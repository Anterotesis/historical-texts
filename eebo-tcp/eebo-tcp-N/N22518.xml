            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
                  <p>RESPECTING the ſource from which the following Letters have been drawn, and the grounds on which the reader is expected to reſt his belief of their authenticity, it may be ſufficient to inform him, that permiſſion was obtained from the proper authority, to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, from the original papers preſerved in the Secretary of State's office in Philadelphia, theſe and ſundry other authentic documents relating to the conteſt between the colonies and the mother country, viz. Letters from the Commanders of the continental forces, and other perſons employed in the public ſervice,—intercepted Letters from Britiſh Officers and other adherents to the royal cauſe,—Communications from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, Conventions, and Committees, of the ſeveral American States,—Diſpatches from Agents and Commiſſioners,—Inſtructions,—Reports of Committees of Congreſs,—parts of the ſecret Journals hitherto unpubliſhed,—and various other pieces elucidative of the events which led to and finally eſtabliſhed American Independence.</p>
                  <p>That permiſſion was granted early in the year 1792, and immediate advantage was
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:029737_0003_0FE2463D94F232A8"/>
taken of the indulgence; though, from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious circumſtances, of little conſequence to the reader to know, the publication has been ſo long delayed. Even at this late period, the editor contents himſelf with laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the public but a part of the collection,—intending, if theſe volumes meet with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable reception, to continue the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and preſent his readers with a variety of intereſting pieces penned by the leaders and principal agents in the American Revolution, and tending to throw light on many import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant tranſactions that have hitherto been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enveloped in total darkneſs, or, at beſt, but obſcurely perceived, and imperfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
                  <p>Some parts of theſe letters may perhaps appear too full of minutiae to intereſt that claſs of readers, who, unaccuſtomed to enter into the inveſtigation of cauſes or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, delight only in recitals of battles, ſieges, and other ſtriking occurrences which conſtitute the more prominent features of hiſtory. But, to the reaſoning philoſophic reader, who wiſhes to explore the ſecret ſprings of action,—to trace events to their remote and latent cauſes,—to diſcover and examine the ſubordinate and collateral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances (oft trifling in appearance, and generally overlooked by the vulgar eye) which, in the ſtruggles of contending na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions give a preponderancy to the one or the other ſcale,—thoſe minute details will, it
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:029737_0004_0FE2463F179F16B0"/>
is preſumed, be far from unacceptable, as furniſhing him with that ſpecies of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon which alone he can venture to ground a deciſive opinion, and which he might elſewhere ſeek in vain.</p>
                  <p>The incloſures, frequently referred to in theſe volumes, would ſtill further contribute to ſet every circumſtance in a clearer and ſtronger light; and it was the editor's origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intention that they ſhould have accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the letters to which they reſpectively belong. Obſtacles however, <hi>at preſent</hi> inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable, ſtand in the way of their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate publication: but, when theſe are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the papers alluded to ſhall make their appearance in form of an Appendix,—ſuch parts of them at leaſt, as are of a curious and intereſting nature.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile the reader will obſerve, that it was deemed as yet premature to publiſh cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain paſſages of theſe letters: ſome omiſſions have of courſe taken place, which are every where pointed out by aſteriſks, and which will be ſupplied at a proper ſeaſon, probably not far diſtant. On the other hand, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps half a dozen inſtances, a ſingle word has been hazarded on conjecture, to fill up a chaſm, where either the original or the copy happened to be torn or defaced; in which caſes, the ſupplemental words are incloſed within crotchets and printed in Italic. A few entire letters, moreover, as appears by refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence made to them in ſubſequent ones, are
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:029737_0005_0FE24641B1B046A0"/>
here wanted to complete the chain of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence. Theſe the editor can give no account of, as the originals appear to have been loſt from the files of office.</p>
                  <p>About a dozen letters, written by the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral's ſecretary,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. P. H. Harriſon.</note> are here inſerted;—a few from the general himſelf to the board of war, or committee of Congreſs,—one to the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ident of the New-York Convention, and one to R. Morris, Eſquire, in the department of finance. Theſe it was thought improper to omit: nor did it ſeem worth while, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a few exceptions, to make any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the general title of the book.</p>

                     <p>UPON my arrival here this afternoon, I was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that an express's was in town, from the provincial camp in Maſſachuſetts-Bay; and having ſeen, among the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in his poſſeſſion, a letter directed to you as Preſident of the Congreſs, I have taken the liberty to open it. I was induced to take that liberty, by ſeveral gentlemen of New-York who were anxious to know the particulars of the affair of the ſeventeenth inſtant, and agreeable to the orders of many members of the Congreſs, who judged it neceſſary that I ſhould avail myſelf of the beſt information in the courſe of my journey.</p>
                     <p>You will find, Sir, by that letter, a great want of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the provincial army, which I ſincerely hope the Congreſs will ſupply as ſpeedily and as effectually as in their power. One thouſand pounds in weight were ſent to the camp at Cambridge, three days ago, from this city; which has left this place almoſt deſtitute of that neceſſary article; there being at this time, from the beſt informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not more than four barrels of powder in the city of New-York.</p>
                     <p>I propoſe to ſet off for the provincial camp to-morrow, and will uſe all poſſible diſpatch to join the forces there.</p>
                     <p>Pleaſe to make my compliments to the gentlemen of the Congreſs; and believe me to be, Sir, your obliged friend, and humble ſervant,</p>

                        <pb n="9" facs="unknown:029737_0008_0FE2464AEB01BC30"/>
Upon my arrival, I immediately viſited the ſeveral poſts occupied by our troops; and, as ſoon as the weather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, reconnoitred thoſe of the enemy. I found the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtrongly intrenched on Bunker's-hill, about a mile from Charleſtown, and advanced about half a mile from the place of the late action, with their centries extended about one hundred and fifty yards on this ſide of the narroweſt part of the neck leading from this place to Charleſtown. Three floating batteries lie in Myſtick river near their camp, and one twenty-gun ſhip below the ferry place between Boſton and Charleſtown. They have alſo a battery on Copſe-hill, on the Boſton ſide, which much annoyed our troops in the late attack. Upon the neck, they have alſo deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched and fortified. Their advanced guards, till laſt Saturday morning, occupied Brown's houſes, about a mile from Roxbury meeting-houſe, and twenty roods from their lines: but, at that time, a party from general Thomas's camp ſurpriſed the guard, drove them in, and burned the houſes. The bulk of their army, commanded by general Howe, lies on Bunker's-hill, and the remainder on Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury-neck, except the light horſe, and a few men in the town of Boſton.</p>
                     <p>On our ſide, we have thrown up intrenchments on Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Proſpect hills,—the enemy's camp in full view, at the diſtance of little more than a mile. Such intermediate points as would admit a landing, I have ſince my arrival taken care to ſtrengthen, down to Sewal's Farm, where a ſtrong intrenchment has been thrown up. At Roxbury, general Thomas has thrown up a ſtrong work on the hill, about two hundred yards above the meeting-houſe; which, with the brokenneſs of the ground, and a great number of rocks, has made that paſs very ſecure. The troops raiſed in New-Hampſhire, with a regiment from Rhode-Iſland, occupy Winter-hill: a part of thoſe from Connecticut, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der general Putnam, are on Proſpect-hill. The troops in this town are entirely of the Maſſachuſetts: the remainder of the Rhode-Iſland men are at Sewal's Farm. Two reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iments of Connecticut, and nine of the Maſſachuſetts, are at Roxbury. The reſidue of the army, to the number of about ſeven hundred, are poſted in ſeveral ſmall towns along the coaſt, to prevent the depredations of the enemy.</p>

Upon the whole, I think myſelf authoriſed to ſay, that, conſidering the great extent of line and the nature of the ground, we are as well ſecured, as could be expected in ſo ſhort a time, and under the diſadvantages we labour. Theſe conſiſt in a want of engineers to conſtruct proper works and direct the men, a want of tools, and a ſufficient number of men to man the works in caſe of an attack. You will obſerve, by the proceedings of the council of war which I have the honour to incloſe, that it is our unanimous opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, to hold and defend theſe works as long as poſſible. The diſcouragement it would give the men, and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effects on the miniſterial troops, thus to abandon our encampment in their face, formed with ſo much labour,—added to the certain deſtruction of a conſiderable and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able extent of country, and our uncertainty of finding a place in all reſpects ſo capable of making a ſtand,—are leading reaſons for this determination. At the ſame time we are very ſenſible of the difficulties which attend the defence of lines of ſo great extent, and the dangers which may enſue from ſuch a diviſion of the army.</p>
                     <p>My earneſt wiſh to comply with the inſtructions of the Congreſs, in making an early and complete return of the ſtate of the army, has led into an involuntary delay of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing you; which has given me much concern. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given orders for this purpoſe immediately on my arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,—and unappriſed of the imperfect obedience which had been paid to thoſe of the like nature from general Ward, I was led from day to day to expect they would come in, and therefore detained the meſſenger. They are not now ſo complete as I could wiſh: but much allowance is to be made for inexperience in forms, and a liberty which had been taken (not given) on this ſubject. Theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I flatter myſelf, will no longer exiſt; and, of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, more regularity and exactneſs will in future pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. This, with a neceſſary attention to the lines, the movements of the miniſterial troops, and our immediate ſecurity, muſt be my apology, which I beg you to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Congreſs with the utmoſt duty and reſpect.</p>
                     <p>We labour under great diſadvantages for want of tents: for, though they have been helped out by a collection of now uſeleſs ſails from the ſea-port towns, the number is far
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029737_0010_0FE24653E9BB1B00"/>
ſhort of our neceſſities. The colleges and houſes of this town are neceſſarily occupied by the troops; which affords another reaſon for keeping our preſent ſituation. But I moſt ſincerely wiſh the whole army was properly provided to take the field, as I am well aſſured, that (beſides greater expedition and activity in caſe of alarm) it would highly conduce to health and diſcipline. As materials are not to be had here, I would beg leave to recommend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing a farther ſupply from Philadelphia, as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould be extremely deficient in gratitude as well as juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, if I did not take the firſt opportunity to acknowledge the readineſs and attention, which the provincial Congreſs and different committees have ſhewn, to make every thing as convenient and agreeable as poſſible. But there is a vital and inherent principle of delay, incompatible with military ſervice, in tranſacting buſineſs through ſuch numerous and different channels. I eſteem it therefore my duty to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the inconvenience which muſt unavoidably enſue from a dependence on a number of perſons for ſupplies; and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to the conſideration of Congreſs, whether the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſervice will not be beſt promoted by appointing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary-general for theſe purpoſes. We have a ſtriking inſtance of the preference of ſuch a mode, in the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Connecticut, as their troops are extremely well provided under the direction of Mr. Trumbull, and he has at different times aſſiſted others with various articles. Should my ſentiments happily coincide with thoſe of your honours on this ſubject, I beg leave to recommend Mr. Trumbull as a very proper perſon for this department. In the arrangement of troops collected under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and upon the ſpur of immediate neceſſity, ſeveral appointments are omitted, which appear to be indiſpenſably neceſſary for the good government of the army—particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly a quarter-maſter-general, a commiſſary of muſters, and a commiſſary of artillery. Theſe I muſt earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the notice and proviſion of the Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>I find myſelf already much embarraſſed, for want of a military cheſt. Theſe embarraſſments will increaſe every day: I muſt therefore requeſt that money may be forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſoon as poſſible. The want of this moſt neceſſary arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle will (I fear) produce great inconveniences, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029737_0011_0FE24656D3586C50"/>
by an early attention. I find the army in general, and the troops raiſed in Maſſachuſetts in particular, very deficient in neceſſary clothing. Upon inquiry, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears no probability of obtaining any ſupplies in this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and, on the beſt conſideration of this matter I am able to form, I am of opinion that a number of hunting ſhirts (not leſs than ten thouſand) would in a great degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this difficulty, in the cheapeſt and quickeſt manner. I know nothing, in a ſpeculative view, more trivial, yet, if put in practice, would have a happier tendency to unite the men, and aboliſh thoſe provincial diſtinctions which lead to jealouſy and diſſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>In a former part of this letter, I mentioned the want of engineers. I can hardly expreſs the diſappointment I have experienced on this ſubject,—the ſkill of thoſe we have being very imperfect, and confined to the mere man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual exerciſe of cannon; whereas the war in which we are engaged requires a knowledge, comprehending the duties of the field, and fortification. If any perſons thus qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified are to be found in the ſouthern colonies, it would be of great public ſervice to forward them with all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                     <p>Upon the article of ammunition, I muſt re-echo the former complaints on this ſubject. We are ſo exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtitute, that our artillery will be of little uſe, without a ſupply both large and ſeaſonable. What we have muſt be reſerved for the ſmall arms, and that managed with the utmoſt frugality.* * *</p>
                     <p>The ſtate of the army you will find aſcertained with tolerable preciſion in the returns which accompany this letter. Upon finding the number of men to fall ſo far ſhort of the eſtabliſhment, and below all expectation, I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately called a council of the general officers, whoſe opinion (as to the mode of filling up the regiments, and providing for the preſent exigency) I have the honour of incloſing, together with the beſt judgment we are able to form of the miniſterial troops. From the number of boys, deſerters, and negroes, that have been enliſted in the troops of this province, I entertain ſome doubts wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the number required can be raiſed here: and all the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral officers agree that no dependence can be put on the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029737_0012_0FE246585766DC28"/>
militia, for a continuance in camp, or regularity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline during the ſhort time they may ſtay. This unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and devoted province has been ſo long in a ſtate of anarchy, and the yoke * * * * * been laid ſo heavily on it, that great allowances are to be made for troops raiſed under ſuch circumſtances. The deficiency of numbers, diſcipline, and ſtores, can only lead to this concluſion, that their ſpirit has exceeded their ſtrength. But at the ſame time I would humbly ſubmit to the conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration of Congreſs the propriety of making ſome further proviſion of men from the other colonies. If theſe regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould be completed to their eſtabliſhment, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of thoſe unfit for duty on account of their age and character would occaſion a conſiderable reduction; and, at all events, they have been enliſted upon ſuch terms, that they may be diſbanded when other troops arrive. But ſhould my apprehenſions be realized, and the regiments here be not filled up, the public cauſe would ſuffer by an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute dependence upon ſo doubtful an event, unleſs ſome proviſion is made againſt ſuch a diſappointment.</p>
                     <p>It requires no military ſkill, to judge of the difficulty of introducing proper diſcipline and ſubordination into an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my while we have the enemy in view, and are in daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of an attack: but it is of ſo much importance, that every effort will be made, which time and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will admit. In the mean time I have a ſincere pleaſure in obſerving that there are materials for a good army—a great number of able-bodied men, active, zealous in the cauſe, and of unqueſtionable courage.</p>
                     <p>I am now, Sir, to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the twenty-eighth, incloſing the reſolutions of Congreſs, of the twenty-ſeventh ultimo, and a copy of a letter from the committee of Albany; to all which I ſhall pay due attention.</p>
                     <p>Generals Gates and Sullivan have both arrived in good health.</p>
                     <p>My beſt abilities are at all times devoted to the ſervice of my country: but I feel the weight, importance, and variety of my preſent duties too ſenſibly, not to wiſh a more immediate and frequent communication with the Congreſs. I fear it may often happen in the courſe of our
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029737_0013_0FE24659DB70C7C0"/>
preſent operations, that I ſhall need that aſſiſtance and direction from them, which time and diſtance will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to receive.</p>
                     <p>Since writing the above, I have alſo to acknowledge your favour of the fourth inſtant by Feſſenden, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the commiſſions, and articles of war. The form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are yet eight hundred ſhort of the number required. This deficiency you will pleaſe to ſupply as ſoon as you conveniently can. Among the other returns, I have alſo ſent one of our killed, wounded, and miſſing, in the late action; but have been able to procure no certain account of the loſs of the miniſterial troops. My beſt intelligence fixes it at above five hundred killed, and ſix or ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred wounded: but it is no more than conjecture,—the utmoſt pains being taken on their ſide to conceal it. I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

                        </gap> the tenth inſtant, nothing material has happened in the camp. From ſome authentic and late advices of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of the miniſterial troops, and the great inconvenience of calling in the militia in the midſt of harveſt, I have been induced for the preſent to wave it:—but in the mean time recruiting parties have been ſent throughout this province,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029737_0014_0FE24664CE3901A8"/>
to fill up the regiments to the eſtabliſhment of the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Congreſs. At the ſame time that I received theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, I alſo obtained a liſt of the officers of the enemy killed and wounded in the late battle at Charleſtown, which I take this opportunity to incloſe.</p>
                     <p>The great ſcarcity of freſh proviſions in their army has led me to take every precaution to prevent a ſupply: for this purpoſe, I have ordered all the cattle and ſheep to be drawn from the low grounds and farms within their reach. A detachment from general Thomas's camp, on Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night, went over to Long-Iſland, and brought from thence twenty cattle and a number of ſheep, with about fifteen labourers who had been put on by a Mr. Ray Thomas, to cut the hay, &amp;c. By ſome accident, they omitted burning the hay, and returned the next day at noon to complete it; which they effected, amidſt the firing of the ſhipping, with the loſs of one man killed and anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er wounded.</p>
                     <p>Laſt evening alſo a party of the Connecticut-men ſtroll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down on the marſh at Roxbury, and fired upon a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; which drew on a heavy fire from the enemy's lines and floating batteries, but attended with no other effect than the loſs of one killed by a ſhot from the enemy's lines. In the mean time, we are, on both ſides, contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our works: but there has been no other movement than what I have noticed above. I ſhall endeavour to give a regular and particular account of all tranſactions as they occur, which you will pleaſe to lay before the honourable Congreſs. I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>SINCE I did myſelf the honour of addreſſing you the fourteenth inſtant, I have received advice from gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor Trumbull, that the aſſembly of Connecticut had vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that they are now raiſing, two regiments of ſeven hundred men each, in conſequence of an application from the provincial Congreſs of Maſſachuſetts-Bay. The Rhode-Iſland aſſembly has alſo made an augmentation for
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029737_0015_0FE24666A5B06C18"/>
this purpoſe. Theſe reinforcements, with the riflemen who are daily expected, and ſuch recruits as may come in to fill up the regiments here, will, I apprehend, compoſe an army ſufficiently ſtrong to oppoſe any force which may be brought againſt us at preſent. I am very ſenſible that the heavy expenſe, neceſſarily attendant upon this cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, will call for the utmoſt frugality and care, and would therefore, if poſſible, avoid enliſting one unneceſſary man. As this is the firſt certain account of the deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe new-raiſed troops, I thought proper to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate my ſentiments as early as poſſible, leſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſhould act upon my letter of the tenth, and raiſe troops in the ſouthern colonies, which, in my preſent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be diſpenſed with.</p>
                     <p>For theſe eight days paſt, there have been no move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in either camp, of any conſequence. On our ſide, we have continued the works without any intermiſſion; and they are now ſo far advanced as to leave us little to apprehend on that ſcore. On the ſide of the enemy, they have alſo been very induſtrious in finiſhing their lines, both on Bunker's-hill and Roxbury-neck. In this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val alſo, their tranſports have arrived from New-York; and they have been employed in landing and ſtationing their men. I have been able to collect no certain account of the numbers arrived: but the incloſed letter, wrote (though not ſigned) by Mr. Sheriff Lee, and delivered me by captain Darby, (who went expreſs with an account of the Lexington battle) will enable us to form a pretty accurate judgment. The increaſe of tents and men in the town of Boſton is very obvious; but all my accounts from thence agree that there is a great mortality, occaſioned by the want of vegetables and freſh meat; and that their loſs in the late battle at Charleſtown (from the few recoveries of their wounded) is greater than at firſt ſuppoſed. The condition of the inhabitants detained in Boſton is very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing: they are equally deſtitute of the comfort of freſh proviſions; and many of them are ſo reduced in their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as to be unable to ſupply themſelves with ſalt. Such fiſh as the ſoldiery leave is their principal ſupport. Added to all this, ſuch ſuſpicion and jealouſy prevails, that
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029737_0016_0FE2466829A8F290"/>
they can ſcarcely ſpeak, or even look, without expoſing themſelves to ſome ſpecies of military execution.</p>
                     <p>I have not been able, from any intelligence I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to form any certain judgment of the future opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the enemy. Sometimes I have ſuſpected an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of detaching a part of their army to ſome part of the coaſt, as they have been building a number of flat-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed boats, capable of holding two hundred men each. But, from their works, and the language held at Boſton, there is reaſon to think they expect the attack from us, and are principally engaged in preparing themſelves againſt it. I have ordered all the whale-boats along the coaſt to be collected: and ſome of them are employed every night to watch the motions of the enemy by water, ſo as to guard as much as poſſible againſt any ſurpriſe. * * *</p>
                     <p>Next to the more immediate and preſſing duties of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our lines in as ſecure a ſtate as poſſible, attending to the movements of the enemy, and gaining intelligence,—my great concern is to eſtabliſh order, regularity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, without which our numbers would embarraſs us, and, in caſe of action, general confuſion muſt infallibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. In order to this, I propoſe to divide the army into three diviſions:—at the head of each will be a general officer:—theſe diviſions to be again ſubdivided into brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades, under their reſpective brigadiers. But the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ariſing from the arrangement of the general officers, and waiting the farther proceedings of the Congreſs on this ſubject, has much retarded my progreſs in this moſt neceſſary work. I ſhould be very happy to receive their final commands, as any determination would enable me to proceed in my plan. * * *</p>
                     <p>In addition to the officers mentioned in mine of the tenth inſtant, I would humbly propoſe that ſome proviſion ſhould be made for a judge-advocate, and provoſt-marſhal. The neceſſity of the firſt appointment was ſo great, that I was obliged to nominate a Mr. Tudor, who was well recommended to me, and now executes the office under an expectation of receiving captain's pay—an allowance (in my opinion) ſcarcely adequate to the ſervice, in new-raiſed troops, where there are court-martials every day. However, as that is the proportion in the regular army,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029737_0017_0FE24669AC62BB60"/>
and he is contented, there will be no neceſſity of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                     <p>I muſt alſo renew my requeſt as to money, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of a pay-maſter. I have forbore urging mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this nature, from my knowledge of the many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant concerns which engage the attention of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs: but as I find my difficulties thicken every day, I make no doubt, ſuitable regard will be paid to a neceſſity of this kind. The inconvenience of borrowing ſuch ſums as are conſtantly requiſite muſt be too plain for me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon, and is a ſituation from which I ſhould be very happy to be relieved.</p>
                     <p>Upon the experience I have had, and the beſt conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration of the appointment of the ſeveral offices of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary-general, muſter-maſter-general, quarter-maſter-gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, pay-maſter-general, and commiſſary of artillery, I am clearly of opinion that they not only conduce to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, diſpatch and diſcipline, but that it is a meaſure of economy. The delay, the waſte, and unpuniſhable neglect of duty, ariſing from theſe offices being in commiſſion in ſeveral hands, evidently ſhew that the public expenſe muſt be finally enhanced. I have experienced the want of theſe officers, in completing the returns of men, ammunition, and ſtores. The latter are yet imperfect, from the number of hands in which they are diſperſed. I have incloſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> laſt weekly return, which is more accurate than the former; and hope in a little time we ſhall be perfectly regular in this as well as ſeveral other neceſſary branches of duty.</p>
                     <p>I have made inquiry into the eſtabliſhment of the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, and find it in a very unſettled condition. There is no principal director, nor any ſubordination among the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons: of conſequence, diſputes and contention have ariſen, and muſt continue until it is reduced to ſome ſyſtem. I could wiſh it was immediately taken into conſideration, as the lives and health of both officers and men ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon a due regulation of this department. I have been particularly attentive to the leaſt ſymptoms of the ſmall pox; and hitherto we have been ſo fortunate as to have every perſon removed ſo ſoon, as not only to prevent any communication, but any alarm or apprehenſion it might
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029737_0018_0FE24672A1AE6020"/>
give in the camp. We ſhall continue the utmoſt vigilance againſt this moſt dangerous enemy.</p>
                     <p>In an army properly organized, there are ſundry offices of an inferior kind, ſuch as waggon-maſter, maſter-carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c. but I doubt whether my powers are ſufficiently extenſive for ſuch appointments. If it is thought prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to repoſe ſuch a truſt in me, I ſhall be governed, in the diſcharge of it, by a ſtrict regard to economy and the public intereſt.</p>
                     <p>My inſtructions from the honourable Congreſs direct that no troops are to be diſbanded without their expreſs direction, nor to be recruited to more than double the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the enemy. Upon this ſubject I beg leave to rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſent, that, unleſs the regiments in this province are more ſucceſsful in recruiting than I have reaſon to expect, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ſome of them will be highly neceſſary, as the public is put to the whole expenſe of an eſtabliſhment of officers, while the real ſtrength of the regiment (which conſiſts in the rank and file) is defective. In caſe of ſuch a reduction, doubtleſs ſome of the privates and all the officers would return home: but many of the former would go into the remaining regiments; and having had ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, would fill them up with uſeful men. I ſo plainly perceive the expenſe of this campaign will exceed any cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation hitherto made, that I am particularly anxious to ſtrike off every unneceſſary charge. You will therefore, Sir, be pleaſed to favour me with explicit directions from the Congreſs, on the mode of this reduction (if it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear neceſſary) that no time may be loſt when ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity appears.</p>
                     <p>Yeſterday we had an account that the light-houſe was on fire:—by whom, and under what orders, I have not yet learned: but we have reaſon to believe it has been done by our irregulars.</p>
                     <p>You will pleaſe to preſent me to the Congreſs, with the utmoſt duty and reſpect; and believe me to be, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>NOTHING material has occurred in either camp, ſince I had the honour of addreſſing you on the twenty-firſt inſtant by expreſs: but on Tueſday, three men-of-war and nine tranſports ſailed out of Boſton harbour, and ſtood a courſe about E. S. E.</p>
                     <p>One Groves, who came out of Boſton the ſame evening, informed the officer at one of the out-poſts, that the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports had on board ſix hundred men, and were bound to Block-Iſland, Fiſher's-Iſland, and Long-Iſland, to plunder them, and bring off what cattle they may find. The fellow returned again into Boſton under ſuch ſuſpicious circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that it has led me to doubt the truth of his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
                     <p>A deſerter, who came in afterwards, informs me that it was given out in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>amp, that they were either gone for Indians or freſh proviſions; and that each tranſport had but twenty men on board. Upon this intelligence, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately wrote to governor Cooke of Rhode-Iſland, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:029737_0020_0FE24675AE57C500"/>
to general Wooſter, that they might take proper precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for removing the cattle off thoſe iſlands and the coaſts, and to prevent any ſurpriſe. As we are confirmed, by every account, in the ſcarcity of freſh proviſions in the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's camp, and particularly by this deſerter, it is very prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able this voyage may be only intended for a ſupply: but as it may poſſibly be otherwiſe, I thought it beſt to tranſmit the intelligence to the honourable Congreſs, that they may forward it to the ſouthward, or take ſuch other ſteps as they may judge proper.</p>
                     <p>Since writing the above, three more deſerters have come out,—which makes four in twenty-four hours. Their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts correſpond with thoſe of the firſt who came out, and which I have related above. I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>I AM to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the twenty-fourth July, accompanied by two hundred and eighty-four commiſſions, which are yet much ſhort of the neceſſary number. I am much honoured by the confidence repoſed in me, of appointing the ſeveral officers recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in mine of the tenth ultimo; and ſhall endeavour to ſelect ſuch perſons as are beſt qualified to fill theſe import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant poſts. * * * *</p>
                     <p>In the renewal of theſe commiſſions, ſome difficulties occur, in which I ſhould be glad to know the pleaſure of the honourable Congreſs. The general officers of the Maſſachuſetts have regiments; thoſe of Connecticut have both regiments and companies; and the other field officers have companies each. From Rhode-Iſland, the general officer has no regiment, but the field officers have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies: but I do not find that they have or expect pay under more than one commiſſion. Should the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, now to be delivered, purſue theſe different eſtabliſhments, there will be a diſtinction between general and field officers of the ſame rank. In order to put New-Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts, and Rhode-Iſland, upon a line with Connecticut, it would be neceſſary to diſmiſs a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029737_0021_0FE2467733837448"/>
of officers, in poſſeſſion of commiſſions, without any fault of theirs. On the other hand, to bring the Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut generals and field officers to the ſame ſcale with the others, will add to the number of officers, and may be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inconſiſtent with the terms on which they entered into the ſervice, although you add nothing to the expenſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the article of proviſions. Upon the whole, it is a caſe which I would wiſh the honourable Congreſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and determine.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Gridley of this province, who is at the head of the artillery, has the rank of major-general from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Congreſs. Will it be proper to renew his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion here in the ſame manner?—It is proper here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that, in this caſe, he will take rank of all the briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers-general, and even the majors-general, whoſe commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are ſubſequent in date: and this can anſwer no good purpoſe, but may be productive of many bad conſequences.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are matters of ſome importance: but I am em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed with a difficulty of a ſuperior kind. The eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, made in Congreſs, ſuppoſed all the regiments to be formed upon one eſtabliſhment: but they are different in different provinces, and even vary in the ſame province, in ſome particulars. In Maſſachuſetts, ſome regiments have ten companies, others eleven: the eſtabliſhment of the former is five hundred and ninety men, officers included; of the latter, ſix hundred and forty-nine. The eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Rhode-Iſland and New-Hampſhire is five hundred and ninety to a regiment, officers included:—Connecticut has a thouſand men to a regiment. Should the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts regiments be completed, with the new levies from Rhode-Iſland and Connecticut, and the riflemen, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber will exceed twenty-two thouſand. If they ſhould not be completed,—as each regiment is fully officered, there will be a heavy expenſe to the public, without an adequate ſervice. The reduction of ſome of them ſeems to be nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary, and yet is a matter of much delicacy, as we are ſituated. I moſt earneſtly requeſt it may be taken into immediate conſideration, and the time and mode of doing it pointed out by the honourable Congreſs. By an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate I have made from the general return,—when the new levies arrive, and the regiments are completed, there will
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029737_0022_0FE246806AD600E0"/>
be twenty-four thouſand four hundred and fifty men on the pay and proviſion of the United Colonies. Some of the recruiting officers, who have been out on that ſervice, have returned with very little ſucceſs; ſo that we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the number of two thouſand and ſixty-four, now wanting to complete, will rather increaſe than diminiſh. There are the regiment of artillery, conſiſting of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninety-three men, and one under colonel Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant (who has not received any commiſſion, although he had orders to raiſe a regiment, from the provincial Congreſs here) which are not included in the above eſtimate. This laſt regiment conſiſts of two hundred and thirty-four men by the laſt return; but a company has ſince joined.</p>
                     <p>By adverting to the general return, which I have the honour of incloſing (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1) it will be ſeen what regiments are moſt deficient.</p>
                     <p>If the Congreſs does not chooſe to point out the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar regiments, but the provinces in which the reduction is to be made, the ſeveral Congreſſes and Aſſemblies may be the proper channel to conduct this buſineſs, which I would alſo conceive the moſt adviſable, from their better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the merits, terms, and time of ſervice, of the reſpective officers. Reducing ſome regiments, and, with the privates thereof, filling up others, would certainly be the beſt method of accompliſhing this work if it were prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable: but the experiment is dangerous, as the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts-men, under the privilege of chooſing their own offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, do not conceive themſelves bound, if thoſe officers are diſbanded.</p>
                     <p>As general Gage is making preparations for winter by contracting for quantities of coal, it will ſuggeſt to us the propriety of extending our views to that ſeaſon. I have directed that ſuch huts as have been lately made of boards ſhould be done in ſuch a manner, that, if neceſſary, they may ſerve for covering during the winter. But I need not enlarge upon the variety of neceſſities, ſuch as cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fuel, &amp;c. (both exceedingly ſcarce, and difficult to be procured) which that ſeaſon muſt bring with it, if the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or any conſiderable part of it is to remain embodied.</p>
                     <p>From the inactivity of the enemy ſince the arrival of their whole reinforcement, their continual addition to their
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029737_0023_0FE24682295AAB80"/>
lines,—and many other circumſtances,—I am inclined to think, that, finding us ſo well prepared to receive them, the plan of operations is varied, and they mean, by regular approaches, to bombard us out of our preſent line of defence, or are waiting in expectation that the colonies muſt ſink under the weight of the expenſe, or the proſpect of a winter campaign ſo diſcourage our troops, as to break up our army. If they have not ſome ſuch expectations, the iſſue of which they are determined to wait, I cannot account for the delay, when their ſtrength is leſſened every day by ſickneſs, deſertions, and little ſkirmiſhes.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe laſt we have had only two worthy of notice. Having ſome reaſon to ſuſpect they were extending their lines at Charleſtown, I, laſt Saturday evening, ordered ſome of the riflemen down, to make a diſcovery, or bring off a priſoner. They were accidentally diſcovered ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than they expected, by the guard coming to relieve, and obliged to fire upon them. We have reaſon to believe they killed ſeveral. They brought in two priſoners, whoſe account (confirmed by ſome other circumſtances) removed my ſuſpicions in part. Since that time, we have, on each ſide, drawn in our c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ntries, and there have been ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fires along the line. This evening we have heard of three captains who have been taken off by the riflemen, and one killed by a cannon-ſhot from Roxbury, beſides ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral privates: but as the intelligence is not direct, I only mention it as a report which deſerves credit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The other happened at the light-houſe. A number of workmen hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ſent down to repair it, with a guard of twenty-two marines and a ſubaltern,—major Tupper, laſt Monday morning about two o'clock, landed there with about three hundred men, attacked them, killed the officer and four privates; but being detained by the tide, in his return he was attacked by ſeveral boats; but he happily got through with the loſs of one man killed, and another wounded. The remainder of the miniſterial troops (three of whom are badly wounded) he brought off priſoners, with ten to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, all of whom are on their way to Springfield jail. The riflemen, in theſe ſkirmiſhes, loſt one man, who (we hear) is a priſoner in Boſton jail. The enemy, in return, endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to ſurpriſe our guard at Roxbury: but they, being
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:029737_0024_0FE24683AE7474C0"/>
appriſed of it by a deſerter, had time to prepare for it: but by ſome negligence or miſconduct in the officer of the guard, they burned the George tavern on the neck; and have every day ſince been cannonading us from their lines, both at Roxbury and Charleſtown, but with no other effect than the loſs of two men. On our part, except ſtraggling fires from the ſmall arms about the lines, which we endeavour to reſtrain, we have made little or no return.</p>
                     <p>Our ſituation in the article of powder, is much more alarming than I had the moſt diſtant idea of. Having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a return to be made out (on my arrival) of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, I found three hundred and three barrels and a half of powder mentioned as in the ſtore: but on ordering a new ſupply of cartridges yeſterday, I was informed, to my very great aſtoniſhment, that there was no more than thirty-ſix barrels of the Maſſachuſetts ſtore, which, with the ſtock of Rhode-Iſland, New-Hampſhire, and Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut, makes nine thouſand nine hundred and thirty-ſeven pounds,—not more than nine rounds a man. As there had been no conſumption of powder ſince, that could in any degree account for ſuch a deficiency, I was very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in my inquiries, and found that the committee of ſupplies, not being ſufficiently acquainted with the nature of a return, or miſapprehending my requeſt, ſent in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all the ammunition which had been collected by the province; ſo that the report included not only what was in hand, but what had been ſpent.</p>
                     <p>Upon diſcovering this miſtake, I immediately went up to confer with the ſpeaker of the houſe of repreſentatives, upon ſome meaſures to obtain a ſupply from the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing townſhips, in ſuch a manner as might prevent our pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty being known; as it is a ſecret of too great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to be divulged in the general court, ſome individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of which might perhaps indiſcreetly ſuffer it to eſcape him, ſo as to find its way to the enemy,—the conſequences of which are terrible even in idea. I ſhall alſo write to the governors of Rhode-Iſland and Connecticut, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of ſafety in New-Hampſhire, on this ſubject, urging, in the moſt forcible terms, the neceſſity of an immediate ſupply, if in their power. I need not enlarge on our mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy ſituation: it is ſufficient that the exiſtence of the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:029737_0025_0FE2468533AA1300"/>
army and the ſalvation of the country depends upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being done for our relief, both ſpeedy and effectual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that our ſituation be kept a profound ſecret.</p>
                     <p>In the incloſures, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2 and 3, I ſend the allowance of proviſions, &amp;c. made by the provinces of Connecticut and Maſſachuſetts. The mode and quantity are different from what has fallen within my experience, and, I am confident, muſt prove very waſteful and expenſive. If any alteration can be ſafety made (which I much doubt) there might be a great ſaving to the public.</p>
                     <p>A gentleman of my family, aſſiſted by a deſerter who has ſome ſkill in fortification, has, by my direction, ſketched out two draughts of our reſpective lines at Charleſtown and Roxbury, which, with the explanations, will convey ſome idea of our ſituation, and, I hope, prove acceptable to the members of the honourable Congreſs. They are the in-cloſures, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 4 and 5.</p>
                     <p>Since I had the honour of addreſſing you laſt, I have been applied to, by a committee of the general court, for a detachment of the army, to protect the inhabitants of the eaſtern parts of this province from ſome apprehended dep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redations on their coaſts. I could have wiſhed to have complied with their requeſt: but, after due conſideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſulting the general officers, together with thoſe members of Congreſs who are here, I thought it my duty to excuſe myſelf. The application and my anſwer are the incloſures, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 6 and 7, which I hope will be approved by the honourable Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>Since I began this letter, the original (of which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 8 is a copy) fell into my hands. As the writer is a perſon of ſome note in Boſton, and it contains ſome advices of importance not mentioned by others, I thought proper to forward it as I received it. By comparing the hand-writing with another letter, it appears the writer is one Belcher Noyes, a perſon probably known to ſome of the gentlemen, delegates from this province, who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, from his principles and character, what credit is due to him.</p>
                     <p>The army is now formed into three grand diviſions, under the command of the generals Ward, Lee, and Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam; each diviſion into two brigades, conſiſting of about
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:029737_0026_0FE2468EA32544C8"/>
ſix regiments each, commanded by generals Thomas and Spencer at Roxbury,—Heath at Cambridge,—Sullivan and Greene at Winter-hill. By this, you will pleaſe to obſerve, there is a deficiency of one brigadier-general (oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by Mr. Pomroy's not acting under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion) which I beg may be filled up as ſoon as poſſible. I obſerve the honourable Congreſs have alſo favoured me with the appointment of three brigade-majors. I preſume they have or intend to appoint the reſt ſoon, as they cannot be unacquainted that one is neceſſary to each brigade; and in a new raiſed army, it will be an office of great duty and ſervice.</p>
                     <p>General Gage has at length liberated the people of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>We have ſeveral reports that general Gage is diſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling Caſtle-William, and bringing all the cannon up to town: but, upon a very particular inquiry, accounts are ſo various, that I cannot aſcertain the truth of it.* * *</p>
                     <p>On the firſt inſtant, a chief of the Caghnewaga tribe, who live about ſix miles from Montreal, came in here, accompained by a colonel Bayley of Cohoſs. His accounts of the temper and diſpoſition of the Indians are very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable. He ſays they have been ſtrongly ſolicited by governor Carleton to engage againſt us; but his nation is totally averſe;—that threats, as well as entreaties, have been uſed without effect;—that the Canadians are well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Engliſh colonies; and, if any expedition is meditated againſt Canada, the Indians in that quarter will give all their aſſiſtance. I have endeavoured to cheriſh theſe favourable diſpoſitions, and have recommended to him to cultivate them on his return. What I have ſaid, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with a preſent, which I underſtood would be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him: and as he is repreſented to be a man of weight and conſequence in his own tribe, I flatter myſelf his viſit will have a good effect. His accounts of general Carle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's force and ſituation at St. John's correſpond with what we have already had from that quarter.</p>
                     <p>The acceſſion of Georgia to the meaſures of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs is a happy event, and muſt give a ſincere pleaſure to every friend of America.</p>

                        <hi>Auguſt</hi> 5.—We have accounts this morning of two exploſions at the Caſtle; ſo that its deſtruction may now be ſuppoſed certain.</p>
                     <p>I have this morning been alarmed with an information that two gentlemen from Philadelphia, (Mr. Hitchbourn and captain White) with letters for general Lee and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, have been taken by captain Ayſcough at Rhode-Iſland, the letters intercepted and ſent forward to Boſton,—with the bearers as priſoners; that the captain exulted much in the diſcoveries he had made: and my informer (who was alſo in the boat, but releaſed) underſtood them to be letters of conſequence. I have therefore diſpatched the expreſs immediately back, though I had before reſolved to detain him till Feſſenden's return. I ſhall be anxious till I am relieved from the ſuſpenſe I am in, as to the contents of thoſe letters.</p>
                     <p>It is exceedingly unfortunate that gentlemen ſhould chooſe to travel the only road on which there is danger. Let the event of this be what it will, I hope it will ſerve as a general caution againſt truſting any letters that way in future.</p>
                     <p>Nothing of conſequence has occurred in camp theſe two days.

The former is colonel John Armſtrong, of Pennſylvania: he ſerved during the laſt war, in moſt of the campaigns to the ſouthward; was honoured with the command of the Pennſylvania forces, and his general military conduct and ſpirit much approved by all who ſerved with him: beſides which, his character was diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by an enterpriſe againſt the Indians, which he planned with great judgment, and executed with equal courage and ſucceſs. It was not till lately that I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe he would enter again on public ſervice; and it is now wholly unſolicited and unknown on his part. The other gentleman is colonel Fry, of Maſſachuſetts-Bay. He entered into the ſervice as early as 1745, and roſe through the different military ranks, in the ſucceeding wars, to that of colonel, until laſt June, when he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a major-general by the Congreſs of this province. From theſe circumſtances, together with the favourable report made to me of him, I preſume he ſuſtained the character of a good officer, though I do not find it diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by any peculiar ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Either of theſe gentlemen, or any other whom the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable Congreſs ſhall pleaſe to favour with this appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will be received by me with the utmoſt deference and reſpect.</p>
                     <p>The late adjournment having made it impracticable to know the pleaſure of the Congreſs as to the appointment of brigade-majors, beyond the number of three which they were pleaſed to leave to me,—and the ſervice not admitting of farther delay,—I have continued the other three: which I hope their honours will not diſapprove. Theſe latter were recommended by the reſpective corps to which they belong, as the propereſt perſons for theſe offices until farther direction, and have diſcharged the duty ever ſince. They are the majors Box, Scammel, and Samuel Brewer.</p>

Laſt Saturday night we took poſſeſſion of a hill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably advanced beyond our former lines; which brought on a very heavy cannonade from Bunker's-hill, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a bombardment, which has been ſince kept up with little ſpirit on their part, or damage on ours. The work having been continued ever ſince, is now ſo advanced, and the men ſo well covered, as to leave us under no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of much farther loſs. In this affair, we had kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—one adjutant, one volunteer, and two privates. The ſcarcity of ammunition does not admit of our availing our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the ſituation, as we otherwiſe might do; but this evil, I hope, will ſoon be remedied, as I have been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the arrival of a large quantity at New-York, ſome at New-London, and more hourly expected at different places. I need not add to what I have already ſaid on this ſubject. Our late ſupply was very ſeaſonable, but far ſhort of our neceſſities.</p>
                     <p>The late adjournment of the honourable Congreſs hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been made before my letter of the fourth inſtant was received, I muſt now beg leave to recall their attention to thoſe parts of it which reſpect the proviſion for the winter, the reduction of the troops, the double commiſſions under different eſtabliſhments, and colonel Gridley's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of major-general; in all which, I hope to be hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured with their commands as ſoon as poſſible.</p>

                     <p>The treatment of our officers, priſoners at Boſton, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to write to general Gage on that ſubject.

                     <p>* * * Mr. Livingſton and ſome other gentlemen from your city brought us the acceptable news of the ſafe arrival of a large quantity of powder, and five hundred ſtand of arms.

I deſired him to commit to writing ſuch propoſals as his experience and knowledge of the country might entitle him to make; which he has done in the paper which I have the honour to incloſe. The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of procuring a ſufficient quantity of ſalt, which I objected to him, he has fully obviated, by aſſuring me that there is ſo much now actually in ſtore, in this and the neighbouring towns, as will remove all poſſibility of a diſappointment.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE been in daily expectation of being favoured with the commands of the honourable Congreſs, on the ſubject of my two laſt letters. The ſeaſon now advances ſo faſt that I cannot any longer defer laying before them ſuch farther meaſures as require their immediate attention, and in which I wait their direction.</p>
                     <p>The mode in which the preſent army has been collected has occaſioned ſome difficulty in procuring the ſubſcription of both officers and ſoldiers to the continental articles of war. Their principal objection has been, that it might ſubject them to a longer ſervice than that for which they engaged under their ſeveral provincial eſtabliſhments. It is in vain to attempt to reaſon away the prejudices of a whole army: * * * I have therefore forbore preſſing them, as I did not experience any ſuch inconvenience from their adherence to their former rules, as would warrant the riſk of entering into a conteſt upon it: more eſpecially as the reſtraints, neceſſary for the eſtabliſhment of eſſential diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and ſubordination, indiſpoſed their minds to every change, and made it both duty and policy to introduce as little novelty as poſſible. With the preſent army, I fear ſuch a ſubſcription is impracticable: but the difficulty will ceaſe with this army.</p>
                     <p>The Connecticut and Rhode-Iſland troops ſtand engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the firſt of December only; and none longer than the firſt of January. A diſſolution of the preſent army
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:029737_0032_0FE2469F602AD148"/>
therefore will take place, unleſs ſome early proviſion is made againſt ſuch an event. Moſt of the general officers are of opinion the greater part of them may be re-enliſted for the winter, or another campaign, with the indulgence of a furlough to viſit their friends, which may be regulated ſo as not to endanger the ſervice. How far it may be proper to form the new army entirely out of the old, for another campaign, rather than from the contingents of the ſeveral provinces, is a queſtion which involves in it too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſiderations of policy and prudence, for me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to decide. It appears to be impoſſible to draw it from any other ſource than the old army, for this winter; and, as the pay is ample, I hope a ſufficient number will engage in the ſervice for that time at leaſt. But there are various opinions of the temper of the men on the ſubject; and there may be great hazard in deferring the trial ſo long.</p>
                     <p>In the continental eſtabliſhment, no proviſion has been made for the pay of artificers, diſtinct from that of the common ſoldiers; whereas, under the provincial, ſuch as found their own tools were allowed one ſhilling per diem advance, and particular artizans, more. The pay of the artillery alſo now differs from that of the province; the men have leſs, the officers more; and, for ſome ranks, no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is made, as the Congreſs will pleaſe to obſerve by the liſt which I have the honour to incloſe. (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1.) Theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, though ſeemingly inconſiderable, are the ſource of much complaint and diſſatisfaction, which I endeavour to compoſe in the beſt manner I am able.</p>
                     <p>By the returns of the rifle companies, and that battalion, they appear to exceed their eſtabliſhment very conſiderably. I doubt my authority to pay theſe extra men without the direction of the Congreſs: but it would be deemed a great hardſhip wholly to refuſe them, as they have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to come.</p>
                     <p>The neceſſities of the troops having required pay, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected that thoſe of the Maſſachuſetts ſhould receive for one month, upon their being muſtered, and returning a proper roll: but a claim was immediately made for pay by lunar months; and ſeveral regiments have declined taking up their warrants on this account. As this practice was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely new to me, though ſaid to be warranted by former
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:029737_0033_0FE246A0E4383398"/>
uſage, here the matter now waits the determination of the honourable Congreſs. I find, in Connecticut and Rhode-Iſland, this point was ſettled by calendar months: in Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts, though mentioned in the Congreſs, it was left undetermined; which is alſo the caſe of New-Hampſhire.</p>
                     <p>The incloſure, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2, is a petition from the ſubalterns, reſpecting their pay. Where there are only two of theſe in a company, I have conſidered one as an enſign, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him pay as ſuch, as in the Connecticut forces. I muſt beg leave to recommend this petition to the favour of the Congreſs; as I am of opinion the allowance is inadequate to their rank and ſervice, and is one great ſource of that familiarity between the officers and men, which is ſo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with ſubordination and diſcipline. Many valuable officers of thoſe ranks, finding themſelves unable to ſupport the character and appearance of officers, (I am informed) will retire as ſoon as the term of ſervice is expired, if there is no alteration.</p>
                     <p>For the better regulation of duty, I found it neceſſary to ſettle the rank of the officers, and to number the regiments; and, as I had not received the commands of the Congreſs on the ſubject, and the exigence of the ſervice forbade any farther delay, the general officers were conſidered as having no regiments; an alteration, which, I underſtand, is not pleaſing to ſome of them, but appeared to me and others to be proper, when it was conſidered, that, by this means, the whole army is put upon one footing, and all particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>Among many other conſiderations which the approach of winter will demand, that of clothing appears to be one of the moſt important. So far as regards the preſervation of the army from cold, they may be deemed in a ſtate of nakedneſs. Many of the men have been without blankets the whole campaign: and thoſe, which have been in uſe during the ſummer, are ſo much worn as to be of little ſervice. In order to make a ſuitable proviſion in theſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and at the ſame to guard the public againſt impoſition and expenſe, it ſeems neceſſary to determine the mode of continuing the army: for, ſhould theſe troops be clothed under their preſent engagement, and, at the expiration of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:029737_0034_0FE246AAE9D91AB0"/>
the term of ſervice, decline renewing it, a ſet of unprovid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men may be ſent to ſupply their places.</p>
                     <p>I cannot ſuppoſe it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be unknown to the honourable Congreſs, that, in all armies, it is an eſtabliſhed practice to make an allowance to officers, of proviſions and forage, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to their rank. As ſuch an allowance formed no part of the continental eſtabliſhment, I have hitherto forbore to iſſue the orders for that purpoſe: but, as it is a received opinion of ſuch members of the Congreſs as I have had an opportunity of conſulting, as well as throughout <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I am now to inform the honourable Congreſs, that, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the repeated declarations of the Canadians and Indians, and u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

By this manoeuvre, I propoſed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to divert Carleton from St. John's, which would leave a free paſſage to general Schuyler;—or, if this did not take effect, Quebec, in its preſent defenceleſs ſtate, muſt fall into his hands an eaſy prey. I made all poſſible inquiry, as to the diſtance, the ſafety of the route, and the danger of the ſeaſon being too far advanced; but found nothing in either, to deter me from proceeding, more eſpecially as it met with very general approbation from all whom I conſulted upon it. But, that nothing might be omitted, to enable me to judge of its propriety and probable conſequences, I communicated it by expreſs to general Schuyler, who approved of it in ſuch terms, that I reſolved to put it in immediate execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They have now left this place ſeven days: and, if favoured with a good wind, I hope ſoon to hear of their being ſafe in Kennebeck river. For the ſatisfaction of the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:029737_0035_0FE246AC6E74F5A8"/>
Congreſs, I here incloſe a copy of the propoſed route. (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 3.) I alſo do myſelf the honour of incloſing a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſto, which I cauſed to be printed here, and of which col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Arnold has taken a ſuitable number with him. This is the incloſure, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 4. I have alſo forwarded a copy of his inſtructions (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 5)—from all which I hope the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will have a clear view of the motives, plan, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended execution of this enterpriſe, and that I ſhall be ſo happy as to meet with their approbation in it.</p>
                     <p>I was the more induced to make this detachment, as it is my clear opinion, from a careful obſervation of the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the enemy, corroborated by all the intelligence we receive by deſerters and others, (of the former of whom we have ſome every day) that the enemy have no intention to come out, until they are reinforced. They have been wholly employed for ſome time paſt in procuring materials for barracks, fuel, and making other preparations for winter. Theſe circumſtances, with the conſtant additions to their works which are apparently defenſive, have led to the above concluſion, and enabled me to ſpare this body of men where I hope they will be uſefully and ſucceſsfully employed.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate of inactivity, in which this army has lain for ſome time, by no means correſponds with my wiſhes, by ſome deciſive ſtroke to relieve my country from the heavy expenſe its ſubſiſtence muſt create. After frequently rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onnoitring the ſituation of the enemy in the town of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, collecting all poſſible intelligence, and digeſting the whole, a ſurpriſe did not appear to me wholly impracticable, though hazardous. I communicated it to the general offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſome days before I called them to a council, that they might be prepared with their opinions. The reſult I have the honour of incloſing. (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 6.) I cannot ſay that I have wholly laid it aſide: but new events may occaſion new meaſures. Of this I hope the honourable Congreſs can need no aſſurance, that there is not a man in America who more earneſtly wiſhes ſuch a termination of the campaign, as to make the army no longer neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>The ſeaſon advances ſo faſt, that I have given orders to prepare barracks and other accommodations for the winter. The great ſcarcity of tow-cloth in this country, I fear, will totally diſappoint as in our expectations of procuring hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſhirts.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:029737_0036_0FE246ADF4A55350"/>
Governor Cooke informs me, few or none are to be had in Rhode-Iſland; and governor Trumbull gives me little encouragement to expect many from Connecticut.</p>
                     <p>I have filled up the office of quarter-maſter-general, which the Congreſs was pleaſed to leave to me, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of major Mifflin, which I hope and believe will be univerſally acceptable.</p>
                     <p>It gives me great pain to be obliged to ſolicit the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the honourable Congreſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But my ſituation is inexpreſſibly diſtreſſing, to ſee the winter faſt approaching upon a naked army; the time of their ſervice within a few weeks of expiring; and no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion yet made for ſuch important events. Added to theſe, the military cheſt is totally exhauſted: the pay-maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has not a ſingle dollar in hand: the commiſſary-general aſſures me he has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>trained his credit, for the ſubſiſtence of the army, to the utmoſt. The quarter-maſter-general is preciſely in the ſame ſituation; and the greater part of the troops are in a ſtate not far from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>utiny, upon the deduction from their ſtated allowance. I know not to whom I am to impute this failure: but I am of opinion, if the evil is not immediately remedied, and more punctuality obſerved in future, the army muſt abſolutely break up. I hoped I had ſo fully expreſſed myſelf on this ſubject, (both by letter, and to thoſe members of the Congreſs who honoured the camp with a viſit) that no diſappointment could poſſibly happen: I therefore hourly expected advice from the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter that he had received a freſh ſupply, in addition to the hundred and ſeventy-two thouſand dollars delivered him in Auguſt: and thought myſelf warranted to aſſure the public creditors that in a few days they ſhould be ſatisfied. But the delay has brought matters to ſuch a criſis, as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no farther uncertain expectation. I have therefore ſent off this expreſs, with orders to make all poſſible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch. It is my moſt earneſt requeſt that he may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with all poſſible expedition, unleſs the honourable Congreſs have already forwarded what is ſo indiſpenſably neceſſary.</p>

                     <p>THE reverend Mr. Kirkland, the bearer of this, having been introduced to the honourable Congreſs, can need no particular recommendation from me. But as he now wiſhes to have the affairs of his miſſion and public employ put upon ſome ſuitable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>All accounts agree that much of the favourable diſpoſition ſhewn by the Indians, may be aſcribed to his labour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. He has accompanied a chief of the Oneidas to this camp, which I have endeavoured to make agreeable to him, both by civility and ſome ſmall preſents. Mr. Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land being alſo in ſome neceſſity for money to bear his trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elling charges and other expenſes, I have ſupplied him with thirty-two pounds lawful money.</p>
                     <p>I cannot but congratulate the honourable Congreſs on the happy temper of the Canadians and Indians, our accounts of which are now fully confirmed by ſome intercepted let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from officers in Canada, to general Gage and others in Boſton, which were found on board the veſſel lately taken, going into Boſton with a donation of cattle and other freſh proviſions for the miniſterial army.</p>

                     <p>I WAS honoured with your favour of the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſixth ultimo, late the night before laſt; and a meeting of the general officers having been called upon a buſineſs which will make a conſiderable part of this letter. I took the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of laying before them thoſe parts of yours which reſpect the continuance and new-modelling of the army, the fuel, clothing, and other preparations for the enſuing winter. They have taken two or three days to conſider; and, as ſoon as I am poſſeſſed of their opinions, I ſhall loſe no time in tranſmitting the reſult, not only on the above ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but the number of troops neceſſary to be kept up.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="unknown:029737_0038_0FE246B9007F8488"/>
I have alſo directed the commiſſary-general and the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-maſter-general to prepare eſtimates of the expenſe of their departments for a certain given number of men, from which a judgment may be made, when the number of men to be kept in pay is determined:—all which I ſhall do my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the honour to lay before the Congreſs, as ſoon as they are ready.</p>
                     <p>I have now a painful though a neceſſary duty to perform, reſpecting Dr. Church, director-general of the hoſpital. About a week ago, Mr. ſecretary Ward, of Providence, ſent up to me one Wainwood, an inhabitant of Newport, with a letter directed to major Cane, in Boſton, in <hi>[occult]</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters, which he ſaid had been left with Wainwood ſome time ago, by a woman who was kept by Dr. Church. She had before preſſed Wainwood to take her to captain Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, Mr. Dudley the collector, or George Rome; which he declined. She then gave him the letter, with a ſtrict charge to deliver it to either of thoſe gentlemen. He, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſome improper correſpondence, kept the letter, and after ſome time opened it; but, not being able to read it, laid it up, where it remained until he received an obſcure letter from the woman, expreſſing an anxiety after the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal letter. He then communicated the whole matter to Mr. Ward, who ſent him up with the papers to me. I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſecured the woman: but for a long time ſhe was proof againſt every threat and perſuaſion to diſcover the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. However, at length ſhe was brought to a confeſſion, and named Dr. Church. I then immediately ſecured him and all his papers. Upon his firſt examination, he readily acknowledged the letter, ſaid it was deſigned for his brother Fleming, and, when deciphered, would be found to contain nothing criminal. He acknowledged his never having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the correſpondence to any perſon here but the girl, and made many proteſtations of the purity of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Having found a perſon capable of deciphering the letter, I in the mean time had all his papers ſearched, but found nothing criminal among them: but it appeared on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, that a confidant had been among the papers before my meſſenger arrived. I then called the general officers together for their advice, the reſult of which you will find in the incloſure, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1. The deciphered letter is the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029737_0039_0FE246BAEC4ACE60"/>
N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2. The army and country are exceedingly irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated: and upon a free diſcuſſion of the nature, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and conſequence of this matter, it has been unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agreed to lay it before the honourable Congreſs for their ſpecial advice and direction; at the ſame time ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting to their conſideration, whether an alteration of the twenty-eighth article of war may not be neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>As I ſhall reſerve all farther remarks upon the ſtate of the army till my next, I ſhall now beg leave to requeſt the determination of Congreſs, as to the property and diſpoſal of ſuch veſſels and cargoes as are deſigned for the ſupply of the enemy, and may fall into our hands. There has been an event of this kind at Portſmouth, (as by the incloſure, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 3) in which I have directed the cargo to be brought hither for the uſe of the army, reſerving the ſettlement of any claims of capture to the deciſion of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>As there are many unfortunate individuals whoſe prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty has been confiſcated by the enemy, I would humbly ſuggeſt to the conſideration of Congreſs the humanity of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, in part or in the whole, ſuch captures to the relief of thoſe ſufferers, after compenſating any expenſe of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and for their activity and ſpirit. I am the more indue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to requeſt this determination may be ſpeedy, as I have directed three veſſels to be equipped in order to cut off the ſupplies; and, from the number of veſſels hourly arriving, it may become an object of ſome importance. In the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of theſe captures, for the encouragement of the officers and men, I have allowed them one third of the cargoes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept military ſtores, which, with the veſſels, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the public uſe. I hope my plan, as well as the execution, will be favoured with the approbation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
                     <p>One Mr. Fiſk, an intelligent perſon, came out of Boſton on the third inſt. and gives us the following advices:—that a fleet, conſiſting of a ſixty-four, and twenty-gun ſhip, two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>loops of eighteen guns, and two tranſports with ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, were to ſail from Boſton as yeſterday; that they took on board two mortars, four howitzers, and other artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery calculated for the bombardment of a town:—their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination was kept a profound ſecret:—that an expreſs ſloop of war, which left England the eighth of Auguſt, arrived
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029737_0040_0FE246BC7111EB90"/>
four days ago;—that general Gage is recalled, and laſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day reſigned his command to general Howe;—that lord Percy, colonel Smith, and other officers who were at Lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, are ordered home with Gage;—that ſix ſhips of the line and two cutters were coming out under Sir Peter Dennis;—that five regiments and a thouſand marines are ordered out, and may be expected in three or four weeks:—no proſpect of accommodation; but the miniſtry deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to puſh the war to the utmoſt.</p>
                     <p>I have an expreſs from colonel Arnold, and herewith ſend a copy of his letter and an incloſure, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 4 and 5.—I am happy in finding he meets with no diſcouragement. The claim of the rifle officers, to be independent of all the ſuperior officers except colonel Arnold, is without any countenance or authority from me, as I have ſignified in my laſt diſpatch both to colonel Arnold and captain Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. The captain of the brig from Quebec for Boſton in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms me that there is no ſuſpicion of any ſuch expedition; and that, if Carleton is not drove from St. John's, ſo as to be obliged to throw himſelf into Quebec, it muſt fall into our hands, as it is left without a regular ſoldier, and many of the inhabitants are moſt favourably diſpoſed to the American cauſe;—and that there is the largeſt ſtock of ammunition ever collected in America.</p>
                     <p>In the above veſſel ſome letters were alſo found, from an officer at Quebec, to general Gage and major Sheriff at Boſton, containing ſuch an account of the temper of the Canadians, as cannot but afford the higheſt ſatisfaction. I have thought it beſt to forward them: they are the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 6 and 7.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029737_0041_0FE246BDF4FDD390"/>

                        </gap> their thoughts upon theſe ſubjects, and to favour me with the reſult, by a particular day, in writing. In this interval, the appointment of Dr. Franklin, Mr. Lynch, and colonel Harriſon, was communicated,—an event which has given me the higheſt ſatisfaction, as the ſubject was too weighty and complex for a diſcuſſion by letter. This appointment made any concluſion here unneceſſary, as it is not probable any ſuch arrangement would be agreed on, as would not be altered in ſome reſpects, upon a full and free conference. This good effect will ariſe from the ſtep already taken, that every officer will be prepared to give his ſentiments upon theſe important ſubjects.</p>
                     <p>The eſtimates of the commiſſary and quarter-maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general I have now the honour of incloſing. The firſt is N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1, the other N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to the reduction of the pay of the men, which may enter into the conſideration of their ſupport, it is the unanimous opinion of the general officers, that it cannot be touched with ſafety at preſent. * * *</p>
                     <p>Upon the preſumption of there being a vacancy in the direction of the hoſpital, lieutenant-colonel Hand, former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſurgeon in the eighteenth regiment, or royal Iriſh, and Dr. Foſter, late of Charleſtown, and one of the ſurgeons of the hoſpital under Dr. Church, are candidates for that office. I do not pretend to be acquainted with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective merits, and therefore have given them no farther expectation, than that they ſhould be mentioned as candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for the department. I therefore need only to add upon this ſubject, that the affairs of the hoſpital require that the appointment ſhould be made as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Before I was honoured with your favour of the fifth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, I had given orders for the equipment of ſome armed veſſels, to intercept the enemy's ſupplies of proviſions and ammunition. One of them was on a cruiſe between Cape Anne and Cape Cod, when the expreſs arrived. The others will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>it for the ſea in a few days, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of officers of the continental army, who are well rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommended, as perſons acquainted with the ſea, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch a ſervice. Two of theſe will be immediately
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029737_0042_0FE246C6A374D3F8"/>
diſpatched on this duty, and every particular, mentioned in your favour of the fifth inſtant, literally complied with.</p>
                     <p>That the honourable Congreſs may have a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete idea of the plan on which theſe veſſels are equipped; I incloſe a copy of the inſtructions given to the captains now out (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 4). Theſe, with the additional inſtruction directed, will be given to the captains who go into the mouth of St. Laurence's river. As both officers and men moſt cheerfully engage in the ſervice on the terms men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in theſe inſtructions, I fear that the propoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe will create ſome difficulty, by making a difference between men engaged on ſimilar ſervice. I have therefore not yet communicated this part of the plan, but reſerved an extra bounty as a reward for extraordinary activity. There are no armed veſſels in this province; and governor Cooke informs me the enterpriſe can receive no aſſiſtance from him, as one of the armed veſſels of Rhode-Iſland is on a long cruiſe, and the other unfit for the ſervice. Nothing ſhall be omitted to ſecure ſucceſs. A fortunate capture of an ordnance ſhip would give new life to the camp, and an immediate turn to the iſſue of this campaign.</p>
                     <p>Our laſt accouts from colonel Arnold are very favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: he was proceeding with all expedition; and I flatter myſelf (making all allowances) he will be at Quebec the twentieth inſtant, where a gentleman from Canada (Mr. * * *) aſſures me he will meet with no reſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>In the quarter-maſter's eſtimate, there are ſome arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles omitted, of which he informs me he cannot pretend to furniſh a computation,—ſuch as cartage, tools, &amp;c. for which ſome general allowance muſt be made.</p>
                     <p>From the various accounts received from Europe, there may be reaſon to expect troops will be landed at New-York, or ſome other middle colony. I ſhould be glad to know the pleaſure of the Congreſs, whether, upon ſuch an event, it would be expected that a part of this army ſhould be detached, or the internal force of ſuch colony and its neighbourhood be deemed ſufficient; or whether, in ſuch caſe, I am to wait the particular direction of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>The fleet, mentioned in my laſt, has been ſeen ſtanding N. N. E.; ſo that we apprehend it is intended for ſome
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:029737_0043_0FE246C875D60350"/>
part of this province, or New-Hampſhire, or poſſibly Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec.</p>
                     <p>The lateſt and beſt accounts we have from the enemy are, that they are engaged in their new work acroſs the ſouth end of Boſton, preparing their barracks, &amp;c. for win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:—that it is propoſed to keep from five hundred to a thouſand men on Bunker's hill all winter, who are to be relieved once a week;—the reſt to be drawn into Boſton.</p>
                     <p>A perſon who has lately been a ſervant to major Conolly (a tool of lord Dunmore's) has given an account of a ſcheme to diſtreſs the ſouthern provinces, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me of ſufficient conſequence to be immediately tranſmitted. I have therefore got it atteſted, and do my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the honour of incloſing it, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>The new levies from Connecticut have lately marched into camp, and are a body of as good troops as any we have: ſo that we have now the ſame ſtrength as before the detachment made under colonel Arnold.</p>
                     <p>I am, with the moſt reſpectful ſentiments to the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Congreſs, and yourſelf, Sir, your moſt obedient, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>MY conjecture of the deſtination of the late ſquadron from Boſton, in my laſt, has been unhappily verified by an outrage, exceeding, in barbarity and cruelty, every hoſtile act practiſed among civilized nations. I have incloſed the account given me by Mr. Jones, a gentleman of the town of Falmouth, of the deſtruction of that increaſing and flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing village. He is a very great ſufferer, and informs me that the time allowed for the removal of effects was ſo ſmall, that valuable property of all kinds, and to a great amount, has been deſtroyed. The orders ſhewn by the captain for this horrid procedure (by which it appears the ſame deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is meditated upon all the towns on the coaſt) made it my duty to communicate it as quickly and extenſively as poſſible. As Portſmouth was the next place to which he propoſed to go, general Sullivan was permitted to go up, and give them his aſſiſtance and advice to ward off the blow. I flatter myſelf the like event will not happen
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029737_0044_0FE246CA009EA930"/>
there, as they have a fortification of ſome ſtrength, and a veſſel has arrived at a place called Sheepſcot, with fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred pounds of powder.</p>
                     <p>The gentlemen of the Congreſs have nearly finiſhed their buſineſs: but as they write by this opportunity, I muſt beg leave to refer you to their letter, for what concerns their commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>We have had no occurrence of any conſequence in the camp ſince I had the honour of addreſſing you laſt; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect every hour to hear that Newport has ſhared the fate of unhappy Falmouth.</p>

                     <p>THE information, which the gentlemen who have lately gone from hence can give the Congreſs, of the ſtate and ſituation of the army, would have made a letter unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, if I did not ſuppoſe there would be ſome anxiety to know the intentions of the army on the ſubject of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enliſtment.</p>
                     <p>Agreeably to the advice of thoſe gentlemen, and my own opinion, I immediately began by directing all ſuch officers as propoſed to continue, to ſignify their intentions as ſoon as poſſible. A great number of the returns are come in, from which I find that a very great proportion of the officers of the rank of captains, and under, will retire;—from preſent appearances, I may ſay, half,—but at leaſt, one third. It is with ſome concern alſo that I obſerve, that many of the officers who retire diſcourage the continuance of the men, and, I fear, will communicate the infection to them. Some have adviſed, that thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers who decline the ſervice ſhould be immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed: but this would be very dangerous and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. I confeſs I have great anxieties upon the ſubject, though I ſtill hope the pay and terms are ſo advantageous, that intereſt, and, I hope alſo, a regard to their country, will retain a greater proportion of the privates than their officers. In ſo important a matter, I ſhall eſteem it my indiſpenſable duty, not only to act with all poſſible pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:029737_0045_0FE246CC8DE88C00"/>
but to give the moſt early and conſtant advice of my progreſs.</p>
                     <p>A ſupply of clothing, equal to our neceſſities, would greatly contribute to the encouragement and ſatisfaction of the men. In every point of view, it is ſo important, that I beg leave to call the attention of the Congreſs to it in a particular manner.</p>
                     <p>A ſergeant has juſt come in from Bunker's-hill, but brings no important news.</p>

                     <p>I COULD not ſuffer Mr. Randolph to quit this camp without bearing ſome teſtimony of my duty to the Congreſs; although his ſudden departure (occaſioned by the death of his worthy relative, whoſe loſs, as a good citizen and valuable member of ſociety, is much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted) does not allow me time to be particular.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed return ſhews, at one view, what reliance we have upon the officers of this army, and how deficient we are like to be in ſubaltern officers. A few days more will enable me to inform the Congreſs what they have to expect from the ſoldiery, as I ſhall iſſue recruiting orders for this purpoſe ſo ſoon as the officers are appointed,—which will be done this day,—having ſent for the general officers, to conſult them in the choice.</p>
                     <p>I muſt beg leave to recall the attention of the Congreſs to the appointment of a brigadier-general,—an officer as neceſſary to a brigade as a colonel is to a regiment, and will be exceedingly wanted in the new arrangement.</p>
                     <p>The proclamations and aſſociation, herewith incloſed, came to my hands on Monday laſt. I thought it my duty to ſend them to you. Nothing of moment has happened ſince my laſt.</p>

                     <p>THE immediate occaſion of my giving the Congreſs the trouble of a letter at this time is to inform them, that, in conſequence of their order ſignified in your letter of the twentieth ultimo, I laid myſelf under a ſolemn tie of ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>y to captain M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Pherſon, and proceeded to examine his plan for the deſtruction of the fleet in the harbour of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, with all that care and attention which the importance of it deſerved, and my judgment could lead to. But not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happy enough to coincide in opinion with that gentleman, and finding that his ſcheme would involve greater expenſe, than (under my doubts of its ſucceſs) I thought myſelf juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in giving into, I prevailed upon him to communicate his plan to three gentlemen of the artillery in this army, well acquainted in the knowledge and practice of gunnery. By them he has been convinced, that, inaſmuch as he ſet out upon wrong principles, the ſcheme would prove abortive. Unwilling however to relinquiſh his favourite project of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the naval force of Great-Britain, he is very deſirous of building a number of row-gallies for this purpoſe. But as the Congreſs alone are competent to the adoption of this meaſure, I have adviſed him (although he offered to go on with the building of them at his own expenſe, till the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſhould decide) to repair immediately to Philadelphia with his propoſals; where, if they ſhould be agreed to, or veſſels of ſuperior force, agreeably to the wiſhes of moſt others, ſhould be reſolved on, he may ſet inſtantly about them, with all the materials upon the ſpot:—here, they are to collect. To him therefore I refer for further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation on this head.</p>
                     <p>A veſſel, ſaid to be from Philadelphia and bound to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, with a hundred and twenty pipes of wine (a hundred and eighteen of which are ſecured) ſtranded at a place called Eaſtham, in a gale of wind on the ſecond inſtant:—another from Boſton to Halifax, with dry goods, &amp;c. (amounting, per invoice, to about two hundred and forty pounds lawful) got diſabled in the ſame gale, near Beverly. Theſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes, with the papers, I have ordered to this place,—the veſſels to be taken care of till further orders. I have alſo an account of the taking of a wood-ſloop bound to Boſton,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:029737_0047_0FE246D5C2455838"/>
and carried into Portſmouth by one of our armed veſſels;—particulars not yet come to hand;—and this inſtant, of two others, from Nova-Scotia to Boſton, with hay, wood, live ſtock, &amp;c. by another of our armed ſchooners.—Theſe are in Plymouth.</p>
                     <p>Theſe accidents and captures point out the neceſſity of eſtabliſhing proper courts without loſs of time, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of property, and the legality of ſeizures; otherwiſe I may be involved in inextricable difficulties.</p>
                     <p>Our priſoners, by the reduction of Fort Chamblee (on which happy event I moſt ſincerely congratulate the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs) being conſiderably augmented, and likely to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, I ſubmit it to the wiſdom of Congreſs, whether ſome convenient inland towns, remote from the poſt-roads, ought not to be aſſigned them; the manner of their treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſubſiſtence, &amp;c. defined; and a commiſſary or agent appointed, to ſee that juſtice is done both to them and the public, proper accounts rendered, &amp;c. Without a mode of this ſort is adopted, I fear there will be ſad confuſion hereafter, as there are great complaints at preſent.</p>
                     <p>I reckoned without my hoſt, when I informed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in my laſt, that I ſhould in a day or two be able to acquaint them of the diſpoſition of the ſoldiery towards a new enliſtment. I have been in conſultation with the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erals of this army ever ſince Thurſday laſt, endeavouring to eſtabliſh new corps of officers; but find ſo many doubts and difficulties to reconcile, that I cannot ſay when they are to end, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The council of officers are unanimouſly of opinion that the command of the artillery ſhould no longer continue in colonel * * *; and knowing of no perſon better qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified to ſupply his place, or whoſe appointment will give more general ſatisfaction, have taken the liberty of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending Henry Knox, eſquire, to the conſideration of Congreſs, thinking it indiſpenſably neceſſary at the ſame time that this regiment ſhould conſiſt of two lieutenant-col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onels, two majors, and twelve companies, agreeably to the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:029737_0048_0FE246D7461A83E8"/>
plan and eſtimate handed in; which, differing from the laſt eſtabliſhment, I ſhould be glad to be inſtructed on.</p>
                     <p>The commiſſary-general not being returned, will apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize, I hope, for my ſilence reſpecting a requiſition of the expenſe of his clerks, &amp;c. which I was to have obtained together with others, and forwarded.</p>
                     <p>I have heard nothing of colonel Arnold ſince the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth ultimo. His letter of, and journal to, that date, will convey all the information I am able to give of him. I think he muſt be in Quebec. If any miſchance had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him, he would, as directed, have forwarded an expreſs. No account yet of the armed veſſels ſent to St. Laurence. I think they will meet the ſtores inward or outward bound.</p>

                     <p>* * * INCLOSED you have a copy of an act, paſſed this ſeſſion, by the honourable council and houſe of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of this province. It reſpects ſuch captures as may be made by veſſels fitted out by the province, or by individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals thereof. As the armed veſſels, fitted out at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental expenſe, do not come under this law, I would have it ſubmitted to the conſideration of Congreſs, to point out a more ſummary way of proceeding, to determine the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and mode of condemnation of ſuch prizes as have been or hereafter may be made, than is ſpecified in this act.</p>
                     <p>Should not a court be eſtabliſhed by authority of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, to take cognizance of prizes made by the continental veſſels? Whatever the mode is which they are pleaſed to
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:029737_0049_0FE246D8CAEE7258"/>
adopt, there is an abſolute neceſſity of its being ſpeedily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined on: for I cannot ſpare time from military affairs, to give proper attention to theſe matters.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of Plymouth have taken a ſloop, laden with proviſions, &amp;c. from Halifax, bound to Boſton: and the inhabitants of Beverly have, under cover of one of the armed ſchooners, taken a veſſel from Ireland, laden with beef, pork, butter, &amp;c. for the ſame place. The latter brings papers and letters of a very intereſting nature, which are in the hands of the honourable council, who informed me they will tranſmit them to you by this conveyance. To the contents of theſe papers and letters I muſt beg leave to refer you and the honourable Congreſs, who will now ſee the abſolute neceſſity there is of exerting all their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to withſtand the mighty efforts of our enemies.</p>
                     <p>The trouble I have in the arrangement of the army is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconceivable. Many of the officers ſent in their names to ſerve, in expectation of promotion: others ſtood aloof * * *; whilſt a number who had declined have again ſent in their names, to ſerve. So great has the confuſion, ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from theſe and many other perplexing circumſtances, been, that I found it abſolutely impoſſible to fix this very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting buſineſs exactly on the plan reſolved on in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, though I have kept up to the ſpirit, as near as the nature and neceſſity of the caſe would admit of: the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the ſoldiers is as great, indeed more ſo, if poſſible, than with the officers. They will not enliſt, until they know their colonel, lieutenant-colonel, major, captain, &amp;c.; ſo that it was neceſſary to fix the officers the firſt thing; which is, at laſt, in ſome manner done; and I have given out enliſting orders.</p>
                     <p>You, Sir, can much eaſier judge, than I can expreſs, the anxiety of mind I muſt labour under on the occaſion, eſpecially at this time, when we may expect the enemy will begin to act on the arrival of their reinforcement, part of which is already come, and the remainder daily dropping in.</p>
                     <p>I have other diſtreſſes of a very alarming nature. The arms of our ſoldiery are ſo exceeding bad, that I aſſure you, Sir, I cannot place a proper confidence in them. Our powder is waſting faſt, notwithſtanding the ſtricteſt
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:029737_0050_0FE24732F4DF4358"/>
care, economy and attention are paid to it. The long ſeries of wet weather we have had, renders the greater part of what has been ſerved out to the men of no uſe. Yeſterday I had a proof of it, as a party of the enemy, about four or five hundred, taking the advantage of a high tide, landed at Leechmore's point: we were alarmed, and of courſe ordered every man to examine his cartouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box, when the melancholy truth appeared; and we were obliged to furniſh the greater part of them with freſh am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition.</p>
                     <p>The damage done at the point was the taking of a man who watched a few horſes and cows: ten of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they carried off. Colonel Thompſon marched down with his regiment of riflemen, and was joined by colonel Woodbridge, with a part of his and a part of Patterſon's regiment, who gallantly waded through the water, and ſoon obliged the enemy to embark under cover of a man-of-war, a floating battery, and the fire of a battery on Charleſtown neck. We have two of our men dangerouſly wounded by grape-ſhot from the man-of-war; and, by a flag ſent out this day, we are informed the enemy loſt two of their men.</p>

                     <p>I RECEIVED your favours of the ſeventh and tenth inſtant, with the reſolves of the honourable Congreſs, to which I will pay all due attention. As ſoon as two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable perſons can be found, I will diſpatch them to Nova-Scotia, on the ſervice reſolved on in Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>The reſolve to raiſe two battalions of marines will (if practicable in this army) entirely derange what has been done. It is therein mentioned, "one colonel for the two battalions:"—of courſe, a colonel muſt be diſmiſſed. One of the many difficulties which attended the new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, was in reconciling the different intereſts, and judging of the merits of the different colonels. In the diſmiſſion of this one, the ſame difficulties will occur. The officers and men muſt be acquainted with maritime
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:029737_0051_0FE246E1C161E1C0"/>
affairs; to comply with which, they muſt be picked out of the whole army,—one from this corps, one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,—ſo as to break through the whole ſyſtem, which has coſt us ſo much time, anxiety and pains, to bring into any tolerable form. Notwithſtanding any difficulties which will ariſe, you may be aſſured, Sir, that I will uſe every endeavour to comply with their reſolve.</p>
                     <p>I beg leave to ſubmit it to the conſideration of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs (if theſe two battalions can be formed out of this army) whether this is a time to weaken our lines, by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying any of the forces appointed to defend them, on any other ſervice. The gentlemen who were here from the Congreſs know their vaſt extent: they muſt know that we ſhall have occaſion for our whole force for that purpoſe; more ſo now than at any paſt time, as we may expect the enemy will take the advantage of the firſt hard weather, and attempt to make an impreſſion ſomewhere. That this is their intention, we have many reaſons to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
                     <p>We have had, in the laſt week, ſix deſerters, and took two ſtraggling priſoners. They all agree that two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, with a train of artillery and one of the regiments from Ireland, were arrived at Boſton;—that freſh ammunition and flints have been ſerved out;—that the grenadiers and light infantry had orders to hold themſelves in readineſs at a moment's warning.</p>
                     <p>As there is every appearance that this conteſt will not be ſoon decided, and of courſe that there muſt be an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the continental army, would it not be eligible to raiſe two battalions of marines in New-York and Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, where there muſt be numbers of ſailors now unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed?—This however is matter of opinion, which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with all due deference to the ſuperior judgment of the Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed you have copies of two letters,—one from colonel Arnold,—the other from colonel * * *. I can form no judgment on the latter's conduct, until I ſee him. Notwithſtanding the great defection, I do not deſpair of colonel Arnold's ſucceſs. He will have, in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, many more difficulties to encounter than if he had been a fortnight ſooner; as it is likely that governor Carleton
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:029737_0052_0FE247359C2EFF10"/>
will, with what forces he can collect after the ſurrender of the reſt of Canada, throw himſelf into Quebec, and there make his laſt effort. There is no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ate account from cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Broughton and Sillman, ſent to the river St. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. The other cruiſers have been chiefly confined to harbour, by the badneſs of the weather. The ſame reaſon has cauſed great delay in building of our barracks; which, with a moſt mortifying ſcarcity of fire-wood, diſcourages the men from enliſting. The laſt, I am afraid, is an inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable obſtacle. I have applied to the honourable houſe of repreſentatives of this province, who were pleaſed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a committee to negociate this buſineſs: and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the pains they have and are taking, they find it impoſſible to ſupply our neceſſities. The want of a ſufficient number of teams I underſtand to be the chief impediment.</p>
                     <p>I got returns this day from eleven colonels, of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers enliſted in their regiments. The whole amount is nine hundred and ſixty-ſix men. There muſt be ſome other ſtimulus beſides love for their country, to make men fond of the ſervice. It would be a great encouragement, and no additional expenſe to the continent, were they to receive pay for the months of October and November; alſo a month's pay advance. The preſent ſtate of the military cheſt will not admit of this. The ſooner it is enabled to do ſo, the better.</p>
                     <p>The commiſſary-general is daily expected in camp. I cannot ſend you the eſtimate of the clerks in his depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, until he arrives.</p>
                     <p>I ſincerely congratulate you upon the ſucceſs of your arms, in the ſurrender of St. John's, which I hope is a happy preſage of the reduction of the reſt of Canada.</p>

Schuyler on the ſame buſineſs, as you will ſee by the incloſed copy of inſtructions which I have given him. It would give me much ſatisfaction, that this gentleman, or any other whom you may think qualified, was appointed to the command of the artillery regiment. In my letter to you, of the eighth inſtant, I have expreſſed myſelf fully on this ſubject, which I beg leave to recommend to your immediate attention; as the formation of that corps will be at a ſtand, until I am honoured with your inſtructions thereon. * * * *</p>
                     <p>There are two perſons engaged to go to Nova-Scotia, on the buſineſs recommended in your laſt. By the beſt information we have from thence, the ſtores, &amp;c. have been withdrawn ſome time. Should this not be the caſe, it is next to an impoſſibility to attempt any thing there, in the preſent unſettled and precarious ſtate of the army. * * *</p>
                     <p>From what I can collect by my inquiries amongſt the officers, it will be impoſſible to get the men to enliſt for the continuance of the war; which will be an inſuperable obſtruction to the formation of the two battalions of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines on the plan reſolved on in Congreſs. As it can make no difference, I propoſe to proceed on the new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of the army, and, when completed, inquire out ſuch officers and men as are beſt qualified for that ſervice, and endeavour to form theſe two battalions out of the whole. This appears to me the beſt method, and will, I hope, meet the approbation of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>As it will be very difficult for the men to work when the hard froſt ſets in, I have thought it neceſſary (though of little u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e at preſent) to take poſſeſſion of Coble-hill, for the benefit of any future operations. It was effected, without the leaſt oppoſition from the enemy, the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>third inſtant. Their inactivity on this occaſion is what I cannot account for;—it is probable they are meditating a blow ſomewhere.</p>
                     <p>About three hundred men, women and children of the poor inhabitants of Boſton, came out to Point-Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley laſt Friday. They have brought their houſehold fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, but are unprovided of every other neceſſary of life. I have recommended them to the attention of the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:029737_0054_0FE247371ED72828"/>
committee of the honourable council of this province, now ſitting at Watertown.</p>
                     <p>The number enliſted ſince my laſt are two thouſand four hundred and fifty men. * * * * Our ſituation is truly alarming: and of this general Howe is well appriſed, it being the common topic of converſation when the people left Boſton laſt Friday. No doubt, when he is reinforced; he will avail himſelf of the information.</p>
                     <p>I am making the beſt diſpoſition I can for our defence, having thrown up, beſides the work on Coble-hill, ſeveral redoubts, half-moons, &amp;c. along the bay: and I fear I ſhall be under the neceſſity of calling in the militia and minute-men of the country to my aſſiſtance: I ſay, I fear it,—becauſe, by what I can learn from the officers in the army, belonging to this colony, it will be next to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility to keep them under any degree of diſcipline, and that it will be very difficult to prevail on them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a moment longer than they chooſe themſelves. It is a mortifying reflection, to be reduced to this dilemma. There has been nothing wanting on my part, to infuſe a proper ſpirit amongſt the officers, that they may exert their influence with the ſoldiery. You ſee, by a fortnight's recruiting amongſt men with arms in their hands, how little has been the ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>As the ſmall-pox is now in Boſton, I have uſed the precaution of prohibiting ſuch as lately came out from coming near our camp. General Burgoyne, I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will ſoon embark for England. I think the riſk too great to write you by poſt, whilſt it continues to paſs through New-York. It is certain that a poſt has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted the beginning of laſt month, as they ſent out ſeveral letters from Boſton with the poſt-mark of Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more on them. This goes by captain Joſeph Blewer, who promiſes to deliver it carefully unto you.</p>
                     <p>You doubtleſs will have heard, before this reaches, of general Montgomery's having got poſs;eſs;ion of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tréal. I congratulate you thereon. He has troubles with his troops, as well as I have. All I can learn of colonel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Arnold is, that he is near Quebec. I hope Montgomery will be able to proceed to his aſſiſtance. I ſhall be very uneaſy until I hear they are joined.</p>

                     <p>I HAD the honour of writing to you the thirtieth ultimo, incloſing an inventory of the military ſtores taken on board the brig Nancy by captain Manly of the armed ſchooner Lee. I have now to inform you that he has ſince ſent into Beverly a ſhip named the Concord, James Lowrie, maſter, from Greenock in Scotland, bound to Boſton. She has on board dry goods and coals, to the value of three thouſand ſix hundred and ſix pounds, nine ſhillings and ſeven pence ſterling, ſhipped by Crawford, Anderſon, and Co. and conſigned to James Anderſon, merchant in Boſton. It is mentioned in the letters found
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:029737_0056_0FE24738A42A3590"/>
on board, that this cargo was for the uſe of the army: but, on a ſtrict examination, I find it is really the property of the ſhippers and the perſon to whom conſigned. Pray what is to be done with this ſhip and cargo? and what with the brigantine which brought the military ſtores?—It was agreed, in the conference laſt October, <hi>"that all veſſels employed merely as tranſports, and unarmed, with their crews, be ſet at liberty, upon giving ſecurity to return to Europe; but that this indulgence be not extended longer than till the firſt of April next."</hi> In the ſhippers' letter, they mention: "You muſt procure a certificate from the general and admiral, of the Concord's being in the government ſervice, ſuch as the Glaſgow packet brought with her, which was of great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, procured a liberty to arm her, which was refuſed us; alſo gave her a preference for ſome recruits that went out in her." In another part of the letter, they ſay: "Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Lowrie will deliver you the contract for the coals: we gave it to him, as it perhaps might be of uſe, as a certificate of his ſhip being employed in the government ſervice." Every letter on board breathes nothing but enmity to this country: and a vaſt number of them there are.</p>
                     <p>It is ſome time ſince I recommended to the Congreſs that they would inſtitute a court for the trial of prizes made by the continental armed veſſels; which I hope they have ere now taken into their conſideration: otherwiſe I ſhould again take the liberty of urging it in the moſt preſſing manner.</p>
                     <p>The conduct of a great number of the Connecticut troops has laid me under the neceſſity of calling in a body of the militia, much ſooner than I apprehended there would be an occaſion for ſuch a ſtep. I was afraid ſome time ago that they would incline to go home, when the time of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtment expired. I called upon the officers of the ſeveral regiments, to know whether they could prevail on the men to remain until the firſt of January, or till a ſufficient number of other forces could be raiſed to ſupply their place. I ſuppoſe they were deceived themſelves: I know they deceived me by aſſurances that I need be under no apprehenſion on that ſcore, for the men would not leave the lines. Laſt Friday ſhewed how much they were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, as the major part of the troops of that colony were
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:029737_0057_0FE246E68039E838"/>
going away with their arms and ammunition. We have however by threats, perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aſion, and the activity of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the country who ſent back many of them that had ſet out, prevailed upon the moſt part to ſtay. There are about eighty of them miſſing.</p>
                     <p>I have called in three thouſand men from this province; and general Sullivan, who lately returned from the prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince of New-Hampſhire, having informed me that a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men were there ready at the ſhorteſt notice, I have demanded two thouſand from that province. Theſe two bodies, I expect, will be in by the tenth inſtant, to make up the deficiency of the Connecticut-men whom I have promiſed to diſmiſs on that day, as well as the numbers to whom I was obliged to grant furloughs before any would enliſt. As the ſame defection is much to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended when the time of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, New-Hampſhire, and Rhode-Iſland forces is expired, I beg the attention of Congreſs to this important affair.</p>
                     <p>I am informed that it has been the cuſtom of theſe prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inces in the laſt war, for the legiſlative power to order ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery town to provide a certain quota of men for the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign. This or ſome other mode ſhould be at preſent adopted, as I am ſatisfied the men cannot be had without. This the Congreſs will pleaſe to take into their immediate conſideration. My ſuſpicions on this head I ſhall alſo communicate to the governors Trumbull and Cooke, alſo to the New-Hampſhire convention.</p>
                     <p>The number enliſted in the laſt week are about thirteen hundred men. By this you ſee how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>low this important work goes on. * * *</p>
                     <p>An expreſs is juſt come in from general Schuyler, with letters from colonel Arnold and general Montgomery, copies of which I have the honour to incloſe you. Upon the whole, I think affairs carry a pleaſing aſpect in that quarter. The reduction of Quebec is an object of ſuch great importance, that I doubt not the Congreſs will give every aſſiſtance in their power for the accompliſhing it this winter.</p>
                     <p>By the laſt accounts from the armed ſchooners ſent to the river St. Laurence, I fear we have but little to expect from them: they were falling ſhort of proviſion, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:029737_0058_0FE247428A3F4E68"/>
that they would be obliged to return; which at this time is particularly unfortunate, as, if they choſe a proper ſtation, all the veſſels coming down that river muſt fall into their hands. The plague, trouble and vexation I have had with the crews of all the armed veſſels, is inexpreſſible. I do believe there is not on earth a more diſorderly ſet: ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery time they come into port, we hear of nothing but mutinous complaints. Manly's ſucceſs has lately, and but lately, quieted his people. The crews of the Waſhington and Harriſon have actually deſerted them; ſo that I have been under the neceſſity of ordering the agent to lay the latter up, and get hands for the other on the beſt terms he could.</p>
                     <p>The houſe of repreſentatives and the honourable board have ſent me a vote of theirs relative to the harbour of Cape-Cod, which you have herewith. I ſhall ſend an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer thither to examine what can be done for its defence, though I do not think I ſhall be able to give them ſuch aſſiſtance as may be requiſite; for I have at preſent neither men, powder, nor cannon to ſpare. The great want of powder is what the attention of Congreſs ſhould be partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly applied to. I dare not attempt any thing offenſive, let the temptation or advantage be ever ſo great, as I have not more of that moſt eſſential article than will be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to defend our lines, ſhould the enemy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to attack them.</p>
                     <p>By recent information from Boſton, general Howe is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſend out a number of the inhabitants, in order, it is thought, to make more room for his expected reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. There is one part of the information I can hardly give credit to:—a ſailor ſays that a number of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out have been inoculated, with deſign of ſpreading the ſmall-pox through this country and camp. I have communicated this to the general court; and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their attention thereto.</p>
                     <p>They are arming one of the tranſports in Boſton, with which they mean to decoy ſome of our armed veſſels. As we are appriſed of their deſign, I hope they will be diſappointed.</p>
                     <p>My beſt reſpects wait on the gentlemen in Congreſs, and I am, Sir, your moſt humble, &amp;c.</p>

My fears, that Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Sillman would not effect any good purpoſe, were too well founded. They are returned, and brought with them three of the principal inhabitants from the iſland of St. John's. * * * They brought the governor's commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the province ſeal, &amp;c. &amp;c. As the captains acted without any warrant for ſuch conduct, I have thought it but juſtice to diſcharge theſe gentlemen, whoſe families were left in the utmoſt diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>I am credibly informed that James Anderſon, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignee and part owner of the ſhip Concord and cargo, is not only unfriendly to American liberty, but actually in arms againſt us,—being captain of the Scotch company at Boſton.

                        </gap> men. If they go on at this ſlow rate, it will be a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this army is complete. I have wrote to the governors of Connecticut and Rhode-Iſland, alſo to the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of New-Hampſhire, on this ſubject. A copy of my letter to them I have the honour to incloſe herewith.
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:029737_0060_0FE2474476DA30C8"/>
A letter to the ſame purport I ſent to the legiſlature of this province.</p>
                     <p>The militia are coming in faſt. I am much pleaſed with the alacrity which the good people of this province, as well as thoſe of New-Hampſhire, have ſhewn upon this occaſion. I expect the whole will be in this day and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, when what remains of the Connecticut [<hi>troops,</hi>] who have not enliſted, will have liberty to go to their fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
                     <p>The commiſſary-general is ſtill by his indiſpoſition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from camp. He committed an error, when mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the ration-liſt: for he was then ſerving out (and has continued ſo to do) ſix ounces per man per week of butter, though it is not included in the liſt approved of by Congreſs. I do not think it would be expedient to put a ſtop thereto; as every thing, that would have a tendency to give the ſoldiery room for complaint, muſt be avoided.</p>
                     <p>The information I received that the enemy intended ſpreading the ſmall-pox amongſt us, I could not ſuppoſe them capable of. I now muſt give ſome credit to it, as it has made its appearance on ſeveral of thoſe who laſt came out of Boſton. Every neceſſary precaution has been taken to prevent its being communicated to this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and the general court will take care that it does not ſpread through the country.</p>
                     <p>I have not heard that any more troops are arrived at Boſton; which is a lucky circumſtance, as the Connecticut troops, I now find, are for the moſt part gone off. The houſes in Boſton are leſſening every day: they are pulled down, either for fire-wood, or to prevent the effects of fire, ſhould we attempt a bombardment or an attack upon the town. Coble-hill is ſtrongly fortified, without any interruption from the enemy. * * * This is what at preſent occurs; from, Sir, your moſt obedient, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>I RECEIVED your favour of the ſecond inſtant, with the ſeveral reſolves of Congreſs therein incloſed. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves relative to captures made by continental armed veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels only want a court eſtabliſhed for trial, to make them complete. This, I hope, will be ſoon done, as I have taken the liberty to urge it often to the Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>I am ſomewhat at a loſs to know whether I am to raiſe the two battalions of marines here, or not. As the delay can be attended with but little inconvenience, I will wait a farther explanation from Congreſs, before I take any ſteps therein.</p>
                     <p>I am much pleaſed that the money will be forwarded with all poſſible expedition, as it is much wanting; alſo that Conolly and his aſſociates are taken. It has been a very fortunate diſcovery. I make no doubt but that the Congreſs will take every neceſſary meaſure to diſpoſſeſs lord Dunmore of his hold in Virginia: the ſooner ſteps are taken for that purpoſe, the more probability there will be of their being effectual. * * * *</p>
                     <p>I will make application to general Howe, and propoſe an exchange for Mr. Ethan Allen. I am much afraid I ſhall have a like propoſal to make for captain Martindale, of the armed brigantine Waſhington, and his men, which, it is reported, was taken a few days paſt by a man-of-war, and carried into Boſton. We cannot expect to be always ſucceſsful.</p>

                     <p>About a hundred and fifty more of the poor inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants are come out of Boſton. The ſmall-pox rages all over the town: ſuch of the military as had it not before are now under inoculation. This, I apprehend, is a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon of defence they are uſing againſt us.

                     <p>CAPTAIN Manly, of the Lee armed ſchooner, took and ſent into Beverly the ſloop Betſey, A. Atkinſon, maſter. She is an armed veſſel, diſpatched by lord Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, with Indian corn, potatoes, and oats, for the army in Boſton. The packets of letters found on board, I have the honour to ſend you with this by captain James Chambers, they being of ſo much importance that I do not think it would be prudent to truſt them by a common expreſs.</p>
                     <p>As lord Dunmore's ſchemes are fully laid open in theſe letters, I need not point out to the Congreſs the neceſſity there is of a vigorous exertion being adopted by them, to diſpoſſeſs his lordſhip of the ſtrong hold he has got in Virginia. I do not mean to dictate: but I am ſure they will pardon me for giving them freely my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, which is, that the fate of America a good deal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on his being obliged to evacuate Norfolk this win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or not.</p>
                     <p>I have Kirkland well ſecured, and think I will ſend him to you for examination. By moſt of the letters relative to him, he is a dangerous fellow. John Stewart's letters and papers are of a very intereſting nature. Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor Tonyn's and many other letters from Auguſtine ſhew the weakneſs of the place; at the ſame time, of what vaſt conſequence it would be for us to poſſeſs our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of it, and the great quantity of ammunition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the forts. Indeed theſe papers are of ſo great conſequence, that I think this but little inferior to any prize our famous Manly has taken.</p>
                     <p>We now work at our eaſe on Leechmore's hill. On diſcovering our party there yeſterday morning, the ſhip which lay oppoſite began a cannonade, to which Mount Horam added ſome ſhells. One of our men was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We fired a few ſhot from two eighteen pounders which are placed on Coble-hill, and ſoon obliged the ſhip to ſhift her ſtation. She now lies in the ferry-way: and, except a few ſhells from the mount in Boſton, (which do no execution) we have no interruption in proſecuting our works. which will in a very ſhort time be completed.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:029737_0064_0FE247488E026D00"/>
When that is done,—when we have powder to ſport with,—I think, if the Congreſs reſolve on the execution of the propoſal made relative to the town of Boſton, it can be done.</p>
                     <p>I have ſent a letter in this day to general Howe, of which a copy goes herewith. My reaſon for pointing out brigadier-general Preſcot as the object who is to ſuffer Mr. Allen's fate, is, that, by letters from general Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and copies of letters from general Montgomery to Schuyler, I am given to underſtand that Preſcot is the cauſe of Allen's ſufferings. I thought it beſt to be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive on the occaſion, as did the generals whom I conſulted thereon.</p>
                     <p>The returns of men enliſted ſince my laſt amount to about eighteen hundred, making in the whole ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand one hundred and forty. The militia that are come in, both from this province and New-Hampſhire, are very fine-looking men, and go through their duty with great alacrity. The diſpatch made, both by the people in march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and by the legiſlative powers in complying with my requiſition, has given me infinite ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Your letter of the eighth inſtant, with the explanatory reſolve reſpecting my calling forth the militia and minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, is come to hand; to which I ſhall pay all due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You have removed all the difficulties which I labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under, about the two battalions of marines. I ſhall obey the orders of Congreſs in looking out for proper offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to command that corps. I make no doubt but, when the money arrives to pay off the arrears and the month's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, that it will be a great encouragement for the men to enliſt.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed is a letter I lately received from Mr. James Lovell. His caſe is truly pitiable. I wiſh ſome mode could be fallen upon to relieve him from the cruel ſituation he is now in. I am ſenſible of the impropriety of exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſoldier for a citizen: but there is ſomething ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly diſtreſſing in regard to this gentleman, that I dare ſay you will take it under your conſideration.</p>

                     <p>I HAD the honour to addreſs myſelf to you on the nineteenth inſtant, ſince which I have received endoubted information that the genuine inſtructions given to Conolly have not reached your hands; that they are very artfully concealed in the tree of his ſaddle, and covered with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſs ſo nicely that they are ſcarcely diſcernible: that thoſe which were found upon him were intended to deceive, if he was caught. You will moſt certainly have his ſaddle taken to pieces, in order to diſcover this deep-laid plot.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed is a copy of general Howe's letter in anſwer to the one I wrote him the eighteenth inſtant. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct I am to obſerve towards brigadier Preſcot in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of theſe letters, the Congreſs will oblige me by determining for me.</p>
                     <p>The gentlemen by whom you ſent the money are arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ſum they brought, though large, is not ſufficient to anſwer the demands of the army, which at this time are remarkably heavy: there is three month's pay due, one month's advance, two dollars for each blanket,—the arms, that are left by thoſe who are diſmiſſed, to be paid for,—beſides the demands which are on the commiſſary and quarter-maſter generals. You will therefore ſee the neceſſity of another remittance, which I beg may be as ſoon as you conveniently can.</p>
                     <p>I will take the opportunity of the return of theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, to ſend colonel Kirkland to you for examination, and that you may diſpoſe of him as to you may ſeem proper.</p>
                     <p>A committee from the general court of this province called on me the other day, informing me that they were in great want of ordnance for the defence of the colony; that, if what belonged to them, now in uſe here, was kept for the continent, they would be under the neceſſity of providing themſelves with others: of courſe what is kept muſt be paid for. There are many of the cannon of very little uſe: ſuch of them as are good, I cannot at preſent part with: perhaps when I receive the ſupply
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029737_0066_0FE2474E83AC23C8"/>
from New-York and Canada, it may be in my power to ſpare them.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Wadſworth has ſent in his report reſpecting Cape-Cod harbour, a copy of which you will receive herewith; alſo a letter from a Mr. Jacob Bailey, put into my hands by colonel Little. It contains ſome things that may not be unworthy the conſideration of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>We have made good progreſs in the works on Leech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more's point. They would have been finiſhed ere this, but for the ſeverity of the weather, which prevents our people from working.</p>
                     <p>I received a letter from governor Cooke, which expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the fears of the people of Rhode-Iſland, leſt the ſhips, which we had information were ſailed, with ſome troops on board, were deſtined for Newport. I ſent major-gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Lee there, to point out to them ſuch defence as he may think the place capable of. I ſincerely wiſh he may be able to do it with effect, as that place, in its preſent ſtate, is an aſylum for ſuch as are diſaffected to American liberty.</p>
                     <p>Our returns of enliſtments, to this day, amount to eight thouſand five hundred men.</p>

                     <p>I WROTE to you the twenty-fifth inſtant; ſince which I am not honoured with any of your favours. The eſtimate I then incloſed you was calculated to pay the troops, &amp;c. up to the firſt of January. That cannot be done for want of funds in the pay-maſter-general's hands; which cauſes a great murmuring amongſt thoſe who are going off. The monthly expenies of this army amount to near two hundred and ſeventy-five thouſand dollars, which I take the liberty of recommending to the obſervation of Congreſs, that their future remittances may be governed thereby.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="unknown:029737_0067_0FE246FB8B44A8A8"/>
It ſometimes happens that perſons would wiſh to depoſit money in the hands of the pay-maſter-general, for his bills on the treaſury at Philadelphia. He has hitherto declined ſuch offers, not having authority from Congreſs to draw. Would it not be proper to give this power? If it ſhould be approved of, you will pleaſe to point out the mode that the Congreſs would chooſe to have it done in.</p>
                     <p>The clothing ſent to the quarter-maſter-general is not ſufficient to put half our army into regimentals; nor is there a poſſibility of getting any quantity here. I have wrote to general Schuyler, that I wiſh what was lodged at Albany could be ſpared for theſe troops, as general Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery would clothe the men under his command at Montréal. If this can be done, it will be of infinite ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and no time ſhould be loſt in forwarding them to this camp.</p>
                     <p>In forming the regiments for the new eſtabliſhment, I thought it but juſtice to appoint the officers, detached under colonel Arnold, to commiſſions in them. Their abſence at preſent is of very great detriment to the ſervice, eſpecially in recruiting: I would therefore wiſh, if the Congreſs intend raiſing troops in or for Canada, that they could be taken in there. The ſooner I have their opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of this matter, the better, that, if they can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned in Canada, I may appoint officers here to replace them.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed you have a copy of a repreſentation ſent to me by the legiſlative body of this province, reſpecting four companies ſtationed at Braintree, Weymouth, and Hingham. As they were never regimented, and were doing duty at a diſtance from the reſt of the army, I did not know whether to conſider them as a part of it; nor do I think myſelf authoriſed to direct payment for them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the approbation of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>It has been repreſented to me that the free negroes who have ſerved in this army are very much diſſatisfied at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcarded. As it is to be apprehended that they may ſeek employ in the miniſterial army, I have preſumed to depart from the reſolution reſpecting them, and have given licenſe for their being enliſted. If this is diſapprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by Congreſs, I will put a ſtop to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="unknown:029737_0068_0FE2475111CB9A60"/>
* * * I muſt remark that the pay of the aſſiſtant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineers is ſo very ſmall, that we cannot expect men of ſcience will engage in it. Thoſe gentlemen, who are in that ſtation, remained under the expectation that an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional allowance would be made them by the reſpective provinces in which they were appointed, to that allowed by the Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>Captain Freeman arrived this day at camp from Canada. He left Quebec the twenty-fourth ultimo, in conſequence of general Carleton's proclamation which I have the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to ſend you herewith. He ſaw colonel Arnold the twenty-ſixth, and ſays that he was joined at Point-à-trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by general Montgomery, the firſt inſtant;—that they were about two thouſand ſtrong, and were making every preparation for attacking Quebec;—that general Carleton had with him about twelve hundred men, the majority of whom are ſailors;—that it was his opinion the French would give up the place if they get the ſame conditions granted to the inhabitants of Montréal. * * *</p>
                     <p>Captains Semple and Harbeſon take under their care Mr. Kirkland. * * * Captain Mathews and Mr. Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon will accompany them. The two latter were taken priſoners by lord Dunmore, who was ſending them to Boſton, from whence there is little doubt but they would be forwarded to England, to which place I am credibly informed captain Martindale and the crew of the Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington are ſent; alſo colonel Allen, and the priſoners tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with him in Canada. This may account for general Howe's ſilence on the ſubject of an exchange of priſoners mentioned in my letter to him.</p>
                     <p>General Lee is juſt returned from his excurſion to Rhode-Iſland:—he has pointed out the beſt method the iſland would admit of for its defence: he has endeavoured all in his power to make friends of thoſe that were our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies. You have, incloſed, a ſpecimen of his abilities in that way, for your peruſal. I am of opinion that, if the ſame plan was purſued through every province, it would have a very good effect.</p>
                     <p>I have long had it on my mind to mention to Congreſs, that frequent applications had been made to me reſpecting the chaplains' pay, which is too ſmall to encourage men
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:029737_0069_0FE246FE18F32178"/>
of abilities. Some of them, who have left their flocks, are obliged to pay the parſon acting for them more than they receive. I need not point out the great utility of gentlemen whoſe lives and converſation are unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being employed for that ſervice in this army. There are two ways of making it worth the attention of ſuch: one is an advancement of their pay; the other, that one chaplain be appointed to two regiments. This laſt, I think, may be done without inconvenience. I beg leave to recommend this matter to Congreſs, whoſe ſentiments hereon I ſhall impatiently expect.</p>
                     <p>Upon a farther converſation with captain Freeman, he is of opinion that general Montgomery has with him near three thouſand men, including colonel Arnold's. He ſays that lord Pit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> had received repeated orders from his father to return home; in conſequence of which, he had embarked, ſome time in October, with a captain Green who was maſter of a veſſel belonging to Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>By a number of ſalutes in Boſton harbour yeſterday, I fancy admiral Shuldha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Our enliſtments now amount to nine thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe gentlemen who were made priſoners by lord Dunmore, being left deſtitute of money and neceſſaries, I have advanced them a hundred pounds lawful-money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the public, for which I have taken captain Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews's draught on the treaſury of Virginia, which goes incloſed.</p>

                     <p>The reſolution relative to the troops in Boſton, I beg the favour of you, Sir, to aſſure Congreſs ſhall be attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

to be put in execution the firſt moment I ſee a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſucceſs, and in ſuch a way as a council of officers ſhall think moſt likely to produce it: but if this ſhould not happen as ſoon as you may expect or my wiſhes prompt to, I requeſt that Congreſs will be pleaſed to advert to my ſituation, and do me the juſtice to believe, that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and not want of inclination, are the cauſe of delay.</p>
                     <p>It is not in the pages of hiſtory perhaps to furniſh a caſe like ours:—to maintain a poſt within muſket-ſhot of the enemy, for ſix months together, without<note n="*" place="bottom">Left blank in the original to guard againſt the danger of miſcarriage.

                        </gap>, and at the ſame time to diſband one army, and recruit another, within that diſtance of twenty-odd Britiſh regiments,—is more, probably, than ever was attempted. But if we ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as well in the laſt, as we have heretofore in the firſt, I ſhall think it the moſt fortunate event of my whole life.</p>
                     <p>By a very intelligent gentleman, a Mr. Hutchinſon, from Boſton, I learn, that it was admiral Shuldham that came into the harbour on Saturday laſt; that two of the five regiments from Cork are arrived at Halifax; two others have ſailed for Quebec; but what was become of them could not be told:—and the other (the fifty-fifth) has juſt got into Boſton. Certain it is alſo, that the greateſt part of the ſeventeenth regiment is arrived there. Whether we are to conclude from hence that more than five regiments have been ſent out, or that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of the ſeventeenth, arrived at Boſton, are part of the regiments deſtined for Halifax and Quebec, I know not.</p>
                     <p>We alſo learn from this gentleman and others, that the troops, embarked for Halifax (as mentioned in my letter of the ſixteenth) were really deſigned for that place, but recalled from Nantaſket road, upon advice being received of the above regiments there. I am alſo informed of a fleet now getting ready under the convoy of the Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough and Fowey men-of-war,—conſiſting of five tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and two bomb veſſels, with about three hundred marines, and ſeveral flat-bottomed boats. It is whiſpered that they are deſigned for Newport, but generally thought
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:029737_0071_0FE246FF9ED829F8"/>
in Boſton that it is meant for Long-Iſland: and it is probable it will be followed by more troops, as the other tranſports are taking in water,—to lie, as others ſay, in Nantaſket road, to be out of the ice. A large quantity of biſcuit is alſo baking.</p>
                     <p>As the real deſign cannot with certainty be known, I ſubmit it, with all due deference, to the ſuperior judgment of Congreſs, whether it would not be conſiſtent with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to have ſome of the Jerſey troops thrown into New-York, to prevent an evil which would be almoſt irremedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhould it happen,—I mean, the landing of troops at that place, or upon Long-Iſland near it.</p>
                     <p>As it is poſſible you may not yet have received his maj<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty's <hi>"moſt gracious"</hi> ſpeech, I do myſelf the honour to incloſe one of many, which were ſent out of Boſton yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. It is full of * * *, and explicitly holds forth his royal will to be, that vigorous meaſures muſt be purſued to deprive us of our * * *. Theſe meaſures, whatever they be, I hope will be oppoſed by more vigorous ones, and rendered unavailing and fruitleſs, though ſanctioned and authoriſed by the name of majeſty,—a name, which ought to promote the bleſſings of his people, and not their oppreſſion.</p>

                     <p>EVERY account I have out of Boſton confirms the embarkation of troops mentioned in my laſt, which, from the ſeaſon of the year and other circumſtances, muſt be deſtined for ſome expedition to the ſouthward of this. I have therefore thought it prudent to ſend major-general Lee to New-York. I have given him letters recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory to governor Trumbull, and to the committee of ſafety at New-York. I have good hopes that in Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut he will get many volunteers, who (I have ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think) will accompany him on this expedition, without more expenſe to the continent than their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. But ſhould it be otherwiſe, and that they ſhould expect pay, I think it is a trifling conſideration, when put
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:029737_0072_0FE247541B7B2FD0"/>
in competition with the importance of the object, which is to put the city of New-York, with ſuch parts of the North-river and Long-Iſland as to him ſhall ſeem proper, in that ſtate of defence, which the ſeaſon of the year and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will admit of,—ſo as, if poſſible, to prevent the enemy from forming a lodgement in that government, which, I am afraid, contains too many perſons diſaffected to the cauſe of liberty and America. I have alſo wrote to lord Stirling to give him all the aſſiſtance that he can with the troops under his command in the continental ſervice, provided it does not interfere with any orders he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from Congreſs relative to them.</p>
                     <p>I hope the Congreſs will approve of my conduct in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing general Lee upon this expedition:—I am ſure I mean it well; as experience teaches us that it is much eaſier to prevent an enemy from poſting themſelves, than it is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge them after they have got poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>The evening of the eighth inſtant, a party of our men, under the command of major Knoulton, were ordered to go and burn ſome houſes which lay at the foot of Bunker's-hill, and at the head of Charleſtown. They were alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to bring off the guard, which, we expected, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of an officer and thirty men. They croſſed the mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam about half after eight o'clock, and gallantly executed their buſineſs,—having burned eight houſes, and brought with them a ſergeant and four privates of the tenth regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There was but one man more there, who making ſome reſiſtance, they were obliged to diſpatch. The gun that killed him was the only one diſcharged by our men, though ſeveral hundred were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I AM exceedingly ſorry that I am under the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of applying to you, and calling the attention of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to the ſtate of our arms, which is truly alarming.
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:029737_0073_0FE24701236FDE70"/>
Upon the diſſolution of the old army, I was apprehenſive that the new would be deficient in this inſtance: and, that the want might be as inconſiderable as poſſible, I gave it out in orders, that the arms of ſuch men as did not re-enliſt (or ſuch of them as were good) ſhould be retained at the prices which ſhould be affixed by perſons appointed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and value them: and, that we might be ſure of them, I added that there would be a ſtoppage of pay for the months of November and December, from thoſe who ſhould carry their firelocks away without their being firſt examined. I hoped, by theſe precautions, to have procured a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number: but, Sir, I find with much concern, that, from the badneſs of the arms, and the diſobedience of too many in bearing them off without a previous inſpection,—very few were collected. Neither are we to expect that many will be brought in by the new recruits,—the officers, who are out enliſting, having reported that few men who have arms will engage in the ſervice; and that they are under the diſagreeable alternative of taking men without arms, or of getting none. Unhappy ſituation, and much to be deplored!—eſpecially when we have every reaſon to convince us, that we have to contend with a formidable army, well provided of every neceſſary; and that there will be a moſt vigorous exertion of miniſterial vengeance againſt us, as ſoon as they think themſelves in a condition for it. I hope it is in the power of Congreſs to afford us relief:—if it is not, what muſt, what can be done?</p>
                     <p>Our treaſury is almoſt exhauſted, and the demands againſt it very conſiderable. A conſtant ſupply of money, to anſwer every claim and exigency, would much promote the good of the ſervice. In the common affairs of life, it is uſeful: in war, it is abſolutely neceſſary and eſſential. I would beg leave, too, to remind you of the tents, and of their importance,—hoping that, if an opportunity has offered, you have procured them. I fear that our army will not be raiſed to the new eſtabliſhment in any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, if ever: the enliſting goes on ſo very ſlow, that it almoſt ſeems at an end.</p>
                     <p>In my letter of the fourth inſtant, I wrote you that I had received certain intelligence from a Mr. Hutchinſon and others, that two of the five regiments from Cork were
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:029737_0074_0FE2475CE3F15AE0"/>
arrived at Halifax, one at Boſton, and the two others had ſailed for Quebec, and had not been heard of. I am new aſſured (as a matter to be relied on) by four captains of ſhips, who left England about the ſecond of November, and who appear to be men of veracity, that the whole of theſe regiments, (except the two companies that arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Boſton ſome time ago) when they ſailed, were at Milford Haven, where they had been obliged to put in, by a violent ſtorm, the nineteenth of October; that they would not be able to leave it for a conſiderable time, as they were under the neceſſity of repairing their veſſels, and getting ſome new ones taken up. Such is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and contradiction in what I now hear, that it is not poſſible to know what to believe or diſbelieve.</p>
                     <p>I wrote to the general court yeſterday, and to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of New-Hampſhire, immediately upon ſeeing the great deficiency in our arms,—praying that they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt themſelves in the matter, and furniſh me with all in their power. Whether I ſhall get any, or what quantity, I cannot determine, not having received their anſwers. The ſame application will be made to the governments of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut and Rhode-Iſland.</p>
                     <p>I do myſelf the honour to ſend you ſundry newſpapers I received from the above-mentioned captains, as they may be later than any you have ſeen, and contain ſome intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intelligence.</p>

                     <p>TAKING it for granted that general Schuyler has not only informed you of the fall of the brave and much-to-be-lamented general Montgomery, but of the ſituation of our affairs in Canada, (as related by general Wooſter, colonel Arnold, colonel Campbell, and others) I ſhall not take up much more of your time on this ſubject, than is neceſſary to incloſe you a copy of his letter to me, with the reſult thereon, as appears by the council of war, which I immediately ſummoned on the occaſion, and at
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:029737_0075_0FE2470B070A2B78"/>
which Mr. Adams, by my particular deſire, was good enough to attend.</p>
                     <p>It may appear ſtrange, Sir, as I had not men to ſpare from theſe lines, that I ſhould preſume (without firſt ſending to Congreſs, and obtaining an expreſs direction) to recommend to the governments of Maſſachuſetts, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut and New-Hampſhire, to raiſe each a regiment, on the continental account, for this ſervice. I wiſh moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that the urgency of the caſe would have admitted of the delay. I wiſh alſo that the purport of general Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's letter had not, unavoidably as it were, laid me under an indiſpenſable obligation to do it:—for having informed you in his letter (a copy of which he incloſed me) of his dependence on this quarter, for men, I thought you might alſo have ſome reliance on my exertions. This conſideration, added to my fears of the fatal conſequences of delay,—to an information of your having deſigned three thouſand men for Canada,—to a belief, founded chiefly on general Schuyler's letters, that few or none of them were raiſed,—and to my apprehenſions for New-York, which led me to think that no troops could be ſpared from that quarter,—induced me to loſe not a moment's time in throwing in a force there; being well aſſured that general Carleton will improve to the utmoſt the advantages gained, leaving no artifices untried, to fix the Canadians and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians (who, we find, are too well diſpoſed to take part with the ſtrongeſt) in his intereſt.</p>
                     <p>If theſe reaſons are not ſufficient to juſtify my conduct in the opinion of Congreſs,—if the meaſure contravenes any reſolution of theirs, they will pleaſe to countermand the levying and marching of the regiments as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and do me the juſtice to believe that my intentions were good, if my judgment has erred.</p>
                     <p>The Congreſs will pleaſe alſo to obſerve, that the meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of ſupporting our poſts in Canada appeared of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great importance, that the general officers (agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me in ſentiment, and unwilling to lay any burden which can poſſibly be avoided,—although it may turn out an ill-timed piece of parſimony) have reſolved that the three regiments for Canada ſhall be part of the thirteen militia regiments which were requeſted to reinforce this

army,—as appears by the minutes of another council of war, held on the ſixteenth inſtant. I ſhall (being much hurried and fatigued) add no more in this letter, than my duty to Congreſs, and that I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>Since writing the above, I have been informed by a meſſage from the general court of Maſſachuſetts, that they have reſolved upon the raiſing of a regiment for Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada, and appointed the field officers for it, in the weſtern parts of this government.

                     <p>THE commiſſary-general being at length [<hi>recovered</hi>] from along and painful illneſs, I have it in my power to comply with the requiſition of Congreſs, in forwarding an eſtimate of the expenſe attending his office, as alſo that of the quarter-maſter-general.</p>
                     <p>You will pleaſe to obſerve that the commiſſary, by his account of the matter, has entered into no ſpecial agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with any of the perſons he has found occaſion to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, (as thoſe, to whoſe names ſums are annexed, are of their own fixing) but left it to Congreſs to aſcertain their wages. I ſhall ſay nothing therefore on this head, farther than relates to the propoſition of Mr. * * *, to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one eighth for his trouble and the delivery of the other ſeven eighths of proviſions, which to me appears exorbitant in the extreme, however conformable it may be to cuſtom
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:029737_0077_0FE2470CE9A53588"/>
and uſage: I therefore think that reaſonable ſtipends had better be fixed upon. Both the quarter-maſter and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary-generals aſſure me, that they do not employ a ſingle perſon uſeleſsly: and as I have too good an opinion of them to think they would deceive me, I believe them.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall take the liberty, in this place, of recommending the expediency, indeed the abſolute neceſſity, of appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit and proper perſons to ſettle the accounts of this army. To do it with preciſion, requires time, care, and attention: the longer it is left undone, the more intricate they will be, the more liable to error, and difficult to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and rectify;—as alſo the perſons in whoſe hands they are (if diſpoſed to take undue advantage) will be leſs ſubject to detection. I have been as attentive as the nature of my office would admit of, in granting warrants for mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey on the pay-maſter: but it would be abſolutely impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to go into an examination of all the accounts incident to this army, and the vouchers appertaining to them, without devoting ſo large a portion of my time to the buſineſs, as might not only prove injurious, but fatal to it in other reſpects. This ought, in my humble opinion, to be the particular buſineſs of a ſelect committe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, or one appointed by them, who, once in three months at furtheſt, ſhould make a ſettlement with the officers in the different departments.</p>
                     <p>Having met with no encouragement from the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire, from my application for arms, and expecting no better from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut and Rhode-Iſland, I have, as the laſt expedient, ſent one or two officers from each regiment into the country, with money, to try if they can buy. In what manner they ſucceed, Congreſs ſhall be informed as ſoon as they return.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs, in my laſt, would diſcover my motives for ſtrengthening theſe lines with the militia: but whether, as the weather turns out exceedingly mild, inſomuch as to promiſe nothing favourable from ice,—and no appearance of powder,—I ſhall be able to attempt any thing deciſive, time only can determine. No man upon earth wiſhes more ardently to deſtroy the neſt in Boſton, than I do:—no perſon would be willing to go greater lengths than I
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:029737_0078_0FE24760470C5A10"/>
ſhall, to accompliſh it, if it ſhall be thought adviſeable. But if we have neither powder to bombard with, nor ice to paſs on, we ſhall be in no better ſituation than we have been in all the year:—we ſhall be worſe, becauſe their works are ſtronger.</p>
                     <p>I have accounts from Boſton, which I think may be relied on, that general <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>inton, with about four or five hundred men, hath left that place within theſe four days. Whether this is part of the detachment which was mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up (as mentioned in my letter of the fourth inſtant, and then at Nantaſket) or not, is not in my power to ſay. If it is deſigned for New-York or Long-Iſland as ſome think, throwing a body of troops there may prove a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate circumſtance. If they go farther ſouth agreeable to the conjectures of others, I hope there will be men to receive them.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the poſitive aſſertions of the four cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains from Portſmouth, noticed in my letter of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, I am now convinced from ſeveral corroborating circumſtances,—the accounts of deſerters, and of a lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Hill, of lord Percy's regiment, who left Ireland the fifth of November, and was taken by a privateer from Newburyport,—that the ſeventeenth and fifty-fifth regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are arrived at Boſton, and other troops at Halifax, agreeable to the information of Hutchinſon and others. Lieutenant Hill ſays that the tranſports of two regiments only were forced into Milford Haven.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs will think me a little remiſs, I fear, when I inform them that I have done nothing yet towards raiſing the battalion of marines: but I hope to ſtand exculpated from blame, when they hear the reaſon, which was, that already having twenty-ſix incomplete regiments, I thought it would be adding to an expenſe, already great, in officers, to ſet two entire corps of officers on foot, when perhaps we ſhould not add ten men a week by it to our preſent numbers. In this opinion the general officers have concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which induced me to ſuſpend the matter a little long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Our enliſtments, for the two laſt weeks, have not amounted to a thouſand men, and are diminiſhing. The regiment for Canada (it is thought) will ſoon be filled, as
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:029737_0079_0FE2470E6E5E21E8"/>
the men are to chooſe all but their field officers, who are appointed by the court.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday evening, thirteen of the Caghnewaga In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians arrived here on a viſit. I ſhall take care that they be ſo entertained during their ſtay, that they may return impreſſed with ſentiments of friendſhip for us, and alſo of our great ſtrength. One of them is colonel Louis, who honoured me with a viſit once before.</p>

                     <p>YOUR favours of the ſixth and twentieth inſtant I received yeſterday, with the ſeveral reſolves of Congreſs alluded to; for which I return you my thanks.</p>
                     <p>Knowing the great importance Canada will be of to us in the preſent intereſting conteſt, and the relief our friends there ſtand in need of, I ſhould be happy, were it in my power to detach a battalion from this camp: but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done. On the nineteeth inſtant, I had the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to write to you, which will fully convey the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a council of war, and the ſentiments of the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al officers here, as to the propriety and expediency of ſending troops from theſe lines, for the defence of which we have been and now are obliged to call in the militia;—to which I beg leave to refer you. You may reſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that my endeavours and exertions ſhall not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſtimulate the governments of Connecticut and New-Hampſhire to raiſe and forward reinforcements as faſt as poſſible; nor in any other inſtance that will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the expedition.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall, in obedience to the order of Congreſs, though interdicted by general Howe, propoſe an exchange of governor Skene for Mr. Lovell and family, and ſhall be happy to have an opportunity of putting this deſerving man (who has diſtinguiſhed his fidelity and regard to his country to be too great for perſecution and cruelty to overcome) in any poſt agreeable to his wiſhes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="unknown:029737_0080_0FE24761CCEC0390"/>
I do not know that there is any particular rank annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the office of aide-de-camp. Generally they are captains, and rank as ſuch: but higher rank is often given on account of particular merit and particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Aides to the king have the rank of colonels. Whether any diſtinction ſhould be made between thoſe of your commander-in-chief and the other generals, I really know not:—I think there ought.</p>
                     <p>You may rely that Conolly had inſtructions conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his ſaddle. Mr. * * * who was one of lord Dunmore's family, and another gentleman who wiſhes his name not to be mentioned, ſaw them caſed in tin, put in the tree, and covered over. He probably has exchanged his ſaddle, or withdrew the papers when it was mended, as you conjecture. Thoſe that have been diſcovered are ſufficiently bad; but I doubt not of the others being worſe, and containing more diabolical and extenſive plans. I hope he will be taken proper care of, and meet with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards equal to his merits.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall appoint officers in the places of thoſe who are in Canada, as I am fully perſuaded they will wiſh to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue there, for making our conqueſt complete in that quarter. I wiſh their bravery and valour may be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſmiles of fortune.</p>
                     <p>It gives me great pleaſure to hear of the meaſures Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs are taking for manufacturing powder. I hope their endeavours will be crowned with ſucceſs. I too well know and regret the want of it. It is ſcarcely poſſible to deſcribe the diſadvantages an army muſt labour under, when not provided with a ſufficient ſupply of this nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary. It may ſeem ſtrange, that, after having received about eleven tons, added to about five tons which I found here, and no general action has happened, we ſhould be ſo deficient in this article, and require more. But you will pleaſe to conſider, that, beſides its being in its nature ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to waſte, and (whilſt the men lay in bad tents) una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably damaged by ſevere and heavy rains (which could not have been prevented, unleſs it had been entirely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the men, and an attack hazarded againſt us without ammunition in their hands)—the armed veſſels, our own occaſional firings, and ſome ſmall ſupplies I have
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:029737_0081_0FE2470FF0EF05F8"/>
been obliged to afford the ſea-port towns threatened with deſtruction,—to which may be added the ſupply to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, and going off of the old troops,—have occaſioned, and ever will, a large conſumption of it, and waſte, in ſpite of all the care in the world. The king's troops never have leſs than ſixty rounds a man in their poſſeſſion, independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of their ſtores. To ſupply an army of twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men in this manner, would take near four hundred barrels, allowing nothing for ſtores, artillery, &amp;c. I have been always afraid to place more than twelve or fifteen rounds at a time in the hands of our men, leſt, any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent happening to it, we ſhould be left deſtitute, and be undone. I have been thus particular, not only to ſhew our poverty, but to exculpate myſelf from even a ſuſpicion of unneceſſary waſte.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall inform the pay-maſter-general of the reſolution of Congreſs reſpecting his draughts, and the mode and account of them.</p>
                     <p>The companies at Chelſea and Malden are and have always been regimented. It was not my intention to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place with continental troops the independent companies at Hingham, Weymouth and Braintree. Theſe places are expoſed, but not more than Cape-Ann, Beverly, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Marblehead, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Is it the intention of Congreſs that the officers of the army ſhould pay poſtage? They are not exempted by the reſolve of the ninth inſtant.</p>
                     <p>The Congreſs will be pleaſed, I have no doubt, to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that the five hundred thouſand dollars, now coming, are but little more than enough to bring us up to the firſt day of this month; that to-morrow will be the laſt of it; and, by their reſolves, the troops are to be paid monthly.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh it was in my power to furniſh Congreſs with ſuch a general as they deſire, to ſend to Canada. Since the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy reverſe of our affairs in that quarter, general Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler has informed me, that, though he had thoughts of declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſervice before, he would now act. My letter of the eleventh will inform them of general Lee's being at New-York. He will be ready to obey their orders, ſhould they incline to ſend him: but, if I am not greatly deceived, he or ſome other ſpirited able officer will be wanted there

in the ſpring, if not ſooner; as we have undoubted intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that general Clinton has ſailed with ſome troops. The reports of their number are various, from between four and five hundred to nineteen companies of grenadiers and light infantry. It is alſo imagined that the regiments, which were to ſail the firſt of December, are intended for that place or Virginia. General Putnam is a moſt valuable man, and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He is a young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er major-general than Mr. Schuyler, who, as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, having determined to continue in the ſervice, will, I expect, repair into Canada. A copy of my letter to him, on this and other ſubjects, I incloſe you, as it will explain my motives for not ſtopping the regiments from theſe gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments.</p>
                     <p>When captain Cockran arrives, I will give him every aſſiſtance in my power, in obedience to the orders of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs: but I fear it will be the means of laying up our own veſſels, as theſe people will not bear the diſtinction. Should this be the conſequence, it will be highly preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to us, as we ſometimes pick up their proviſion-veſſels, and may continue to diſtreſs them in this way.</p>
                     <p>Laſt week captain Manly took a ſhip and a brig bound to Boſton from Whitehaven, with coals chiefly, and ſome potatoes, for the army. I have, for his great vigilance and induſtry, appointed him commodore of our little ſquad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron; and he now hoiſts his flag on board the ſchooner Hancock.</p>
                     <p>I congratulate you upon the recovery of Smith, and am exceedingly glad to hear of the meaſures Congreſs are tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the general defence of the continent. The clouds thicken faſt: where they will burſt, I know not: but we ſhould be armed at all points.</p>
                     <p>I have not ſucceeded in my applications to theſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for arms. They have returned for anſwer, that they cannot furniſh any. Whether I ſhall be more lucky in the laſt reſource left me in this quarter, I cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, having not received returns from the officers ſent out to purchaſe of the people. I greatly fear that but very few will be procured in this way, as they are exceedingly ſcarce, and but a ſmall part of what there are, fit for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

When they make their report, you ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                     <p>The quarter-maſter-general has juſt received from gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Schuyler clothing for the ſoldiery, amounting to about ſeventeen hundred pounds York currency. It has come very ſeaſonably, as they are in great want, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute a little to their relief.</p>
                     <p>Since writing the above, I ſaw Mr. * * *, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning that nothing had been found in the tree of Conol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's ſaddle, he told me there had been a miſtake in the matter; that the inſtructions were artfully concealed on the two pieces of wood which are on the mail-pillion of his portmanteau-ſaddle; that, by order of lord Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, he ſaw them contrived for the purpoſe, the papers put in, and firſt covered with tin, and over that with a waxed canvaſs cloth. He is ſo exceedingly pointed and clear in his information, that I have no doubt of its being true. I could wiſh them to be diſcovered, as I think they contain ſome curious and extraordinary plans.</p>
                     <p>In my letter of the twenty-fourth inſtant I mentioned the arrival of thirteen of our Caghnewaga friends. They honoured me with a talk to-day, as did three of the tribes of the St. John's and Pafmiquoddi Indians;—copies of which I beg leave to incloſe you. I ſhall write to general Schuyler reſpecting the tender of ſervice made by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and not to call for their aſſiſtance, unleſs he ſhall at any time want it, or be under the neceſſity of doing it to prevent their taking the ſide of our enemies.</p>
                     <p>I had the honour of writing you on the nineteenth of November, and then I informed you of having engaged two perſons to go to Nova-Scotia on the buſineſs recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in your letter of the tenth; and alſo that the ſtate of the army would not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I think it would be adviſeable to raiſe them in the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of this government. If it is attempted, it muſt
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029737_0084_0FE2476BEAAE4500"/>
be by people from the country. A colonel * * * and a captain * * * have been with me:—they think the men neceſſary may be eaſily engaged there, and the meaſure prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable: provided there are not more than two hundred Britiſh troops at Halifax, they are willing and ready to embark in the matter, upon the terms mentioned in their plan, which I incloſe you. I would wiſh you to advert to the conſiderations inducing them to the expedition, as I am not without apprehenſion, ſhould it be undertaken upon their plan, that the innocent and guilty will be involved in one common ruin. I preſume they do not expect to receive more than the five or ten thouſand pounds mentioned in their ſcheme, and to be at every expenſe. If we had men to ſpare, it might be undertaken for leſs than either, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Perhaps, if Congreſs do not adopt their propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they will undertake to raiſe men for that particular purpoſe, who may be diſbanded as ſoon as it is effected, and upon the ſame terms that are allowed the continental troops in general. Whatever may be the determination of Congreſs upon the ſubject, you will pleaſe to communicate it to me immediately: for the ſeaſon moſt favourable for the enterpriſe is advancing faſt; and we may expect in the ſpring, that there will be more troops there, and the meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure be more difficult to execute.</p>

                     <p>THE purport of this letter will be directed to a ſingle object: through you, I mean to lay it before Congreſs; and, at the ſame time that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I beg their ſerious attention to the ſubject, to aſk pardon for intruding an opinion, not only unaſked, but, in ſome meaſure, repugnant to their reſolves.</p>

                        </gap>mited enliſtment of troops are too apparent to thoſe who are eye-witneſſes of them, to render any animadverſions neceſſary: but to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen at a diſtance, whoſe attention is engroſſed by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand important objects, the caſe may be otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>That this cauſe precipitated the fate of the brave and much-to-be-lamented general Montgomery, and brought on
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029737_0085_0FE2471B52DC04A8"/>
the defeat which followed thereupon, I have not the moſt diſtant doubt: for, had he not been apprehenſive of the troops leaving him at ſo important a criſis, but continued the blockade of Quebec, a capitulation (from the beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts I have been able to collect) muſt inevitably have followed. And that we were not at one time obliged to diſpute theſe lines under diſadvantageous circumſtances (proceeding from the ſame cauſe, to wit, the troops diſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelves before the militia could be got in) is to me a matter of wonder and aſtoniſhment: and proves that general Howe was either unacquainted with our ſituation, or reſtrained by his inſtructions from putting any thing to a hazard till his reinforcements ſhould arrive.</p>
                     <p>The inſtance of general Montgomery—(I mention it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a ſtriking one; for a number of others might be adduced)—proves, that inſtead of having men to take advantage of circumſtances, you are in a manner compelled, right or wrong, to make circumſtances yield to a ſecondary conſideration. Since the firſt of December, I have been deviſing every means in my power to ſecure theſe encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and, though I am ſenſible that we never have, ſince that period, been able to act upon the offenſive, and at times not in a condition to defend, yet the coſt of marching home one ſet of men,—bringing in another,—the havoc and waſte occaſioned by the firſt,—the repairs neceſſary for the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond, with a thouſand incidental charges and inconveniences which have ariſen, and which it is ſcarce poſſible either to recollect or deſcribe—amount to near as much, as the keeping up a reſpectable body of troops the whole time, ready for any emergency, would have done. To this may be added, that you never can have a well-diſciplined army.</p>
                     <p>To bring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

To bring them under proper diſcipline and ſubordination, not only requires time, but is a work of great difficulty, and, in this army where there is ſo little diſtinction between the officers and ſoldiers, requires an uncommon degree of attention. To expect then the ſame ſervice from raw and undiſciplined recruits as from veteran ſoldiers, is to expect what never did and perhaps never will happen. Men who are familiariſed to danger meet it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhrinking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas thoſe who have never ſeen ſervice

The two firſt are common to the untutored and the diſciplined ſoldier: but the latter moſt obviouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes the one from the other. A coward, when taught to believe, that, if he breaks his ranks and abandons his colours, he will be puniſhed with death by his own party—will take his chance againſt the enemy: but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Again, men of a day's ſtanding will not look forward: and from experience we find, that, as the time approaches for their diſcharge, they grow careleſs of their arms, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, camp utenſils, &amp;c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ay, even the barracks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have felt uncommon marks of wanton depredation, and lay us under freſh trouble and additional expenſe in providing for every freſh ſet, when we find it next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to procure ſuch articles as are abſolutely neceſſary in the firſt inſtance. To this may be added the ſeaſoning which new recruits muſt have to a camp, and the loſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent thereupon. But this is not all. Men, engaged for a ſhort limited time only, have the officers too much in their power: for, to obtain a degree of popularity in order to induce a ſecond enliſtment, a kind of familiarity takes place, which brings on a rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>To go into an enumeration of all the evils we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in this late great change of the army, and the expenſes incidental to it—to ſay nothing of the hazard we have run, and muſt run, between the diſcharging of one army and enliſtment of another, unleſs an enormous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of militia is incurred—would greatly exceed the bounds of a letter. What I have already taken the liberty of ſaying will ſerve to convey a general idea of the matter; and therefore I ſhall, with all due deference, take the freedom to give it as my opinion, that, if the Congreſs have any reaſon to believe that there will be occaſion for
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029737_0087_0FE2471CD698B2D0"/>
troops another year, and conſequently of another enliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they would ſave money, and have infinitely better troops, if they were, even at a bounty of twenty, thirty, or more dollars, to engage the men already enliſted (till Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary next) and ſuch others as may be wanted to complete the eſtabliſhment, for and during the war. I will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſay that the men can be had upon theſe terms: but I am ſatisfied that it will never do to let the matter alone, as it was laſt year, till the time of ſervice was near expiring. The hazard is too great in the firſt place:—in the next, the trouble and perplexity of diſbanding one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and raiſing another at the ſame inſtant, and in ſuch a critical ſituation as the laſt was, is ſcarcely in the power of words to deſcribe, and ſuch as no man, who has experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced it once, will ever undergo again.</p>
                     <p>If Congreſs ſhould differ from me in ſentiment upon this point, I have only to beg that they will do me the juſtice to believe, that I have nothing more in view than what to me appears neceſſary to advance the public weal, although in the firſt inſtance it will be attended with a capital ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe;—and that I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

She is one of the tranſports in the miniſterial ſervice. The captain ſays that he was at Halifax the ſeventeenth of January, and that general Maſſey was arrived there with two regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from Ireland.</p>
                     <p>The different prizes were all libelled immediately on the receipt of the reſolves of Congreſs pointing out the mode; but none of them yet brought to trial, owing to a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:029737_0088_0FE2476EF390AF00"/>
the law paſſed in this province, and the reſolutions of Congreſs. The general court are making an amendment to their law, by which the difficulties that now occur will be removed, as I underſtand it is to be made conformable to your reſolves. The unavoidable delay attending the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the captures to trial is grievouſly complained of by the maſters of theſe veſſels, as well as the captors. Many of the former have applied for liberty to go away without waiting the deciſion—which I have granted them.</p>
                     <p>I beg leave to recall the attention of Congreſs to their appointing a commiſſary in theſe parts, to attend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of neceſſaries for the priſoners who are diſperſed in theſe provinces. Complaints are made by ſome of them, that they are in want of bedding and many other things. As I underſtand that Mr. Franks has undertaken that buſineſs, I wiſh he was ordered to ſend a deputy immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to ſee that the priſoners get what is allowed them by Congreſs; alſo to ſupply the officers with money as they may have occaſion. It would ſave me much time and much trouble.</p>
                     <p>There are yet but few companies of the militia come in. This delay will, I am much afraid, fruſtrate the intention of their being called upon, as the ſeaſon is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The demands of the army were ſo very preſſing before your laſt remittance came to hand, that I was under the neceſſity of borrowing twenty-five thouſand pounds lawful money from this province. They very cheerfully lent it, and paſſed a vote for as much more, if required. I have not repaid the ſum borrowed, as I may ſtand in need of it before the arrival of another ſupply, which the demands of the commiſſary-general, quarter-maſter-general, and paying off the arrearages, will very ſoon require.</p>
                     <p>Your eſteemed favour of the twenty-ninth ultimo is juſt come to hand. It makes me very happy to find my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to hath met the approbation of Congreſs. I am entirely of your opinion, that, ſhould an accommodation take place, the terms will be ſevere or favourable in proportion to our ability to reſiſt, and that we ought to be on a reſpectable footing to receive their armaments in the ſpring. But how far we ſhall be provided with the means, is a matter I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs

not to know, under my preſent unhappy want of arms, ammunition, and,. I may add, men—as our regiments are very incomplete. The recruiting goes on very ſlow, and will, I apprehend, be more ſo, if for other ſervice the men receive a bounty, and none is given here.</p>
                     <p>I have tried every method I could think of, to procure arms for our men. They really are not to be had in theſe governments (belonging to the public;) and if ſome meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od is not fallen upon, in the ſouthern governments, to ſupply us, we ſhall be in a diſtreſſed ſituation for want of them. There are near two thouſand men now in camp without firelocks. I have wrote to the committee of New-York this day, requeſting them to ſend me thoſe arms which were taken from the diſaffected in that government. The Congreſs intereſting themſelves in this requeſt will doubtleſs have a good effect. I have ſent officers into the country, with money to purchaſe arms in the different towns. Some have returned, and brought in a few:—many are ſtill out:—what their ſucceſs will be, I cannot determine.</p>
                     <p>I was in great hopes that the expreſſes, reſolved to be eſtabliſhed between this place and Philadelphia, would ere now have been fixed. It would, in my opinion, rather ſave than increaſe the expenſe; as many horſes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by one man coming the whole way.

I ſhould have paid them in the ſame manner I did the reſt of the

army, had I not been prevented by the colonels, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their inclination to receive the whole at once upon their return home at the expiration of ſervice, as was cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary in their colony. For this reaſon I never included them in my eſtimates of money, and have made no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for their payment, always imagining that, whatever payments the colony made them, Congreſs would apply to their credit in the general account againſt the United Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onies, or refund upon application.</p>

                     <p>THROUGH you, I beg leave to lay before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the incloſed letter from lord Drummond to general Robertſon, which came to my hands a few days ago in order to be ſent into Boſton.</p>
                     <p>As I never heard of his lordſhip being veſted with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to treat with Congreſs upon the ſubject of our grievances, nor of his having laid any propoſitions before them for an accommodation, I confeſs it ſurpriſed me much, and led me to form various conjectures of his motives, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed application to general Howe and admiral Shuldham for a paſſport for the ſafe-conduct of ſuch deputies as Congreſs might appoint for negociating terms of reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Great Britain and us. Whatever his intentions are, however benevolent his deſigns may be, I confeſs that his letter has embarraſſed me much; and I am not without ſuſpicion of its meaning more than the generous purpoſes it profeſſes. I ſhould ſuppoſe, that, if the mode for negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which he points out, ſhould be adopted (which I hope will never be thought of) it ought to have been fixed and ſettled previous to any application of this ſort; and at beſt, that his conduct in this inſtance is premature and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious, and leading to conſequences of a fatal and injurious nature to the rights of this country. His zeal and deſire perhaps of an amicable and conſtitutional adjuſtment's tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place may have ſuggeſted and precipitated the meaſure. Be that as it may, I thought it of too much importance, to ſuffer it to go in without having the expreſs direction of
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:029737_0091_0FE2472568D03A18"/>
Congreſs for that purpoſe; and that it was my indiſpenſable duty to tranſmit them the original, to make ſuch interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and inferences as they may think right.</p>
                     <p>Meſſrs. Willard and Child, who were ſent to Nova-Scotia in purſuance of the reſolve of Congreſs, have juſt returned, and made their report, which I do myſelf the honour to incloſe you. They have not anſwered the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of their commiſſion by any means, as they only went a little way into that country, and found their intelligence upon the information of others. You will ſee the reaſons they aſſign in excuſe or juſtification of their conduct, in the report itſelf.</p>
                     <p>Laſt night a party of regulars, ſaid to be about five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, landed on Dorcheſter neck, and burned ſome of the houſes there, which were of no value to us; nor would they have been, unleſs we take poſt there: they then might be of ſome ſervice. A detachment went after them as ſoon as the fire was diſcovered: but, before it could arrive, they had executed their plan, and made their retreat.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed is a letter for David Franks, eſquire, from Mr. Chamier in Boſton, upon the ſubject of victualling ſuch of the king's troops as may be priſoners within the limits of his contract, which I beg the favour of you to deliver him, and that proper agents may be appointed by him, to ſee that it is done. I could wiſh, too, that Congreſs would fall upon ſome mode for ſupplying the officers with ſuch money as they may really ſtand in need of, and depute proper perſons for that purpoſe, and furniſhing the privates with ſuch clothing as may be abſolutely neceſſary. I am appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and wearied by their repeated requeſts. In ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I have deſired the committees to give the priſoners within their appointments what they ſhould judge abſolutely neceſſary for their ſupport—as the only means in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of relieving the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> diſtreſs. But I imagine, that, if there were perſons to ſuperintend this buſineſs, their wants would be better attended to, and many exorbitant charges prevented and ſaved to the continent; and the whole would then be brought into a proper account.</p>

                     <p>THE late freezing weather having formed ſome pretty ſtrong ice from Dorcheſter point to Boſton neck, and from Roxbury to the Common, thereby affording a more expanded and conſequently a leſs dangerous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the town, I could not help thinking,—notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the militia were not all come in, and we had little or no powder to begin our operation by a regular cannonade or bombardment,—that a bold and reſolute a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ault upon the troops in Boſton with ſuch men as we had (for it could not take many men to guard our own lines at a time when the enemy were attacked in all quarters) might be crowned with ſucceſs: and therefore, ſeeing no certain proſpect of a ſupply of powder on the one hand, and a certain diſſolution of the ice on the other, I called the general officers together, for their opinion, agreeably to the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ove of Congreſs, of the twenty-ſecond of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</p>
                     <p>The reſult will appear in the incloſed council of war; and, being almoſt unanimous, I muſt ſuppoſe it to be right; although, from a thorough conviction of the neceſſity of attempting ſomething againſt the miniſterial troops before a reinforcement ſhould arrive, and while we were favoured with the ice, I was not only ready, but willing, and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of making the aſſault, under a firm hope (if the men would have ſtood by me) of a favourable iſſue, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the enemy's advantage of ground, artillery, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps the irkſomeneſs of my ſituation may have given different ideas to me, than thoſe which influenced the gentlemen I conſulted, and might have inclined me to put more to the hazard than was conſiſtent with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:—if it had, I am not ſenſible of it, as I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give it all the conſideration that a matter of ſuch importance required. True it is, and I cannot help ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, that I have many diſagreeable ſenſations on account of my ſituation: for, to have the eyes of the whole continent fixed with anxious expectation of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome great event,—and to be reſtrained in every military operation, for want of the neceſſary means of carrying it on,—is not very pleaſing, eſpecially as the
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:029737_0093_0FE2472889FCE668"/>
means uſed to conceal my weakneſs from the enemy, conceal it alſo from our friends, and add to their wonder.</p>
                     <p>I do not utter this by way of complaint. I am ſenſible that all that the Congreſs can do, they have done; and I ſhould feel moſt powerfully the weight of conſcious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude were I not to acknowledge this. But as we have accounts of the arrival of powder in captain Maſon, I would beg to have it ſent on in the moſt expeditious manner: otherwiſe we not only loſe all chance of the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efits reſulting from the ſeaſon, but of the militia, who are brought in at a moſt enormous expenſe, upon a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we ſhould, long ere this, have been amply ſupplied with powder, under the contracts entered into with the committee of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>The militia, contrary to an expreſs requiſition, are come and coming in without ammunition. To ſupply them alone with twenty-four rounds (which is leſs, by three fifths, than the regulars are ſerved with) will take between fifty and ſixty barrels of powder; and to complete the other troops to the like quantity, will take near as much more, and leave in ſtore not more than about ſixty barrels, beſides a few rounds of cannon cartridges ready filled for uſe. This, Sir, Congreſs may be aſſured, is a true ſtate of our powder, and will, I hope, bear ſome teſtimony of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity for action in ſuch a way as may do any eſſential ſervice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>February</hi> 21.—When I began this letter, I propoſed to have ſent it by expreſs. But recollecting that all my late letters have been as expreſſive of my want of powder and arms as I could paint them, and that Mr. Hooper was to ſet off in a day or two, I thought it unneceſſary to run the continent to the expenſe of an expreſs, merely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what I had ſo often done before, when I am certain that Congreſs, knowing our neceſſities, will delay no time that can poſſibly be avoided in ſupplying them.</p>

                     <p>I HAD the honour of addreſſing you on the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and twenty-firſt inſtant, by Mr. Hooper; ſince which, nothing material has occurred.</p>
                     <p>We are making every neceſſary preparation for taking poſſeſſion of Dorcheſter heights as ſoon as poſſible, with a view of drawing the enemy out. How far our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be anſwered, time only can determine: but I ſhould think, if any thing will induce them to hazard an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, it will be our attempting to fortify theſe heights; as, on that event's taking place, we ſhall be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a great part of the town and almoſt the whole har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and to make them rather diſagreeable than otherwiſe, provided we can get a ſufficient ſupply of what we greatly want.</p>
                     <p>Within theſe three or four days, I have received ſundry accounts from Boſton, of ſuch movements there—(ſuch as taking the mortars from Bunker's hill—the putting them, with ſeveral pieces of heavy ordnance, on board of ſhip, with a quantity of bedding—the ſhips all taking in water—the baking a large quantity of biſcuit, &amp;c.)—as to indicate an embarkation of the troops from thence. A Mr. Ides, who came out yeſterday, ſays that the inhabitants of the town generally believe that they are about to remove either to New-York or Virginia, and that every veſſel in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour on Tueſday laſt was taken up for government's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and two months' pay advanced them. Whether they really intend to embark, or whether the whole is a feint, is impoſſible for me to tell. However I have thought it expedient to ſend an expreſs to general Lee, to inform him of it—(in order that he may not be taken by ſurpriſe, if their deſtination ſhould be againſt New-York)—and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued him on to you. If they do embark, I think the poſſeſſing themſelves of that place, and of the North-river, is the object they have in view, thereby ſecuring the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with Canada, and rendering the intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:029737_0095_0FE2472A0C4B2010"/>
the northern and ſouthern United Colonies exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly precarious and difficult. To prevent them from ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting their plan, is a matter of the higheſt importance, and will require a large and reſpectable army, and the moſt vigilant and judicious exertions.</p>
                     <p>Since I wrote by Mr. Hooper, ſome ſmall parcels of powder have arrived from Connecticut, which will give us a little aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>On Thurſday night a party of our men at Roxbury made the enemy's out-centries, conſiſting of a corporal and two privates, priſoners, without firing a gun or giving the leaſt alarm.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall be as attentive to the enemy's motions as I can, and obtain all the intelligence in my power; and, if I find them embark, ſhall in the moſt expeditious manner detach a part of the light troops to New-York, and repair thither myſelf if circumſtances ſhall require it. I ſhall be better able to judge what to do, when the matter happens. At preſent, I can only ſay that I will do every thing that ſhall appear proper and neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Your letter of the twelfth inſtant, by colonel Bull, came to hand yeſterday evening: and I ſhall, agreeable to your recommendation, pay proper notice to him. The ſupply of caſh came very ſeaſonably, as our treaſury was juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and nothing can be done here without it.</p>

                     <p>ON the twenty-ſixth ultimo I had the honour of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing you, and then mentioned that we were making prep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arations for taking poſſeſſion of Dorcheſter heights. I now beg leave to inform you, that, a council of general officers having determined a previous bombardment and cannonade expedient and proper, in order to haraſs the enemy and divert their attention from that quarter—on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday nights laſt, we carried
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:029737_0096_0FE2477D22F02EF0"/>
them on from our poſts at Coble-hill, Leechmore's-point, and Lam's-dam. Whether they did the enemy any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and what injury, I have not yet heard, but have the pleaſure to acquaint you that they greatly facilitated our ſchemes, and would have been attended with ſucceſs equal to our moſt ſanguine expectations, had it not been for the unlucky burſting of two thirteen, and three ten-inch mortars, among which was the braſs one taken in the ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance brig. To what cauſe to attribute this misfortune, I know not—whether to any defect in them, or to the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the bombardiers. But to return—on Monday evening, as ſoon as our firing commenced, a conſiderable detachment of our men, under the command of brigadier-general Thomas, croſſed the neck, and took poſſeſſion of the two hills, without the leaſt interruption or annoyance from the enemy; and by their great activity and induſtry, before the morning, advanced the works ſo far as to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure againſt their ſhot. They are now going on with ſuch expedition, that in a little time I hope they will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, and enable our troops ſtationed there to make a vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orous and obſtinate ſtand. During the whole cannonade, which was inceſſant the laſt two nights, we were fortunate enough to loſe but two men—one, a lieutenant, by a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ball's taking off his thigh—the other, a private, by the exploſion of a ſhell, which alſo ſlightly wounded four or five more.</p>
                     <p>Our taking poſſeſſion of Dorcheſter heights is only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to taking poſt on Nuke-hill, and the points oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite the ſouth end of Boſton. It was abſolutely neceſſary that they ſhould be previouſly fortified, in order to cover and command them. As ſoon as the works on the former are finiſhed and complete, meaſures will be immediately adopted for ſecuring the latter, and making them as ſtrong and defenſible as we can. Their contiguity to the enemy will make them of much importance, and of great ſervice to us.</p>
                     <p>As mortars are eſſential, and indiſpenſably neceſſary for carrying on our operations, and for the proſecution of our plans, I have applied to two furnaces to have ſome thirteen-inch ones caſt with all expedition imaginable, and am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to hope, from the accounts I have had, that they
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:029737_0097_0FE2472C92CFEB00"/>
will be able to do it. When they are done, and a proper ſupply of powder obtained, I flatter myſelf, from the poſts we have juſt taken and are about to take, that it will be in our power to force the miniſterial troops to an attack, or to diſpoſe of them in ſome way that will be of advantage to us. I think from theſe poſts they will be ſo galled and annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they muſt either give us battle or quit their preſent poſſeſſions. I am reſolved that nothing on my part ſhall be wanting, to effect the one or the other.</p>
                     <p>It having been the general opinion that the enemy would attempt to diſlodge our people from the hills, and force their works as ſoon as they were diſcovered, which proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly might have brought on a general engagement,—it was thought adviſeable that the honourable council ſhould be applied to, to order in the militia from the neighbouring and adjacent towns. I wrote to them on the ſubject, which they moſt readily complied with: and, in juſtice to the militia, I cannot but inform you that they came in at the appointed time, and manifeſted the greateſt alertneſs, and determined reſolution to have acted like men engaged in the cauſe of freedom.</p>
                     <p>When the enemy firſt diſcovered our works in the morning, they ſeemed to be in great confuſion, and, from their movements, to have intended an attack. It is much to be wiſhed that it had been made: the event, I think, muſt have been fortunate, and nothing leſs than ſucceſs and victory on our ſide, as our officers and men appeared impatient for the appeal, and to have poſſeſſed the moſt animated ſentiments and determined reſolution.</p>
                     <p>On Tueſday evening a conſiderable number of their troops embarked on board of their tranſports, and fell down to the caſtle, where part of them landed before dark. One or two of the veſſels got a-ground, and were fired at by our people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> field-piece, but without any dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. What was the deſign of this embarkation and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have not been able to learn. It would ſeem as if they meant an attack; for it is moſt probable, that, if they make one on our works at Dorcheſter at this time, they will firſt go to the caſtle, and come from thence. If ſuch was their deſign, a violent ſtorm that night, and which laſted till eight o'clock the next day, rendered the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution

of it impracticable. It carried one or two of their veſſels a-ſhore, which have ſince got off.</p>
                     <p>In caſe the miniſterial troops had made an attempt to diſlodge our men from Dorcheſter hills, and the number detached upon the occaſion had been ſo great as to have afforded a probability of a ſucceſsful attack's being made upon Boſton,—on a ſignal given from Roxbury for that purpoſe, agreeable to a ſettled and concerted plan, four thouſand choſen men, who were held in readineſs, were to have embarked at the mouth of Cambridge river, in two diviſions, the firſt under the command of brigadier-general Sullivan, the ſecond under brigadier-general Greene,—the whole to have been commanded by major-general Putnam. The firſt diviſion was to land at the powder-houſe, and gain poſſeſſion of Beacon-hill and Mount-Horam,—the ſecond at Barton's point or a little ſouth of it, and, after ſecuring that poſt, to join the other diviſion, and force the enemy's gates and works at the neck, for letting in the Roxbury troops. Three floating batteries were to have preceded, and gone in front of the other boats, and kept up a heavy fire on that part of the town were our men were to land.</p>
                     <p>How far our views would have ſucceeded, had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offered for attempting the execution, is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to ſay; nothing leſs than experiment could determine with preciſion. The plan was thought to be well digeſted; and, as far as I could judge from the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and alacrity which diſtinguiſhed the officers and men who were to engage in the enterpriſe, I had reaſon to hope for a favourable and happy iſſue.</p>
                     <p>The militia who were ordered in from the adjacent towns brought with them three days' proviſion. They were only called upon to act under the idea of an attack's being immediately made, and were all diſcharged this afternoon.</p>
                     <p>I beg leave to remind Congreſs that three major-gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erals are eſſential and neceſſary for this army; and that by general Lee's being called from hence to the command in Canada, the left diviſion is without one. I hope they will fill up the vacancy by the appointment of another. General Thomas is the firſt brigadier, ſtands fair in point

of reputation, and is eſteemed a brave and good officer. If he is promoted, there will be a vacancy in the briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier-generals, which it will be neceſſary to ſupply by the appointment of ſome other gentleman that ſhall be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Congreſs: but juſtice requires me to mention that William Thompſon, eſquire, of the rifle regiment, is the firſt colonel in this department, and, as far as I have had an opportunity of judging, is a good officer and a man of courage. What I have ſaid of theſe two gentlemen, I conceived to be my duty, at the ſame time acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whatever promotions are made will be ſatisfactory to me.</p>

                        </gap>.—Yeſterday evening, a captain Irvine, who eſcaped from Boſton the night before with ſix of his crew, came to head-quarters, and gave the following intelligence:—"That our bombardment and cannonade cauſed a great deal of ſurpriſe and alarm in town, as many of the ſoldiery ſaid they never heard or thought we had mortars of ſhells;—that ſeveral of the officers acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they were well and properly directed; that they made much diſtreſs and confuſion;—that the cannon-ſhot, for the greateſt part, went through the houſes; and he was told that one took off the legs and arms of ſix men lying in the barracks on the neck;—that a ſoldier, who came from the lines there on Tueſday morning, informed him that twenty men had been wounded the night before:—(it was reported that others were alſo hurt, and one of the light-horſe torn to pieces by the exploſion of a ſhell: this was afterwards contradicted)—that, early on Tueſday morning, admiral Shuldham, diſcovering the works our people were throwing up on Dorcheſter heights, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent an expreſs to general Howe, to inform him that it was neceſſary they ſhould be attacked and diſlodged from thence, or he would be under the neceſſity of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the ſhips from the harbour, which were under his command;—that preparations were directly made for that purpoſe, as it was ſaid; and, from twelve to two o'clock, about three thouſand men embarked on board the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, which fell down to the caſtle with a deſign of land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on that part of Dorcheſter next to it, and attacking our works on the heights at five o'clock next morning;—
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:029737_0100_0FE247D196A4A950"/>
that lord Percy was appointed to command;—that it was generally believed the attempt would have been made, had it not been for the violent ſtorm which happened that night, as I have mentioned before;—that he heard ſeveral of the privates, and one or two ſerjeants, ſay as they were embarking, that it would be another Bunker's-hill affair."</p>
                     <p>He further informs—"that the army is preparing to leave Boſton, and that they will do it in a day or two;—that the tranſports neceſſary for their embarkation were getting ready with the utmoſt expedition;—that there had been great movements and confuſion among the troops, the night and day preceding his coming out, in hurrying down their cannon, artillery and other ſtores, to the wharfs, with the utmoſt precipitation; and they were putting them on board the ſhips in ſuch haſte, that no account or memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum was taken of them;—that moſt of the cannon were removed from their works, and embarked or embarking;—that he heard a woman ſay, whom he took to be an officer's wife, that ſhe had ſeen men go under the ground at the lines on the neck, without returning;—that the ſhip he commanded was taken up, places fitted, and fitting, for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to lodge, and ſeveral ſhot, ſhells, and cannon already on board;—that the tories were to have the liberty of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where they pleaſe, if they can get ſeamen to man the veſſels, of whom there was a great ſcarcity;—that, on that account, many veſſels could not be carried away, and would be burned;—that many of the inhabitants apprehended the town would be deſtroyed; and that it was generally thought their deſtination is Halifax."</p>
                     <p>The account given by captain Irvine, as to the embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and their being about to leave the town, I believe true. There are other circumſtances corroborating; and it ſeems fully confirmed by a paper ſigned by four of the ſelectmen of the town, (a copy of which I have the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to incloſe you) which was brought out yeſterday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a flag, and delivered to colonel Learned, by major Baſſet of the tenth regiment, who deſired it might be deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered me as ſoon as poſſible. I adviſed with ſuch of the general officers upon the occaſion as I could immediately aſſemble; and we determined it right (as it was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to me or any one elſe, nor authenticated by the
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:029737_0101_0FE1BFA64F880F18"/>
ſignature of general Howe, or any other act obliging him to a performance of the promiſe mentioned on his part) that I ſhould give it no anſwer; at the ſame time, that a letter ſhould be returned, as going from colonel Learned, ſignifying his having laid it before me,—with the reaſons aſſigned for not anſwering it. A copy of this is ſent.</p>
                     <p>To-night I ſhall have a battery thrown up on Nuke-hill (Dorcheſter point) with a deſign of acting as circumſtances may require; it being judged adviſeable to proſecute our plans of fortification, as we intended before this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the ſelectmen came.</p>
                     <p>It being agreed on all hands that there is no poſſibility of ſtopping them in caſe they determine to go,—I ſhall order look-outs to be kept upon all the head-lands, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their movements and courſe, and moreover direct commodore Manly and his little ſquadron to dog them, as well for the ſame purpoſe as for picking up any of their veſſels that may chance to depart their convoy. From their loading with ſuch precipitancy, it is preſumable they will not be in the beſt condition for ſea.</p>
                     <p>If the miniſterial troops evacuate the town and leave it ſtanding, I have thoughts of taking meaſures for fortifying the entrance into the harbour, if it ſhall be thought proper, and the ſituation of affairs will admit of it.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the report from Boſton that Halifax is the place of their deſtination, I have no doubt but that they are going to the ſouthward of this,—and, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, to New-York. Many reaſons lead to this opinion: it is in ſome meaſure corroborated by their ſending an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſhip there, which, on Wedneſday week, got on ſhore and bilged at Cape-Cod. The diſpatches, if written, were deſtroyed when ſhe was boarded. She had a parcel of coal, and about four thouſand cannon-ſhot, ſix carriage-guns, a ſwivel or two, and three barrels of powder.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall hold the riflemen and other parts of our troops in readineſs to march at a moment's warning, and govern my movements by the events that happen, or ſuch orders as I may receive from Congreſs, which I beg may be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and forwarded with all poſſible expedition.</p>
                     <p>On the ſixth inſtant, a ſhip bound from London, with ſtores for the miniſterial army, conſiſting of coal, porter,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:029737_0102_0FE247DC1056A1E8"/>
and krout, fell in with our armed veſſels, four of them in company, and was carried into Portſmouth. She had had a long paſſage, and of courſe brought no papers of a late date. The only letters of importance, or in the leaſt intereſting that were found, I have incloſed.</p>
                     <p>I beg leave to mention to Congreſs that money is much wanted. The militia from theſe governments, engaged till the firſt of April, are then to be paid: and, if we march from hence, the expenſe will be very conſiderable, muſt be defrayed, and cannot be accompliſhed without it. The neceſſity of making the earlieſt remittance for theſe purpoſes is too obvious for me to add more.</p>
                     <p>When I wrote that part of this letter which is antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to this date, I fully expected it would have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now by colonel Bull, not deeming it of ſufficient importance to ſend a ſpecial meſſenger. But he deferred his return from time to time, and never ſet off till to-day. Theſe reaſons I hope will excuſe the delay, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as a proper apology for not tranſmitting it ſooner.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>IN my letter of the ſeventh and ninth inſtant which I had the honour of addreſſing you, I mentioned the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence I had received reſpecting the embarkation of the troops from Boſton; and fully expected, before this, that the town would have been entirely evacuated. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have been deceived, and was rather premature in the opinion I had then formed, I have little reaſon to doubt but the event will take place in a very ſhort time, as other accounts which have come to hand ſince, of the ſailing of a great number of tranſports from the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to Nantaſket-road, and many circumſtances correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding therewith, ſeem to confirm and render it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable.</p>
                     <p>Whether the town will be deſtroyed, is a matter of much uncertainty: but it would ſeem, from the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are making of ſundry pieces of furniture, of many of their waggons, carts, &amp;c. which they cannot take
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:029737_0103_0FE1BFB364DACC98"/>
with them as it is ſaid, that it will not: for, if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, the whole might be involved in one general ruin.</p>
                     <p>Holding it of the laſt importance in the preſent conteſt that we ſhould ſecure New-York, and prevent the enemy from poſſeſſing it,—and conjecturing they have views of that ſort, and their embarkation to be for that purpoſe,—I judged it neceſſary, under the ſituation of things here, to call a council of general officers to conſult of ſuch meaſures as might be expedient to be taken at this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting conjuncture of affairs. A copy of the proceedings I have the honour to incloſe you.</p>
                     <p>Agreeable to the opinion of the council, I ſhall detach the rifle regiment to-morrow, under the command of brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adier-general Sullivan, with orders to repair to New-York with all poſſible expedition;—which will be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, the day after, by the other five in one brigade,—they being all that it was thought adviſeable to ſend from hence till the enemy ſhall have quitted the town. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon their departure, I ſhall ſend forward major-general Putnam, and follow myſelf with the remainder of the army as ſoon as I have it in my power,—leaving here ſuch a number of men as circumſtances may ſeem to require.</p>
                     <p>As the badneſs of the roads at this ſeaſon will greatly retard the march of our men, I have, by advice of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral officers, wrote to governor Trumbull by this expreſs, to uſe his utmoſt exertions for throwing a reinforcement, of two thouſand men into New-York, from the weſtern parts of Connecticut,—and to the commanding officer there, to apply to the provincial convention or committee of ſafety of New-Jerſey, for a thouſand more for the ſame purpoſe, to oppoſe the enemy and prevent their getting poſſeſſion in caſe they arrive before the troops from hence can get there; of which there is a probability, unleſs they are impeded by contrary winds. This meaſure, though it may be attended with conſiderable expenſe, I flatter myſelf, will meet with the approbation of Congreſs. Paſt experience, and the lines in Boſton and on Boſton neck, point out the propriety, and ſuggeſt the neceſſity of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:029737_0104_0FE247DD946A8830"/>
our enemies from gaining poſſeſſion and making a lodgement.</p>
                     <p>Should their deſtination be further ſouthward, or for Halifax (as reported in Boſton) for the purpoſe of going into Canada,—the march of our troops to New-York will place them nearer the ſcene of action, and more convenie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> for affording ſuccours.</p>
                     <p>We have not taken poſt on Nuke-hill, and fortified it, as mentioned that we ſhould, in my laſt. On hearing that the enemy were about to retreat and leave the town, it was thought imprudent and unadviſeable to force them with too much precipitation, that we might gain a little time, and prepare for a march. To-morrow evening we ſhall take poſſeſſion, unleſs they are gone.</p>
                     <p>As New-York is of ſuch importance, prudence and policy require that every precaution that can be deviſed ſhould be adopted, to fruſtrate the deſigns which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my have of poſſeſſing it. To this end I have ordered veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to be provided and held ready at Norwich, for the embarkation and tranſportation of our troops thither. This I have done with a view not only of greatly expedit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their arrival, (as it will ſave ſeveral days marching) but alſo that they may be freſh and ſit for intrenching and throwing up works of defence as ſoon as they get there, if they do not meet the enemy to contend with:—for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which would they be in a proper condition after a long and fatiguing march in bad roads. If Wallace, with his ſhips, ſhould be appriſed of the meaſure, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to prevent it by ſtopping up the harbour of New-London, they can but purſue their march by land.</p>
                     <p>You will pleaſe to obſerve that it is the opinion of the general officers, if the enemy abandon the town, that it will be unneceſſary to employ or keep any part of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for its defence; and that I have mentioned, on that event's happening, I ſhall immediately repair to New-York with the remainder of the army not now detached, leaving only ſuch a number of men here as circumſtances may ſeem to require. What I partly allude to, is, that, as it will take a conſiderable time for the removal of ſuch a body of men, and the diviſions muſt precede each other in ſuch order as to allow intermediate time ſufficient for
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:029737_0105_0FE24788B4039510"/>
them to be covered and provided for, and many things done previous to the march of the whole, for ſecuring and forwarding ſuch neceſſaries as cannot be immediately car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and others which it may be proper to keep here,—that directions might be received from Congreſs reſpecting the ſame, and as many men ordered to remain for that and other purpoſes, as they may judge proper. I could wiſh to have their commands upon the ſubject, and in time; as I may be under ſome degree of embarraſſment as to their views.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs having been pleaſed to appoint colonel Thompſon a brigadier-general, there is a vacancy for a colonel in the regiment he commanded, to which I would beg leave to recommend the lieutenant-colonel Hand. I ſhall alſo take the liberty of recommending captain Hugh Stephenſon, of the Virginia riflemen, to ſucceed colonel Hand, and to be appointed in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Colonel Mifflin informed me to-day of his having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived tent-cloths from Mr. Barrell, of Philadelphia, to the amount of ſeven thouſand five hundred pounds Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania currency, and applied for a warrant for payment of it.

                     <p>IT is with the greateſt pleaſure I inform you, that, on Sunday laſt, the ſeventeenth inſtant, about nine o'clock in
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:029737_0106_0FE247DF188C5CE0"/>
the forenoon, the miniſterial army evacuated the town of Boſton, and that the forces of the United Colonies are now in actual poſſeſſion thereof. I beg leave to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late you, Sir, and the honorable Congreſs, on this happy event, and particularly as it was effected without endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lives and property of the remaining unhappy inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants.</p>
                     <p>I have great reaſon to imagine their flight was precipitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the appearance of a work which I had ordered to be thrown up laſt Saturday night on an eminence at Dorcheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which lay neareſt to Boſton neck, called Nuke-hill.</p>
                     <p>The town, although it has ſuffered greatly, is not in ſo bad a ſtate as I expected to find it; and I have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pleaſure in being able to inform you, Sir, that your houſe has received no damage worth mentioning. Your furniture is in tolerable order, and the family pictures are all left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and untouched. Captain Cazneau takes charge of the whole, until he ſhall receive further orders from you.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the miniſterial troops had quitted the town, I ordered a thouſand men, (who had had the ſmall-pox) under command of general Putnam, to take poſſeſſion of the heights, which I ſhall endeavour to fortify in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to prevent their return, ſhould they attempt it. But, as they are ſtill in the harbour, I thought it not prudent to march off with the main body of the army until I ſhould be fully ſatisfied they had quitted the coaſt. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only detached five regiments, beſides the rifle battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, to New-York, and ſhall keep the remainder here till all ſuſpicion of their return ceaſes.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation in which I found their works evidently diſcovered that their retreat was made with the greateſt precipitation. They have left their barracks and other works of wood at Bunker's hill, &amp;c. all ſtanding, and have deſtroyed but a ſmall part of their lines. They have alſo left a number o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Part of the powder mentioned in yours of the ſixth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant has already arrived.

He deſired leave for three or four days, to ſettle ſome of his private affairs; after which, he will ſet out for his command in Canada. I am happy that my conduct in intercepting lord Drummond's letter is approved of by Congreſs.</p>

                     <p>WHEN I had the honour to addreſs you on the nineteenth inſtant upon the evacuation of the town of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton by the miniſterial army, I fully expected, as their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat and embarkation were hurried and precipitate, that, before now, they would have departed the harbour, and been far in their paſſage to the place of deſtination. But, to my ſurpriſe and diſappointment, the fleet is ſtill in Nantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-road. The purpoſe inducing their ſtay is altogether unknown; nor can I ſuggeſt any ſatisfactory reaſon for it. On Wedneſday night laſt, before the whole of the fleet fell down to Nantaſket, they demoliſhed the caſtle and houſes belonging to it, by burning them down, and the ſeveral for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications. They left a great number of the cannon, but have rendered all of them, except a very few, entirely uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, by breaking off the trunnions; and thoſe they ſpiked up: but they may be made ſerviceable again:—ſome are already done.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral veſſels in the docks, which were taken by the enemy (ſome with and others without cargoes,) which different perſons claim as their property and right. Are they to be reſtored to their former owners on making proof of their title, or to belong to the continent, as captures made from the enemy?—I wiſh Congreſs would direct a mode of proceeding againſt them, and eſtabliſh a rule for
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:029737_0108_0FE247E0B868CBC0"/>
deciſion: they appear to me to be highly neceſſary. In like manner, ſome of the cannon which are in Boſton are ſaid to have come from the caſtle. Suppoſing them, with thoſe remaining at the caſtle, to have been purchaſed by and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided originally at the expenſe of this province,—are they now to be conſidered as belonging to it, or to the public? I beg leave to refer the matter to the opinion of Congreſs, and pray their direction how I am to conduct reſpecting them.</p>
                     <p>It having been ſuggeſted to me that there was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able property, &amp;c. belonging to perſons who had, from the firſt of the preſent unhappy conteſt, manifeſted an unfriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and invetera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

A copy of the letter I herewith ſend you, and ſubmit it to Congreſs, through you, whether they will not determine how it is to be diſpoſed of, and as to the appropriation of the money ariſing from the ſale of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the town was abandoned by the enemy, I judged it adviſeable to ſecure the ſeveral heights, leſt they ſhould attempt to return: and, for this purpoſe, have cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a large and ſtrong <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

This work is almoſt done, and in a little time will be complete: and, that the communication between the town and country may be free and open, I have ordered all the lines upon the neck to be immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and the other works on the ſides of the town facing the country, that the inhabitants from the latter may not be impeded, and afforded an eaſy entrance, in caſe the enemy ſhould gain poſſeſſion at any future time. Theſe matters I conceived to be within the line of my duty; of which I adviſed the General Court, and recommended to their attention ſuch other meaſures as they might think neceſſary for ſecuring the town againſt the hoſtile deſigns of the enemy.</p>

I have juſt got an inventory of ſtores and property be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the crown, which the enemy left in Boſton, at the caſtle, and Bunker's-hill,—which I have the honour to tranſmit you; and ſhall give ſtrict orders that a careful attention be had to any more that may be found. I ſhall take ſuch precautions reſpecting them, that they may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and turn to the public advantage, as much as poſſible, or circumſtances will admit of.</p>
                     <p>A Mr. Bulfinch from Boſton, who acted as clerk to Mr. * * *, having put into my hands a liſt of rations drawn the Saturday before the troops evacuated the town, I have incloſed it for your inſpection. He ſays, neither the ſtaff officers nor women are included in the liſt; from which it appears that their number is greater than we had an idea of.</p>
                     <p>Major-general Ward and brigadier-general Frye are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of leaving the ſervice; and, for that purpoſe, have requeſted me to lay the matter before Congreſs, that they may be allowed to reſign their commiſſions. The papers containing their applications you will herewith receive. They will give you a full and more particular information upon the ſubject; and therefore I ſhall take the liberty of referring you to them.</p>
                     <p>I would mention to Congreſs that the commiſſary of artillery ſtores has informed me, that whatever powder has been ſent to this camp has always come without any bill aſcertaining the number of caſks or quantity. This, it is probable, has proceeded from forgetfulneſs or inattention in the perſons appointed to ſend it, or the negligence of thoſe who brought it, though they have declared otherwiſe, and that they never had any. As it may in ſome meaſure prevent embezzlements, (though I do not ſuſpect any to have been made) and the commiſſary will know what and how much to receive, and be enabled to diſcover miſtakes if any ſhould happen,—I ſhould be glad if you will direct a bill of parcels to be always ſent in future.</p>
                     <p>There have been ſo many accounts from England, all agreeing that commiſſioners are coming to America, to propoſe terms for an accommodation, as they ſay,—that I am inclined to think the time of their arrival not very far off. If they come to Boſton, (which probably will be the
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:029737_0110_0FE247EB0E3D7E18"/>
caſe if they come to America at all) I ſhall be under much embarraſſment reſpecting the manner of receiving them, and the mode of treatment that ought to be uſed. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray that Congreſs will give me directions, and point out the line of conduct to be purſued—whether they are to be conſidered as ambaſſadors, and to have a paſs or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit for repairing through the country to Philadelphia or to any other place—or whether they are to be reſtrained in any and what manner. I ſhall anxiouſly wait their orders, and, whatever they are, comply with them literally.</p>

                     <p>I RECEIVED your favour of the eleventh inſtant by Saturday night's poſt, and muſt beg pardon for not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging it in my laſt of the twenty-fourth. The hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I was then in occaſioned the neglect, and I hope will apologize for it.</p>
                     <p>I now beg leave to inform you that I have juſt received intelligence, that the whole of the miniſterial fleet, beſides three or four ſhips, got under way this evening at Nantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-road, and were ſtanding out for ſea: in conſequence of which, I ſhall detach a brigade of ſix regiments immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from hence for New-York, under the command of brigadier-general Sullivan (brigadier-general Heath having gone with the firſt) which will be ſucceeded by another in a day or two; and directly after, I ſhall forward the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the army (except four or five regiments which will be left for taking care of the barracks and public ſtores, and fortifying the town, and erecting ſuch works for its defence as the honourable General Court may think neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary)—and follow myſelf.</p>
                     <p>Apprehending that general Thomas will ſtand in need of ſome artilleriſts in Canada, I have ordered two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of the train to march immediately; and two mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, with a quantity of ſhells and ſhot, to be ſent him. He ſet out on the twenty-firſt inſtant.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed you have a copy of the return of ordnance ſtores left in Boſton by the enemy. In it are not included
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:029737_0111_0FE247945C0E5B98"/>
the cannon left at the caſtle, amounting to a hundred and thirty-five pieces, as reported, all of which, except a very few, they have deſtroyed and rendered uſeleſs, by knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the trunnions, and ſpiking up.</p>
                     <p>I beg leave to tranſmit you the copy of a petition from the inhabitants of Nova-Scotia, brought me by * * *, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, mentioned therein, who is now here with an Acadian. From this it appears they are in a diſtreſſed ſituation; and, from Mr. * * *'s account, are exceedingly apprehenſive that they will be reduced to the diſagreeable alternative of taking up arms and joining our enemies, or to flee their country, unleſs they can be protected againſt their inſults and oppreſſions. He ſays that their committees think ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſalutary and valuable conſequences would be derived from five or ſix hundred men being ſent there, as it would not only quiet the minds of the people from the anxiety and uneaſineſs they are now filled with, and enable them to take a part in behalf of the colonies, but be the means of preventing the Indians (of whom there are a good many) from taking the ſide of government, and the miniſterial troops from getting ſuch ſupplies of proviſions from thence as they have done.</p>
                     <p>How far theſe good purpoſes would be anſwered if ſuch a force was ſent as they aſk for, is impoſſible to determine in the preſent uncertain ſtate of things. For, if the army from Boſton is going to Halifax (as reported by them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their departure) that or a much more conſiderable force would be of no avail: if not, and they poſſeſs the friendly diſpoſition to our cauſe, ſuggeſted in the petition and declared by Mr. * * *, it might be of great ſervice, unleſs another body of troops ſhould be ſent thither by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, too powerful for them to oppoſe. It being a matter of ſome importance, I judged it prudent to lay it before Congreſs for their conſideration; and requeſting their direction upon the ſubject, ſhall only add, if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to adopt it, that they will preſcribe the number to be ſent, and whether it is to be from the regiments which will be left here. I ſhall wait their deciſion, and, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, will endeavour to have it carried into execution.</p>

                     <p>AN expreſs arrived this morning with a letter from governor Cooke of Rhode-Iſland, of which the incloſed is a copy. In conſequence of this important intelligence, I immediately diſpatched an expreſs after general Sullivan who is on his march to Norwich with ſix regiments, and ordered him to file off to Providence, if he ſhould be ſo deſired by governor Cooke, to whom I have wrote on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>General Greene was to have marched this morning with five more regiments, by way of Providence. I have order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to haſten his march for that place; and hope to collect a force there, ſufficient to prevent the enemy from effecting their purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>I WAS honoured with your favours of the twenty-firſt and twenty-fifth ultimo, on the ſecond inſtant,—the former by Mr. Hanſon, &amp;c. the latter by Feſſenden. I heartily wiſh the money had arrived ſooner, that the militia might have been paid as ſoon as their time of ſervice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. The diſappointment has given them great uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and they are gone home much diſſatisfied: nor have I been without ſevere complaints from the other troops on the ſame account. When I get to New-York, I hope a ſufficient ſum will be there, ready to pay every claim.</p>

                     <p>When I arrive at New-York, I ſhall, in purſuance of the order of Congreſs, detach four battalions to Canada, if the ſituation of affairs will admit of it; and ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely happy if they and the troops already there can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the important end of their going.</p>
                     <p>In my letter of the firſt inſtant, per poſt, I incloſed you a copy of a letter from governor Cooke, adviſing me of the arrival of a ſhip of war, &amp;c. at and near the harbour of Newport. I have now the pleaſure to inform you that the report was entirely premature, and without any foundation. You have a copy of his letter of the firſt inſtant to this effect. I wiſh the alarm had never been given: it occaſioned general Sullivan and his brigade to make an unneceſſary and inconvenient diverſion from their route.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed is a copy of an account, preſented by the honourable General Court, of powder furniſhed the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental army by this colony. From the account, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that part of it was ſupplied before the army was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my command; and therefore I know nothing of it; but have not the ſmalleſt doubt of the juſtice of the charge.
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:029737_0114_0FE247EE51FBAEF8"/>
I ſhall leave about two hundred barrels of this article with major-general Ward, out of which Congreſs will direct him to make a return, if they think proper,—and alſo repayment of what may have been furniſhed by the other governments.</p>
                     <p>A proclamation of general Howe's, iſſued a few days before his departure from town, having fallen into my hands, I have incloſed you a copy, which may probably have been the occaſion of large quantities of goods being carried away, and the removal of many perſons, which otherwiſe would not have happened.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Warren, pay-maſter-general, finding the army likely to be removed from hence, informed me the other day that the ſituation of his affairs and engagements in the buſineſs of the colony are ſuch, as to prevent him from perſonally attending the army; and offered, in caſe it ſhould be required, to reſign. This was rather embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. To me it appears indiſpenſably neceſſary that the pay-maſter-general, with his books, ſhould be at or near head-quarters. Indeed it is uſual for the head of every department in the army, however diſperſed tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> army may be, to be with the commanding general, keeping deputies in the ſmaller departments. On the other hand, colonel Warren's merit and attachment to the cauſe are ſuch, that I could do nothing leſs than deſire, (as ſome money muſt be left for the pay and contingent charges of the army which will remain here) he would wait here till Congreſs ſhall be pleaſed to give their ſentiments upon the matter—ſending in the mean time ſome perſon in whom he could confide, with the money, but little of which there will be to carry, though great the demands, as nine of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have marched to New-York have only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived five hundred pounds each, towards their pay for the months of February and March—and ſix others, not a farthing. I hope therefore this matter will be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Congreſs, and the reſult tranſmitted me as ſoon as done.</p>
                     <p>I would alſo mention to Congreſs, that the militia regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were laſt called upon, in making up their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts, charged pay—the officers, from the time they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived orders to raiſe companies—and the privates, from
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:029737_0115_0FE24797CD41A570"/>
the time they reſpectively engaged to come or were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, though they did not march for a conſiderable time after—ſome not within three, four, to twenty days, during all which, they remained at home about their own private affairs, without doing any thing elſe than "prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the march," as they ſay by way of plea. This appeared to me ſo exceedingly unreaſonable, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to juſtice, that the public ſhould pay for a longer time than from the day of their march to that of their return, that I ordered the abſtracts to be made out accordingly, and refuſed to give warrants on any other terms. They ſay that the enliſting orders, which went out from their governments, give them the pay they claim. The fact may be that ſomething in theſe may ſeem to authorize it: but I muſt ſubmit it to Congreſs, and wiſh for their deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whether the continent muſt pay it.</p>

                     <p>I AM now to inform you that on the fourth inſtant I ſet out from Cambridge, and arrived here on Saturday laſt. I came through Providence, Norwich, and New-London, in order to ſee and expedite the embarkation of the troops. The third brigade, under the command of general Greene, was at New-London when I left it, where there was a ſufficient number of tranſports to embark them—and moſt probably would have arrived here before this, had it not been for a ſevere ſtorm which happened the night they ſailed, which diſperſed them, and, I fear, has done them ſome injury.</p>
                     <p>General Spencer, with the laſt brigade, marched from Roxbury the day I left Cambridge, and would be at New-London, ready to embark in the return tranſports which brought general Sullivan's diviſion to this place. The whole of the troops may be reaſonably expected here in the courſe of this week. The badneſs of the roads, and difficulty of procuring teams for bringing the ſtores, bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, &amp;c. have greatly prolonged their arrival at this place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="117" facs="unknown:029737_0116_0FE247F0DD4291F0"/>
I have not had time, ſince I came, to look fully about me; but find many works of defence begun, and ſome finiſhed. The troops are much diſperſed—ſome on Long-Iſland, others on Staten-Iſland, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I have ordered four battalions from hence to Canada, and am taking meaſures to have them forwarded to Albany, by water, with all poſſible expedition. This will greatly expedite their arrival, and eaſe the men of much fatigue. I have wrote general Schuyler of their coming, that he may have neceſſary meaſures taken to hurry their march to general Thomas.</p>
                     <p>I am informed by general Putnam that the militia, that were called in for the ſupport of this town in caſe the miniſterial army had arrived before our troops, are all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, it being unneceſſary to keep them longer.</p>
                     <p>All the ſhips of war, beſides the Aſia moved out of this harbour on Saturday, and the Aſia yeſterday; ſome of which are now below the Narrows, and the reſt gone to ſea.</p>
                     <p>Your favour of the tenth inſtant, by major Sherburne, directed to general Putnam or the commanding officer here, came to hand on Saturday evening, with three boxes of money, which I ſhall deliver the pay-maſter as ſoon as he arrives, and tranſmit you his receipt for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Having received information from hence before my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from Camb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

He told me, that, as many were wanting for the defence of Providence river and the harbour at New-London, it was uncertain whether I could have all I wanted; but that he would ſend me all that could be ſpared.</p>
                     <p>I have not been able to get a return of the troops ſince I came:—as ſoon as I do, I will ſend it you.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE this moment received a letter from gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Schuyler, containing incloſures of a very important nature, copies of which, I imagine, are contained in the incloſed letter to you, which I thought it my duty imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to forward by expreſs, that they may be laid before the honourable Congreſs, and proper meaſures purſued to prevent the fatal effects which are therein apprehended. For my own part, I have done my utmoſt to forward the four
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:029737_0118_0FE247F9EC266228"/>
regiments ordered by Congreſs: but a variety of incidents have hitherto conſpired to prevent their embarkation. The men had ſcarcely recovered themſelves from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of their march from Boſton, and are quite unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with neceſſaries. The colonels of the regiments, though repeatedly called upon for that purpoſe, had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected making out the abſtracts for their pay. All obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles however are now removed; and I hope to begin the embarkation this day. Indeed it would have been beſt, in my opinion, to have ſent the regiments, raiſed in this province and New-Jerſey, upon that ſervice, had not the peculiar circumſtances under which they were raiſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it. By the terms of their enliſtment, they are to ſerve during the war, and at five dollars per month, on condition (as I am informed) that they ſhall not be ſent out of thoſe provinces. Beſides, they are very ill provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with arms, ſome companies not having any. It muſt be a great burden upon the continent to keep ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of uſeleſs men in pay: and yet, if they ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, and an unexpected ſupply of arms ſhould arrive, it may be found very difficult to replace them.</p>
                     <p>The officers of the ſeveral corps that have arrived here have been ſo buſily employed in fixing their men in quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that I have not yet been able to procure an exact return of their numbers. Some are yet behind. As ſoon as the whole are collected, I ſhall order the proper returns, and tranſmit them to Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>You will pleaſe to notice what colonel Hazen ſays of the diſpoſition of the Indians. In my opinion, it will be impoſſible to keep them in a ſtate of neutrality. They muſt, and, no doubt, ſoon will take an active part either for or againſt us: and I ſubmit it to the conſideration of Congreſs, whether it would not be beſt immediately to engage them on our ſide, and to uſe our utmoſt endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to prevent their minds being poiſoned by miniſterial emiſſaries, which will ever be the caſe while a king's gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon is ſuffered to remain in their country. Would it not therefore be adviſeable to ſend a ſufficient force from the back counties of Pennſylvania, to take poſſeſſion of the garriſons of Niagara and Detroit? This, I think, might eaſily be effected, and would anſwer the moſt ſalutary
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:029737_0119_0FE247A28BF318E8"/>
purpoſes. The Seneca Indians, who have hitherto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared friendly to us, might be uſefully employed in this buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>I am in hopes moſt of the difficulties mentioned in colonel Hazen's letter will be obviated by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he appearance of the reſpectable committee of Congreſs in Canada, and the forces that have been and will be ſent there.

It is to be lamented that any conduct of the continental troops ſhould tend to alienate their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from us.</p>
                     <p>The honourable Congreſs will be able to judge from the papers ſent them by general Schuyler, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation they may receive of the deſigns of the enemy, whether it is expedient to ſend a further reinforcement to Canada. If ſuch ſhould be their determination, I ſtand ready to execute their orders; and am, with reſpect, Sir, your moſt obedient, humble ſervant,</p>

                     <p>I WAS this day honoured with the receipt of your favour of the twentieth inſtant. I have now the pleaſure to acquaint you that the four regiments deſigned for Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada embarked yeſterday with a fair wind for Albany, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of colonels Greaton, Patterſon, Bond, and Poor; beſides which there was a company of riflemen, a company of artificers, and two engineers,—the whole commanded by brigadier-general Thompſon.</p>
                     <p>I have repeatedly mentioned to the honourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the diſtreſsful ſituation we are in for want of arms. With much pains and difficulty I got moſt of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the eaſtward tolerably well furniſhed; but find the York regiments very badly provided. Colonel Ritze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:029737_0120_0FE247FB91BD59F0"/>
has ſcarcely any: and yet theſe men, being enliſted during the war, and at five dollars per month, ought not (in my judgment) to be diſcharged; as we find it almoſt as difficult to get men, as arms. This is a matter of ſome importance, which I ſhould be glad to receive the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar opinion of Congreſs upon.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Baldwin is one of the aſſiſtant engineers ordered to Canada. He is indeed a very uſeful man in his department, but declined the ſervice on account of his pay, which he ſays is inadequate to his ſupport. In order to induce him to continue, I promiſed to repreſent his caſe to Congreſs; and would recommend an increaſe of his pay, and that he ſhould have the rank of lieutenant-colonel, of which he is very deſerving. I beg leave therefore to recommend him to the Congreſs, and that they would make proviſion for him accordingly.</p>
                     <p>A few days ago, application was made to me by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of ſafety for this colony, for an exchange of priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. For the particulars I beg leave to refer you to their letter, a copy of which you have incloſed. As there is a ſtanding order of Congreſs that no ſailors or ſoldiers ſhall be exchanged for citizens, I did not incline to comply with the requeſt without the particular direction of Congreſs: but I have been ſince informed that the priſoners, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the committee's letter as citizens, are really ſeamen taken from private veſſels, but not in arms. How far this may alter the caſe, or how far the reaſons which induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Congreſs to paſs the reſolve above-mentioned may ſtill exiſt, muſt be left to their determination.</p>
                     <p>The militia, who, on my application, were ordered to this place to keep poſſeſſion until I ſhould arrive with the continental forces, were obliged to return home without their pay, as there was not then money ſufficient in the treaſury for that purpoſe, and to anſwer the exigencies of the army. This occaſioned great uneaſineſs among them, and may be attended with very bad conſequences in caſe we ſhould have occaſion for their ſervice on any future emergency. I therefore beg the Congreſs would make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for their pay, and point out particularly whether it is to be done by the commander of the continental forces,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:029737_0121_0FE247A40F2F4888"/>
or by the provincial aſſemblies or conventions from whence they are ſent.</p>
                     <p>As the time for which the riflemen enliſted will expire on the firſt of July next, and as the loſs of ſuch a valuable and brave body of men will be of great, injury to the ſervice, I would ſubmit it to the conſideration of Congreſs, whether it would not be beſt to adopt ſome method to induce them to continue. They are indeed a very uſeful corps: but I need not mention this, as their importance is already well known to the Congreſs. It is neceſſary they ſhould pay an early attention to this matter, as we know from paſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that men are very ſlow in re-enliſting.</p>
                     <p>When I had the honour of ſeeing admiral Hopkins at New-London, he repreſented to me the weak ſtate of his fleet, occaſioned by ſickneſs and the damage he received in his engagement with the enemy; and requeſted I would ſpare him two hundred men to aſſiſt him in a deſign he had formed of attacking Wallace. This I readily conſented to; and the men are to be returned as ſoon as the ſervice is performed.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh it was in my power at preſent to furniſh general Lee with the companies of artillery he deſires. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſent two companies to Quebec; and I have not yet been able to procure a return of thoſe that are here. I expect colonel Knox every moment, and ſhall then be able to determine whether any can be ſpared from hence. Blankets we are in great want of, ourſelves; and it was with great difficulty a few could be procured for the rifle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that were ordered for Canada.</p>
                     <p>I incloſe you Mr. Winthrop's receipt for two hundred thouſand dollars brought ſome time ago from Philadelphia by major Sherburne, which you will pleaſe to deliver to the continental treaſurers.</p>
                     <p>On my arrival here, I found that Mr. Livingſton had been appointed by the provincial Congreſs a commiſſary, to furniſh the continental troops ſtationed in this city with proviſions. I ſuppoſe this was done becauſe there was no continental commiſſary then on the ſpot. Mr. Livingſton ſtill claims a right of furniſhing all the troops but thoſe lately arrived from Cambridge. Mr. Trumbull is now here: and, as I conſider him as the principal in that office,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:029737_0122_0FE247FD16A4FB58"/>
I ſhould be glad to know whether any part of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental troops is to be furniſhed by any other than their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary-general. I muſt needs ſay, that to me it appears very inconſiſtent, and muſt create great confuſion in the accounts as well as in the contracts. I intended to have laid before Congreſs the amount of the rations, as ſupplied by colonel Trumbull and Mr. Livingſton; and called upon thoſe gentlemen to furniſh me with a ſeparate eſtimate for that purpoſe. Colonel Trumbull has given me his, by which it appears he ſupplies the troops at eight pence and one third per ration. I have not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any from Mr. Livingſton; but am informed his contract is at ten pence half-penny. The difference is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe, as it will amount to no leſs than two hundred pounds per day, for twenty thouſand men. It is indeed to be conſidered that Mr. Livingſton's contract is, includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every other charge; and that to Mr. Trumbull's muſt be added ſtore hire, clerks, and every other contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent expenſe. But even then it will not amount to ſo much as Mr. Livingſton's, by a penny per ration, which, in the groſs, will be ſomething very conſiderable. I thought it my duty, without prejudice or partiality, to ſtate the matter fairly to Congreſs, that they might take ſuch order upon it as to them ſhall ſeem neceſſary. I cannot however, in juſtice to Mr. Trumbull, help adding that he has been indefatigable in ſupplying the army; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, from his connexions in New-England, is able to do it on as good terms as any perſon in America.</p>
                     <p>The ſeveral matters contained in the foregoing, I muſt beg the early attention of Congreſs to; and that I may be favoured with an anſwer as ſoon as poſſible.</p>

                     <p>IN a letter which I had the honour to receive from Congreſs ſome conſiderable time ago, they were pleaſed to aſk what rank aides-de-camp bore in the army? from whence I concluded that they had adverted to the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary trouble and confinement of thoſe gentlemen, with
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:029737_0123_0FE247A59506F710"/>
a view to make them an adequate allowance. But noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being ſince done or ſaid of the matter, I take the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, unſolicited by, and unknown to my aides-de-camp, to inform your honourable body that their pay is not by any means equal to their trouble and confinement.</p>
                     <p>No perſon wiſhes more to ſave money to the public, than I do: and no perſon has aimed more at it. But there are ſome caſes in which parſimony may be ill placed; and this I take to be one. Aides-de-camp are perſons in whom entire confidence muſt be placed: it requires men of abilities to execute the duties with propriety and diſpatch, where there is ſuch a multiplicity of buſineſs, as muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the commander-in-chief of ſuch an army as ours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and perſuaded I am, that nothing but the zeal of thoſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (who live with me, and act in this capacity) for the great American cauſe, and perſonal attachment to me, has induced them to undergo the trouble and confinement they have experienced ſince they have become members of my family.</p>
                     <p>I give in to no kind of amuſements myſelf; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thoſe about me can have none, but are confined from morning till eve, hearing and anſwering the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and letters of one and another, which will now, I expect, receive a pretty conſiderable addition, as the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the northern and eaſtern departments (if I continue here) muſt. I ſuppoſe, paſs through my hands. If theſe gentlemen had the ſame relaxation from duty as other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers have in their common routine, there would not be ſo much in it. But, to have the mind always upon the ſtretch—ſcarce ever unbent—and no hours for recreation, makes a material odds. Knowing this, and at the ſame time how inadequate the pay is, I can ſcarce find inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to impoſe the neceſſary duties of their office upon them. To what I have here ſaid, this further remark may be made, and is a matter of no ſmall concernment to me, and, in its conſequences, to the public:—and that is, that, while the duty is hard and the pay ſmall, it is not to be wondered at, if there ſhould be found a promptneſs in them to ſeek preferment, or in me to do juſtice to them by facilitating their views; by which means I muſt loſe their aid when they have it moſt in their power to aſſiſt
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:029737_0124_0FE247FE9CA41F70"/>
me. Influenced by theſe motives, I have taken the liberty of laying the matter fully, and with all due deference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your honourable body, not doubting its meeting with a patient hearing.</p>

                     <p>I RECEIVED by laſt evening's poſt a letter from Joſhua Wentworth, eſquire, of Portſmouth, whom I had appointed agent for our little fleet in that province. It is dated the fifteenth inſtant; an extract from which I have the honour of tranſcribing for your peruſal.</p>
                     <p>"The third inſtant, commodore Manly brought in the brigantine Elizabeth, one of the third diviſion which ſailed from Nantaſket, with a valuable cargo of Engliſh goods, and a few hogſheads of rum and ſugar, by a Mr. J * * *, who was paſſenger, part freighter, and a very tory. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the cargo worth twenty thouſand pounds ſterling. Thoſe goods are, the greater part, owned by the late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Boſton, and by ſome that were inhabitants when the troops left it,—the reſidue of this Mr. J * * *, and others of the ſame caſt. The complicate ſtate of this
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:029737_0125_0FE247A7191B71C8"/>
prize required my immediate ſetting off for Boſton, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting I might find ſome directions for my government there; when I waited on general Ward, who was obliging enough to give me his opinion (but not able to direct, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received no inſtructions to the point) that the veſſel and cargo muſt be libelled, and a dividend to the captors would follow, of all ſuch goods as might be legally claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the friends to America; and thoſe that were the property of them inimical, might be decreed forfeited. Upon further inquiry, I was informed a reſolve paſſed in Congreſs that all veſſels and goods, retaken previous to a condemnation by a Britiſh court of admiralty, were liable to a partial decree (by every colony judge) to the captors, not more than one-third, nor leſs than one-fourth. The preſent prize falls under this reſolve: and any other, that [<hi>makes the</hi>] property of our internal enemies liable to a full confiſcation, may be neceſſary for my government: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall be much obliged by your full direction of this capture, and a copy of the continental reſolves thereon. This brigantine is owned by a Mr. Richard Hart, of this town, taken on her return from the Weſt-Indies laſt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, and carried into Boſton, not condemned: The rum on board are ſeventeen hogſheads,—and four of ſugar, not removed out of her from the time of capture. The other cargo was in general ſtolen by virtue of general Howe's proclamation (which undoubtedly you have ſeen) appointing one C * * * B * * * ſuperintendant, who, by the way, was taken in the prize, and is now confined in the Maſſachuſetts colony, with Mr. J * * * and ſundry others, by order of the general court, to whom general Ward delivered them.</p>
                     <p>"There were a ſerjeant and twelve privates of the fourth, or king's own regiment, taken priſoners on board, with the others, making ſixty-three ſouls. * * *</p>
                     <p>"There appeared from the pillage of this cargo by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the paſſengers, the property was in him who could ſecrete the moſt. For, when examining the cheſts and bedding of the priſoners, I found great quantity of goods that they had collected while on board, which were taken out of ware-houſes without packing, and hove promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly on board the veſſel. Even the ſailors had provided
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:029737_0126_0FE24806AA27BB98"/>
for their diſpoſal at pleaſure. In fact, the deſtruction of property, under cover of general Howe's proclamation, is unparell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>led. * * *</p>
                     <p>"I am now diſcharging the cargo, as it is in a periſhing ſituation; and, when ſelected, and the regular courſe purſued through the admiralty, ſhall advertiſe agreeable to his Excellency's inſtructions to general Ward, who was obliging enough to give me an abſtract.</p>
                     <p>"The general court of this province, finding a difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in making a code of laws for the admiralty-court, did not complete that inſtitution their laſt ſeſſion, when they adjourned to June; which lapſe of time will not admit my facilitating the diſpoſal of the prizes under my care, ſo early as I could wiſh, for the ſafety of part of the intereſt of the Suſanna's cargo, viz. the porter, which I fear may be ſpoiled by lying ſo long,—it not having equal body to that commonly imported for ſale;—which induces me to deſire your direction for a diſpoſal of that article either at private or public ſale."</p>
                     <p>That, Sir, is an exact copy of part of Mr. Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth's letter to Mr. Moylan. I now requeſt you will pleaſe to direct me, in what manner I ſhall inſtruct the agent reſpecting the complicated cargo, and whether he may be empowered to diſpoſe of the porter or any other articles on board the prizes under his care, which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of eſtabliſhing the court of admiralty may make liable to periſh.</p>
                     <p>I have not yet heard that there has been any trial of the prizes carried into Maſſachuſetts-Bay. This procraſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is attended with very bad conſequences. Some of the veſſels I had fitted out are now laid up, the crews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſatisfied that they cannot get their prize-money. I have tired the Congreſs upon this ſubject: but the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it makes me again mention, that, if a ſummary way of proceeding is not reſolved on, it will be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to get our veſſels manned. I muſt alſo mention to you, Sir, that captain Manly and his crew are deſirous to know when they may expect their part of the value of the ordnance ſtores taken laſt fall. They are anxious to know what the amount may be. As the inventory of that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go is in the hands of Congreſs, I would humbly ſubmit it
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:029737_0127_0FE247B1134F4C60"/>
to them, whether a valuation thereof ſhould not be made, and the captors' dividend be remitted them as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. It will give them ſpirit, and encourage them to be alert in looking out for other prizes.</p>
                     <p>Several officers belonging to the regiments raiſed in theſe middle colonies inform me that their men (notwithſtanding their agreement) begin to murmur at the diſtinction of pay made between them and the regiments from the eaſt-ward. I would be glad that the Congreſs would attend to this in time, leſt it may get to ſuch a pitch as will make it difficult to ſuppreſs. They argue that they perform the ſame duty, undergo the ſame fatigue, and receive five dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, when the eaſtern regiments receive ſix dollars and two-thirds per month. For my own part, I wiſh they were all upon the ſame footing: for, if the Britiſh army will not face this way, it will be neceſſary to detach a great part of our troops: in that caſe, I would, for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, be ſorry there ſhould be any diſtinctions of regiments that are all in the pay of the United Colonies.</p>
                     <p>The deficiency of arms (in the New-York regiments eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially) is very great. If I am rightly informed, there are ſcarce as many in colonel Ritzema's regiment as will arm one company. Can the Congreſs remedy this evil? If they can, there ſhould not a moment be loſt in effecting it, as our ſtrength at preſent is, in reality, on paper only. Should we think of diſcharging thoſe men who are without arms, the remedy would be worſe than the diſeaſe: for, by vigorous exertions, I hope arms may be procured; and I well know that the raiſing men is exceeding difficult, eſpecially to be engaged during the continuance of the war, which is the footing on which colonel Ritzema's regiment is engaged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>April</hi> 26.—I had wrote thus far before I was hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured with your favour of the twenty-third inſtant. In obedience to the order therein contained, I have directed ſix regiments more for Canada, which will embark as ſoon as veſſels and other neceſſaries can be provided. Theſe regiments will be commanded by general Sullivan. I ſhall give him inſtructions to join the forces in that country un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der general Thomas, as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to ſending more troops to that country, I
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:029737_0128_0FE248085D7C1498"/>
am really at a loſs what to adviſe, as it is impoſſible at preſent to know the deſigns of the enemy. Should they ſend the whole force under general Howe up the river St. Lawrence, to relieve Quebec and recover Canada, the troops gone and now going will be inſufficient to ſtop their progreſs: and ſhould they think proper to ſend that or an equal force this way from Great-Britain for the purpoſe of poſſeſſing this city and ſecuring the navigation of Hudſon's river, the troops left here will not be ſufficient to oppoſe them: and yet, for any thing we know, I think it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable they may attempt both,—both being of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt importance to them,—if they have men.</p>
                     <p>I could wiſh indeed that the army in Canada ſhould be more powerfully reinforced: at the ſame time I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that the truſting this important poſt (which is now become the grand magazine of America) to the handful of men remaining here, is running too great a riſk. The ſecuring this poſt and Hudſon's river is to us alſo of ſo great importance, that I cannot at preſent adviſe the ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more troops from hence:—on the contrary, the general officers now here, whom I thought it my duty to conſult, think it abſolutely neceſſary to increaſe the army at this place with at leaſt ten thouſand men, eſpecially when it is conſidered, that, from this place only, the army in Canada muſt draw its ſupplies of ammunition, proviſions, and, moſt probably, of men; and that all reinforcements can be ſent from hence much eaſier than from any other place. By the incloſed return, you will fee the ſtate of the army here, and that the number of effective men is far ſhort of what the Congreſs muſt have expected.</p>
                     <p>I have found it neceſſary to order colonel Dayton's regiment from New-Jerſey to march as one of the ſix to Canada: wherefore I muſt recommend it to Congreſs to order two companies of one of the regiments ſtill in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania to march to Cape-May, which can be done much ſooner: for, had this deſtination of that regiment not tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en place, it would have been very inconvenient to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached two companies from it to that place; as the march would (according to lord Stirling's and other accounts) have been at leaſt two hundred miles from Amboy, and they muſt have paſſed within twenty miles of Philadelphia,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:029737_0129_0FE247B2ECCDBA00"/>
there being no practicable road along the ſea-coaſt of New-Jerſey for their baggage to have paſſed.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Potts, who is bearer hereof, was, I underſtand, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed director of the hoſpital for theſe middle colonies: but the army being removed, with the general hoſpital, from the eaſtward, does in courſe ſuperſede him. He is inclined to go to Canada, where he may be very uſeful, if a perſon is not already appointed for that department. I would humbly beg leave to aſk the Congreſs whether, in all theſe appointments, it would not be beſt to have but one chief, to whom all the others ſhould be ſubordinate.</p>

                     <p>I AM honoured with your favour of the thirtieth ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo, and obſerve what Congreſs have done reſpecting the ſettlement of the paymaſter's accounts. This ſeems expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, as he is out of office, and, I am certain, will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with but little if any difficulty; nothing more being neceſſary, than to compare the warrants with his debts, and the receipts he has given, with his credits. I wiſh every other ſettlement as eaſy, and that a committee was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to examine and audit the accounts upon which the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants are founded, particularly thoſe of the quarter-maſter and commiſſary generals. They are long and of high amount, conſiſting of a variety of charges,—of courſe more intricate, and will require time and an extraordinary degree of attention to adjuſt and liquidate in a proper manner.—Upon this ſubject, I did myſelf the honour to write you a conſiderable time ago.</p>
                     <p>Having had ſeveral complaints from the officers in the eaſtern regiments who have been and are engaged in recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, about the expenſe attending it, and for which they have never yet been allowed any thing, though the officers in theſe governments have, as I am informed,—I ſhall be glad to know whether the allowance of ten ſhillings, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the officers for every man enliſted, by the reſolve of Congreſs in [<hi>January</hi>] is general and indiſcriminate, or confined to the middle diſtricts. If general, muſt I have
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:029737_0131_0FE247B471C8DB98"/>
retroſpect to the time of the reſolve, and pay for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices ſince, or only for future enliſtments?</p>
                     <p>In a letter I wrote to Congreſs the twenty-fifth of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, I incloſed one I had received from Jacob Baily, eſquire, about opening a road from Newbury to Canada. I have received another of the fifteenth ultimo: and, from his account and the intelligence I have from others upon inquiry, I have no doubt of the practicability of the meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure; and am well informed that the diſtance will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably ſhortened, inſomuch that our people going from any part of the New-England governments eaſtward of Connecticut-river, to Canada, or returning from thence home, will perform their march in five or ſix days leſs time than by coming or going any way now uſed. Add to this, that the road may be ſo conducted (as it is ſaid) as to go to the river Miſſiſque, from whence the water-carriage to St. John's is good, except forty odd miles,—or be carried ſo far to the northward, as to keep clear of the Lakes altogether, and afford an eaſy paſs into Canada at all ſeaſons. The advantage reſulting from this route being ſo great and important, I have advanced colonel Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley two hundred and fifty pounds to begin with, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him to execute his plan. No doubt it will require a conſiderable advance to accompliſh it: but that will be ſoon ſunk. The expenſe ſaved, by taking off ſix day's pay and proviſions from the ſoldiers returning to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern governments at the expiration of this campaign, will be almoſt if not more than equal to the charge incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in opening it. If not,—as in all probability there will be often a neceſſity for ſending detachments of our troops to Canada from thoſe governments, and for others to return, it will ſoon be repaid.</p>
                     <p>By a letter from general Schuyler, of the twenty-ſeventh ultimo, I find general Thompſon and his brigade were at Albany;—general Sullivan with the laſt (except three or four companies of colonel Wayne's regiment, not yet come) is embarked and gone, and probably will be ſoon there. I am apprehenſive, from general Schuyler's account, that they will not proceed with the wiſhed-for expedition, owing to a difficulty in getting teams and provender for cattle neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to carry their baggage, and a ſcarcity of batteaux at
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:029737_0132_0FE2480B64B37648"/>
the Lakes for ſo large a number, though he is taking the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt pains to procure them. Should they be ſtopped for any time, it will be exceedingly unfortunate, as their going from hence has weakened us here much, and our army in Canada will not be ſtrengthened.</p>
                     <p>I have ſent with the laſt brigade ſixty barrels of powder, and other ſtores and intrenching tools, a ſupply being aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; alſo the chain for a boom at the narrows of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elieu, and the three boxes of money brought by Mr. Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and have wrote to general Schuyler to have the boom fixed as ſoon as poſſible. The commiſſary too has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded about eight hundred barrels of pork, and is in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a further quantity from Connecticut, which will go on without ſtopping here.</p>
                     <p>As the magazine from whence the northern and eaſtern armies will occaſionally receive ſupplies of powder will probably be here, and our ſtock is low and inconſiderable, being much reduced by the ſixty barrels ſent to Canada, I ſhall be glad to have a quantity immediately forwarded. Our ſtores ſhould be great: for if the enemy make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack upon the town, or attempt to go up the North-river, the expenditure will be very conſiderable. Money too is much wanted:—the regiments that are paid have only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to the firſt of April, except thoſe of Pennſylvania and Jerſey which are gone to Canada: they are paid to the laſt of April. By a letter from general Ward, I find his cheſt is juſt exhauſted; the money which was left with him for the payment of the five regiments at Boſton and Beverly being almoſt expended by large draughts in favour of the commiſſary and quarter-maſter, and in fitting out the armed veſſels.</p>
                     <p>I would here aſk a queſtion, to wit, whether, as Mr. Warren's commiſſion is ſuperſeded by Mr. Palfrey's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, it will not be neceſſary to fix upon ſome perſon to pay the troops there: or are the payments to go through his hands?—He does not incline to do any thing in the affair without the direction of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>I have incloſed you a return of the laſt brigade detached, and alſo of the forces remaining here. And as it is a matter of much importance to know the whole of our ſtrength from time to time, and to ſee it at one view, for
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:029737_0133_0FE247B707290DB8"/>
regulating our movements with propriety, I wiſh it were a direction from Congreſs to the commanding officers in the different diſtricts to make monthly returns to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-in-chief of the continental army, of the ſtate of the troops in their departments, and alſo of the military ſtores. Such direction will probably make them more attentive than they otherwiſe would be. I could not get a return of the army in Canada all laſt year.</p>
                     <p>I beg leave to lay before Congreſs a copy of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of a court-martial upon lieutenant * * * *, of the ſecond regiment, and of his defence—which I ſhould not have troubled them with, had I not conceived the court's ſentence, upon the facts ſtated in the proceedings, of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular nature, to be by no means adequate to the enormity of his offence, and to be of exceeding dangerous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious tendency. Upon theſe principles I thought it my duty to tranſmit the proceedings to them, in order that they may form ſuch a judgment upon the facts ſtated, as they may conceive right and juſt, and advancive of the public good. At the ſame time I would mention to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs that I think it of material conſequence that they ſhould paſs a reſolve, cutting off the right of ſucceſſion in the military line from one rank to another, which is claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many upon the happening of vacancies—(upon which principle this offence ſeems to have originated in a great meaſure, and the extraordinary judgment in this inſtance to be founded)—declaring that no ſucceſſion or promotion can take place upon any vacancy, without a continental commiſſion giving and authoriſing it. It is of much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to check and entirely ſuppreſs this opinion and claim, which is becoming too prevalent, and has an obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tendency to introduce mutiny and diſorder;—or, if they conceive the claim good, and that it ſhould take place, that they will declare it ſo, that the point may be ſettled and known in future.</p>

them the trouble of receiving another letter upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at this time, but for the particular application of colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Wayne, of Pennſylvania, who has pointed out a method by which he thinks they may be obtained.</p>
                     <p>In the hands of the committee of ſafety at Philadelphia, there are, according to colonel Wayne's account, not leſs than two or three thouſand ſtand of arms for provincial uſe. From hence he thinks a number might b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> continental arms as they are brought into the magazine in that city. At a criſis ſo important as this, ſuch a loan might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the moſt ſignal advantages—while the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs ſtate of the regiments, if no relief can be had, may be productive of fatal conſequences.</p>
                     <p>To give Congreſs ſome idea of our ſituation with reſpect to arms—(and juſtice to my own character requires that it ſhould be known to them, although the world at large will form their opinion of our ſtrength from numbers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attending to circumſtances)—it may not be amiſs to incloſe a copy of a return which I received a few days ago from the forts in the Highlands, and add, that, by a report fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> colonel Ritzema's regiment, of the twenty-ninth ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo, there appeared to be only ninety-ſeven firelocks and ſeven bayonets belonging thereto; and that all the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the eaſtward are deficient from twenty to fifty of the former. Four of thoſe companies at the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Highlands belong to colonel Clinton's regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but in what condition the reſidue are on account of arms, and how colonel Wynkoop's men are provided, I cannot undertake to ſay, but am told, moſt miſerably; as colonel Dayton's of New-Jerſey and colonel Wayne's of Pennſylvania alſo are. This, Sir, is a true though mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy deſcription of our ſituation. The propriety there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of keeping arms in ſtore when men in actual pay are in want of them, and who (it is to be preſumed) will, as they ought, bear the heat and burden of the day, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with all due deference to the ſuperior judgment of others.</p>
                     <p>I cannot, by all the inquiries I have been able to make, learn what number of arms have been taken from the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, where they lie, or how they are to be got at. The
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:029737_0135_0FE247BE28255800"/>
committee of ſafety for this colony have aſſured me that no exertions of theirs ſhall be wanting to procure arms: but our ſufferings in the mean while may prove fatal, as men without are in a manner uſeleſs. I have therefore thoughts of employing an agent whoſe ſole buſineſs it ſhall be to ride through the middle and interior parts of theſe governments, for the purpoſe of buying up ſuch arms as the inhabitants may incline to ſell, and are fit for uſe.</p>
                     <p>The deſigns of the enemy are too much behind the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for me to form any acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

We are left to wander therefore in the field of conjecture: and as no place (all its conſequences conſidered) ſeemed of more importance in the execution of their grand plan, than poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing themſelves of Hudſon's river, I thought it adviſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to remove with the continental army to this city ſo ſoon as the king's troops evacuated Boſton. But if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, from their knowledge, information, or belief, think it beſt for the general good of the ſervice that I ſhould go to the northward or elſewhere, they are convinced, I hope, that they have nothing more to do than ſignify their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>

                     <p>AT a quarter after ſeven this evening, I received by expreſs a letter from Thomas Cuſhing, eſquire, chairman of a committee of the honourable general court, covering one to them from the committee of Salem; copies of which I do myſelf the honour to lay before Congreſs, that they may judge of the intelligence contained therein, and direct ſuch meaſures to be taken upon the occaſion as they may think proper and neceſſary.</p>

Perhaps, by dividing and ſubdivid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our force too much, we ſhall have no one poſt ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently guarded.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your favours of the fourth and ſeventh inſtant with their ſeveral inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and am exceedingly glad, that before the reſolution reſpecting lieutenant-colonel Ogden came to hand, I had ordered him to join his regiment, and had qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lled a diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ſpirit both of mutiny and deſertion, which had taken place and ſeemed to be riſing to a great degree in conſequence of it. In order to effect it, I had the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paraded, and ordered two more at the ſame time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der arms, convinced them of their error and ill conduct, and obtained a promiſe for their good behaviour in future. To ſuch of the men as had abſconded I gave pardons, on their aſſurances to return to their duty again.</p>
                     <p>In my letter of the fifth inſtant which I had the honour of addreſſing you, I mentioned to Congreſs the refractory and mutinous conduct of lieutenant * * * *, of the ſecond regiment, and laid before them a copy of the proceedings
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:029737_0137_0FE247C0C264F210"/>
of a court-martial upon him, and of his defence, with a view that ſuch meaſures might be adopted as they ſhould think adequate to his crime. I would now beg leave to inform them, that, ſince then, he has appeared ſenſible of his miſconduct; and having made a written acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his offence, and begged pardon for it, (as by the incloſed copy will appear) I thought it beſt to releaſe him from his confinement, and have ordered him to join his regiment; which I hope will meet their approbation, and render any determination, as to him, unneceſſary;—ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving at the ſame time that I have endeavoured, and, I flatter myſelf, not ineffectually, to ſupport their authority, and a due ſubordination in the army. I have found it of importance and highly expedient to yield many points in fact, without ſeeming to have done it—and this, to avoid bringing on a too frequent diſcuſſion of matters, which, in a political view, ought to be kept a little behind the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and not be made too much the ſubjects of diſquiſition. Time only can eradicate and overcome cuſtoms and prej<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udices of long ſtanding: they muſt be got the better of by ſlow and gradual advances.</p>
                     <p>I would here take occaſion to ſuggeſt to Congreſs (not wiſhing or meaning of myſelf to aſſume the ſmalleſt degree of power in any inſtance) the propriety and neceſſity of having their ſentiments reſpecting the filling up the vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and iſſuing commiſſions to officers, eſpecially to thoſe under the rank of field officers. Had I literally complied with the directions given upon this ſubject when I firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the ſervice, and which I conceived to be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded by a ſubſequent reſolve for forming the army upon the preſent eſtabliſhment, I muſt have employed one clerk for no other buſineſs than iſſuing warrants of appointment, and giving information to Congreſs for their confirmation or refuſal. It being evident from the neceſſity of the thing, that there will be frequent changes and vacancies in office, from death and a variety of other cauſes, I now ſubmit it to them, and pray their direction whether I am to purſue that mode and all the ceremonies attending it, or to be at liberty to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Before I have done, with the utmoſt deference and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I would beg leave to remind Congreſs of my former letters and applications reſpecting the appointment of prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perſons to ſuperintend and take direction of ſuch priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners as have already fallen and will fall into our hands in the courſe of the war—being fully convinced, that, if there were perſons appointed who would take the whole management of them under their care, the continent would ſave a conſiderable ſum of money by it, and the priſoners be better treated and provided with real neceſſaries than they now are;—and ſhall take the liberty to add that it appears to me a matter of much importance, and worthy of conſideration, that particular and proper places of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould be fixed on and eſtabliſhed in the interior parts of the different governments for their reception.</p>
                     <p>Such eſtabliſhments are agreeable to the practice and uſage of the Engliſh and other nations, and are founded on principles of neceſſity and public utility. The advantages which will ariſe from them are obvious and many:—I ſhall only mention two or three. They will tend much to prevent eſcapes, (which are difficult to effect when the public is once advertiſed that the priſoners are reſtrained to a few ſtated and well-known places, and not permitted to go from thence,) and the more ingenious among them from diſſeminating and ſpreading their artful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious intrigues and opinions throughout the country, which would influence the weaker and wavering part of mankind, and meet with but too favourable a hearing. Further, it will be leſs in their power to join and aſſiſt our enemies in caſes of invaſion, and will give us an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity always to know, from the returns of thoſe appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuperintend them, what number we have in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the force ſufficient to check and ſuppreſs their hoſtile views in times of emergency, and the expenſes neceſſary for their maintenance and ſupport. Many other reaſons might be adduced to prove the neceſſity and expediency of the meaſure:—I ſhall only ſubjoin one more, and then have done on the ſubject,—which is, that many of the towns where priſoners have been already ſent, not having convenience for or the mean of keeping them, complain they are burdenſome; and have become careleſs, inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:029737_0139_0FE247C24820BBF8"/>
and altogether indifferent whether they eſcape or not; and thoſe of them that are reſtricted to a cloſer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement (the limits of jail) are neglected, and not treated with that care and regard which Congreſs wiſh.</p>
                     <p>I have not received further intelligence of the German troops ſince my letter of the ſeventh inſtant, covering Mr. Cuſhing's diſpatches. But, leſt the account of their coming ſhould be true, may it not be adviſeable and good policy to raiſe ſome companies of our Germans to ſend among them when they arrive, for exciting a ſpirit of diſaffection and deſertion?—If a few ſenſible and truſty fellows could get with them, I ſhould think they would have great weight and influence with the common ſoldiery, who certainly have no enmity towards us, having received no injury nor cauſe of quarrel from us. The meaſure having oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, and appearing to me expedient, I thought it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to mention it for the conſideration of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>Having received a letter from general Ward, adviſing that Congreſs have accepted his reſignation, and praying to be relieved,—and it being neceſſary that a general of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer ſhould be ſent to take the command of the troops at Boſton, eſpecially if the army ſhould arrive which is talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, and which ſome conſider as a probable event,—I muſt beg leave to recommend to Congreſs the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome brigadier-generals, not having more here (nor ſo many at this time) than are eſſential to the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment and conducting the forces and the works that are carrying on. Generals Sullivan and Thompſon being ordered to Canada, I cannot ſpare one more general of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer from hence without injuring the ſervice greatly, and leaving the army here without a ſufficient number.</p>
                     <p>Having frequent applications from the committee of ſafety and others, about an exchange of priſoners, and not having authority to purſue any other mode in this inſtance, than that marked out by a reſolve of Congreſs ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time ago, I hope they will pardon me when I wiſh them to take under conſideration ſuch parts of my letter of the twenty-ſecond ultimo as relate to this ſubject; and for their determination upon it. I ſhall then have it in my power to give explicit and ſatisfactory anſwers to thoſe who ſhall apply.</p>

                     <p>He alſo informs, "that the ſixty barrels of powder had arrived, and would be forwarded that day;—that the firſt regiment of general Sullivan's brigade marched that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that the intrenching tools and about ſix hundred barrels of pork were alſo gone on;—that he cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſend more than half of the three hundred thouſand dollars into Canada, (being greatly in debt on the public account, and the creditors exceedingly clamorous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate for payment) which ſum he hopes will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient till the Canadians agree to take our paper currency, to which they are much averſe, and of which he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly doubtful;—that he had got the chain, and would forward it that day to general Arnold, with orders to fix it at the rapids of Richelieu." He adds "that he had reviewed general Sullivan's brigade in preſence of about two hundred and ſixty Indians, who were greatly pleaſed with the order and regularity of the troops, and ſurpriſed at the number, which, the tories had induſtriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

propagated, conſiſted only of three companies, and that they were kept always walking the ſtreets, to induce them to believe their number was much greater than it really was."</p>
                     <p>I have incloſed a copy of general Schuyler's inſtructions to James Price, eſquire, deputy commiſſary-general, for the regulation of his conduct in that department, which I received laſt night, and which general Schuyler requeſted me to forward you. I alſo beg leave to lay before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs a copy of a letter from Samuel Stringer, director of one of the hoſpitals, purporting an application for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of ſurgeons'-mates, &amp;c. an eſtimate of which is alſo incloſed; and ſubmit it to them, what number muſt be ſent from hence or got elſewhere. It is highly probable that many more will be wanted in Canada than are already there, on account of the late augmentation of the army: but I thought it moſt adviſeable to make his requiſition known to Congreſs, and to take their order and direction upon it. As to the medicines, I ſhall ſpeak to Dr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan (not yet arrived) as ſoon as he comes, and order him to forward ſuch as may be neceſſary and can be poſſibly ſpared.</p>

                     <p>I THIS moment received by expreſs from general Schuyler an account of the melancholy proſpect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of our affairs in Canada: and preſuming that the letters which accompany this will give Congreſs full infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation upon the ſubject, I ſhall only add that general Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, in purſuance of orders from the honourable commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, has directed brigadier-general Sullivan to halt his brigade; as a further reinforcement (on account of the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of proviſions) would not relieve, but contribute great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſtreſs our troops already in Canada. Before he received theſe orders, all the brigade, except Dayton's and Wayne's regiments, had left Albany: but I ſuppoſe he will be able to ſtop their march.</p>

By my letter of the fifteenth, Congreſs will perceive the quantity of pork already gone from hence: and the commiſſary has aſſured me that he will forward a further ſupply as ſoon as it can be poſſibly collected. I had alſo directed five tons of lead to be ſent to general Schuyler for the Canada expedition, before I received this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate account; which was as much as could be ſpared for the preſent (our ſtock being inconſiderable in proportion to the demand we may reaſonably expect for it;) and ſhall do every thing in my power to relieve our affairs from their preſent diſtreſſed and melancholy ſituation in that quarter, which occurs to me and appears neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>

yeſterday. I have committed to him the heads of ſundry matters to lay before Congreſs for their conſideration, which, from the intereſting intelligence contained in my laſt, appear to me of the utmoſt importance, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their moſt early and ſerious attention.</p>

His military experience and intimate acquaintance with the ſituation of our affairs will enable him to give Congreſs the fulleſt ſatisfaction about the meaſures neceſſary to be adopted at this alarming criſis; and, with his zeal and attachment to the cauſe of America, have a claim to their notice and favours.</p>

                     <p>I DO myſelf the honour to inform Congreſs that I arrived here yeſterday afternoon about one o'clock, and found all in a ſtate of peace and quiet. I had not time to view the works carrying on, and thoſe ordered to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun when I went away; but have reaſon to believe, from the report of ſuch of the general and other officers as I had the pleaſure to ſee, that they have been proſecuted and forwarded with all poſſible diligence and diſpatch.</p>
                     <p>I am much concerned for the ſituation of our affairs in Canada, and am fearful, ere this, it is much worſe than was firſt reported at Philadelphia. The intelligence from thence, in a letter from captain Wilkinſon of the ſecond regiment, to general Greene, is truly alarming. It not only confirms the account of colonel Biddle and major Sherburne's defeat, but ſeems to forebode general Arnold's, with the loſs of Montreal. I have incloſed a copy of the letter, which will but too well ſhew that there is founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for my apprehenſions.</p>

                     <p>IN my letter of yeſterday which I had the honour of addreſſing you, and which was deſigned to have gone by poſt, but was prevented by his departure before the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al time, I mentioned my having received by expreſs a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſundry papers from general Schuyler, reſpecting Sir John Johnſton, copies of which I herewith tranſmit you for your inſpection and peruſal. They will ſhew you what meaſures were planned and attempted for apprehending him, and ſecuring the Scotch Highlanders in Tryon county.</p>
                     <p>Having heard that the troops at Boſton are extremely uneaſy and almoſt mutinous for want of pay, (ſeveral months being now due) I muſt take the liberty to repeat a queſtion contained in my letter of the fifth ultimo—"What mode is to be purſued reſpecting it? whether is money to be ſent from hence by the paymaſter general, or ſome perſon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:029737_0146_0FE2482440280618"/>
ordinate to him to be appointed there for that purpoſe?" I expected ſome direction would have been given in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, long ere this, from what was contained in yours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying (or about the time of) the laſt remittance. I preſume it has been omitted by reaſon of the multiplicity of important buſineſs before Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>In peruſing the ſeveral reſolves you honoured me with when at Philadelphia and ſince my return, I find one allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a chief engineer for the army in a ſeparate department. The ſervice requiring many of them, I wiſh Congreſs, if they know any perſons ſkilled in this buſineſs, would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them. General Schuyler has frequently applied, and ſuggeſted the neceſſity of having ſome in Canada. I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf know of none.</p>
                     <p>I alſo find there is a reſolve of the third of June for taking Indians into the ſervice, which, if literally conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, confines them to that in Canada. Is that the meaning of Congreſs, or that the commander-in-chief may order their ſervice to any place he may think neceſſary?</p>
                     <p>In reſpect to the eſtabliſhing expreſſes between the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al continental poſts,—who is to do it? the reſolve does not ſay. Is it expected by Congreſs that I ſhould? Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the work is aſſigned to, I think, ſhould execute it with the utmoſt diſpatch. The late imperfect and contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry accounts reſpecting our defeat at the Cedars, ſtrongly point out the neceſſity there is for it. No intelligence is yet come from any officer in command there, (and moſt probably for want of a proper channel to convey it) though this misfortune happened ſo long ago.</p>
                     <p>When I had the honour of being in Congreſs, if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not, I heard a reſolve read, or was told of one, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the New-York troops the ſame pay as others in the continental ſervice. This, if any ſuch, I do not find; and if there is not ſuch a one, I ſhall be under ſome embarraſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how to pay the militia to be provided by this prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince. The reſolve providing them ſays they are to be paid, while in ſervice, as other troops are. But if thoſe enliſted heretofore in this province are to receive according to the firſt eſtabliſhment, it is a matter of doubt what the militia are to have.</p>
                     <p>Before this comes to hand, a hand-bill, containing an
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:029737_0147_0FE247D010F097F8"/>
account of a victory gained by general Arnold over the party that had defeated colonel Biddle and major Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne, will moſt probably have reached you. I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into the authenticity of this fortunate report, and have found there is no dependence to be put in it; nor do I believe it deſerving of the leaſt credit. I ſhall be happy not to hear the reverſe.</p>

                        <p>As the militia will be coming in, and they will be in much need of covering, pleaſe to have all the tents, and cloth proper for making them that can be procured, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded as ſoon as poſſible.</p>

                     <p>I WAS honoured yeſterday with your favour of the ſeventh, with its incloſures. When Dr. Potts arrives, I ſhall order him to Canada or Lake-George, as may appear moſt proper. It is certainly neceſſary that he or Dr. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſhould go to the former. The reſolve reſpecting general Wooſter's recal I will immediately tranſmit him, with directions to repair hither without delay.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of our affairs in Canada, as reported by the honourable commiſſioners, is truly alarming; and I am ſorry that my opinion of the ill conſequences reſulting from the ſhort enliſtment of the army ſhould be but too well confirmed by the experience they have had of the want of diſcipline and order in our ſoldiery there. This induces me again to wiſh Congreſs to determine on a lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral allowance to engage the troops already in ſervice to re-enliſt for a longer period, or during the continuance of the war; nor can I forbear expreſſing my opinion of the propriety of keeping the military cheſt always ſupplied with money, as evils of the moſt intereſting nature are often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for want of a regular payment of troops. The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect makes them impatient and uneaſy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="149" facs="unknown:029737_0148_0FE24826D1C9CD70"/>
I am much ſurpriſed at the ſcarcity of proviſions there, particularly of flour; as, from ſeveral accounts I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from thence, I was led to expect that conſiderable ſupplies of that article could be procured there. That our misfortunes may not become greater, I have wrote to the commiſſary to forward more proviſions, in addition to thoſe already ſent.</p>
                     <p>An adjutant and quarter-maſter-general are indiſpenſably neceſſary, with aſſiſtants. The money ſaved to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent by their non-appointment will be but ſmall and trifling, when put in competition with the loſs for want of them. Colonel Fleming, who acted in the former capacity under general Montgomery, is now here: but his indiſpoſition is ſuch as to render him unfit, at this time, for the poſt:—it is an important one, and requires vigour and activity to diſcharge the duties of it. He will be of much ſervice to colonel Reed, the buſineſs of whoſe office will increaſe conſiderably by the augmentation of the army.</p>
                     <p>It will be neceſſary, too, that the commiſſaries in Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada, and the deputy quarter-maſter-generals, ſhould have ſeveral aſſiſtants and clerks: nor do I think a preciſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber can be fixed on, as a variety of circumſtances may and muſt occur, to render the number, eſſential for doing the buſineſs in thoſe departments, greater or leſs at different times. It will be better, I apprehend, to leave it indef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inite, and with power to the commanding officer to allow ſuch as may be wanted.</p>
                     <p>I am ſtill in the dark, how the unfortunate affair ended at the Cedars, or on what terms the ſurrender was made, as the laſt letter from the commiſſioners has reference to a former, and mentions an agreement entered into, which I have not ſeen: but I know of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> more than I could wiſh.</p>
                     <p>I have received from Providence, in conſequence of Mr. Morris's order, as chairman of the ſecret committee of Congreſs, two hundred and thirty-four muſkets, in part of the two hundred and forty-four directed to be ſent. The incloſed copy of a letter from Mr. Brown will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the deficiency.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall be much obliged by your ordering a quantity of lead and flints to be immediately forwarded: our demands for both are and will be very preſſing. There are alſo want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:029737_0149_0FE2482E560D9D58"/>
ſome particular and neceſſary medicines to complete our hoſpital cheſts, of which I will get Dr. Morgan to furniſh Congreſs with a liſt, when he writes or waits on them about ſome other matters neceſſary to be fixed in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment.</p>
                     <p>As general Wooſter, in all probability, will be here in a little time in compliance with the reſolve of Congreſs and my order tranſmitted to him, I wiſh to know what I am to do with him when he comes.</p>
                     <p>General Schuyler, in his letter of the thirty-firſt ultimo, of which I tranſmitted you a copy yeſterday, mentions that ſundry perſons had a deſign to ſeize him as a tory, and probably ſtill have; and wiſhes Congreſs to give him ſome public mark of their approbation, if they are convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his zeal and attachment to the cauſe of his country. Whether he intended that I ſhould communicate his deſire to them, or not, I am not certain: but, ſuppoſing that he did, I muſt beg leave to requeſt that you will lay the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agraph before them, that they may do, in the inſtance of his requiſition, whatever they may judge neceſſary.</p>

If Congreſs have agreed to the report of the committee for allowing the Indians fifty pounds for every priſoner they ſhall take at Niagara, &amp;c. it is material I ſhould be informed of it. This will be a favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for them to embrace, to gain poſſeſſion of Detroit and the other poſts, whilſt the enemy are engaged towards Montréal, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>SINCE I did myſelf the honour of writing to you yeſterday, I have had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing, and for a few minutes converſing with Mr. Chaſe and Mr. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll, from Canada. Their account of our troops and the ſituation of affairs in that department cannot poſſibly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe you more than it has done me. But I need not touch upon a ſubject which you will be ſo well informed of from the fountain-head; nor ſhould I have given you the trouble of a letter by this day's poſt, but for the diſtraction
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:029737_0150_0FE24881324195D8"/>
which ſeems to prevail in the commiſſary's department, as well as others in that quarter,—the neceſſity of having it under one general direction,—and the diſſatisfaction of colonel Trumbull at the allowance made him by Congreſs as an equivalent for his trouble. With reſpect to this particular matter, I can only ſay that I think he is a man well [<hi>calculated</hi>] for the buſineſs, and that, where a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is ſaved in the pay, a pound may be loſt by miſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement in the office; and that his reſignation at this time (I mean this campaign) may poſſibly be attended with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal conſequences. I therefore humbly ſubmit to Congreſs the propriety of handſomely rewarding thoſe gentlemen who hold ſuch very important, troubleſome, and hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offices, as commiſſary and quarter-maſter.</p>
                     <p>In ſpeaking to the former about the ſupplies neceſſary for the troops to be raiſed, he informed me that the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſalt proviſions which was ſhipping from hence might render his attempts to do it precarious; in conſequence of which, I deſired him to lay the matter before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of this colony, which he will do this day, but in the mean while deſired Congreſs might be informed of the matter, which I cannot better do than in his own words incloſed, and ſubmit the conſideration of it to the wiſdom of that honourable body.</p>
                     <p>To Congreſs I alſo ſubmit the propriety of keeping the two continental battalions (under the command of colonels Shee and M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Gaw) at Philadelphia, when there is the greateſt probability of a ſpeedy attack upon this place from the king's troops. The encouragements given by gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Tryon to the diſaffected, which are circulated, no one can well tell how,—the movements of theſe kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which are more eaſy to perceive than deſcribe,—the confident report, which is ſaid to have come immediately from governor Tryon, and brought by a frigate from Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifax, that the troops at that place were embarking for this,—added to a thouſand incidental circumſtances, trivial in themſelves, but ſtrong from compariſon,—leave not a doubt upon my mind but that troops are hourly expected at the Hook.</p>
                     <p>I had no doubt when I left this city for Philadelphia, but that ſome meaſures would have been taken to ſecure
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:029737_0151_0FE2482FDB1E90E0"/>
the ſuſpected and dangerous perſons of this government before now, and left orders for the military to give every aid to the civil power. But the ſubject is delicate, and nothing is done in it. We may therefore have internal as well as external enemies to contend with.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE the honour of tranſmitting to Congreſs a letter which came by expreſs laſt night from general Schuyler, incloſing a copy of a letter to him from colonel Kirkland. I have likewiſe incloſed the copy of one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to general Putnam or the commanding officer at New-York. The repreſentations contained in theſe letters have induced me, without waiting the determination of Congreſs, to direct general Schuyler immediately to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence a treaty with the Six Nations, and to engage them in our intereſt, upon the beſt terms he and his colleagues in commiſſion can procure: and I truſt the urgency of the occaſion will juſtify my proceeding to the Congreſs:—the neceſſity for deciſion and diſpatch in all our meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, in my opinion, becomes every day more and more apparent.</p>
                     <p>The expreſs, Mr. Bennet, was overtaken at Albany by general Schuyler, who had received intelligence at Fort-George that a conſiderable body of Mohawk Indians were coming down the Mohawk river under the conduct of Sir John Johnſton. The general's extreme hurry would not allow him to write: but it ſeems his intention is to collect at Albany a ſufficient force to oppoſe Sir John. I have given him my opinion that colonel Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's regiment ſhould be employed in that ſervice, and to ſecure the poſt where Fort-Stanwix formerly ſtood.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence of an information that ſeveral mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants were exporting ſalt pork and beef from this place, I requeſted the commiſſary to make application to the provincial Congreſs for a reſtraint to be laid on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of thoſe articles, as I apprehended, not only that the enemy might receive ſupplies by the capture of
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:029737_0152_0FE24882B6613038"/>
our veſſels, but that our people might ſhortly experience a ſcarcity. The provincial Congreſs have accordingly made a reſolution (a copy of which is incloſed) to ſtop the exportation for fourteen days. They expect Congreſs will in the mean time frame ſome general regulations on this head. They are unwilling (they ſay) to ſubject their conſtituents to partial reſtraints.</p>
                     <p>I once mentioned to Congreſs that I thought a war-office extremely neceſſary, and they ſeemed inclined to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute one for our army; but the affair ſeems to have been ſince dropped. Give me leave again to inſiſt on the util<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and importance of ſuch an eſtabliſhment. The more I reflect upon the ſubject, the more I am convinced of its neceſſity, and that affairs can never be properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted without it.</p>
                     <p>It is with pleaſure I receive the reſolve incloſed in your favour of the eleventh inſtant. One conſiderable ground of diſſatisfaction in the army is thereby removed.</p>
                     <p>I have employed perſons in building the gondolas and rafts which the Congreſs thought neceſſary for the defence of this place; and, in conjunction with the provincial Congreſs, have determined to ſink chevaux-de-friſe, one of which is already begun.</p>

From theſe you will learn that general Thomas died the ſecond inſtant; and the apprehenſions of our frontier friends in this colony, that our ſavage foes are meditating an attack againſt them.</p>
                     <p>I muſt beg leave to refer you to a paragraph in the copy of general Schuyler's letter to general Putnam or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer here, incloſed in mine of the thirteenth, where he requeſts a ſupply of cloathing to be ſent for the army in Canada. As there is but little or no probability of
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:029737_0153_0FE248315DD2C400"/>
getting it here, I ſhall be glad to know whether there will be any chance of procuring it in Philadelphia; and, if it ſhould be ſent through the hands of the quarter-maſter here, to what account it is to be charged.</p>
                     <p>I was laſt evening favoured with yours of the eleventh inſtant, and hope the two battalions, which Congreſs have ordered from Philadelphia for the defence of this place, will come provided with arms. If they do not, they will be of no ſervice, as there are more troops here already than are armed.</p>
                     <p>From general Schuyler's letter, he has in view the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſt where Fort-Stanwix formerly ſtood. I wrote him I thought it prudent, previous to that, to ſecure a poſt lower down, about the falls below the German-Flats, leſt the ſavages ſhould poſſeſs themſelves of the country, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſupplies of men and proviſions that may be neceſſary to ſend there in future. He ſays he is in want of cannon and ammunition; but has expreſſed himſelf ſo ambiguouſly, that I am at a loſs to know whether he meant what he has ſaid as an application or not,—this being the only intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence on the ſubject, and the firſt mention of his want. I have deſired him to explain the matter, and, in his future requiſitions for neceſſaries, to be more certain and explicit as to quantity and quality. In the mean time I ſhall ſend him ſome intrenching tools, and inquire whether there are any cannon that can be ſpared from hence.</p>

The intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence communicated by him is pleaſing and intereſting, and ſuch as muſt afford the greateſt ſatisfaction, if the conduct the Canadians have diſcovered ſince his arrival among them is ingenuous and ſincere.</p>
                     <p>General Sullivan mentions his having given commiſſions to ſome of the Canadians as a meaſure founded in neceſſity, and requeſts my approbation of it. But not conſidering
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:029737_0154_0FE2488565F11E98"/>
myſelf empowered to ſay any thing upon the ſubject, it may not be improper for Congreſs to give him their opinion in this inſtance.</p>
                     <p>I have alſo incloſed copies of general Schuyler's letters received at the ſame time. They contain accounts reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Indians, variant from what was reported by Mr. Kirkland, but amounting to the ſame thing,—the probabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the ſavages attacking our frontiers.</p>
                     <p>By laſt night's poſt I had information of a capture made by our armed veſſels, of one of the tranſports with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Highlanders on board, bound to Boſton. The in-cloſed extract from general Ward's letter to me will give you the intelligence more particularly. There are accounts in the city mentioning other valuable prizes: but as general Ward has ſaid nothing of them, I fear they want authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity.</p>
                     <p>I beg leave to mention that a further ſum of money will be wanted for our military cheſt by the time it can be ſent. The incloſed note from the pay-maſter-general ſhews the neceſſity for it; and, I may add, beſides his eſtimate of draughts to be made, there are the claims of the eaſtern troops at Boſton for three or four months' pay, not included, and now due.</p>
                     <p>Colonel M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Gaw is arrived with part of his battalion; and by Wedneſday evening the whole both of his and colonel Shee's will be here, as I am told.</p>
                     <p>As it is and may be of great importance to have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the Jerſies and Long-Iſland, I have had ſeveral flat-bottomed boats built for the purpoſe, and have thoughts of getting more for Poſaic and Hackinſac rivers, where they may be equally neceſſary for tranſporting our army or part of it occaſionally, or ſuccours coming to or going from it.</p>

                     <p>The inſtituting a war-office is certainly an event of great importance, and, in all probability, will be recorded as ſuch in the hiſtoric page. The benefits derived from it, I flatter myſelf, will be conſiderable, though the plan upon which it is firſt formed may not be entirely perfect. This, like other great works, in its firſt edition, may not be free from error:—time will diſcover its defects, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſuggeſt the remedy, and ſuch further improvements as may be neceſſary; but it was right to give it a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in my opinion.</p>
                     <p>The recommendation to the convention of New-York for reſtraining and puniſhing diſaffected perſons, I am hopeful, will be attended with ſalutary conſequences; and the prohibition againſt exporting proviſions appears to have been a meaſure founded in ſound policy, leſt proper ſupplies ſhould be wanted, wherewith to ſupply our armies.</p>
                     <p>I have tranſmitted general Schuyler the reſolves about the Indians, and the others on which he is to act; and have requeſted his ſtrict attention and exertions in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their being carried into execution with all poſſible diſpatch.</p>
                     <p>I note your requeſt reſpecting Mr. Hancock. He ſhall have ſuch directions as may be neceſſary for conducting
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:029737_0156_0FE2488B834802F8"/>
his office; and I am happy he will have ſo early a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance for paying the troops in his department.</p>
                     <p>The ſilver and paper money deſigned for Canada will be highly ſerviceable, and I hope will be the means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhing our credit there in ſome degree with the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adians, and alſo encourage our men too, who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in this inſtance. When it arrives, I will ſend it forward under a proper guard.</p>
                     <p>I have communicated to major-general Gates the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve of Congreſs for him to repair to Canada, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him to view Point-au-fer, that a fortreſs may be erected if he ſhall judge neceſſary. He is preparing for his command, and in a few days will take his departure for it. I would fain hope his arrival there will give our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs a complexion different from what they have worn for a long time paſt, and that many eſſential benefits will reſult from it.</p>
                     <p>The kind attention Congreſs have ſhewn to afford the commander-in-chief here every aſſiſtance, by reſolving that recommendatory letters be written to the conventions of New-Jerſey, New-York, and aſſembly of Connecticut, to authorize him to call in the militia in caſe of exigency, claims my thankful acknowledgments; and, I truſt, if carried into execution, will produce many advantages in caſe it may be expedient at any time to call in early rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements. The delays incident to the ordinary mode may frequently render their aid too late, and prove ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly injurious.</p>
                     <p>I this evening received intelligence of the nineteenth inſtant from captain Pond, of the armed ſloop Schuyler, of his having taken, about fifty miles from this, on the ſouth ſide of Long-Iſland, a ſhip and a ſloop bound to Sandy-Hook. The ſhip, from Glaſgow, with a company of the forty-ſecond regiment, had been taken by one of commodore Hopkins's fleet, who took the ſoldiers out, and ordered her to Rhode-Iſland; after which, ſhe was retaken by the Cerberus, and put under the convoy of the ſloop. As captain Pond informs me, there were five com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned officers, two ladies, and four privates on board. They are not yet arrived at head-quarters. Incloſed is an invoice of what they have on board.</p>

General Wooſter having expreſſed an inclination and wiſh to wait on Congreſs, I have given him permiſſion, not having any occaſion for him here. He ſet out this morning.</p>
                     <p>I have been up to view the grounds about Kingſbridge, and find them to admit of ſeveral places well calculated for defence; and, eſteeming it a paſs of the utmoſt importance, have ordered works to be laid out, and ſhall direct part of the two battalions from Pennſylvania to ſet about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution immediately, and will add to their number ſeveral of the militia when they come in, to expedite them with all poſſible diſpatch. Their conſequence, as they will keep open the communication with the country, requires the moſt ſpeedy completion of them.</p>

                     <p>I WAS this morning honoured with your favour of the nineteenth inſtant, with ſundry reſolves of Congreſs, which came to hand after I had cloſed mine of the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. I ſhall appoint a deputy muſter-maſter-general as ſoon as I can fix upon a proper perſon for the office, and direct him immediately to repair to Canada.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Bennet, the bearer of this, delivered me a letter to-day from general Schuyler, incloſing the proceedings of the commiſſioners of Indian affairs at a meeting at Albany in conſequence of the reſolution of Congreſs (as they ſay) which I tranſmitted, the ſeventh inſtant, for engaging the Indians in our ſervice. The gentlemen appear to me to have widely miſtaken the views of Congreſs in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and to have formed a plan for engaging ſuch Indians as were not in contemplation. I cannot account upon what principles they have gone, as a part of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhews they are about to hold a conference with the Six Nations. I ſuppoſe they eſteemed what they have done a neceſſary meaſure:—a copy of which I have the honour to incloſe you.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now beg leave to lay before Congreſs a propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to me by captain Leary of this city, in behalf
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:029737_0158_0FE2488E29708158"/>
of a body of men who are deſirous of being employed in the continental ſervice as a troop of horſe, and at the ſame time to offer my opinion that ſuch a corps may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely uſeful in many reſpects. In a march, they may be of the utmoſt ſervice in reconnoitring the enemy and gaining intelligence, and have it in their power to render many important benefits. The terms on which they are willing to engage are incloſed, which appear to me mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate and reaſonable. I am alſo informed that another company might readily be made up, and moſt probably upon the ſame terms. I would therefore ſubmit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and expediency of the meaſure to the conſideration of Congreſs, and wiſh their opinion whether it will be agreeable to them that both or either of them ſhould be formed and incorporated in this army, in manner as has been propoſed by captain Leary, if it can be done.</p>

I ſincerely wiſh the ſame ſucceſs had attended our arms in another quarter—but it has not. In Canada, the ſituation of our affairs is truly alarming. The incloſed copies of generals Schuyler, Sullivan, and Arnold's letters will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you that general Thompſon has met with a repulſe at Three-Rivers, and is now a priſoner in the hands of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Burgoyne, who (theſe accounts ſay) is arrived with a conſiderable army. Nor do they ſeem to promiſe an end of our misfortunes here:—it is greatly to be feared that the next advices from thence will be, that our ſhattered, divided, and broken army (as you will ſee by the return) have been obliged to abandon the country, and retreat, to avoid a greater calamity,—that of being cut off or becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing priſoners. I will have done upon the ſubject, and leave you to draw ſuch concluſions as you conceive from the ſtate of facts are moſt likely to reſult, only adding my apprehenſions that one of the latter events,—either that they are cut off, or become priſoners,—has already happened, if they did not retreat while they had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. General Schuyler and general Arnold ſeem to think it extremely probable: and if it has taken place, it will not be eaſy to deſcribe all the fatal conſequences that may flow from it. At leaſt our utmoſt exertions will be neceſſary, to prevent the advantages they have gained being turned to our greater misfortunes. General Gates will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſet out to-morrow, and would have gone before now had he not expected to receive ſome particular inſtructions from Congreſs, which colonel Braxton ſaid he imagined would be given, and tranſmitted here.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed is a copy of a letter from general Arnold, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting ſome of the Indian tribes, to general Schuyler, and of a talk had at Albany with thirteen of the Oneidas. They ſeemed then to entertain a friendly diſpoſition towards us, which I wiſh may not be changed by the misfortunes we have ſuſtained in Canada.</p>

                     <p>I THIS morning received, by expreſs, letters from generals Schuyler and Arnold, with a copy of one from
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:029737_0160_0FE2488FAE88B070"/>
general Sullivan to the former, and alſo of others to gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sullivan; of all which I do myſelf the honour to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you copies. They will give you a further account of the melancholy ſituation of our affairs in Canada, and ſhew that there is nothing left to ſave our army there but evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the country.</p>
                     <p>I am hopeful general Sullivan would retreat from the Iſle-aux-noix without waiting for previous orders for that purpoſe; as, from generals Schuyler and Arnold's letters, it is much to be feared, by remaining there any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, his retreat would be cut off, or at leaſt be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of extreme difficulty. I would obſerve to Congreſs that it is not in my power to ſend any carpenters from hence to build the gondolas and gallies general Arnold mentions, without taking them from a work equally neceſſary (if not more ſo) here, of the ſame kind:—and ſubmit it to them whether it may not be adviſeable (as it is of great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to us to have a number of thoſe veſſels on the Lake, to prevent the enemy's paſſing) to withdraw the carpenters for the preſent from the frigates building up the North-river, and detach them immediately, with all that can be got at Philadelphia, for that purpoſe and carrying on thoſe here.</p>
                     <p>I have the pleaſure to inform you of another capture made by our armed veſſels, of a tranſport, on the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth inſtant, with a company of Highland grenadiers on board. The incloſed extract of a letter from general Ward, by laſt night's poſt, contains the particulars; to which I beg leave to refer you.</p>
                     <p>I have been honoured with your favours of the twenty-firſt and twenty-fifth inſtant in due order, with their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant incloſures, to which I ſhall particularly attend. I have tranſmitted general Schuyler a copy of the reſolve of Congreſs reſpecting the Mohickan and Stockbridge In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and directed him to put an immediate ſtop to the raiſing the two companies.</p>
                     <p>The quarter-maſter-general has been called upon for ſtopping the tents deſigned for Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to forward them immediately. He means to write to Congreſs upon the ſubject, and hopes his conduct will
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:029737_0161_0FE2483DDBF132C0"/>
not appear to deſerve their reprehenſion. Of this they will judge from his relation of the matter.</p>
                     <p>Being extremely deſirous to forward the intelligence from Canada to Congreſs, well knowing their anxiety about our affairs there, I muſt defer writing upon ſome other matters I want to lay before them, until the next oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, which I hope will be to-morrow, when I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them fully upon the ſubject of rations, having deſired the commiſſary-general to furniſh me with ſome things neceſſary in that inſtance.</p>

                     <p>UPON information that major * * * was travelling through the country under ſuſpicious circumſtances, I thought it neceſſary to have him ſecured. I therefore ſent after him. He was taken at South-Amboy, and brought up to New-York. Upon examination, he inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me that he came from New-Hampſhire, the country of his uſual abode, where he had left his family; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he was deſtined to Philadelphia on buſineſs with Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>As by his own confeſſion he had croſſed Hudſon's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>river at New-Windſor, and was taken ſo far out of his proper and direct route to Philadelphia—this conſideration, added to the length of time he had taken to perform his journey,—his being found in ſo ſuſpicious a place as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy,—his unneceſſary ſtay there on pretence of getting ſome baggage from New-York, and an expectation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving money from a perſon here, of bad character, and in no circumſtances to furniſh him out of his own ſtock,—the major's reputation, and his being a half-pay officer, have increaſed my jealouſies about him.</p>
                     <p>The buſineſs, which he informs me he has with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, is a ſecret offer of his ſervices, to the end that, in caſe it ſhould be rejected, he might have his way left open to an employment in the Eaſt-Indies, to which he is aſſigned: and in that caſe he flatters himſelf he will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain leave of Congreſs to go to Great-Britain.</p>

As he had been put upon his parole by Congreſs, I thought it would be improper to ſtay his progreſs to Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adelphia, ſhould he be in fact deſtined thither. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſend him forward, but (to prevent impoſition) under the care of an officer, with letters found upon him, which, from their tenour, ſeem calculated to recommend him to Congreſs. I ſubmit it to their conſideration, whether it would not be dangerous to accept of the offer of his ſervices.</p>

                     <p>IN compliance with the requeſt of Congreſs contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your favour of the twenty-fifth inſtant, and my prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe of yeſterday, I do myſelf the honour to inform you that the coſt of a ration, according to the commiſſary-general's eſtimate, from the firſt of July to the firſt of December, will be from eight-pence to eight-pence halfpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, York currency.</p>
                     <p>Having diſcharged the obligation I was under in this inſtance, and finding that many applications have been made for victualling the flying camp, I would, with all poſſible deference, wiſh Congreſs to conſider the matter well before they come to any determination upon it. Who the gentlemen are that have made offers upon this occaſion, I know not: conſequently my objections to their appointment cannot proceed from perſonal diſlike; nor have I it in view to ſerve Mr. Trumbull the commiſſary-general, by wiſhing him to have the direction of the whole ſupplies for his emolument; becauſe whatever rations are taken from him ſave him the trouble of ſupplying proviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions to the amount, without diminiſhing his pay,—that being fixed and certain:—but what influences me is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the public good. I am morally certain, if the buſineſs is taken out of Mr. Trumbull's hands and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another's, that it may and will in all probability be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with great and many inconveniences. It is likely, during the continuance of the war between us and Great-Britain, that the army here, or part of it, and the troops
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:029737_0163_0FE2483F6183A6A0"/>
compoſing the flying camp, will be frequently joined, and under the neceſſity of affording each other mutual aid. If this event is probable (and moſt certainly it is) the ſame confuſion and diſorder will reſult from having two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries, or one commiſſary and one contractor in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> army in the ſame department, as did between Mr. Trumbull and Mr. Livingſton on the coming of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to New-York. I cannot diſcriminate the two caſes; and not foreſeeing that any good conſequences will flow from the meaſure, but that many bad ones will,—ſuch as claſhing of intereſts,—a contention for ſtores, carriages,—and many other cauſes that might be mentioned if hurry of buſineſs would permit,—I confeſs I cannot perceive the propriety of appointing a different perſon, or any but the commiſſary.</p>
                     <p>I would alſo add, that few armies, if any, have been better ſupplied than the troops under Mr. Trumbull's care in this inſtance; which, I ſhould ſuppoſe, ought to have conſiderable weight, eſpecially as we have ſtrong reaſons to believe that a large ſhare of the misfortunes our arms have ſuſtained in Canada ſprang from a want of proper and neceſſary ſupplies of proviſions.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Trumbull too (I am informed) has already made proviſion in New-Jerſey for the flying camp which will be ſtationed there, and employed proper perſons in that colony to tranſact the buſineſs incident to his department, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to my orders, and in full confidence that it was to come under his management.</p>
                     <p>My great deſire to ſee the affairs of this important poſt, on which ſo much depends, go on in an eaſy, ſmooth and uninterrupted courſe, has led me to ſay thus much upon the ſubject, and will, I hope, (if I am unhappy enough to differ in opinion with Congreſs) plead my excuſe for the liberty I have taken.</p>
                     <p>I would alſo beg leave to mention to Congreſs the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity there is of ſome new regulations being entered into, reſpecting the chaplains of this army. They will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that applications were made to increaſe their pay, which was conceived too low for their ſupport; and that it was propoſed (if it could not be done for the whole) that the number ſhould be leſſened, and one be appointed
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:029737_0164_0FE2489B045F5AB0"/>
to two regiments, with an additional allowance. This latter expedient was adopted, and, while the army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued all together at one encampment, anſwered well, or at leaſt did not produce many inconveniences. But the army now being differently circumſtanced from what it then was,—part here, part at Boſton, and a third part detached to Canada,—has introduced much confuſion and diſorder in this inſtance; nor do I know how it is poſſible to remedy the evil, but by affixing one to each regiment, with ſalaries competent to their ſupport. No ſhifting, no change from one regiment to another can anſwer the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and in many caſes it could never be done though the regiments ſhould conſent,—as where detachments are compoſed of unequal numbers, or ordered from different poſts. Many more inconveniences might be pointed out: but theſe, it is preſumed, will ſufficiently ſhew the defect of the preſent eſtabliſhment, and the propriety of an alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. What that alteration ſhall be, Congreſs will pleaſe to determine.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs, I doubt not, will have heard of the plot that was forming among many diſaffected perſons in this city and government for aiding the king's troops upon their arrival. No regular plan ſeems to have been digeſted: but ſeveral perſons have been enliſted, and ſworn to join them. The matter, I am in hopes, by a timely diſcovery, will be ſuppreſſed and put a ſtop to. Many citizens and others, among whom is the mayor, are now in confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The matter has been traced up to governor Tryon; and the mayor appears to have been a principal agent, or go-between him and the perſons concerned in it. The plot had been communicated to ſome of the army, and part of my guard engaged in it. T * * * H * * *, one of them, has been tried, and, by the unanimous opinion of a court-martial, is ſentenced to die,—having enliſted himſelf, and engaged others. The ſentence, by the advice of the whole council of general officers, will be put in execution to-day at eleven o'clock. The others are not tried. I am hopeful this example will produce many ſalutary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, and deter others from entering into the like traitorous practices.</p>

The incloſed copy of a reſolve of the provincial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will ſhew that ſome of the diſaffected on Long-Iſland have taken up arms.

                     <p>I could wiſh general Howe and his armament not to arrive yet, as not more than a thouſand militia have yet come in, and our whole force (including the troops at all the detached poſts, and on board the armed veſſels, which are comprehended in our returns) is but ſmall and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, when compared with the extenſive lines they are to defend, and (moſt probably) the army that he brings.

                     <p>I was laſt night honoured with your favour of the twenty-ſixth inſtant, and, agreeable to your requeſt, ſhall pay proper attention to the reſolves it incloſed.</p>
                     <p>I obſerve the augmentation Congreſs have reſolved to make to the forces deſtined for the northern department, and the bounty to be allowed ſuch ſoldiers as will enliſt for three years. I hope many good conſequences will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from theſe meaſures; and that, from the latter, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:029737_0166_0FE2489C88D8B988"/>
number of men may be induced to engage in the ſervice.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould eſteem myſelf extremely happy to afford the leaſt aſſiſtance to the Canada department in compliance with the deſire of Congreſs and your requiſition, were it in my power: but it is not. The return which I tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted yeſterday will but too well convince Congreſs of my incapacity in this inſtance, and point out to them that the force I now have is trifling, conſidering the many and important poſts that are neceſſary, and muſt be ſupported, if poſſible. But few militia have yet come in, the whole being about twelve hundred, including the two battalions of this city, and one company from the Jerſies. I wiſh the delay may not be attended with diſagreeable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and their aid may not come too late, or when it may not be wanted. I have wrote, I have done every thing I could, to call them in: but they have not come, though I am told that they are generally willing.</p>
                     <p>The accounts communicated yeſterday through lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Daviſon's letter are partly confirmed, and, I dare ſay, will turn out to be true on the whole. For two or three days paſt, three or four ſhips have been dropping in; and I juſt now received an expreſs from an officer appointed to keep a look-out on Staten-Iſland, that forty-five arrived at the Hook to-day:—ſome ſay more; and I ſuppoſe the whole fleet will be in, within a day or two. I am hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, before they are prepared to attack, that I ſhall get ſome reinforcements. Be that as it may, I ſhall attempt to make the beſt diſpoſition I can of our troops, in order to give them a proper reception, and to prevent the ruin and deſtruction they are meditating againſt us.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the expreſs arrived laſt night, I ſent the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the northern colonies to the quarter-maſter-general, with orders to forward them immediately.</p>
                     <p>When monſieur Wiebert comes, (I have not ſeen him yet) I ſhall employ him as Congreſs have directed. The terms upon which he offers his ſervice ſeem to promiſe ſomething from him. I wiſh he may anſwer, and be ſkill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the buſineſs he ſays he is acquainted with.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I HAD the pleaſure of receiving your favour of the twenty-ninth early this morning, with which you have been pleaſed to honour me, together with the reſolves for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther augmentation of our army.</p>
                     <p>The battalion of Germans, which Congreſs have order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be raiſed, will be a corps of much ſervice; and I am hopeful that ſuch perſons will be appointed officers, as will complete their enliſtments with all poſſible expedition.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall communicate to colonel Stevenſon and one of his field-officers what you have requeſted, and direct them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair immediately to Philadelphia. It is an unlucky cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that the term of enliſtment of theſe three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and of the rifle battalion, ſhould expire at this time when a hot campaign is, in all probability, about to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence.</p>
                     <p>Canada, it is certain, would have been an important ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, and well worth the expenſes incurred in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of it. But as we could not reduce it to our poſſeſſion, the retreat of our army with ſo little loſs, under ſuch a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of diſtreſſes, muſt be eſteemed a moſt fortunate event. It is true, the accounts we have received do not fully au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe us to ſay that we have ſuſtained no loſs: but they hold forth a probable ground for ſuch concluſion. I am anxious to hear it confirmed.</p>
                     <p>I have the honour of tranſmitting you an extract of a letter received laſt night from general Ward. If the ſcheme the privateers had in view, and the meaſures he had planned, have been carried into execution, the Highland corps will be tolerably well diſpoſed of: but I fear the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate event has not taken place.</p>
                     <p>In general Ward's letter, was incloſed one from lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant-colonel Campbell, who was made priſioner with the Highland troops. I have tranſmitted you a copy. This will give you a full and exact account of the number of priſoners that were on board the four tranſports; and will prove, beyond a poſſibility of doubt, that the evacuation of Boſton by the Britiſh troops was a matter neither known nor expected when he received his orders. Indeed ſo
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:029737_0168_0FE2489E0E365610"/>
many facts had concurred before to ſettle the matter, that no additional proofs were neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>When I had the honour of addreſſing you yeſterday, I had only been informed of the arrival of forty-five of the fleet in the morning. Since that, I have received authentic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence from ſundry perſons (among them, from general Greene) that a hundred and ten ſail came in before night, that were counted, and that more were ſeen about duſk in the offing. I have no doubt but the whole that ſailed from Halifax are now at the Hook.</p>
                     <p>Juſt as I was about to conclude my letter, I received one from a gentleman upon the ſubject of calling the five regiments from Boſton to the defence of Canada or New-York, and to have militia raiſed in their lieu. I have ſent you a copy, and ſhall only obſerve, that I know the author well: his hand-writing is quite familiar to me: he is a member of the General Court, very ſenſible, of great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and a warm and zealous friend to the cauſe of Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica. The expedient propoſed by him is ſubmitted to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>

                     <p>SINCE I had the honour of addreſſing you, and on the ſame day, ſeveral ſhips more arrived within the Hook, making the number that came in then a hundred and ten; and there remains no doubt of the whole of the fleet from Halifax being now here. Yeſterday evening fifty of them came up the bay and anchored on the Staten-Iſland ſide. Their views I cannot preciſely determine; but am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely apprehenſive, as part of them only came, that they mean to ſurround the iſland, and ſecure the ſtock upon it. I had conſulted with a committee of the provincial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs upon the ſubject, before the arrival of the fleet; and they appointed a perſon to ſuperintend the buſineſs, and to drive the ſtock off. I alſo wrote to brigadier-general Heard, and directed him to the meaſure leſt it might be neglected; but am fearful it has not been effected.</p>

Our reinforcement of militia is yet but ſmall:—I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſcertain the amount, not having got a return. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I truſt, if the enemy make an attack, they will meet with a repulſe, as I have the pleaſure to inform you that an agreeable ſpirit and willingneſs for action ſeem to animate and pervade the whole of our troops.</p>
                     <p>As it is difficult to determine what objects the enemy may have in contemplation, and whether they may not detach ſome part of their force to Amboy, and to ravage that part of the country, if not extend their views farther, I ſubmit it to Congreſs whether it may not be expedient for them to repeat and preſs home their requeſts to the different governments that are to provide men for the fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing camp, to furniſh their quotas with all poſſible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch. It is a matter of great importance, and will be of ſerious conſequence, to have the camp eſtabliſhed in caſe the enemy ſhould be able to poſſeſs themſelves of this river, and cut off the ſupplies of troops that might be nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary on certain emergencies to be ſent from hence.</p>
                     <p>I muſt entreat your attention to an application I made ſome time ago for flints. We are extremely deficient in this neceſſary article, and ſhall be greatly diſtreſſed if we cannot obtain a ſupply. Of lead we have a ſufficient quantity for the whole campaign, taken off the houſes here.</p>
                     <p>Eſteeming it of infinite advantage to prevent the enemy from getting freſh proviſions, and horſes for their waggons, artillery, &amp;c, I gave orders to a party of our men on Staten-Iſland (ſince writing to general Heard) to drive the ſtock off without waiting for the aſſiſtance or direction of the committees there, leſt their ſlow mode of tranſacting buſineſs might produce too much delay;—and have ſent this morning to know what they have done. I am this morning informed by a gentleman, that the committee of Elizabeth-Town ſent their company of light-horſe on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to effect it, and that ſome of their militia were to give their aid yeſterday. He adds that he was credibly told laſt night by a party of the militia coming to this place, that yeſterday they ſaw a good deal of ſtock driving off the
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:029737_0170_0FE2489F92DBE950"/>

                     <p>WHEN I had the honour to addreſs you on the thirtieth ultimo, I tranſmitted a copy of a letter I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from a gentleman, a member of the honourable Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Court, <hi>[of Maſſachuſetts]</hi> ſuggeſting the improbability of ſuccours coming from thence in any reaſonable time, either for the defence of this place, or to reinforce our troops engaged in the Canada expedition. I am ſorry to inform you, that, from a variety of intelligence, his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions appear to be juſt, and to be fully confirmed: nor have I reaſon to expect but that the ſupplies from the other two governments, Connecticut and New-Hampſhire, will be extremely ſlow and greatly deficient in number.</p>
                     <p>As it now ſeems beyond queſtion, and clear to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that the enemy mean to direct their operations
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:029737_0171_0FE2484D14DD1850"/>
and bend their moſt vigorous efforts againſt this colony, and will attempt to unite their two armies,—that under general Burgoyne, and the one arrived here,—I cannot but think the expedient propoſed by that gentleman is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly juſt; and that the continental regiments, now in the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, ſhould be immediately called from thence, and be employed where there is the ſtrongeſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe their aid will be indiſpenſably neceſſary. The expediency of the meaſure I ſhall ſubmit to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Congreſs, and will only obſerve, as my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, that there is not the moſt diſtant proſpect of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt being made, where they now are, by the enemy; and, if there ſhould, that the militia that can be aſſembled upon the ſhorteſt notice will be more than equal to repel it. They are well armed, reſolute, and determined, and will inſtantly oppoſe any invaſion that may be made in their own colony.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall alſo take the liberty again to requeſt Congreſs to intereſt themſelves in having the militia raiſed and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with all poſſible expedition, as faſt as any conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable number of them can be collected, that are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the flying camp. This I mentioned in my letter yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, but think proper to repeat it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ing more and more convinced of the neceſſity. The camp will be in the neighbourhood of Amboy: and I ſhall be glad that the conventions, or committees of ſafety, of thoſe governments from whence they come, may be requeſted to give me previous notice of their marching, that I may form ſome plan, and direct proviſion to be made for their reception.</p>
                     <p>The diſaffection of the people at that place and others not far diſtant is exceedingly great; and, unleſs it is checked and overawed, it may become more general, and be very alarming. The arrival of the enemy will encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age it. They, or at leaſt a part of them, are already land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Staten-Iſland, which is quite contiguous; and about four thouſand were marching about it yeſterday, as I have been adviſed, and are leaving no arts un-eſſayed to gain the inhabitants to their ſide, who ſeem but too favourably diſpoſed. It is not unlikely that in a little time they may attempt to croſs to the Jerſey ſide, and induce many to
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:029737_0172_0FE248A69A860DE8"/>
join them, either from motives of intereſt or fear, unleſs there is a force to oppoſe them.</p>
                     <p>As we are fully convinced that the miniſterial army we ſhall have to oppoſe this campaign will be great and numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and well know that the utmoſt induſtry will be uſed, as it already has been, to excite the ſavages and every body of people to arms againſt us whom they can influence, it certainly behoves us to ſtrain every nerve to counteract their deſigns. I would therefore ſubmit it to Congreſs, whether (eſpecially as our ſchemes for employing the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Indians do not ſeem to be attended with any great proſpect of ſucceſs, from general Schuyler's accounts) it may not be adviſeable to take meaſures to engage thoſe of the eaſtward, the St. John's, Nova-Scotia, Penobſcot, &amp;c. in our favour. I have been told that ſeveral might be got, perhaps five or ſix hundred or more, readily to join us. If they can, I ſhould imagine it ought to be done. It will prevent our enemies from ſecuring their friendſhip; and further they will be of infinite ſervice in annoying and haraſſing them, ſhould they ever attempt to penetrate the country. Congreſs will be pleaſed to conſider the meaſure: and if they determine to adopt it, I conceive it will be neceſſary to authoriſe and requeſt the General Court of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay to carry it into execution. Their ſituation and advantages will enable them to negociate a treaty and an alliance better than it can be done by any perſons elſe.</p>
                     <p>I have been honoured with your two favours of the firſt inſtant; and, agreeable to the wiſhes of Congreſs, ſhall put monſieur Wiebert in the beſt place I can to prove his abilities in the art he profeſſes. I ſhall ſend him up imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the works erecting towards Kingſbridge under the diſcretion of general Mifflin, whom I ſhall requeſt to employ him.</p>
                     <p>I this moment received a letter from general Greene, an extract of which I have incloſed. The intelligence it contains is of the moſt important nature, and evinces the neceſſity of the moſt ſpirited and vigorous exertions on our part.</p>
                     <p>The expectation of the fleet under admiral Howe is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the reaſon the army already come have not begun
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:029737_0173_0FE248569C2BAF68"/>
their hoſtile operations. When that arrives, we may look for the moſt intereſting events, and ſuch as, in all probabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, will have conſiderable weight in the preſent conteſt. It behoves us to be prepared in the beſt manner: and I ſubmit it again to Congreſs, whether the accounts given by their priſoners do not ſhew the propriety of calling the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral continental regiments from the Maſſachuſetts govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, raiſing the flying camp with all poſſible diſpatch, and engaging the eaſtern Indians.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>July</hi> 5.—General Mercer arrived here on Tueſday, and, the next morning, was ordered to Paulus-Hook to make ſome arrangements of the militia as they came in, and the beſt diſpoſition he could to prevent the enemy croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Staten-Iſland, if they ſhould have any ſuch views. The diſtreſſed ſituation of the inhabitants of Elizabeth-Town and Newark has ſince induced me, upon their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to give up all the militia from the Jerſies, except thoſe engaged for ſix months. I am hopeful they will be able to repel any incurſions that may be attempted. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erals Mercer and Livingſton are concerting plans for that purpoſe. By a letter from the latter laſt night, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the enemy are throwing up ſmall works at all the paſſes on the north ſide of Staten-Iſland, which it is prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able they mean to ſecure.</p>
                     <p>None of the Connecticut militia are yet arrived: ſo that the reinforcement we have received is very inconſiderable.</p>
                     <p>A letter from general Schuyler, with ſundry incloſures, (of which N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1, 2 and 3 are exact copies) this moment came to hand, and will no doubt claim, as it ought to do, the immediate attention of Congreſs. The evils which muſt inevitably follow a diſputed command, are too obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and alarming to admit a moment's delay in your deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereupon: and, although I do not preſume to adviſe in a matter, now, of this delicacy, yet as it appears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the northern army has retreated to Crown-Point, and mean to act upon the defenſive only, I cannot help giving it as my opinion that one of the major-gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als in that quarter would be more uſefully employed here, or in the flying camp, than there: for it becomes my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to obſerve, if another experienced officer is taken from hence in order to command the flying camp, that your
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:029737_0174_0FE248A92F3795E0"/>
grand army will be entirely ſtripped of generals who have ſeen ſervice,—being in a manner already deſtitute of ſuch. My diſtreſs on this account,—the appointment of general Whitcomb to the eaſtern regiments,—a convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my own breaſt that no troops will be ſent to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,—and the certainty of a number coming to this place,—occaſioned my poſtponing, from time to time, ſending any general officer from hence to the eaſtward heretofore: and now I ſhall wait the ſentiments of Congreſs relative to the five regiments in Maſſachuſetts-Bay, before I do any thing in this matter.</p>
                     <p>The commiſſary-general has been with me this morning concerning the other matter contained in general Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's letter reſpecting the buſineſs of that department. He has, I believe, (in order to remove difficulties) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called Mr. Avery, but ſeems to think it neceſſary in that caſe that Mr. Livingſton ſhould be left to himſelf, as he cannot be reſponſible for perſons not of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This matter ſhould alſo be clearly defined by Congreſs. I have already given my opinion of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of theſe matters being under one general direction, in ſo full and clear a manner, that I ſhall not take up the time of Congreſs to repeat it in this place.</p>

                     <p>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your two favours of the fourth and ſixth inſtant, which came duly to hand, with their important incloſures.</p>
                     <p>I perceive that Congreſs have been employed in delib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erating on meaſures of the moſt intereſting nature. It is certain that it is not with us to determine in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances what conſequences will flow from our councils: but yet it behoves us to adopt ſuch, as, under t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> ſmiles of a gracious and all-kind Providence, will be moſt likely to promote our happineſs. I truſt the late deciſive part they have taken is calculated for that end, and will ſecure us that freedom and thoſe privileges, which have been and are refuſed us, contrary to the voice of nature and the Britiſh conſtitution. Agreeable to the requeſt of Congreſs, I cauſed "THE DECLARATION" to be proclaimed before all the army under my immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and have the pleaſure to inform them that the meaſure ſeemed to have their moſt hearty aſſent,—the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and behaviour, both of officers and men, teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their warmeſt approbation of it. I have tranſmitted a copy to general Ward at Boſton, requeſting him to have it proclaimed to the continental troops in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment.</p>
                     <p>It is with great pleaſure that I hear the militia from Maryland, the Delaware government, and Pennſylvania, will be in motion every day to form the flying camp. It is of great importance, and ſhould be accompliſhed with all poſſible diſpatch. The readineſs and alacrity with which the committee of ſafety of Pennſylvania and the other conferees have acted in order to forward the aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated militia of that State to the Jerſies for ſervice till the men to compoſe the flying camp arrive, ſtrongly ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence their regard to the common cauſe, and that noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their part will be wanting to ſupport it. I hope, and I doubt not, that the aſſociated militia, impreſſed with the expediency of the meaſure, will immediately carry it into execution, and furniſh in this inſtance a proof of the continuance of that zeal which has ſo eminently marked their conduct. I have directed the commiſſary
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:029737_0176_0FE248AAB3A6A418"/>
to make the neceſſary proviſion for their reception, who will alſo ſupply the army for the flying camp with rations. A proper officer will be appointed to command it.</p>
                     <p>In purſuance of the power given me by Congreſs, and the advice of my general officers, I have wrote to general Ward, and deſired him forthwith to detach three of the fulleſt regiments from the Maſſachuſetts-Bay to join the northern army,—eſteeming it a matter of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to have a ſufficient force there to prevent the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy paſſing the Lake and making an impreſſion in that quarter. The gondolas and gallies will be of great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and I am hopeful the carpenters you have ſent from Philadelphia, and that will go from the eaſtward on your application, will be able to build a ſufficient number in time to anſwer every exigency.</p>
                     <p>I have requeſted governor Cooke, if the duck men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Mr. Greene's letter is proper for tents, to have it made up as early as poſſible, and forwarded here. I have alſo deſired him to ſend the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lints and ſmall arms, as I have general Ward thoſe of the latter that were tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en out of the Scotch tranſports,—our deficiency in theſe neceſſary articles being ſtill great.</p>
                     <p>Obſerving that Congreſs have particularly mentioned a bounty of ten dollars, to be paid to men of ſome corps directed to be raiſed in two or three inſtances ſince their reſolve of the twenty-ſixth of June, allowing ſuch boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I have been led to doubt how that reſolve is to be conſtrued; whether it is a general regulation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to all men that will engage for three years,—for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the ſoliders of the preſent army, if they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt for that time. If it is, and extends to them, it will be neceſſary to forward a large ſum of money: many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would engage.</p>
                     <p>I alſo obſerve, by their reſolve of the twenty-fifth of June for raiſing four regiments of militia in the eaſtern governments to augment the troops in the northern de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, that the aſſemblies of thoſe governments are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to appoint paymaſters to the ſaid regiments. This appears to me a regulation of great uſe, and I could wiſh that it was made general, and one allowed to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:029737_0177_0FE24859F30C2938"/>
regiment in the ſervice. Many advantages would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from it.</p>
                     <p>The Connecticut militia begin to come in: but from every account the battalions will be very incomplete, owing, they ſay, to the buſy ſeaſon of the year. That government, leſt any inconvenience might reſult from their militia not being here in time, ordered three regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their light-horſe to my aſſiſtance, part of which have arrived. But, not having the means to ſupport them (and, if it could be done, the expenſe would be enormous) I have thanked the gentlemen for their zeal, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment they have manifeſted upon this occaſion, and informed them that I cannot conſent to their keeping their horſes,—at the ſame time wiſhing them to ſtay themſelves. I am told they or part of them mean to do ſo.</p>
                     <p>General Mercer is now in the Jerſies, for the purpoſe of receiving and ordering the militia coming for the flying camp: and I have ſent over our chief engineer to view the ground within the neighbourhood of Amboy, and to lay out ſome neceſſary works for the encampment, and ſuch as may be proper at the different paſſes in Bergen-Neck, and other places on the Jerſey ſhore oppoſite Staten-Iſland, to prevent the enemy making impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and committing depredations on the property of the inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>The intelligence we have from a few deſerters that have come over to us, and from others, is that general Howe has between nine and ten thouſand men, who are chiefly landed on the iſland, poſted in different parts, and ſecuring the ſeveral communications from the Jerſies with ſmall works and intrenchments, to prevent our people from paying them a viſit;—that the iſlanders have all joined them, ſeem well diſpoſed to favour their cauſe, and have agreed to take up arms in their behalf. They look for admiral Howe's arrival every day with his fleet and a large reinforcement; are in high ſpirits, and talk confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of ſucceſs, and carrying all before them when he comes. I truſt, through divine favour and our own exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they will be diſappointed in their views: and, at all events, any advantages they may gain will coſt them
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:029737_0178_0FE248AC35F33010"/>
very dear. If our troops will behave well (which I hope will be the caſe, having every thing to contend for that freemen hold dear) they will have to wade through much blood and ſlaughter before they can carry any part of our works, if they carry them at all,—and, at beſt, be in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a melancholy and mournful victory. May the ſacredneſs of our cauſe inſpire our ſoldiery with ſentiments of heroiſm, and lead them to the performance of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt exploits!—</p>

                     <p>I WAS honoured with your favour of the eighth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant by yeſterday morning's poſt, with the ſeveral reſolves to which you referred my attention. I ſhall duly regard them, and attempt their execution as far as I am able.</p>
                     <p>By virtue of the diſcretionary power that Congreſs were pleaſed to veſt me with, and by advice of ſuch of my gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral officers as I have had an opportunity of conſulting, I have ordered the two remaining continental regiments in the Maſſachuſetts-Bay to march immediately for the defence of this place, in full confidence that nothing hoſtile will be attempted againſt that State in the preſent campaign.</p>
                     <p>I have wrote to the General Court of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and tranſmitted a copy of the reſolve for employing the eaſtern Indians, entreating their good offices in this inſtance, and their exertions to have them forthwith engaged and marched to join this army. I have deſired five or ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them to be enliſted for two or three years, if they will conſent to it,—ſubject to an earlier diſcharge if it ſhall be thought neceſſary,—and upon the ſame terms as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental troops, if better cannot be had,—though I am hopeful they may.</p>
                     <p>In my letter of yeſterday, I mentioned the arrival of part of the Connecticut light-horſe to aſſiſt in the defence of this place, and my objection to their horſes being kept. Four or five hundred of them are now come in; and, in juſtice to their zeal and laudable attachment to the cauſe of
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:029737_0179_0FE2485B76CF6EE0"/>
their country, I am to inform you that they have conſented to ſtay as long as occaſion may require, though they ſhould be at the expenſe of maintaining their horſes themſelves. They have paſtured them out about the neighbourhood of Kingſbridge (being unwilling to ſend them away) at the rate of half a dollar per week each, meaning to leave in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely with Congreſs either to allow or refuſe it, as they ſhall judge proper. I promiſed to make this repreſentation and thought it my duty; and will only obſerve that the motives which induced them at firſt to ſet out were good and praiſe-worthy, and were, to afford the moſt ſpeedy and early ſuccour, which they apprehended would be wanted before the militia arrived. Their ſervices may be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly important,—being moſt of them, if not all, men of rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utation and of property.</p>
                     <p>The ſubject of the incloſed copy of a letter from gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Trumbull I beg leave to ſubmit to the conſideration of Congreſs. They will perceive from his repreſentation the diſquieting apprehenſions that have ſeized on the minds of the people ſince the retreat of the northern army, and how expoſed the northern frontiers of New-York and New-Hampſhire are to the ravages and incurſions of the Indians. How far it may be expedient to raiſe the battalion he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives neceſſary to prevent the calamities and diſtreſſes he points out, they will determine, upon what he has ſaid, and the neceſſity that may appear to them for the meaſure;—what I have done, being only to lay the matter before them in compliance with his wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>I have alſo incloſed a memorial from the ſurgeons'-mates, ſetting forth the inadequacy of their pay to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and maintenance, and praying that it may be increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I ſhall obſerve that they have a long time complained in this inſtance, and that ſome additional allowance may not be unneceſſary.</p>
                     <p>As I am truly ſenſible the time of Congreſs is much taken up with a variety of important matters, it is with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs and pain I ever repeat a requeſt after having once made it, or take the liberty of enforcing any opinion of mine after it is once given: but as the eſtabliſhing of ſome office for auditing accounts is a matter of exceeding importance to the public intereſt, I would beg leave once
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:029737_0180_0FE248B601610ED0"/>
mere to call the attention of Congreſs to an appointment competent to the purpoſe. Two motives induce me to urge the matter; firſt, a conviction of the utility of the meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure—ſecondly, that I may ſtand exculpated if hereafter it ſhould appear that money has been improperly expended, and neceſſaries for the army obtained upon unreaſonable terms.</p>
                     <p>For me, whoſe time is employed from the hour of my riſing till I retire to bed again, to go into an examination of the accounts of ſuch an army as this with any degree of preciſion and exactneſs, without neglecting other matters of equal importance, is utterly impracticable. All that I have been able to do (and that, in fact, was doing nothing) was, when the commiſſary, and quarter-maſter, and director-general of the hoſpital (for it is to theſe the great advances are made) applied for warrants,—to make them at times produce a general account of their expenditures. But this anſwers no valuable purpoſe. It is the minutiae that muſt be gone into,—the propriety of each charge examined,—the vouchers looked into;—and, with reſpect to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary-general, his victualling returns and expenditures of proviſions ſhould be compared with his purchaſes: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a perſon in this department, if he was inclined to be knaviſh, might purchaſe large quantities with the public money, and fell one half of it again for private emolument; and yet his accounts upon paper would appear fair, and be ſupported with vouchers for every charge.</p>
                     <p>I do not urge this matter from a ſuſpicion of any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nfair practices in either of the departments before mentioned; and ſorry ſhould I be if this conſtruction was put upon it, having a high opinion of the honour and integrity of theſe gentlemen. But there ſhould nevertheleſs be ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol as well upon their diſcretion as honeſty:—to which may be added, that accounts become perplexed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by long ſtanding, and the errors therein not ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable as if they underwent an early reviſion and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination. I am well appriſed that a treaſury-office of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts has been reſolved upon, and an auditor-general for ſettling all public accounts: but, with all deference and ſubmiſſion to the opinion of Congreſs, theſe inſtitutions are not calculated to prevent the inconveniences I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;

nor can they be competent to the purpoſes, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced as they are.</p>
                     <p>We have intelligence from a deſerter that came to us, that on Wedneſday morning the Aſia, Chatham, and Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound men-of-war weighed anchor, and (it was ſaid) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to paſs up the North-river above the city, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the communication with the Jerſies. They did not attempt it, nor does he know what prevented them. A priſoner belonging to the tenth regiment, taken yeſterday, informs that they hourly expected admiral Howe and his fleet. He adds that a veſſel has arrived from them, and the prevailing opinion is, that an attack will be ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>By a letter from general Ward, I am informed that the ſmall-pox has broke out at Boſton, and infected ſome of the troops. I have wrote to him to place the invalids under an officer, to remain till they are well; and to uſe every poſſible precaution to prevent the troops from thence bringing the infection. The diſtreſſes and calam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities we have already ſuffered by this diſorder in one part of our army, I hope, will excite his utmoſt care that they may not be increaſed.</p>

                     <p>The deſign of this is to inform Congreſs, that, about half after three o'clock this evening, two of the enemy's ſhips of war, one of forty and the other of twenty guns, with three tenders, weighed anchor in the bay oppoſite Staten-Iſland, and, availing themſelves of a briſk and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable breeze, with a flowing tide, ran paſt our batteries up the North-river, without receiving any certain damage that I could perceive, notwithſtanding a heavy and inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant cannonade was kept up from our ſeveral batteries here, as well as from that at Paulus-Hook. They, on their part, returned and continued the fire as they ran by. I diſpatched an expreſs to brigadier-general Mifflin, at our encampment towards the upper end of the iſland;
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:029737_0182_0FE248B7B8070868"/>
but have not heard whether they have got by, or received any damage.</p>
                     <p>The account tranſmitted by this morning's poſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the arrival of one of the fleet, ſeems to be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Several ſhips have come in to-day: among them, one this evening, with a Saint-George's flag at her fore-top-maſt-head, which we conclude to be admiral Howe, from the circumſtance of the flag, and the ſeveral and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſalutes that were paid. It is probable they will all arrive in a day or two, and immediately begin their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                     <p>As it will be extremely neceſſary that the flying camp ſhould be well provided with powder and ball, and it may be impracticable to ſend ſupplies from hence on account of our hurry and engagements, (beſides, the communication may be uncertain) I muſt beg the attention of Congreſs to this matter, and requeſt that they will forward with all poſſible expedition ſuch a quantity of muſket-powder and lead, (if balls of different ſizes cannot be had) as will be ſufficient for the militia to compoſe that camp.</p>
                     <p>By an expreſs this minute arrived from general Mifflin, the ſhips have paſſed his works.</p>

                     <p>My laſt of Friday evening, which I had the honour of addreſſing you, adviſed that two of the enemy's ſhips of war and three tenders had run above our batteries here and the works at the upper end of the iſland. I am now to inform you, that, yeſterday forenoon, receiving intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from general Mifflin that they had paſſed the Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan-Sea, and were trying to proceed higher up,—by advice of R. R. Livingſton, eſquire, and other gentlemen, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched expreſſes to general Clinton of Ulſter, and the committee of ſafety for Ducheſs-county, to take meaſures for ſecuring the paſſes in the Highlands, leſt they might have deſigns of ſeizing them, and have a force concealed
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:029737_0183_0FE2486567F5F330"/>
for the purpoſe. I wrote the evening before to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer of the two garriſons there to be vigilant and prepared againſt any attempts they or any diſaffected perſons might make againſt them, and to forward expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes all the way to Albany, that proviſion and other veſſels might be ſecured and prevented falling into their hands.</p>
                     <p>The information given general Mifflin was rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature, as to their having gone paſt the Sea. A letter from the committee of Orange-county, which came to hand this morning, ſays they were there yeſterday, and that a regiment of their militia was under arms, to prevent their landing and making an incurſion. The meſſenger who brought it, and to whom it refers for particulars, adds that a party of them, in two or three boats, had approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſhore, but were forced back by our people firing at them. Since the manoeuvre of Friday, there have been no other movements in the fleet.</p>
                     <p>General Sullivan, in a letter of the ſecond inſtant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms me of his arrival with the army at Crown-Point, where he is fortifying and throwing up works. He adds that he has ſecured all the ſtores except three cannon left at Chamblee, which in part is made up by taking a fine twelve-pounder out of the Lake. The army is ſickly,—many with the ſmall-pox; and he is apprehenſive the militia, ordered to join them, will not eſcape the infection. An officer he had ſent to reconnoitre had reported that he ſaw at Saint John's about a hundred and fifty tents,—twenty at Saint Roy's, and fifteen at Chamblee; and works at the firſt were buſily carrying on.</p>
                     <p>I have incloſed a general return of the army here, which will ſhew the whole of our ſtrength. All the detached poſts are included.</p>
                     <p>A letter from the eaſtward, by laſt night's poſt, to Mr. Hazard, poſt-maſter in this city, adviſes that two ſhips had been taken and carried into Cape-Ann,—one from Antigua, conſigned to general Howe, with four hundred and thirty-nine puncheons of rum,—the other a Jamaica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with four hundred hogſheads of ſugar, two hundred puncheons of rum, thirty-nine bales of cotton, pimento, fuſtic, &amp;c. &amp;c. Each mounted two guns, ſix-pounders.</p>
                     <p>About three o'clock this afternoon I was informed that
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:029737_0184_0FE248B941388000"/>
a flag from lord Howe was coming up, and waited with two of our whale-boats, until directions ſhould be given. I immediately convened ſuch of the general officers as were not upon other duty, who agreed in opinion that I ought not to receive any letter directed to me as a private gentleman: but if otherwiſe, and the officer deſired to come up to deliver the letter himſelf, as was ſuggeſted, he ſhould come under a ſafe-conduct. Upon this, I directed colonel Reed to go down and manage the affair under the above general inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>On his return, he informed me, that, after the common civilities, the officer acquainted him that he had a letter from lord Howe to Mr. Waſhington, which he ſhewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſuperſcription, <hi>"To George Waſhington, eſquire."</hi> Colonel Reed replied there was no ſuch perſon in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that a letter intended for the general could not be received under ſuch a direction. The officer expreſſed great concern,—ſaid it was a letter rather of a civil than military nature,—that lord Howe regretted he had not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſooner,—that he (lord Howe) had great powers. The anxiety to have the letter received was very evident, though the officer diſclaimed all knowledge of its contents. However, colonel Reed's inſtructions being poſitive, they parted. After they had got ſome diſtance, the officer with the flag again put about, and aſked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>der what direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Mr. Waſhington choſe to be addreſſed:—to which colonel Reed anſwered, his ſtation was well known, and that certainly they could be at no loſs how to direct to him. The officer ſaid they knew it and lamented it; and again repeated his wiſh that the letter could be received. Colonel Reed told him a proper direction would obviate all difficulties, and that this was no new matter,—this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject having been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ully diſcuſſed in the courſe of the laſt year; of which lord Howe could not be ignorant:—upon which they parted.</p>
                     <p>I would not upon any occaſion ſacrifice eſſentials to punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilio: but in this inſtance, the opinion of others concurring with my own, I deemed it a duty to my country and my appointment, to inſiſt upon that reſpect, which, in any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than a public view, I would willingly have waved. Nor do I doubt, but, from the ſuppoſed nature of the meſſage,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:029737_0185_0FE24866ED15F630"/>
and the anxiety expreſſed, they will ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>her repeat their flag, or fall upon ſome mode to communicate the import and <hi>[contents]</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>I have been duly honoured with your two letters, that of the tenth by Mr. Anderſon,—and the eleventh, with its incloſures. I have directed the quarter-maſter to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide him with every thing he wants to carry his ſcheme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution. It is an important one, and I wiſh it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; but am doubtful that it will be better in theory than practice.</p>
                     <p>The paſſage of the ſhips of war and tenders up the river is a matter of great importance, and has excited much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture and ſpeculation. To me two things have occurred, as leading them to this proceeding,—firſt a deſign to ſeize on the narrow paſſes on both ſides of the river, giving almoſt the only land-communication with Albany, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence with our northern army; for which purpoſe they might have troops concealed on board, which they deemed competent of themſelves, as the defiles are narrow,—or that they would be joined by many diſaffected perſons in that quarter. Others have added a probability of their having a large quantity of arms on board, to be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to put into the hands of the tories immediately on the arrival of the fleet, or rather at the time they intend to make their attack. The ſecond is, to cut off entirely all intercourſe between this and Albany by water, and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per country, and to prevent ſupplies of every kind going and coming.</p>
                     <p>Theſe matters are truly alarming, and of ſuch importance that I have wrote to the provincial Congreſs of New-York, and recommended to their ſerious conſideration the adoption of every poſſible expedient to guard againſt the two firſt; and have ſuggeſted the propriety of their employing the militia, or ſome part of them, in the counties in which theſe defiles are, to keep the enemy from poſſeſſing them, till further proviſion can be made; and to write to the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral leading perſons on our ſide in that quarter, to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to all the movements of the ſhips and the diſaffected, in order to diſcover and fruſtrate whatever pernicious ſchemes they have in view.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="187" facs="unknown:029737_0186_0FE1BFA1EEDB29B8"/>
In reſpect to the ſecond conjecture of my own, and which ſeems to be generally adopted, I have the pleaſure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Congreſs, that, if their deſign is to keep the armies from proviſion, the commiſſary has told me upon inquiry, he has forwarded ſupplies to Albany (now there, and above it) ſufficient for ten thouſand men for four months; that he has a ſufficiency here for twenty thouſand men for three months, and an abundant quantity ſecured in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts of the Jerſies for the flying camp, beſides having about four thouſand barrels of flour in ſome neighbouring part of Connecticut.

                     <p>I WAS this morning honoured with yours of the fifteenth inſtant, with ſundry reſolves.</p>
                     <p>I perceive the meaſures Congreſs have taken to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite the raiſing of the flying camp, and providing it with articles of the greateſt uſe. You will ſee by a poſtſcript to my letter of the fourteenth, I had wrote to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer of the Pennſylvania militia, ordering them to be marched from Trenton to Amboy, as their remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there could not anſwer the leaſt public good. For, having conſulted with ſundry gentlemen, I was informed, if the enemy mean to direct their views towards Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania or penetrate the Jerſies, their route will be from near Amboy, and either by way of Brunſwic or Bound-brook,—the lower road from South-Amboy being through a woody, ſandy country. Beſides, they will be then able to throw in ſuccour here, and to receive it from hence in caſes of emergency.</p>
                     <p>The Connecticut light-horſe, mentioned in my letter of the eleventh, notwithſtanding their then promiſe to continue here for the defence of this place, are now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and about to return home,—having peremptorily refuſed all kind of fatigue duty, or even to mount guard, claiming an exemption as troopers. Though their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is much needed, and might be of eſſential ſervice in caſe of an attack, yet I judged it adviſeable, on their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and claim of ſuch indulgences, to diſcharge them; as granting them would ſet an example to others, and might produce many ill conſequences. The number of men included in the laſt return, by this, is leſſened about five hundred.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="189" facs="unknown:029737_0188_0FE248C45B759A20"/>
I laſt night received a letter from general Schuyler, with ſeveral incloſures, copies of which I have herewith tranſmitted. They will give Congreſs every information I have reſpecting our northern army and the ſituation of our affairs in that quarter;—to which I beg leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their attention. I cannot but expreſs my ſurpriſe at the ſcarcity of proviſion which general Schuyler mentions, after what the commiſſary aſſured me, and which formed a part of my letter of the fourteenth. He ſtill aſſures me of the ſame. This is a diſtreſſing circumſtance, as every article of proviſion, and every thing neceſſary for that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, can have no other now than a land-conveyance, the water-communication from hence to Albany being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely cut off.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs will pleaſe to conſider the incloſure, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 6, about raiſing ſix companies out of the inhabitants about the Lakes, to prevent the incurſions of the Indians. The general officers, in their minutes of council, have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it a matter of much importance;—and their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the price of goods furniſhed the ſoldiery may be extremely neceſſary. They have complained much upon this head.</p>
                     <p>The retreat from Crown-Point ſeems to be conſidered in oppoſite views by the general and field officers. The former (I am ſatisfied) have weighed the matter well; and yet the reaſons aſſigned by the latter againſt it appear ſtrong and forcible. I hope whatever is done will be for the beſt. * * *</p>
                     <p>By a letter from the committee of Orange-county, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this morning, the men-of-war and tenders were yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday at Haverſham-bay, about forty miles above this. A number of men, in four barges from the tenders, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to land, with a view (they ſuppoſe) of taking ſome ſheep and cattle, that had been previouſly removed. A ſmall number of militia that were collected obliged them to retreat, without their doing any damage with their cannon. They were ſounding the water up towards the Highlands; by which it is probable they will attempt to paſs with part of the fleet, if poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Yeſterday evening a flag came from general Howe with a letter addreſſed "<hi>To George Waſhington, eſquire, &amp;c.
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:029737_0189_0FE2486F58B6F338"/>

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favours of the ſixteenth and ſeventeenth, with the ſeveral reſolves they contained; to the execution of which, ſo far as ſhall be in my power, I will pay proper attention.</p>
                     <p>In my letter of the ſeventeenth I tranſmitted you a copy of one from general Schuyler, and of its ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures. I confeſs the determination of the council of general officers on the ſeventh, to retreat from Crown-Point, ſurpriſed me much: and the more I conſider it, the more ſtriking does the impropriety appear. The reaſons aſſigned againſt it by the field-officers, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, coincide greatly with my own ideas and thoſe of the other general officers I have had an opportunity of conſulting with, and ſeem to be of conſiderable weight,—I may add, concluſive. I am not ſo fully acquainted with the geography of that country and the ſituation of the different poſts, as to pronounce a peremptory judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the matter: but, if my ideas are right, the poſſeſſion of Crown-Point is eſſential, to give us the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority and maſtery upon the Lake.</p>
                     <p>That the enemy will poſſeſs it as ſoon as abandoned by us, there can be no doubt; and if they do, whatever gallies or force we keep on the Lake will be unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in their rear. How they are to be ſupported there, or what ſuccour can be drawn from them there, is beyond my comprehenſion. Perhaps it is only meant that they ſhall be employed on the communication between that and Ticonderoga. If this is the caſe, I fear the views of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will not be anſwered, nor the ſalutary effects be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from them, that were intended.</p>
                     <p>I have mentioned my ſurpriſe to general Schuyler, and would, by the advice of the general officers here, have directed that that poſt ſhould be maintained, had it not been for two cauſes,—an apprehenſion that the works
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:029737_0190_0FE248C614C9DA88"/>
have been deſtroyed, and that, if the army ſhould be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from Ticonderoga, or the poſt oppoſite to it (where I preſume they are) to repoſſeſs it, they would have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one place nor another ſecure and in a defenſible ſtate: the other, leſt it might increaſe the jealouſy and diverſity of opinions which ſeem already too prevalent in that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and eſtabliſh a precedent for the inferior officers to ſet up their judgments whenever they would, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe of their ſuperiors,—a matter of great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, and that might lead to fatal conſequences, if coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced;—though in the preſent inſtance I could wiſh their reaſoning had prevailed.</p>
                     <p>If the army has not removed, what I have ſaid to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Schuyler may perhaps bring on a reconſideration of the matter; and it may not be too late to take meaſures for maintaining that poſt. But of this I have no hope.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence of the reſolve of Congreſs for three of the eaſtern regiments to reinforce the northern army, I wrote to general Ward, and, by advice of my gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral officers, directed them to march to Norwich, and there to embark for Albany; conceiving that two val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable purpoſes might reſult therefrom,—firſt, that they would ſooner join the army, by purſuing this route, and be ſaved from the diſtreſs and fatigue that muſt attend every long march through the country at this hot and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable ſeaſon; and ſecondly, that they might give ſuccour here, in caſe the enemy ſhould make an attack about the time of their paſſing. But the enemy having now, with their ſhips of war and tenders, cut off the water-communication from the hence to Albany, I have wrote this day and directed them to proceed by land acroſs the country. If Congreſs diſapprove the route, or wiſh to give any orders about them, you will pleaſe to certify me thereof, that I may take meaſures accordingly.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed I have the honour to tranſmit you copies of a letter and ſundry reſolutions which I received yeſterday from the convention of this State. By them you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they have been acting upon matters of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and are exerting themſelves in the moſt vigorous manner to defeat the wicked deſigns of the enemy, and ſuch diſaffected perſons as may incline to aſſiſt and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:029737_0191_0FE24871E69906F8"/>
their news. In compliance with their requeſt, and on account of the ſcarcity of money for carrying their ſalutary views into execution, I have agreed to lend them, out of the ſmall ſtock now in hand, (not more than ſixty thouſand dollars) twenty thouſand dollars, in part of what they want; which they promiſe ſpeedily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place. Had there been money ſufficient for paying the whole of our troops and no more, I could not have done it. But as it was otherwiſe, and by no means proper to pay a part and not the whole, I could not foreſee any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences that would attend the loan;—on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that it might contribute in ſome degree to forward their ſchemes. I hope my conduct in this inſtance will not be diſapproved.</p>
                     <p>I incloſed governor Trumbull a copy of their letter and of their ſeveral reſolves, to-day, by colonel Broom and Mr. Duer, two members of the convention, who are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to wait on him; but did not think myſelf at liberty to urge or requeſt his intereſt in forming the camp of ſix thouſand men, as the levies, directed by Congreſs to be furniſhed the third of June, for the defence of this place, by that government, are but little more than one third come in. At the ſame time, the propoſition I think a good one, if it could be carried into execution. In caſe the enemy ſhould attempt to effect a landing above Kingſbridge, and to cut off the communication between this city and the country, an army to hang on their rear would diſtreſs them exceedingly.</p>

                     <p>YOUR favours of the eighteenth and nineteenth, with which you have been pleaſed to honour me, have been duly received, with the ſeveral reſolves alluded to.</p>
                     <p>When the letter and declaration, from lord Howe to Mr. Franklin and the other late governors, come to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, I ſhould ſuppoſe the warmeſt advocates for depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the Britiſh crown muſt be ſilent, and be convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond all poſſibility of doubt, that all that has been ſaid about the commiſſioners was illuſory, and calculated expreſsly to deceive and unguard, not only the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our own country, but thoſe of the Engliſh nation that were averſe to the proceedings of the king and miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Hence we ſee the cauſe why a ſpecification of their powers was not given the mayor and city of London, on their addreſs requeſting it. That would have been danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe it would then have been manifeſt that the line of conduct they were to purſue would be totally variant from that they had induſtriouſly propagated, and amuſed the public with. The uniting the civil and military offices in the ſame perſons too, muſt be concluſive to every think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, that there is to be but little negociation of the civil kind.</p>
                     <p>I have incloſed, for the ſatisfaction of Congreſs, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what paſſed between myſelf and lieutenant-colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Patterſon, adjutant-general, at an interview had yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:029737_0193_0FE248736BD9FB90"/>
in conſequence of a requeſt from general Howe the day before;—to which I beg leave to refer them for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Knox of the train having often mentioned to me the neceſſity of having a much more numerous body of artilleriſts than what there now is, in caſe the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſhould continue longer,—and knowing the deficiency in this inſtance, and their extreme uſefulneſs,—I deſired him to commit his ideas upon the ſubject to writing, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that I might tranſmit them to Congreſs for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. Agreeable to my requeſt, he has done it; and the propriety of his plan is now ſubmitted for their deciſion. It is certain that we have not more at this time than are ſufficient for the ſeveral extenſive poſts we now have,—including the draughts which he ſpeaks of, and which, I preſume (not only from what he has informed me, but from the nature of the thing) can never be qualified to render the ſame ſervice as if they were regularly appointed and formed into a corps for that particular purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>I beg leave to remind Congreſs that ſome time ago I laid before them the propoſals of ſome perſons here for forming a company of light-horſe; and the preſident's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, a little time after, intimated that the plan ſeemed to be approved of. As thoſe who wanted to make up the troop are frequently preſſing me for an anſwer, I could wiſh to be favoured with the deciſion of Congreſs upon the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>By a letter from general Schuyler, of the fourteenth inſtant, dated at Albany, he informs me, that, the day before, ſome deſperate deſigns of the tories in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had been diſcovered, the particulars of which he could not divulge, being under an oath of ſecrecy;—however, that ſuch meaſures had been taken, as to promiſe a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the intended miſchief; and that four of the conſpirators (among them, a ringleader) were apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about one o'clock that morning, not far from the town. What the plot was, or who were concerned in it, is a matter I am ignorant of as yet.</p>
                     <closer>With my beſt regards to Congreſs, I have the honour to be your and their moſt obedient ſervant. <signed>G. W.</signed>

                     <p>SINCE I had the pleaſure of writing you by this morning's poſt, I was favoured with a letter from gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Trumbull, a copy of which is incloſed, and to which I beg leave to refer you. In regard to the ſtock he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I wrote to him, requeſting that they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the iſlands on which they were, as I conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it of great importance to diſtreſs the enemy as much as poſſible in the article of freſh proviſion. I wiſh the other governments may follow his example, and have it remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the iſlands belonging to them reſpectively.</p>
                     <p>When the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ps of war and tenders went up the river, it was thought expedient that application ſhould be made for the Connecticut row-gallies and thoſe belonging to Rhode-Iſland, in order to attempt ſomething for their deſtruction. As ſoon as they arrive we ſhall try to employ them in ſome uſeful way,—but in what, or how ſucceſsfully, I cannot at preſent determine.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs will pleaſe to obſerve what Mr. Trumbull ſays reſpecting the continental regiment raiſing under colonel Ward. If they incline to give any orders about their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination, you will pleaſe to communicate them by the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt opportunity, as their march will be ſuſpended till they are known.</p>
                     <p>The orders Mr. Trumbull has given to the officers of their cruiſers, to ſtop proviſion-veſſels, ſeem to be neceſſary. We have too much reaſon to believe that ſome have gone voluntarily to the enemy, and that there are many perſons who would continue to furniſh them with large ſupplies: and, however upright the intentions of others may be, it will be a matter of the utmoſt difficulty, if not an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, for any to eſcape falling into their hands now, as every part of the coaſt (it is probable) will ſwarm with their ſaips of war and tenders. I had propoſed writing to the convention of this State upon the ſubject before I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his letter; and am now more perſuaded of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of their taking ſome ſteps to prevent further expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations down the Sound. In my next I ſhall inform them of the intelligence received from Mr. Trumbull, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommend the matter to their attention.</p>

                        <p>P. S. It appears abſolutely neceſſary that the expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of proviſion ſhould be ſtopped. Our army is large, and otherwiſe may want. Nor can individuals be injured, as they have a ready-money market for every thing they have to diſpoſe of in that way.</p>

                     <p>DISAGREEABLE as it is to me and unpleaſing as it may be to Congreſs to multiply officers, I find myſelf under the unavoidable neceſſity of aſking an increaſe of my aides-de-camp. The augmentation of my command,—the increaſe of my correſpondence,—the orders to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>,—the inſtructions to draw,—cut out more buſineſs than I am able to execute in time with propriety. The buſineſs of ſo many different departments centring with me, and by me to be handed on to Congreſs for their information,—added to the intercourſe I am obliged to keep up with the adjacent States,—and incidental occurrences,—all of which require confidential and not hack writers to execute,—renders it impoſſible, in the preſent ſtate of things, for my family to diſcharge the ſeveral duties expected of me, with that preciſion and diſpatch that I could wiſh. What will it be then, when we come into a more active ſcene, and I am called upon from twenty different places perhaps at the ſame inſtant?</p>
                     <p>Congreſs will do me the juſtice to believe (I hope) that it is not my inclination or wiſh to run the continent to any unneceſſary expenſe; and thoſe who better know me will not ſuſpect that ſhew and parade can have any influence on my mind in this inſtance. A conviction of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of it, for the regular diſcharge of the truſt repoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, is the governing motive for the application; and, as ſuch, is ſubmitted to Congreſs by, Sir, your moſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, &amp;c.</p>

The confidence Congreſs are pleaſed to repoſe in my judgment demands my warmeſt acknowledgments, and they may reſt aſſured it ſhall be invariably employed, ſo far as ſhall be in my power, to promote their views and the public weal. * * *</p>
                     <p>Since my laſt, nothing material has occurred. Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day evening report was made that eight ſhips were ſeen in the offing, ſtanding towards the Hook. The men-of-war and tenders are ſtill up the river. They have never attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to paſs the Highland fortifications; and, a day or two ago, quitted their ſtation, and fell down the river eight or ten miles. The vigilance and activity of the militia oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite where they were have prevented their landing and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much injury. One poor peaſant's cot they plundered and then burnt.</p>
                     <p>I would wiſh to know whether the allowance given to officers, the ſeventeenth of January, of a dollar and one-third for every man they enliſt, Congreſs mean to extend to the officers who enliſt for the new army for three years. At firſt it may appear wrong, or rather exorbitant, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that many will be recruited out of the regiments now in ſervice, and under them: but the allowance will be of great uſe, as it will intereſt the officers, and call forth their exertions, which otherwiſe would be faint and languid. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I am fearful, from the inquiries I have made, that their utmoſt exertions will be attended with but little ſucceſs. It is objected that the bounty of ten dollars is too low; and argued,—"if the States, furniſhing men for five or ſix months, allow conſiderably more, why ſhould that be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted when the term of enliſtment is to be for three years." I heartily wiſh a bounty in land had been or could be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, as was propoſed ſome time ago. I think it would be attended with ſalutary conſequences.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence of my application to governor Trumbull, he has ſent me two row-gallies; and I expect another from him. None from governor Cooke are yet come; nor have I heard from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m on the ſubject. One is complete here. The fire-ſhips are going on under Mr. Anderſon's direction, but rather ſlowly; and I am preparing ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for the channel nearly oppoſite the works at the upper end of this iſland. When all things are ready, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:029737_0198_0FE248D4B9AE5798"/>
to try, if it ſhall ſeem practicable, to deſtroy the ſhips and tenders above, and to employ the gallies, if they can be of advantage.</p>
                     <p>The militia for the flying camp come in but ſlowly. By a return from general Mercer yeſterday, they are but little more than three thouſand. If they were in, or can be there ſhortly, and the ſituation of the enemy remains the ſame, I would make ſome efforts to annoy them, keeping our poſts here well guarded, and not putting too much to the hazard, or in any manner to the riſk.</p>

                     <p>YOUR favour of the twenty-fourth I received on Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urday evening, and, agreeable to your requeſt, ſhall expunge the preamble to the reſolution ſubjecting the property of ſubjects to the Britiſh crown to forfeiture and confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Our ſtock of muſket-powder is entirely made up in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges. I therefore requeſt that Congreſs will order four or five tons more of that ſort to be immediately forwarded; it being not only neceſſary that we ſhould have more for that purpoſe, but alſo ſome ſtock to remain in barrels.</p>
                     <p>Yeſterday evening Hutchinſon's and Sergeant's regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from Boſton arrived; alſo two row-gallies from Rhode-Iſland. I am fearful the troops have not got en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely clear of the ſmall-pox. I ſhall uſe every poſſible precaution to prevent the infection ſpreading; and, for that purpoſe, have ordered them to an encampment ſeparate and detached from the reſt.</p>
                     <p>By Saturday's report from Long-Iſland camp, five ſhips, a brig, and five ſchooners, had got into the Hook; by yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday's, two ſhips more, and a ſloop, were ſtanding in. What they are, I have not been able to learn.</p>
                     <p>I have tranſmitted a general return herewith, by which Congreſs will perceive the whole of our force at the time it was made.</p>
                     <p>I have incloſed you an account of ſundry prizes, which was tranſmitted to ſeveral gentlemen here by Saturday's

poſt. The two laſt prizes I did not ſee mentioned in the letters ſhewn me; and I fear the report of the ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion-veſſel is premature. I was alſo this minute informed that captain Biddle had taken a ſhip with ſugars for Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and, in bringing her in, unfortunately loſt her on Fiſher's-Iſland.</p>

                     <p>I WAS this morning honoured with your two favours of yeſterday's date; and, agreeable to your requeſt, have given Mr. Palfrey liberty to negociate your claim with Mr. Brimer, and wiſh it may be ſatisfied agreeably to you.</p>
                     <p>I laſt night received a letter from general Schuyler, a copy of which I do myſelf the honour to tranſmit you. You will thereby perceive his reaſons for leaving Crown-Point, and preferring the poſt the council of officers deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to take oppoſite to Ticonderoga. I am totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with thoſe ſeveral poſts and the country about them, and therefore cannot determine on the validity of his obſervations, or think myſelf at liberty to give any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in the matter.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs will pleaſe to obſerve what he ſays of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs for money. From hence he can have no relief, there being only about three or four thouſand dollars in the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter's hands, according to his return this morning,—and all but two months pay due to the army, beſides many other demands. I could wiſh that proper ſupplies of money could be always kept:—the want may occaſion conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of an alarming nature.</p>
                     <p>By a letter from him, of a prior date to the copy incloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he tells me that a Mr. Ryckman, who has juſt returned through the country of the Six-Nations, reports that the Indians who were at Philadelphia have gone home with very favourable ideas of our ſtrength and reſources. This he heard in many of their villages:—a lucky circumſtance if it will either gain their friendſhip or ſecure their neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality.</p>

                        <pb n="201" facs="unknown:029737_0200_0FE249277047DD00"/>
In my letter of the twenty-ſeventh I informed Congreſs of my views and wiſhes to attempt ſomething againſt the troops on Staten-Iſland. I am now to acquaint them, that, by the advice of general Mercer and other officers at Amboy, it will be impracticable to do any thing upon a large ſcale, for want of craft, and as the enemy have the entire command of the water all round the iſland. I have deſired general Mercer to have nine or ten flat-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed boats built at Newark-bay and Elizabeth-Town, with a deſign principally to keep up the communication acroſs Hackinſac and Paſſaic rivers, which I deem a matter of great importance, and extremely neceſſary to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to.</p>
                     <p>Since I wrote you yeſterday, eleven ſhips more, four brigs, and two ſloops, have come into the Hook. I have not yet received intelligence what any of the late arrivals are: but I ſuppoſe we ſhall not long remain in a ſtate of uncertainty.</p>
                     <p>Having reaſon to believe that lord Howe will readily come into an exchange of ſuch priſoners as may be more immediately under his command, and that ſomething will be offered on this ſubject within a day or two, or rather come in anſwer to the propoſitions I have made general Howe. I ſhould be glad to have Congreſs's interpretation of the reſolve of the twenty-ſecond inſtant, empowering the commanders to exchange, &amp;c. whether by the word <hi>'ſailor,'</hi> they mean ſailors generally, as well thoſe taken in the veſſels of private adventurers by the enemy, as thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the continental cruiſers, or veſſels in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent's employ; or whether they only deſign to extend the exchange to the latter,—thoſe in their particular em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy.</p>
                     <p>I would alſo obſerve, that, heretofore, ſailors belonging to merchant ſhips that have fallen into our hands, and thoſe employed merely as tranſports, have not generally been conſidered as priſoners. I ſubmit it to Congreſs whether it may not be now neceſſary to paſs a reſolve declaring their ſentiments on this ſubject, and, in general, who are to be treated as priſoners of war, that are taken on board veſſels belonging to the ſubjects of the Britiſh crown, &amp;c.
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:029737_0201_0FE248D64597BF58"/>
The reſult of their opinion upon the firſt queſtion propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you will be pleaſed to tranſmit me by the earlieſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
                     <p>I have incloſed, for the conſideration of Congreſs, a memorial and petition by captain Holdridge, praying to be relieved againſt the loſs of money ſtolen from him,—not conceiving myſelf authoriſed to grant his requeſt. The certificate which attends it proves him a man of character; and his caſe is hard, on his ſtate of it. Whether making the loſs good may not open a door to others, and give riſe to applications not ſo juſt as his may be, I cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. That ſeems to be the only objection to relieving him.</p>
                     <p>I am informed by general Putnam that there are ſome of the Stockbridge Indians here (I have not ſeen them myſelf) who expreſs great uneaſineſs at their not being employed by us, and have come to inquire into the cauſe. I am ſenſible Congreſs had them not in contemplation when they reſolved that Indians might be engaged in our ſervice. However, as they ſeem ſo anxious,—as they were led to expect it, from what general Schuyler and the other commiſſioners did,—as we are under difficulties in getting men, and there may be danger of their (or ſome of them) taking an unfavourable part,—I beg leave to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it as my opinion, under all theſe circumſtances, that they had better be employed.</p>

                     <p>YOUR favour of the thirtieth ultimo, with its ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral incloſures, I was honoured with by Wedneſday's poſt.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs having been pleaſed to leave with me the direction of colonel Ward's regiment, I have wrote to governor Trumbull, and requeſted him to order their march to this place, being fully ſatisfied that the enemy mean to make their grand puſh in this quarter, and that the good of the ſervice requires every aid here that can be obtained. I have alſo wrote to colonel Elmore, and
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:029737_0202_0FE24928F6A0CD60"/>
directed him to repair hither with his regiment. When it comes, I ſhall fill up commiſſions for ſuch officers as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with their reſpective companies.</p>

                     <p>The enemy's force is daily augmenting and becoming ſtronger by new arrivals.

                     <p>I WAS honoured with your favour of the thirty-firſt ultimo on Friday, with its ſeveral incloſures; and return you my thanks for the agreeable intelligence you were pleaſed to communicate, of the arrival of one of our ſhips with ſuch valuable articles as arms and ammunition; alſo of the capture made by a privateer.</p>
                     <p>The mode for the exchange of priſoners, reſolved on by Congreſs, is acceded to by general Howe, ſo far as it comes within his command. A copy of my letter and his anſwer upon this ſubject I have the honour to incloſe you; to which I beg leave to refer Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed copy of a letter from colonel Tupper, who had the general command of the gallies here, will inform Congreſs of the engagement between them and the ſhips of war up the North-river on Saturday evening, and of the damage we ſuſtained. What injury was done to the ſhips, I cannot aſcertain. It is ſaid they were hulled ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:029737_0203_0FE248D7CA8F1C18"/>
times by our ſhot. All accounts agree that our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and men, during the whole of the affair, behaved with great ſpirit and bravery. The damage done the gallies ſhews beyond queſtion that they had a warm time of it. The ſhips ſtill remain up the river; and, before any thing further can be attempted againſt them (ſhould it be thought adviſeable) the gallies muſt be repaired.</p>
                     <p>I have alſo tranſmitted Congreſs a copy of a letter I received by Saturday's poſt from governor Cooke, to which I refer them for the intelligence it contains. The ſeizure of our veſſels by the Portugueſe is, I fear, an event too true. Their dependence upon the Britiſh crown for aid againſt the Spaniards muſt force them to comply with every thing required of them. I wiſh the Morris may get ſafe in with her cargo. As to the ſhips captain Buch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin ſaw on the twenty-fifth ultimo, they are probably ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived; for yeſterday twenty-five ſail came into the Hook.</p>
                     <p>By a letter from general Ward, of the twenty-ninth ultimo, he informs me that two of our armed veſſels, the day before, had brought into Marblehead a ſhip bound from Halifax to Staten-Iſland. She had in about fifteen hundred and nine pounds' worth of Britiſh goods, beſides a good many belonging to tories. A Halifax paper, found on board her, I have incloſed, as alſo an account ſent me by Mr. Hazard, tranſmitted him by ſome of his friends, as given by the tories taken in her. Their intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, I dare ſay, is true reſpecting the arrival of part of the Heſſian troops. General Ward in his letter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that, the day this prize was taken, captain Burke, in another of our armed veſſels, had an engagement with a ſhip and a ſchooner which he thought were tranſports, and would have taken them, had it not been for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky accident in having his quarter-deck blown up. Two of his men were killed, and ſeveral more were wounded.</p>
                     <p>The hulks and chevaux-de-friſe, that have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to obſtruct the channel, have got up to the place they are intended for, and will be ſunk as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                     <p>I have tranſmitted Congreſs a general return of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in and about this place on the third inſtant, by which they will perceive the amount of our force.</p>

Before I conclude, I would beg leave to remind Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the neceſſity there is of having ſome major-gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als appointed for this army, the duties of which are great, extenſive, and impoſſible to be diſcharged as they ought and the good of the ſervice requires, without a competent number of officers of this rank. I mean to write more fully upon the ſubject: and, as things are drawing faſt to an iſſue, and it is neceſſary to make every proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and arrangement that we poſſibly can, I pray that this matter may be taken into conſideration, and claim their early attention. I well know what has prevented appointments of this ſort for ſome time paſt: but the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of our affairs will not juſtify longer delays in this inſtance. By the firſt opportunity, I ſhall take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of giving you my ſentiments more at large upon the propriety and neceſſity of the meaſure.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>IN my letter of the fifth which I had the honour of addreſſing you, I begged leave to recal the attention of Congreſs to the abſolute neceſſity there is for appointing more general officers,—promiſing at the ſame time, by the firſt opportunity, to give my ſentiments more at large upon the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Confident I am that the poſtponing this meaſure has not proceeded from motives of frugality: otherwiſe I ſhould take the liberty of attempting to prove that we put too much to the hazard by ſuch a ſaving. I am but too well appriſed of the difficulties that occur in the choice. They are, I acknowledge, great; but at the ſame time it muſt be allowed they are of ſuch a nature as to preſent themſelves whenever the ſubject is thought of. Time on the one hand does not remove them; on the other, delay may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of fatal conſequences.</p>
                     <p>This army, though far ſhort as yet of the numbers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Congreſs, is by much too unwieldy for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of any one man, without ſeveral major-generals to aſſiſt. For it is to be obſerved that a brigadier-general at
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:029737_0205_0FE248DEE4AA8D08"/>
the head of his brigade is no more than a colonel at the head of a regiment, except that he acts upon a larger ſcale. Officers of more general command are at all times wanted for the good order and government of an army, eſpecially when the army is compoſed chiefly of raw troops: but in an action they are indiſpenſably neceſſary. At preſent there is but one major-general for this whole department and the flying camp; whereas, at this place alone, leſs than three cannot diſcharge the duties with that regularity they ought to be.</p>
                     <p>If theſe major-generals are appointed, as undoubtedly they will, out of the preſent brigadiers, you will want for this place three brigadiers at leaſt. The northern depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will require one, if not two (as general Thompſon is a priſoner, and the baron Woedtke reported to be dead or in a ſtate not much better) there being at preſent only one brigadier-general (Arnold) in all that department. For the eaſtern governments there ought to be one, or a major-general, to ſuperintend the regiments there, and to prevent impoſitions that might otherwiſe be practiſed. Theſe make the number wanted to be ſix or ſeven: and who are to be appointed, Congreſs can beſt judge.</p>
                     <p>To make brigadiers of the oldeſt colonels would be the leaſt exceptionable way: but it is much to be queſtioned whether by that mode the ableſt men would be appointed to office. And I would obſerve, though the rank of the colonels of the eaſtern governments was ſettled at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge laſt year, it only reſpected themſelves and is ſtill open as to officers of other governments. To pick a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel here and a colonel there through the army according to the opinion entertained of their abilities, would no doubt be the means of making a better choice, and nominating the fitteſt perſons: but then the ſenior officers would get diſguſted, and, more than probable, with their connexions, quit the ſervice. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> might prove fatal at this time. To appoint gentlemen as brigadiers, that had not ſerved in this army, (in this part of it at leaſt) would not wound any one in particular, but hurt the whole equally, and muſt be conſidered in a very diſcouraging light by every officer of merit. View the matter therefore in any point of light you will, there are inconveniences on the one hand, and
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:029737_0206_0FE24933CB344D28"/>
difficulties on the other, which ought to be avoided. Would they be remedied by appointing the oldeſt colonels from each State?—If this mode ſhould be thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, the incloſed liſt gives the names of the colonels, from New-Hampſhire to Pennſylvania incluſive, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying thoſe who rank firſt, as I am told, in the ſeveral colony liſts.</p>
                     <p>I have tranſmitted a copy of a letter from Mr. John Glover, ſetting forth the nature and grounds of a diſpute between him and a Mr. Bradford reſpecting their agency. Not conceiving myſelf authoriſed, nor having the ſmalleſt inclination to interefere in any degree in the matter, it is referred to Congreſs, who will determine and give direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon it in ſuch manner as they ſhall judge beſt. I will only obſerve that Mr. Glover was recommended to me as a proper perſon for an agent when we firſt fitted out armed veſſels, and was accordingly appointed one; and, ſo far as I know, diſcharged his office with fidelity and induſtry.</p>
                     <p>I received yeſterday evening a letter from general Schuyler, containing lieutenant M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Michael's report, who had been ſent a ſcout to Oſwego. A copy of the report I have incloſed for the information of Congreſs, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Schuyler ſhould have omitted it in his letter which accompanies this. He was at the German-Flats when he wrote, which was the ſecond inſtant, and the treaty with the Indians not begun; nor had the whole expected then arrived. But of theſe things he will have adviſed you more fully, I make no doubt.</p>
                     <p>The pay-maſter informs me he received a ſupply of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey yeſterday. It came very ſeaſonably: for the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and clamours of the troops had become inceſſant and diſtreſſing beyond meaſure. There is now two months' pay due to them.</p>

who left the Solebay man-of-war laſt evening. One of them is a native of New-York. Their account is that they were in the engagement with colonel Moultrie at Sullivan's iſland on the ninth of July—(the particulars they give nearly correſpond with the narrative ſent by general Lee)—that they left Carolina three weeks ago as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy to forty-five tranſports having on board general Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, lord Cornwallis, and the whole ſouthern army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of about three thouſand men, all of whom were landed laſt week on Staten-Iſland in tolerable health;—that, on Sunday, thirteen tranſports, part of lord Howe's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>leet, and having on board Heſſians and Highlanders, came to Staten-Iſland;—that the remainder of the fleet, which was reported to have, in the whole, twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, had parted with theſe troops off the banks of Newfoundland, and were expected to come in every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;—that they were getting their heavy carriages and cannon on board, had launched eight gondolas with flat bottoms, and two rafts or ſtages to carry cannon.</p>
                     <p>Theſe men underſtand that the attack will ſoon be made, if the other troops arrive;—that they give out they will lay the Jerſies waſte with fire and ſword;—that the computed ſtrength of their army will be thirty thouſand men. They further add, that, when they left Carolina, one tranſport got on ſhore, ſo that they were not able to give her relief; upon which, ſhe ſurrendered, with five com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Highlanders, to general Lee, who, after taking every thing valuable out of her, burnt her;—that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral turned general Clinton out of his ſhip after the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, with a great deal of abuſe;—great differences between the principal naval and military gentlemen;—that the ſhips, left in Carolina, are now in ſuch a weakly diſtreſſed condition, they would fall an eaſy prey.</p>

                     <p>By yeſterday morning's poſt, I was honoured with your favour of the ſecond inſtant, with ſundry reſolutions of Congreſs, to which I ſhall pay ſtrict attention.</p>
                     <p>As the propoſition for employing the Stockbridge In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians has been approved, I have wrote to Mr. Edwards, one of the commiſſioners, and who lives among them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting him to engage them, or, ſuch as are willing, to enter the ſervice. I have directed him to indulge them with liberty to join this or the northern army, or both, as their inclination may lead.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh the ſalutary conſequences may reſult from the regulation reſpecting ſeamen taken, that Congreſs have in view. From the nature of this kind of people, and the privileges granted on their entering into our ſervice, I ſhould ſuppoſe many of them will do it. We want them much.</p>
                     <p>I yeſterday tranſmitted the intelligence I received from the deſerters from the Solebay man-of-war. The incloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed copy of a letter by laſt night's poſt, from the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mr. Bowdoin, with the information of a captain Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedy lately taken, corroborate their accounts reſpecting the Heſſian troops. Indeed his report makes the fleet and armament, to be employed againſt us, greater than what we have heard they would be. However there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no doubt of their being both large and formidable, and ſuch as will require our moſt vigorous exertions to oppoſe them. Perſuaded of this, and knowing how much inferior our numbers are and will be to theirs when the whole of their troops arrive,—of the important conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that may and will flow from the appeal that will ſoon be made,—I have wrote to Connecticut and New-Jerſey, for all the ſuccour they can afford, and alſo to the convention of this State. What I may receive, and in what time, the event muſt determine. But I would fain hope, the ſituation and the exigency of our affairs will call forth the moſt ſtrenuous efforts and early aſſiſtance of thoſe who are friends to the cauſe. I confeſs there is but too much occaſion for their exertions. I confidently truſt they will not be withheld.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="210" facs="unknown:029737_0209_0FE248E2F36EEA78"/>
I have incloſed a copy of a letter from Mr. Bowdoin reſpecting the eaſtern Indians. Congreſs will thereby perceive that they profeſs themſelves to be well attached to our intereſt,—and the ſummary of the meaſures taken to engage them in our ſervice. I have the treaty at large between the honourable council of the Maſſachuſetts, on behalf of the United States, with the delegates of the Saint John's and Mickmac tribes. The probability of a copy's being ſent already, and its great length, prevent one coming herewith. If Congreſs have not had it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded to them, I will ſend a copy by the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity after notice that it has not been received.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Auguſt</hi> 9.—By a report received from general Greene laſt night, at ſunſet and a little after, about a hundred boats were ſeen bringing troops from Staten-Iſland to the ſhips, three of which had fallen down towards the narrows, having taken in ſoldiers from thirty of the boats. He adds, that, by the beſt obſervations of ſeveral officers, there appeared to be a general embarkation.</p>
                     <p>I have wrote to general Mercer for two thouſand men from the flying camp. Colonel Smallwood's battalion, as part of them, I expect this forenoon: but where the reſt are to come from, I know not, as, by the general's laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, not more than three or four hundred of the new levies had got in.</p>
                     <p>In my letter of the fifth I incloſed a general return of the army under my immediate command; but I imagine the following ſtate will give Congreſs a more perfect idea, though not a more agreeable one, of our ſituation. For the ſeveral poſts on New-York, Long and Governor's iſlands, and Paulus-Hook, we have, fit for duty, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred and fourteen,—ſick preſent, three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and thirty-nine,—ſick abſent, ſix hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-nine,—on command, two thouſand nine hundred and forty ſix,—on furlough, ninety-ſeven,—total, ſeventeen thouſand two hundred and twenty-five. In addition to theſe, we are only certain of colonel Smallwood's battalion in caſe of an immediate attack. Our poſts too are much divided, having waters between many of them, and ſome diſtant from others fifteen miles. Theſe circumſtances, ſufficiently diſtreſſing of themſelves, are much aggravated
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:029737_0210_0FE24936CFB5F518"/>
by the ſickneſs that prevails through the army. Every day more or leſs are taken down; ſo that the proportion of men that may come in cannot be conſidered as a real and ſerviceable augmentation on the whole.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things are melancholy; but they are neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs true. I hope for better. Under every diſadvantage, my utmoſt exertions ſhall be employed to bring about the great end we have in view: and, ſo far as I can judge from the profeſſions and apparent diſpoſition of my troops, I ſhall have their ſupport. The ſuperiority of the enemy and the expected attack do not ſeem to have depreſſed their ſpirits. Theſe conſiderations lead me to think, that, though the appeal may not terminate ſo happily in our favour as I could wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h, yet they will not ſucceed in their views without conſiderable loſs. Any advantage they may get, I truſt, will coſt them dear.</p>

                     <p>By the reverend Mr. Madiſon and a Mr. Johnſon, two gentlemen of Virginia, who came from Staten-Iſland yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, where they arrived the day before in the packet with colonel Guy Johnſon, I am informed that nothing material had taken place in England when they left it:—that there had been a change in the French miniſtry, which, many people thought, foreboded a war;—that it ſeemed to be believed by many that Congreſs would attempt to buy off the foreign troops, and that it might be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without great difficulty. Their accounts from Staten-Iſland nearly correſpond with what we had before: they ſay that every preparation is making for an attack;—that the force now upon the iſland is about fifteen thouſand;—that they appear very impatient for the arrival of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign troops, but a very ſmall part having got in. Wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they would attempt any thing before they come, they are uncertain: but they are ſure they will as ſoon as they arrive, if not before. They ſay, from what they could collect from the converſation of officers, &amp;c. they mean to hem us in by getting above us and cutting off all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the country.</p>
                     <p>That this is their plan, ſeems to be corroborated and confirmed by the circumſtance of ſome ſhips of war going out at different times within a few days paſt, and other
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:029737_0211_0FE248E47581D488"/>
veſſels. It is probable that a part are to go round and come up the Sound.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Madiſon ſays lord Howe's powers were not known when he left England;—that general Conway moved, before his departure, that they might be laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the commons; and had his motion rejected by a large majority.</p>

The reſt will be ſent by the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
                     <p>Since my laſt, of the eighth and ninth, the enemy have made no movements of conſequence. They remain nearly in the ſame ſtate; nor have we any further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of their deſigns. They have not been yet joined by the remainder of the fleet with the Heſſian troops.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Smallwood and his battalion got in on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; and colonel Miles is alſo here with two battalions more of Pennſylvania riflemen.</p>
                     <p>The convention of this State have been exerting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to call forth a portion of their militia to an encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forming above Kingſbridge, to remain in ſervice for the ſpace of one month after their arrival there; and alſo half of thoſe in King and Queen's counties, to reinforce the troops on Long-Iſland till the firſt of September, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſooner diſcharged. General Morris too is to take poſt with his brigade on the Sound and Hudſon's-river for ten days, to annoy the enemy in caſe they attempt to land; and others of their militia are directed to be in readineſs, in caſe their aid ſhould be required. Upon the whole, from the information I have from the convention, the militia ordered are now in motion, or will be in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:029737_0212_0FE2493959E84F18"/>
time, and will amount to about three thouſand or more. From Connecticut, I am not certain what ſuccours are coming. By one or two gentlemen who have come from thence, I am told ſome of the militia were aſſembling, and, from the intelligence they had, would march this week.</p>
                     <p>By a letter from governor Trumbull, of the fifth, I am adviſed that the troops from that State, deſtined for the northern army, had marched for Skeneſborough. Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Ward too, by a letter of the fourth, informs me that the two regiments would march from Boſton laſt week, having been cleanſed and generally recovered from the ſmall-pox. I have alſo countermanded my orders to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Elmore, and directed him to join the northern army, having heard, after my orders to Connecticut for his march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hither, that he and moſt of his regiment were at Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or within its vicinity. General Ward mentions that the council of the Maſſachuſetts State will have in from two to three thouſand of their militia to defend their lines and different poſts, in lieu of the regiments ordered from thence agreeable to the reſolution of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed copy of a reſolve of this State, paſſed the tenth inſtant, will diſcover the apprehenſion they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the defection of the inhabitants of King's county from the common cauſe, and of the meaſures they have taken thereupon. I have directed general Greene to give the committee ſuch aſſiſtance as he can, and they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, in the execution of their commiſſion; though at the ſame time I wiſh the information the convention have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon the ſubject may prove groundleſs.</p>
                     <p>I would beg leave to mention to Congreſs, that, in a letter I received from general Lee, he mentions the valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſequences that would reſult from a number of cav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alry being employed in the ſouthern department. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them (to uſe his own expreſſions) he can anſwer for nothing:—with one thouſand, he would enſure the ſafety of thoſe States. I ſhould have done myſelf the honour of ſubmitting this matter to Congreſs before at his particular requeſt, had it not eſcaped my mind. From his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with that country, and the nature of the grounds, I doubt not he has weighed the matter well, and preſume he
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:029737_0213_0FE248EDDC37C528"/>
has fully repreſented the advantages that would ariſe from the eſtabliſhment of ſuch a corps: all I mean, is, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his requiſition, to mention the matter, that ſuch conſideration may be had upon it (if not already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined) as it may be deſerving of.</p>
                     <p>I have tranſmitted a general return, whereby Congreſs will perceive the whole of our ſtrength, except the two bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions under colonel Miles, which, coming ſince it was made out, are not included.</p>
                     <p>I have incloſed a letter juſt come to hand from Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique. Congreſs will pleaſe to conſider of the purport, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring me with their anſwer and a return of the letter.</p>
                     <p>This moment (ten o'clock) report is made by general Greene that a man-of-war came in yeſterday, and that ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſail of ſhips are now ſtanding i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Your favour of the tenth, with its incloſures, was duly received; and I have inſtructed the ſeveral officers who were promoted, to act in their ſtations as you requeſted, though their commiſſions were not ſent.</p>
                     <p>As we are in extreme want of tents and covering for this army,—a great part of thoſe at the out-poſts having nothing to ſhelter them, nor houſes to go into,—I ſubmit it to Congreſs whether it may not be prudent to remand thoſe that were lately ſent to Boſton, where there are no troops at preſent; and, if there were, the neceſſity for them would not be great, as the town, and barracks at ſeveral of the poſts, would be ſufficient to receive them.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed letter from lieutenant-colonel Henſhaw will diſcover to Congreſs his views and wiſhes, which they will conſider and determine on, in whatever way they think right and conducive to the public good;—meaning only to lay his letter before them.</p>
                     <p>I take the liberty of mentioning that colonel Varnum of Rhode-Iſland has been with me this morning to reſign his commiſſion, conceiving himſelf to be greatly injured in not having been noticed in the late arrangement and promotion of general officers.

                     <p>In my letter of yeſterday I forgot to mention the arrival of lord Dunmore here.

                     <p>I HAVE been honoured with your favour of the ſixteenth with the incloſure, and am ſorry it is not in my power to tranſmit Congreſs a copy of the treaty as they require, having ſent it away with the other papers that were in my hands.</p>
                     <p>The reſolution they have entered into reſpecting the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign troops, I am perſuaded, would produce ſalutary effects if it could be properly circulated among them. I fear it will be a matter of difficulty. However, I will take every meaſure that ſhall appear probable to facilitate the end.</p>
                     <p>I have the honour to incloſe you, for the peruſal and conſideration of Congreſs, ſundry papers marked N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1 to N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 7, incluſive; the whole of which, except N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2 and 7, (my anſwers to lord Drummond and general Howe) I received yeſterday evening by a flag, and to which I beg leave to refer Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>I am exceedingly at a loſs to know the motives and cauſes inducing a proceeding of ſuch a nature at this time, and why lord Howe has not attempted ſome plan of nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation before, as he ſeems ſo deſirous of it. If I may be allowed to conjecture and gueſs at the cauſe, it may be that part of the Heſſians have not arrived, as mentioned in the examination tranſmitted yeſterday,—or that general Burgoyne has not made ſuch progreſs as was expected, to form a junction of their two armies,—or, what I think equally probable, they mean to procraſtinate their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for ſome time, truſting that the militias which have come to our ſuccour will ſoon become tired and return home, as is but too uſual with them. Congreſs will make their obſervations upon theſe ſeveral matters, and favour me with the reſult as ſoon as they have done. They will obſerve my anſwer to lord Drummond, who (I am pretty confident) has not attended to the terms of his parole, but
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:029737_0219_0FE248F269FDCD38"/>
has violated it in ſeveral inſtances. It is with the reſt of the papers; but, if my memory ſerves me, he was not to hold any correſpondence directly or indirectly with thoſe in arms againſt us, or to go into any port or harbour in America, where the enemy themſelves were or had a fleet, or to go on board their ſhips.</p>
                     <p>The treaty with the Indians is in the box which lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant-colonel Reed, I preſume, has delivered before this. If Congreſs are deſirous of ſeeing it, they will be pleaſed to have the box opened. It contains a variety of papers, and all the affairs of the army, from my firſt going to Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, till it was ſent away.</p>
                     <p>This morning the Phoenix and Roſe men-of-war, with two tenders, availing themſelves of a favourable and briſk wind, came down the river, and have joined the fleet. Our ſeveral batteries fired at them in their paſſage, but without any good effect that I could perceive.</p>

                     <p>I WAS yeſterday morning favoured with yours of the ſeventeenth, accompanied by ſeveral reſolutions of Congreſs, and commiſſions for officers appointed to the late vacancies in this army.</p>
                     <p>I wrote ſome days ago to general Schuyler to propoſe to generals Carleton and Burgoyne an exchange of priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in conſequence of a former reſolve of Congreſs author<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iſing their commanders in each department to negociate one. That of major Meigs for major French, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Dearborn's for any officer of equal rank, I ſubmitted to general Howe's conſideration, by letter, on the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, underſtanding their paroles had been ſent him by general Carleton; but have not yet received his anſwer upon the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect to the exchange of the priſoners in Canada, if à propoſition on that head has not been already made, (and I believe it has not) the incloſed copy of general Carleton's orders (tranſmitted me under ſeal by major Bigelow, who was ſent with a flag to general Burgoyne
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:029737_0221_0FE248FC49440A30"/>
from Ticonderoga, with the proceedings of Congreſs on the breach of capitulation at the Cedars, and the inhuman treatment of our people afterwards) will ſhew it is unnec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary, as he has determined to ſend them to their own provinces, there to remain as priſoners; interdicting at the ſame time all kind of intercourſe between us and his army, except ſuch as may be for the purpoſe of imploring the king's mercy. The aſſaſſination he mentions, of brigadier-general Gordon, is a fact entirely new to me, and what I never heard of before. I ſhall not trouble Congreſs with my ſtrictures upon this * * * performance, * * * on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerving that its deſign is ſomewhat artful, and that each boatman with major Bigelow was furniſhed with a copy.</p>
                     <p>I have alſo tranſmitted Congreſs a copy of the major's journal, to which I beg leave to refer them for the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence reported by him on his return from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>By a letter from general Greene yeſterday evening, he informed me he had received an expreſs from Hog-Iſland inlet, adviſing that five of the enemy's ſmall veſſels had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the mouth of the creek, with ſome troops on board;—alſo that he had heard two peri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>guas were off Oyſter-bay, the whole ſuppoſed to be after live ſtock; and to prevent their getting it, he had detached a party of horſe, and two hundred and twenty men, among them twenty ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flemen. I have not received further intelligence upon the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>I am alſo adviſed by the examination of a captain Button (maſter of a veſſel that had been taken) tranſmitted me by general Mercer, that the general report among the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's troops, when he came off, was, that they were to attack Long-Iſland, and to ſecure our works there if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, at the ſame time that another part of their army was to land above this city. This information is corroborated by many other accounts, and is probably true: nor will it be poſſible to prevent them landing on the iſland, as its great extent affords a variety of places favourable for that purpoſe, and the whole of our works on it are at the end
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:029737_0222_0FE2494E94F41320"/>

It could not have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened laſt night, by reaſon of a moſt violent guſt.</p>

                     <p>I have detached from hence ſix battalions as a rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement to our troops there, which are all that I can ſpare at this time, not knowing but the fleet may move up with the remainder of their army, and make an attack here, on the next flood-tide. If they do not, I ſhall ſend a further reinforcement, ſhould it be neceſſary; and have ordered five battalions more to be in readineſs for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>I have no doubt but a little time will produce ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant events. I hope they will be happy. The rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement detached yeſterday went off in high ſpirits; and I have the pleaſure to inform you that the whole of the army, that are effective and capable of duty, diſcover the ſame, and great cheerfulneſs. I have been obliged to appoint major-general Sullivan to the command on the iſland, owing to general Greene's indiſpoſition:—he has been extremely ill for ſeveral days, and ſtill continues bad.</p>

                     <p>THE irregularity of the poſt prevents your receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the early and conſtant intelligence it is my wiſh to communicate. This is the third letter which you will probably receive from me by the ſame poſt. The firſt was of little or no conſequence: but that of yeſterday gave you the beſt information I had been able to obtain of the enemy's landing and movements upon Long-Iſland. Having occaſion to go over thither yeſterday, I ſent my letter to the poſt-office at the uſual hour, being informed that the rider was expected every moment, and would go out again directly: but in the evening when I ſent to inquire, none had come in.</p>
                     <p>I now incloſe you a report made to me by general Sullivan after I left Long-Iſland yeſterday. I do not conceive that the enemy's whole force was in motion, but a detached party rather. I have ſent over four more regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with boats, to be ready either to reinforce the troops under general Sullivan, or to return to this place, if the remainder of the fleet at the watering-place ſhould puſh up to the city; which hitherto (I mean, ſince the landing upon Long-Iſland) they have not had in their power to do, on account of the wind which has either been a-head or too ſmall when the tide has ſerved.

                     <p>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favours of the twentieth and twenty-fourth, and am happy to find
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:029737_0225_0FE248FF97838BE8"/>
my anſwer to lord Drummond has met the approbation of Congreſs. Whatever his views were, moſt certainly his conduct reſpecting his parole is highly reprehenſible.</p>
                     <p>Since my letter of the twenty-fourth, almoſt the whole of the enemy's fleet have fallen down to the Narrows; and, from this circumſtance, and the ſtriking of their tents at their ſeveral encampments on Staten-Iſland from time to time previous to the departure of the ſhips from thence, we are led to think they mean to land the main body of their army on Long-Iſland, and to make their grand puſh there. I have ordered over conſiderable reinforcements to our troops there, and ſhall continue to ſend more as circumſtances may require. There has been a little ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing and irregular firing kept up between their and our advanced guards, in which colonel Martin of the Jerſey levies has received a wound in his breaſt, which, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, will prove mortal; a private has had his leg broke by a cannon-ball, and another has received a ſhot in the groin from their muſketry. This is all the damage they have yet done us:—what they have ſuſtained, is not known.</p>
                     <p>The ſhifting and changing the regiments have undergone of late has prevented their making proper returns, and of courſe put it out of my power to tranſmit a general one of the army. However, I believe our ſtrength is much the ſame as it was when the laſt was made, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, of nine militia regiments come from the State of Connecticut, averaging about three hundred and fifty men each. Theſe are nine of the fourteen regiments mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my letter of the nineteenth. Our people ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be very ſickly.</p>
                     <p>The papers deſigned for the foreign troops have been put into ſeveral channels, in order that they might be conveyed to them; and, from the information I had yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, I have reaſon to believe many have fallen into their hands.</p>
                     <p>I have incloſed a copy of lord Drummond's ſecond let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (in anſwer to mine) which I received ſince I tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his firſt, and which I have thought neceſſary to lay before Congreſs, that they may poſſeſs the whole of the
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:029737_0226_0FE249519ABEF068"/>

                     <p>I THIS minute returned from our lines on Long-Iſland, where I left his excellency the General. From him I have it in command to inform Congreſs, that yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday he went there, and continued till evening, when, from the enemy's having landed a conſiderable part of their forces,—and many of their movements,—there was reaſon to apprehend they would make in a little time a general attack. As they would have a wood to paſs through before they could approach the lines, it was thought expedient to place a number of men there on the different roads leading from where they were ſtationed, in order to haraſs and annoy them in their march. This being done, early this morning a ſmart engagement enſued between the enemy and our detachments, which, being unequal to the force they had to contend with, have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a pretty conſiderable loſs: at leaſt many of our men are miſſing. Among thoſe that have not returned, are generals Sullivan and lord Stirling. The enemy's loſs is not known certainly: but we are told by ſuch of our troops as were in the engagement and have come in, that they had many killed and wounded. Our party brought off a lieutenant, ſerjeant, and coporal, with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty privates, priſoners.</p>

                        <pb n="228" facs="unknown:029737_0227_0FE249011AA23CC0"/>
While theſe detachments were engaged, a column of the enemy deſcended from the woods, and marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the centre of our lines with a deſign to make an impreſſion, but were repulſed. This evening they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very numerous about the ſkirts of the woods, where they have pitched ſeveral tents: and his excellency in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to think they mean to attack and force us from our lines by way of regular approaches, rather than in any other manner.</p>
                     <p>To-day, five ſhips of the line came up towards the town, where they ſeemed deſirous of getting, as they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a long time againſt an unfavourable wind: and on my return this evening, I found a deſerter from the twenty-third regiment, who informed me that they deſign, as ſoon as the wind will permit them to come up, to give us a ſevere cannonade, and to ſilence our batteries, if poſſible. I have the honour to be, in great haſte, Sir, your moſt obedient,</p>

                     <p>I WAS laſt night honoured with your favour of the twenty-ſeventh, accompanied by ſundry reſolutions of Congreſs. Thoſe reſpecting the officers, &amp;c. that may be wounded in the ſervice of the States, are founded much in juſtice, and (I ſhould hope) may be productive of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſalutary conſequences. As to the encouragement to the Heſſian officers, I wiſh it may have the deſired effect. Perhaps it might have been better had the offer been ſooner made.</p>
                     <p>Before this, you will probably have received a letter from Mr. Harriſon, of the twenty-ſeventh, adviſing of the engagement between a detachment of our men and the enemy on that day. I am ſorry to inform Congreſs that I have not yet heard either of general Sullivan or lord Stirling, who (they would obſerve) were among the miſſing after the engagement: nor can I aſcertain our loſs. I am hopeful, part of our men will yet get in: ſeveral did yeſterday morning. That of the enemy is alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain:

                     <p>There was ſome ſkirmiſhing, the greateſt part of yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, between parties from the enemy and our people: in the evening it was pretty ſmart. The event I have not yet learned.</p>
                     <p>The weather of late has been extremely wet.

I am in hopes they will all be got to-day, and that they will be more comfortably provided, though the great ſcarcity of theſe articles diſtreſſes us beyond meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, not having any thing like a ſufficient number to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect our people from the inclemency of the weather;—which has occaſioned much ſickneſs, and the men to be almoſt broken down.</p>

                     <p>INCLINATION as well as duty would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to give Congreſs the earlieſt information of my removal and that of the troops, from Long-Iſland and its dependencies, to this city, the night before laſt: but the extreme fatigue which myſelf and family have undergone, as much from the weather ſince as the engagement on the twenty-ſeventh, rendered me and them entirely unfit to take pen in hand. Since Monday, ſcarce any of us have been out of the lines till our paſſage acroſs the Eaſt-river was effected yeſterday morning; and, for forty-eight hours preceding that, I had hardly been off my horſe, and never cloſed my eyes; ſo that I was quite unfit to write or dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate till this morning.</p>
                     <p>Our retreat was made without any loſs of men or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and in better order than I expected from troops in the ſituation ours were. We brought off all our cannon and ſtores, except a few heavy pieces, which, in the condition the earth was by a long-continued rain, we
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:029737_0229_0FE249092AF84650"/>
found, upon trial, impracticable. The wheels of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages ſinking up to the hobs rendered it impoſſible for our whole force to drag them. We left but little proviſions on the iſland, except ſome cattle which had been driven within our lines, and which, after many attempts to force acroſs the water, we found impoſſible to effect, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced as we were.</p>
                     <p>I have incloſed a copy of the council of war held pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the retreat, to which I beg leave to refer Congreſs for the reaſons, or many of them, that led to the adoption of that meaſure.</p>
                     <p>Yeſterday evening and laſt night, a party of our men were employed in bringing our ſtores, cannon, tents, &amp;c. from Governor's-Iſland, which they nearly completed. Some of the heavy cannon remain there ſtill, but (I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect) will be got away to-day.</p>
                     <p>In the engagement on the twenty-ſeventh, generals Sullivan and Stirling were made priſoners. The former has been permitted, on his parole, to return for a little time. From my lord Stirling I had a letter by general Sullivan (a copy of which I have the honour to tranſmit) that contains his information of the engagement with his brigade. It is not ſo full and certain as I could wiſh:—he was hurried moſt probably, as his letter was unfiniſhed:—nor have I been yet able to obtain an exact account of our loſs;—we ſuppoſe it from ſeven hundred to a thouſand killed and taken.</p>
                     <p>General Sullivan ſays lord Howe is extremely deſirous of ſeeing ſome of the members of Congreſs; for which purpoſe he was allowed to come out, and to communicate to them what has paſſed between him and his lordſhip. I have conſented to his going to Philadelphia, as I do not mean, or conceive it right, to withhold, or prevent him from giving, ſuch information as he poſſeſſes in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                     <p>I am much hurried and engaged in arranging and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new diſpoſitions of our forces; the movements of the enemy requiring them to be immediately had;—and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have only time to add, that I am, with my beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards to Congreſs, their and your moſt obedient, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>AS my intelligence of late has been rather unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and would be received with anxiety and concern, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly happy ſhould I eſteem myſelf, were it in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at this time to tranſmit ſuch information to Congreſs, as would be more pleaſing and agreeable to their wiſhes:—but, unfortunately for me,—unfortunately for them,—it is not.</p>
                     <p>Our ſituation is truly diſtreſſing. The check our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment ſuſtained on the twenty-ſeventh ultimo has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited too great a proportion of our troops, and filled their minds with apprehenſion and deſpair. The militia, inſtead of calling forth their utmoſt efforts to a brave and manly oppoſition in order to repair our loſſes, are diſmayed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable, and impatient to return. Great numbers of them have gone off,—in ſome inſtances, almoſt by whole regiments, by half ones, and by companies at a time. This circumſtance, of itſelf, independent of others, when fronted by a well-appointed enemy ſuperior in number to our whole collected force, would be ſufficiently diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:—but, when their example has infected another part of the army,—when their want of diſcipline, and refuſal of almoſt every kind of reſtraint and government, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a like conduct but too common to the whole, and an entire diſregard of that order and ſubordination neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the well doing of an army, and which had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated before, as well as the nature of our military eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment would admit of,—our condition is ſtill more alarming: and with the deepeſt concern I am obliged to confeſs my want of confidence in the generality of the troops.</p>
                     <p>All theſe circumſtances fully confirm the opinion I ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er entertained, and which I more than once in my letters took the liberty of mentioning to Congreſs, that no depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence could be put in a militia, or other troops than thoſe enliſted and embodied for a longer period than our regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions heretofore have preſcribed. I am perſuaded, and as fully convinced as I am of any one fact that has happened, that our liberties muſt of neceſſity be greatly hazarded if not entirely loſt, if their defence is left to any but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:029737_0231_0FE2490BDBE2CF28"/>
ſtanding army,—I mean, one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>xiſt during the war. Nor would the expenſe, incident to the ſupport of ſuch a body of troops as would be competent to almoſt every exigency, far exceed that which is daily incurred by calling in ſuccour, and new enliſtments, which, when ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, are not attended with any good conſequences. Men who have been free, and ſubject to no control, cannot be reduced to order in an inſtant; and the privileges and exemptions they claim and will have, influence the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of others; and the aid derived from them is nearly counterbalanced by the diſorder, irregularity, and confuſion they occaſion.</p>
                     <p>I cannot find that the bounty of ten dollars is likely to produce the deſired effect. When men can get double that ſum to engage for a month or two in the militia, and that militia frequently called out, it is hardly to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The addition of land might have a conſiderable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on a permanent enliſtment.</p>
                     <p>Our number of men at preſent fit for duty is under twenty thouſand; they were ſo by the laſt returns and beſt accounts I could get after the engagement on Long-Iſland; ſince which, numbers have deſerted. I have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered general Mercer to ſend the men intended for the flying camp to this place, about a thouſand in number, and to try with the militia, if practicable, to make a diverſion upon Staten-Iſland.</p>
                     <p>Till of late, I had no doubt in my own mind, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending this place: nor ſhould I have yet, if the men would do their duty: but this I deſpair of. It is painful, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely grating to me, to give ſuch unfavourable accounts: but it would be criminal to conceal the truth at ſo critical a juncture. Every power I poſſeſs ſhall be exerted to ſerve the cauſe; and my firſt wiſh is, that, whatever may be the event, the Congreſs will do me the juſtice to think ſo.</p>
                     <p>If we ſhould be obliged to abandon the town, ought it to ſtand as winter quarters for the enemy? They would derive great conveniences from it on the one hand; and much property would be deſtroyed on the other. It is an important queſtion, but will admit of but little time for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation. At preſent I dare ſay the enemy mean to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it if they can. If Congreſs therefore ſhould reſolve
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:029737_0232_0FE2495D85B1FE18"/>
upon the deſtruction of it, the reſolution ſhould be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſecret, as the knowledge of it will make a capital change in their plans.</p>

                     <p>SINCE I had the honour of addreſſing you on the ſecond, our affairs have not undergone a change for the better, nor aſſumed a more agreeable aſpect than what they then wore. The militia, under various pretences, of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c. are daily diminiſhing; and in a little time, I am perſuaded, their number will be very inconſiderable.</p>
                     <p>On Monday night a forty-gun ſhip paſſed up the Sound between Governor's and Long-Iſland, and anchored in Turtle-bay. In her paſſage ſhe received a diſcharge of cannon from our batteries, but without any damage; and, having a favourable wind and tide, ſoon got out of their reach. Yeſterday morning I diſpatched major Crane of the artillery, with two twelve-pounders and a howitzer, to annoy her; who, hulling her ſeveral times, forced her from that ſtation, and to take ſhelter behind an iſland, where ſhe ſtill continues. There are ſeveral other ſhips of war in the Sound, with a good many tranſports or ſtore-ſhips which came round Long-Iſland, ſo that that communication is entirely cut off. The admiral, with the main body of the fleet, is cloſe in with Governor's-Iſland.</p>
                     <p>Judging it expedient to guard againſt every contingency as far as our peculiar ſituation will admit, and that we may have reſources left if obliged to abandon this place, I have ſent away and am removing above Kingſbridge all our ſtores that are unneceſſary, and that will not be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately wanted.</p>
                     <p>I have incloſed ſeveral original letters from ſome of our officers priſoners at Quebec, which fell into general Gates's hands, and were tranſmitted by him to general Schuyler who ſent them to me. General Gates adds, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who brought them ſaid general Burgoyne had ſent meſſages to the inhabitants upon the lakes; inviting their
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:029737_0233_0FE2490D5F2D6A30"/>
continuance on their farms, and aſſuring them that they ſhould remain in ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>The poſt-maſter having removed his office from the city to Dobbs's-ferry, as it is ſaid, makes it extremely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and will be the means of my not giving ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and regular intelligence as I could wiſh. Cannot ſome mode be deviſed, by which we may have a pretty conſtant and certain intercourſe and communication kept up? It is an intereſting matter, and of great importance; and, as ſuch, I am perſuaded, will meet with due attention from Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>I have tranſmitted the copy of general Gates's letter as ſent me by general Schuyler, from which Congreſs will diſcover all the information I have reſpecting general Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne's meſſage, and my lateſt intelligence from Ticonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga, with the returns of the army there. Thoſe of the army here it is, impoſſible to obtain, till the hurry and buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle we are now in are a little over.</p>

                     <p>Since my letter of the fourth, nothing very material has occurred, unleſs it is that the fleet ſeem to be drawing more together, and all getting cloſe in with Governor's-Iſland. Their deſigns we cannot learn; nor have we been able to procure the leaſt information of late, of any of their plans or intended operations.</p>
                     <p>As the enemy's movements are very different from what we expected,—and, from their large encampments a
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:029737_0234_0FE2495F09E69390"/>
conſiderable diſtance up the Sound, there is reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they intend to make a landing above or below Kingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, and thereby to hem in our army, and cut off the communication with the country,—I mean to call a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of general officers to-day or to-morrow, and endeavour to digeſt and fix upon ſome regular and certain ſyſtem of conduct to be purſued in order to battle their efforts and counteract their ſchemes; and alſo to determine of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency of evacuating or attempting to maintain the city and the ſeveral poſts on this iſland. The reſult of their opinion and deliberations I ſhall adviſe Congreſs of by the earlieſt opportunity, which will be by expreſs, having it not in my power to communicate any intelligence by poſt, as the office is removed to ſo great a diſtance, and entirely out of the way.</p>
                     <p>I have incloſed a liſt of the officers who are priſoners, and from whom letters have been received by a flag. We know there are others not included in the liſt.</p>
                     <p>General Sullivan having informed me that general Howe was willing that an exchange of him for general Preſcot ſhould take place, it will be proper to ſend general Preſcot immediately, that it may be effected.</p>
                     <p>As the milltia regiments in all probability will be impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to return, and become preſſing for their pay, I ſhall be glad of the direction of Congreſs, whether they are to receive it here or from the conventions or aſſemblies of the reſpective States to which they belong. On the one hand, the ſettlement of their abſtracts will be attended with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and difficulty: on the other, they will go away much better ſatisfied, and be more ready to give their aid in future, if they are paid before their departure.</p>
                     <p>Before I conclude, I muſt take the liberty of mentioning to Congreſs the great diſtreſs we are in for want of money. Two months' pay (and more to ſome battalions) is now due to the troops here, without any thing in the military cheſt to ſatisfy it. This occaſions much diſſatisfaction, and almoſt a general uneaſineſs. Not a day paſſes without complaints and the moſt importunate and urgent demands on this head. As it may injure the ſervice greatly, and the want of a regular ſupply of caſh produce conſequences of the moſt fatal tendency, I entreat the attention of Congreſs
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:029737_0235_0FE2490EE3C81860"/>
to this ſubject, and that we may be provided as ſoon as can be with a ſum equal to every preſent claim.</p>
                     <p>I have wrote to general Howe, propoſing an exchange of general M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Donald for lord Stirling, and ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely happy to obtain it, as well as that of general Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livan for general Preſcot, being greatly in want of them, and under the neceſſity of appointing, pro tempore, ſome of the colonels to command brigades.</p>

                     <p>SINCE I had the honour of addreſſing you on the ſixth inſtant, I have called a council of the general officers, in order to take a full and comprehenſive view of our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thereupon form ſuch a plan of future defence as may be immediately purſued, and ſubject to no other alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:029737_0236_0FE249608E1DB948"/>
than a change of operations on the enemy's ſide may occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Before the landing of the enemy on Long-Iſland, the point of attack could not be known, or any ſatisfactory judgment formed of their intentions. It might be on Long-Iſland, or Bergen, or directly on the city. This made it neceſſary to be prepared for each, and has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned an expenſe of labour which now ſeems uſeleſs, and is regretted by thoſe who form a judgment from after-knowledge. But I truſt, men of diſcernment will think differently, and ſee that by ſuch works and preparations we have not only delayed the operations of the campaign till it is too late to effect any capital incurſion into the country, but have drawn the enemy's forces to one point and obliged them to [<hi>diſcloſe</hi>] their plan, ſo as to enable us to form our defence on ſome certainty.</p>
                     <p>It is now extremely obvious from all intelligence,—from their movements, and every other circumſtance,—that having landed their whole army on Long-Iſland (except about four thouſand on Staten-Iſland) they mean to incloſe us on the iſland of New-York, by taking poſt in our rear while the ſhipping effectually ſecure the front; and thus, either by cutting off our communication with the country, oblige us to fight them on their own terms, or ſurrender at diſcretion,—or by a brilliant ſtroke en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to cut this army in pieces, and ſecure the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of arms and ſtores, which they well know we ſhall not be able ſoon to replace.</p>
                     <p>Having therefore their ſyſtem unfolded to us, it became an important conſideration how it could be moſt ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully oppoſed. On every ſide there is a choice of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; and every meaſure on our part (however painful the reflection is from experience) to be formed with ſome apprehenſion that all our troops will not do their duty. In deliberating on this great queſtion, it was impoſſible to forget, that hiſtory, our own experience, the advice of our ableſt friends in Europe, the fears of the enemy, and even the declarations of Congreſs, demonſtrate, that on our ſide the war ſhould be defenſive—(it has ever been called a war of poſts)—that we ſhould on all occaſions avoid a general action, nor put any thing to the riſk, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:029737_0237_0FE24916E3718838"/>
compelled by a neceſſity into which we ought never to be drawn.</p>
                     <p>The arguments on which ſuch a ſyſtem was founded were deemed unanſwerable; and experience has given her ſanction. With theſe views, and being fully perſuaded that it would be preſumption to draw out our young troops into open ground againſt their ſuperiors both in number and diſcipline, I have never ſpared the ſpade and pickaxe. I confeſs I have not found that readineſs to defend even ſtrong poſts at all hazards, which is neceſſary to derive the greateſt benefit from them. The honour of making a brave defence does not ſeem to be a ſufficient ſtimulus when ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is very doubtful, and the falling into the enemy's hands probable: but I doubt not, this will be gradually attained. We are now in a ſtrong poſt, but not an impregnable one, nay, acknowledged by every man of judgment to be unten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, unleſs the enemy will make the attack upon lines when they can avoid it, and their movements indicate that they mean to do ſo.</p>
                     <p>To draw the whole army together in order to arrange the defence proportionate to the extent of lines and works, would leave the country open for an approach, and put the fate of this army and its ſtores on the hazard of making a ſucceſsful defence in the city, or the iſſue of an engagement out of it. On the other hand, to abandon a city which has been by ſome deemed defenſible, and on whoſe works much labour has been beſtowed, has a tendency to diſpirit the troops and enfeeble our cauſe. It has alſo been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the key to the northern country. But as to that, I am fully of opinion that the eſtabliſhing of ſtrong poſts at Mount-Waſhington on the upper part of this iſland, and on the Jerſey ſide oppoſite to it, with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the obſtructions already made (and which may be improved) in the water, not only the navigation of Hudſon's-river, but an eaſier and better communication may be more effectually ſecured between the northern and ſouthern States. This, I believe, every one acquainted with the ſituation of the country will readily agree to; and it will appear evident to thoſe who have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of recurring to good maps.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="239" facs="unknown:029737_0238_0FE2496AC199D210"/>
Theſe and many other conſequences, which will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the determination of our next meaſure, have given our minds full employ, and led every one to form a judgment as the various objects preſented themſelves to his view.</p>
                     <p>The poſt at Kingſbridge is naturally ſtrong, and is pretty well fortified: the heights about it are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and might ſoon be made more ſo. Theſe are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant objects, and I have attended to them accordingly. I have alſo removed from the city all the ſtores and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition except what was abſolutely neceſſary for its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and made every other diſpoſition that did not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially interfere with that object,—carefully keeping in view, until it ſhould be abſolutely determined on full conſideration, how far the city was to be defended at all events.</p>
                     <p>In reſolving points of ſuch importance, many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances peculiar to our own army alſo occur. Being only provided for a ſummer's campaign, their clothes, ſhoes, and blankets, will ſoon be unfit for the change of weather which we every day feel. At preſent we have not tents for more than two thirds, many of them old and worn out: but if we had a plentiful ſupply, the ſeaſon will not admit of continuing in them long. The caſe of our ſick is alſo worthy of much conſideration. Their number, by the returns, forms at leaſt one fourth of the army. Policy and humanity require they ſhould be made as comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>With theſe and many other circumſtances before them, the whole council of general officers met yeſterday in order to adopt ſome general line of conduct to be purſued at this important criſis. I intended to have procured their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate opinions on each point; but time would not admit. I was therefore obliged to collect their ſenſe more generally than I could have wiſhed. All agreed the town would not be tenable if the enemy reſolved to bombard and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonade it: but the difficulty attending a removal operated ſo ſtrongly, that a courſe was taken between abandoning it totally and concentring our whole ſtrength for its defence: nor were ſome a little influenced in their opinion, to whom the determination of Congreſs was known, againſt an evac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:029737_0239_0FE24919A30368D0"/>
totally, as they were led to ſuſpect Congreſs wiſhed it to be maintained at every hazard.</p>
                     <p>It was concluded to arrange the army under three divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;—five thouſand to remain for the defence of the city;—nine thouſand to Kingſbridge and its dependencies, as well to poſſeſs and ſecure thoſe poſts, as to be ready to attack the enemy who are moving eaſtward on Long-Iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and, if they ſhould attempt to land on this ſide;—the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to occupy the intermediate ſpace, and ſupport ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;—that the ſick ſhould be immediately removed to Orangetown, and barracks prepared at Kingſbridge with all expedition to cover the troops.</p>
                     <p>There were ſome general officers, in whoſe judgment and opinion much confidence is to be repoſed, that were for a total and immediate removal from the city,—urging the great danger of one part of the army being cut off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other can ſupport it, the extremities being at leaſt ſixteen miles apart;—that our army, when collected, is inferior to the enemy;—that they can move with their whole force to any point of attack, and conſequently muſt ſucceed by weight of numbers, if they have only a part to oppoſe them;—that, by removing from hence, we deprive the enemy of the advantage of their ſhips, which will make at leaſt one half of the force to attack the town;—that we ſhould keep the enemy at bay, put nothing to the hazard, but at all events keep the army together, which may be recruited another year;—that the unſpent ſtores will alſo be preſerved; and, in this caſe, the heavy artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry can alſo be ſecured. But they were overruled by a majority, who thought for the preſent a part of our force might be kept here, and attempt to maintain the city a while longer.</p>
                     <p>I am ſenſible a retreating army is encircled with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; that the declining an engagement ſubjects a gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to reproach; and that the common cauſe may be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the diſcouragement it may throw over the minds of many. Nor am I inſenſible of the contrary effects, if a brilliant ſtroke could be made with any probability of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, eſpecially after our loſs upon Long-Iſland. But, when the fate of America may be at ſtake on the iſſue, when the wiſdom of cooler moments and experienced men
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:029737_0240_0FE2496C7A6599A8"/>
have decided that we ſhould protract the war if poſſible, I cannot think it ſafe or wiſe to adopt a different ſyſtem when the ſeaſon for action draws ſo near a cloſe.</p>
                     <p>That the enemy mean to winter in New-York, there can be no doubt:—that, with ſuch an armament, they can drive us out, is equally clear. The Congreſs having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that it ſhould not be deſtroyed, nothing ſeems to remain, but to determine the time of their taking poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It is our intereſt and wiſh to prolong it as much as poſſible, provided the delay does not affect our future meaſures.</p>
                     <p>The militia of Connecticut is reduced, from ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, to leſs than two thouſand, and in a few days will be merely nominal. The arrival of ſome Maryland troops, &amp;c. from the flying camp, has in a great degree ſupplied the loſs of men: but the ammunition they have carried away will be a loſs ſenſibly felt. The impulſe for going home was ſo irreſiſtible, it anſwered no purpoſe to oppoſe it. Though I would not diſcharge, I have been obliged to acquieſce; and it affords one more melancholy proof, how deluſive ſuch dependencies are.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed I have the honour to tranſmit a general return, the firſt I have been able to procure for ſome time; alſo a report of captain Newel from our works at Horn's-Hook or Hell-gate. Their ſituation is extremely low, and the Sound ſo very narrow, that the enemy have them much within their command.</p>

                     <p>The liſt of priſoners, before omitted through hurry, is now incloſed; though it will probably have reached Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs before this.

                     <p>As ſoon as generals Preſcot and M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Donald arrive, I ſhall take meaſures to adviſe general Howe of it, that the propoſed exchange for general Sullivan and lord Stirling may be carried into execution.</p>
                     <p>Since my letter of the eighth, nothing material has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, except that the enemy have poſſeſſed themſelves of Montezore's-iſland, and landed a conſiderable number of troops upon it. This iſland lies in the mouth of Haerlem-river, which runs out of the Sound into the North-river, and will give the enemy an eaſy opportunity of landing either on the low grounds of Morriſania, if their views are to ſeize and poſſeſs the paſſes above Kingſbridge, or on the plains of Haerlem, if they deſign to intercept and cut off the communication between our ſeveral poſts. I am making every diſpoſition and arrangement that the divided ſtate of our troops will admit of, and which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear moſt likely and the beſt calculated to oppoſe their attacks; for I preſume there will be ſeveral. How the event will be, God only knows: but you may be aſſured that nothing in my power, circumſtanced as I am, ſhall be wanting, to effect a favourable and happy iſſue.</p>
                     <p>By my letter of the eighth you would perceive that ſeveral of the council were for holding the town, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it practicable for ſome time. Many of them now, upon ſeeing our divided ſtate, have altered their opinion, and allow the expediency and neceſſity of concentring our whole force, or drawing it more together. Convinced of the propriety of this meaſure, I am ordering our ſtores
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:029737_0242_0FE2496E027C5E28"/>
away, except ſuch as may be abſolutely neceſſary to keep as long as any troops remain; that, if an evacuation of the city becomes inevitable (which certainly muſt be the caſe) there may be as little to remove as poſſible.</p>

This morning one of the ſhips that have been for ſome time in the Sound mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down towards Hell-gate; but, the tide leaving her, ſhe could not get near enough to bring her guns to bear upon our fortification. If ſhe means to attack it, it is probable ſhe will warp in the next tide. Their batteries have kept up a pretty conſtant fire againſt ours at that place, but without any conſiderable effect. This morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they opened a new one.</p>
                     <p>I do not recollect any other material occurrence, and ſhall only add, that I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

                        </gap> my judgment reſpecting the evacuation of the city. I could wiſh to maintain it, becauſe I know it to be of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: but I am fully convinced that it cannot be done, and that an attempt for that purpoſe, if perſevered in, might and moſt certainly would be attended with conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences the moſt fatal and alarming in their nature.</p>
                     <p>Senſible of this, ſeveral of the general officers, ſince the determination of the council mentioned in my laſt, petitioned that a ſecond council might be called to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the propoſitions which had been before them upon the ſubject. Accordingly I called one on the twelfth, when a large majority not only determined a removal of the army prudent, but abſolutely neceſſary,—declaring they were entirely convinced from a full and minute inquiry into our ſituation, that it was extremely perilous; and, from every movement of the enemy, and the intelligence received, their plan of operations was to get in our rear, and, by cutting off the communication with the main, oblige us to force a paſſage through them on the terms they wiſh, or to become priſoners in ſome ſhort time for want of neceſſary ſupplies of proviſion.</p>
                     <p>We are now taking every method in our power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the ſtores, &amp;c, in which we find almoſt inſuperable difficulties. They are ſo great and ſo numerous, that I fear we ſhall not effect the whole before we meet with ſome interruption. I fully expected that an attack ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where would have been made laſt night. In that I was diſappointed; and happy ſhall I be, if my apprehenſions of one to-night, or in a day or two, are not confirmed by the event. If it is deferred a little while longer, I flatter myſelf all will be got away, and our force be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred, and of courſe more likely to reſiſt them with ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Yeſterday afternoon, four ſhips of war, two of forty and two of twenty-eight guns, went up the Eaſt-river, paſſing between Governor's and Long-Iſland, and anchored about a mile above the city, oppoſite Mr. Stivanſent's, where the Roſe man-of-war was lying before. The deſign of their going not being certainly known, gives riſe to various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,—ſome ſuppoſing they are to cover the landing of
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:029737_0244_0FE2496F84DA14A8"/>
a party of the enemy above the city,—others that they are to aſſiſt in deſtroying our battery at Horn's-hook, that they may have a free and uninterrupted navigation in the Sound. It is an object of great importance to them, and what they are induſtriouſly trying to effect by a pretty conſtant can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonade and bombardment.</p>
                     <p>Before I conclude, I would beg leave to mention to Congreſs, that the pay now allowed to nurſes for their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the ſick is by no means adequate to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; the conſequence of which is, that they are extremely difficult to procure: indeed they are not to be got; and we are under the neceſſity of ſubſtituting in their place a number of men from the reſpective regiments, whoſe ſervice by that means is entirely loſt in the proper line of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and but little benefit rendered to the ſick. The officers I have talked with upon the ſubject all agree that they ſhould be allowed a dollar per week, and that for leſs they cannot be had.</p>
                     <p>Our ſick are extremely numerous, and we find their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval attended with the greateſt difficulty. It i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>ON Saturday about ſunſet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ix more of the enemy's ſhips, one or two of which were men-of-war, paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Governor's-iſland and Red hook, and went up the Eaſt-river to the ſtation taken by thoſe mentioned in my laſt. In half an hour I received two expreſſes,—one from colonel Serjeant at Horn's-hook [Hell-gate] giving an account that the enemy, to the amount of three or four thouſand, had ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ched to the river, and were embarking
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:029737_0245_0FE24924E536D330"/>
for Barns's or Montezore's-iſland, where numbers of them were then encamped;—the other from general Mifflin, that uncommon and formidable movements were diſcovered among the enemy; which being confirmed by the ſcouts I had ſent out, I proceeded to Haerlem, where it was ſuppoſed (or at Morriſania oppoſite to it) the principal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to land would be made. However, nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable happened that night: but in the morning they began their operations. Three ſhips of war came up the North-river as high as Bloomingdale, which put a total ſtop to the removal, by water, of any more of our provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp;c. and about eleven o'clock thoſe in the Eaſt-river began a moſt ſevere and heavy cannonade, to ſcour the grounds, and cover the landing of their troops between Turtle-bay and the city, where breaſtworks had been thrown up to oppoſe them.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as I heard the firing, I rode with all poſſible diſpatch towards the place of landing, when, to my great ſurpriſe and mortification, I found the troops that had been poſted in the lines retreating with the utmoſt precipitation, and thoſe ordered to ſupport them (Parſons's and Fellows's brigades) flying in every direction, and in the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, notwithſtanding the exertions of their generals to form them. I uſed every means in my power to rally and get them into ſome order: but my attempts were fruitleſs and ineffectual; and on the appearance of a ſmall party of the enemy, not more than ſixty or ſeventy, their diſorder increaſed, and they ran away in the greateſt confuſion, without firing a ſingle ſhot.</p>
                     <p>Finding that no confidence was to be placed in theſe brigades, and apprehending that another party of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my might paſs over to Haerlem plains and cut off the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to this place, I ſent orders to ſecure the heights in the beſt manner with the troops that were ſtationed on and near them; which being done, the retreat was effected with but little or no loſs of men, though, of a conſiderable part of our baggage,—occaſioned by this diſgraceful and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ſtardly conduct. Moſt of our heavy cannon, and a part of our ſtores and proviſions which we were about removing, was unavoidably left in the city, though every means (after
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:029737_0246_0FE2497B31964A48"/>
it had been determined in council to evacuate the poſt) had been uſed to prevent it.</p>
                     <p>We are now encamped with the main body of the army on the heights of Haerlem, where I ſhould hope the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would meet with a defeat in caſe of an attack, if the generality of our troops would behave with tolerable brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But experience to my extreme affliction has convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that this is rather to be wiſhed for than expected. However, I truſt that there are many who will act like men, and ſhew themſelves worthy of the bleſſings of freedom.</p>

                     <p>AS my letter of the ſixteenth contained intelligence of an important nature, and ſuch as might lead Congreſs to expect that the evacuation of New-York and retreat to the heights of Haerlem, in the manner they were made, would be ſucceeded by ſome other intereſting event, I beg leave to inform them that as yet nothing has been attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a large and general pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of attack.</p>
                     <p>About the time of the poſt's departure with my letter, the enemy appeared in ſeveral large bodies upon the plains about two and a half miles from hence. I rode down to our advanced poſts, to put matters in a proper ſituation if they ſhould attempt to come on. When I arrived there I heard a firing, which, I was informed, was between a party of our rangers under the command of lieutenant-col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Knolton, and an advanced party of the enemy. Our men came in and told me that the body of the enemy, who kept themſelves concealed, conſiſted of about three hundred as near as they could gueſs. I immediately ordered three companies of colonel Weeden's regiment from Virginia, under the command of major Leitch, and colonel Knolton with his rangers compoſed of volunteers from different
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:029737_0247_0FE2497CB458C1C0"/>
New-England regiments to try to get in their rear, while a diſpoſition was making as if to attack them in front, and thereby draw their whole attention that way.</p>
                     <p>This took effect as I wiſhed on the part of the enemy. On the appearance of our party in front, they immediately ran down the hill, took poſſeſſion of ſome fences and buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and a ſmart firing began, but at too great a diſtance to do much execution on either ſide. The parties under col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Knolton and major Leitch unluckily began their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack too ſoon, as it was rather in flank than in rear. In a little time major Leitch was brought off wounded, having received three balls through his ſide; and in a ſhort time after colonel Knolton got a wound which proved mortal. Their men however perſevered, and continued the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the greateſt reſolution.</p>
                     <p>Finding that they wanted a ſupport, I advanced part of colonel Griffith's and colonel Richardſon's Maryland regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with ſome detachments from the eaſtern regiments who were neareſt the place of action. Theſe troops charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the enemy with great intrepidity, and drove them from the wood into the plain, and were puſhing them from thence (having ſilenced their fire in a great meaſure) when I judged it prudent to order a retreat, fearing the enemy (as I have ſince found was really the caſe) were ſending a large body to ſupport their party.</p>
                     <p>Major Leitch, I am in hopes, will recover: but colonel Knolton's fall is much to be regretted, as that of a brave and good officer. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>By a ſergeant who deſerted from the enemy and came in this morning, I find that their party was greater than I imagined. It conſiſted of the ſecond battalion of light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, a battalion of the royal Highlanders, and three companies of Heſſian riflemen, under the command of brigadier-general Leſlie. The deſerter reports that their loſs in wounded and miſſing was eighty-nine, and eight killed. In the latter, his account is too ſmall, as our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſcovered and buried double that number. This af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, I am in hopes, will be attended with many ſalutary conſequences, as it ſeems to have greatly inſpirited the
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:029737_0248_0FE2497E378FB1A0"/>
whole of our troops. The ſergeant further adds that a conſiderable body of men are now encamped from the Eaſt to the North-river, between the ſeven and eight-mile ſtones, under the command of general Clinton. General Howe, he believes, has his quarters at Mr. Apthorp's houſe.</p>

                     <p>As the period will ſoon arrive, when the troops com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the preſent army (a few excepted) will be diſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the tenor of their enliſtments, and the moſt fatal conſequences may enſue if a ſuitable and timely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is not made in this inſtance, I take the liberty of ſuggeſting to Congreſs not only the expediency but the abſolute neceſſity there is that their earlieſt attention ſhould be had to this ſubject. In reſpect to the time that troops ſhould be engaged for, I have frequently given my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; nor have I omitted to expreſs my opinion of the difficulties that will attend raiſing them, nor of the imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticability of effecting it without the allowance of a large and extraordinary bounty.</p>
                     <p>It is a melancholy and painful conſideration to thoſe who are concerned in the work and have the command, to be forming armies conſtantly, and to be left by troops juſt when they begin to deſerve the name, or perhaps at a moment when an important blow is expected. This, I
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:029737_0250_0FE249DD2AE92350"/>
am informed, will be the caſe at Ticonderoga with part of the troops there, unleſs ſome ſyſtem is immediately come into, by which they can be induced to ſtay. General Schuyler tells me in a letter received yeſterday, that De Haas's, Maxwell's, and Wind's regiments ſtand engaged only till the beginning of next month, and that the men, he is fearful, will not remain longer than the time of their enliſtment.</p>
                     <p>I would alſo beg leave to mention to Congreſs, that the ſeaſon is faſt approaching when clothes of every kind will be wanted for the army. Their diſtreſs is already great, and will be increaſed as the weather becomes more ſevere. Our ſituation is now bad, but is much better than that of the militia that are coming to join us from the States of Maſſachuſetts-Bay and Connecticut in conſequence of the requiſition of Congreſs. They, I am informed, have not a ſingle tent or a neceſſary of any kind; nor can I conceive how it will be poſſible to ſupport them. Theſe circumſtances are extremely alarming, and oblige me to wiſh Congreſs to have all the tents, clothing of every kind, and camp neceſſaries, provided and forwarded, that are to be procured. Theſe eaſtern reinforcements have not a ſingle neceſſary, not a pan or a kettle,—in which we are now greatly deficient. It is with reluctance that I trouble Congreſs with theſe matters: but to whom can I reſort for relief unleſs to them? The neceſſity therefore, which urges the application, will excuſe it, I am perſuaded.</p>
                     <p>I have not been able to tranſmit Congreſs a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the army this week, owing to the peculiar ſituation of our affairs, and the great ſhifting and changing among the troops.

                     <p>FROM the hours allotted to ſleep I will borrow a few moments to convey my thoughts on ſundry important matters to Congreſs. I ſhall offer them with the ſincerity
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:029737_0252_0FE249DF123BEC48"/>
which ought to characterize a man of candour, and with the freedom which may be uſed in giving uſeful informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without incurring the imputation of preſumption.</p>
                     <p>We are now, as it were, upon the eve of another diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of our army. The remembrance of the difficulties which happened upon the occaſion laſt year, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which might have followed the change if proper advantages had been taken by the enemy, added to a knowledge of the preſent temper and ſituation of the troops, reflect but a very gloomy proſpect upon the appearances of things now, and ſatisfy me beyond the poſſibility of doubt, that, unleſs ſome ſpeedy and effectual meaſures are adopted by Congreſs, our cauſe will be loſt.</p>
                     <p>It is in vain to expect that any or more than a trifling part of this army will again engage in the ſervice on the encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement offered by Congreſs. When men find that their townſmen and companions are receiving twenty, thirty, and more dollars, for a few months' ſervice (which is truly the caſe,) it cannot be expected, without uſing compulſion; and to force them into the ſervice would anſwer no valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble purpoſe. When men are irritated, and the paſſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, they fly haſtily and cheerfully to arms: but after the firſt emotions are over * * *, a ſoldier, reaſoned with upon the goodneſs of the cauſe he is engaged in and the ineſtimable rights he is contending for, hears you with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and acknowledges the truth of your obſervations, but adds that it is of no more importance to him than others. The officer makes you the ſame reply, with this further remark, that his pay will not ſupport him, and he cannot ruin himſelf and family to ſerve his country, when every member of the community is equally intereſted and benefited by his labours. * * *</p>
                     <p>It becomes evidently clear then, that, as this conteſt is not likely to be the work of a day,—as the war muſt be carried on ſyſtematically,—and to do it you muſt have good officers,—there are, in my judgment, no other poſſible means to obtain them but by eſtabliſhing your army upon a permanent footing, and giving your officers good pay. This will induce gentlemen and men of character to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage: and, till the bulk of your officers are compoſed of ſuch perſons as are actuated by principles of honour and a
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:029737_0253_0FE24989AFD18038"/>
ſpirit of enterpriſe, you have little to expect from them. They ought to have ſuch allowances as will enable them to live like and ſupport the characters of gentlemen. * * * Beſides, ſomething is due to the man who puts his life in <hi>[your]</hi> hands, hazards his health, and forſakes the ſweets of domeſtic enjoyment. Why a captain in the continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſervice ſhould receive no more than five ſhillings cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency per day for performing the ſame duties that an officer of the ſame rank in the Britiſh ſervice receives ten ſhillings ſterling for, I never could conceive, eſpecially when the latter is provided with every neceſſary he requires upon the beſt terms, and the former can ſcarce procure them at any rate. There is nothing that gives a man conſequence and renders him fit for command, like a ſupport that renders him independent of every body but the State he ſerves.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to the men, nothing but a good bounty can obtain them upon a permanent eſtabliſhment: and for no ſhorter time than the continuance of the war, ought they to be engaged; as facts inconteſtibly prove that the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and coſt of enliſtments increaſe with time. When the army was firſt raiſed at Cambridge, I am perſuaded the men might have been got, without a bounty, for the war. After this, they began to ſee that the conteſt was not likely to end ſo ſpeedily as was imagined, and to feel their conſequence by remarking, that, to get in the militia in the courſe of the laſt year, many towns were induced to give them a bounty.</p>
                     <p>Foreſeeing the evils reſulting from this, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive conſequences which unavoidably would follow ſhort enliſtments, I took the liberty in a long letter (date not now recollected, as my letter-book is not here) to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommend the enliſtments for and during the war, aſſigning ſuch reaſons for it as experience has ſince convinced me were well founded. At that time, twenty dollars would, I am perſuaded, have engaged the men for this term. But it will not do to look back: and, if the preſent opportunity is ſlipped, I am perſuaded that twelve months more will increaſe our difficulties four-fold. I ſhall therefore take the freedom of giving it as my opinion, that a good bounty be immediately offered, aided by the proffer of at leaſt a hundred or a hundred and fifty acres of land, and a ſuit of
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:029737_0254_0FE249E097E43218"/>
clothes and blanket to each non-commiſſioned officer and ſoldier; as I have good authority for ſaying, that, however high the men's pay may appear, it is barely ſufficient, in the preſent ſcarcity and dearneſs of all kinds of goods, to keep them in clothes, much leſs afford ſupport to their families.</p>
                     <p>If this encouragement then is given to the men, and ſuch pay allowed the officers as will induce gentlemen of character and liberal ſentiments to engage, and proper care and precaution uſed in the nomination (having more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the characters of perſons than the number of men they can enliſt,) we ſhould in a little time have an army able to cope with any that can be oppoſed to it, as there are excellent materials to form one out of. But while the only merit an officer poſſeſſes is his ability to raiſe men,—while thoſe men conſider and treat him as an equal, and (in the character of an officer) regard him no more than a broomſtick, being mixed together as one common herd, no order nor diſcipline can prevail; nor will the officer ever meet with that reſpect which is eſſentially neceſſary to due ſubordination.</p>
                     <p>To place any dependence upon militia is aſſuredly reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a broken ſtaff,—men juſt dragged from the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſcenes of domeſtic life,—unaccuſtomed to the din of arms,—totally unacquainted with every kind of military ſkill; which being followed by a want of confidence in themſelves, when oppoſed to troops regularly trained, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined, and appointed, ſuperior in knowledge and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in arms, makes them timid and ready to fly from their own ſhadows. Beſides, the ſudden change in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living (particularly in the lodging) brings on ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in many, impatience in all, and ſuch an unconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſire of returning to their reſpective homes, that it not only produces ſhameful and ſcandalous deſertions among themſelves, but infuſes the like ſpirit into others.</p>
                     <p>Again; men accuſtomed to unbounded freedom and no control, cannot brook the reſtraint which is indiſpenſably neceſſary to the good order and government of an army; without which, licentiouſneſs and every kind of diſorder triumphantly reign. To bring men to a proper degree of ſubordination is not the work of a day, a month, or even
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:029737_0255_0FE2498B34D5F870"/>
a year: and, unhappily for us and the cauſe we are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in, the little diſcipline I have been labouring to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in the army under my immediate command is in a manner done away, by having ſuch a mixture of troops as have been called together within theſe few months.</p>
                     <p>Relaxed and unfit as our rules and regulations of war are for the government of an army, the militia (thoſe prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly ſo called; for of theſe we have two ſorts, the ſix-months-men, and thoſe ſent in as a temporary aid) do not think themſelves ſubject to them, and therefore take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the ſoldier is puniſhed for. This creates jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſy: jealouſy begets diſſatisfactions; and theſe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ripen into mutiny, keeping the whole army in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and diſordered ſtate,—rendering the time of thoſe who wiſh to ſee regularity and good order prevail, more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy than words can deſcribe. Beſides this, ſuch repeated changes take place, that all arrangement is ſet at nought, and the conſtant fluctuation of things deranges every plan as faſt as adopted.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, Sir, Congreſs may be aſſured, are but a ſmall part of the inconveniences which might be enumerated, and attributed to militia: but there is one that merits particular attention, and that is the expenſe. Certain I am, that it would be cheaper to keep fifty or a hundred thouſand in conſtant pay, than to depend upon half the number and ſupply the other half occaſionally by militia. The time the latter are in pay before and after they are in camp, aſſembling and marching,—the waſte of ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, the conſumption of ſtores, which, in ſpite of every reſolution or requiſition of Congreſs, they muſt be furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, or ſent home,—added to other incidental ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes conſequent upon their coming and conduct in camp, ſurpaſſes all idea, and deſtroys every kind of regularity and economy which you could eſtabliſh among fixed and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled troops, and will, in my opinion, prove (if the ſcheme is adhered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>) the ruin of our cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The jealouſies of a ſtanding army, and the evils to be apprehended from one, are remote, and, in my judgment, ſituated and circumſtanced as we are, not at all to be dreaded: but the conſequences of wanting one, according to my ideas formed from the preſent view of things, is
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:029737_0256_0FE249E21B8CC7B8"/>
certain and inevitable ruin. For, if I was called upon to declare upon oath, whether the militia have been moſt ſerviceable or hurtful upon the whole, I ſhould ſubſcribe to the latter. I do not mean by this, however, to arraign the conduct of Congreſs: in ſo doing I ſhould equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn my own meaſures, if I did not my judgment: but experience, which is the beſt criterion to work by, ſo fully, clearly and deciſively reprobates the practice of truſting to militia, that no man who regards order, regularity and economy, or who has any regard for his own honour, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, or peace of mind, will riſk them upon this iſſue. * * *</p>
                     <p>An army formed of good officers moves like clock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work: but there is no ſituation upon earth leſs enviable nor more diſtreſſing than that perſon's wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>s at the head of troops who are regardleſs of order and diſcipline, and who are unprovided with almoſt every neceſſary. In a word, the difficulties which have forever ſurrounded me ſince I have been in the ſervice, and kept my mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly upon the ſtretch,—the wounds which my feelings (as an officer) have received by a thouſand things which have happened contrary to my expectation and wiſhes, * * *—added to a conſciouſneſs of my inability to gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern an army compoſed of ſuch diſcordant parts, and under ſuch a variety of intricate and perplexing circumſtances,—induce not only a belief, but a thorough conviction in my mind, that it will be impoſſible (unleſs there is a thorough change in our military ſyſtem) for me to conduct matters in ſuch a manner as to give ſatisfaction to the public, which is all the recompenſe I aim at, or ever wiſhed for.</p>
                     <p>Before I conclude, I muſt apologize for the liberties taken in this letter, and for the blots and ſcratchings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, not having time to give it more correctly. With truth I can add, that, with every ſentiment of reſpect and eſteem,</p>

                     <p>HAVING wrote you fully on ſundry important ſubjects this morning, as you will perceive by the letter which accompanies this, I mean principally now to incloſe
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:029737_0257_0FE2498CB7929FA0"/>
a copy of a letter received from general Howe on Sunday morning, with the liſts of the priſoners in his hands,—of thoſe in our poſſeſſion belonging to the army immediately under his command,—and of my anſwer, which were omitted to be put in the other. His letter will diſcover to Congreſs his refuſal to exchange lord Stirling for Mr. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Donald, conſidering the latter only as a major. They will be pleaſed to determine how he is to be ranked in future.</p>
                     <p>The number of priſoners according to theſe returns is greater than what we expected. However, I am inclined to believe, that, among thoſe in the liſt from Long-Iſland, are ſeveral militia of general Woodhull's party, who were never arranged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> this army. As to thoſe taken on the fifteenth, they greatly exceed the number that I ſuppoſed fell into their hands in the retreat from the city. At the time that I tranſmitted an account of that affair, I had not obtained returns, and took the matter upon the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers' reports. They are difficult to get with certainty at any time. In the ſkirmiſh of Monday ſe'nnight, they could have taken but very few.</p>
                     <p>Before I conclude, I ſhall take occaſion to mention that thoſe returns made with ſuch preciſion, and the difficulty that will attend the propoſed exchange on account of the diſperſed and ſcattered ſtate of the priſoners in our hands, will clearly evince the neceſſity of appointing commiſſaries and proper perſons to ſuperintend and conduct in ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. This I took the liberty of urging more than once, as well on account of the propriety of the meaſure and the ſaving that would have reſulted from it, as that the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers might be treated with humanity, and have their wants particularly attended to.</p>
                     <p>I would alſo obſerve (as I eſteem it my duty) that this army is in want of almoſt every neceſſary,—tents, camp kettles, blankets, and clothes of all kinds. But what is to be done with reſpect to the two laſt articles, I know not, as the term of enliſtment will be nearly expired by the time they can be provided. This may be exhibited as a further proof of the diſadvantages attending the levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an army upon ſuch a footing as never to know how to keep them without injuring the public or incommoding

the men. I have directed the colonel or commanding officer of each corps to uſe his endeavours to procure ſuch clothing as is abſolutely neceſſary: but at the ſame time I confeſs, that I do not know how they are to be got.</p>

As colonel Hugh Stephenſon, of the rifle regiment or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered lately to be raiſed, is dead according to the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation I have received, I would beg leave to recommend to the particular notice of Congreſs captain Daniel Morgan, juſt returned among the priſoners from Canada, as a fit and proper perſon to ſucceed to the vacancy occaſioned by his death. The preſent field-officers of the regiment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not claim any right in preference to him, becauſe he ranked above them, and as a captain, when he firſt entered the ſervice. His conduct as an officer, on the expedition with general Arnold laſt fall,—his intrepid behaviour in the aſſault upon Quebec, when the brave Montgomery fell,—the inflexible attachment he profeſſed to our cauſe during his impriſonment, and which he perſeveres in,—added to theſe, his reſidence in the place colonel Stephen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon came from, and his intereſt and influence in the ſame circle, and with ſuch men as are to compoſe ſuch a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,—all, in my opinion, entitle him to the favour of Congreſs, and lead me to believe that in his promotion the States will gain a good and valuable officer for the ſort of troops he is particularly recommended to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. * * *</p>

                     <p>I DO myſelf the honour of tranſmitting to you the incloſed letter from lieutenant-colonel Livingſton, with ſundry copies of general Delancey's orders, which diſcover the meaſures the enemy are purſuing on Long-Iſland for raiſing recruits and obtaining ſupplies of proviſions. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the intelligence they contain, and authentic advices through other channels reſpecting th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe matters, I have ſent brigadier-general George Clinton to meet gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Lincoln, who has got as far as Fairfield with part of the troops lately ordered by the Maſſachuſetts aſſembly, to concert with him and others an expedition acroſs the Sound with thoſe troops, three companies under colonel Livingſton, and ſuch further aid as governor. Trumbull can afford, in order to prevent if poſſible their effecting thoſe important objects, and to aſſiſt the inhabitants in the removal of their ſtock, grain, &amp;c. or in deſtroying them, that the enemy may not derive any advantage or benefit from them.</p>
                     <p>The recruiting ſcheme they are proſecuting with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common induſtry; nor is it confined to Long-Iſland alone. Having juſt now received a letter from the committee of Weſt-Cheſter county, adviſing that there are ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of men in that and Ducheſs county preparing to go off and join the king's army, I have given directions to our guard-boats and the centries at our works at Mount-Waſhington to keep a ſtrict look-out in caſe they attempt to come down the North-river; alſo to general Heath at Kingſbridge, that the utmoſt vigilance may be obſerved by the regiments and troops ſtationed above there and down
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:029737_0261_0FE24996EFAE44B0"/>
towards the Eaſt-river, that they may intercept them, ſhould they take that route with a view of croſſing to Long-Iſland. I will uſe every precaution in my power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thoſe parricides from accompliſhing their deſigns: but I have but little hopes of ſucceſs, as it will be no difficult matter for them to procure a paſſage over ſome part or other of the Sound.</p>
                     <p>I have been applied to lately by colonel Weedon of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, for permiſſion to recruit the deficiency of men in his regiment out of the troops compoſing the flying camp,—informing me at the ſame time that ſome of thoſe from Maryland had offered to engage. Colonel Hand of the rifle battalion made a ſimilar application to-day. If the enliſtments could be made, they would have this good conſequence,—the ſecuring of ſo many in the ſervice. However, as the meaſure might occaſion ſome uneaſineſs in their own corps, and be conſidered as a hardſhip by the States to which they belong, and the means of their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing more than the quota extracted from them in the general arrangement, and would make it more difficult for them to complete their own levies, I did not conceive myſelf at liberty to authoriſe it without ſubmitting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of it to the conſideration of Congreſs, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their opinion whether it ſhould be allowed or not.</p>
                     <p>I have incloſed a liſt of warrants granted from the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond to the thirtieth ultimo incluſive, the only return of the ſort that I have been able to make ſince the reſolution for that purpoſe,—owing to the unſettled ſtate of our affairs, and my having ſent my papers away. You will alſo receive ſundry letters, &amp;c. from general Schuyler, which came under cover to me, and which I have the honour of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding.</p>
                     <p>By a letter juſt received from the committee of ſafety of the State of New-Hampſhire, I find a thouſand of their militia were about to march on the twenty-fourth ultimo to reinforce this army in conſequence of the requiſition of Congreſs. Previous to their march, general Ward writes me he was obliged to furniſh them with five hundred pounds of powder and a thouſand pounds of muſket-ball; and I have little reaſon to expect that they are better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with other articles than they were with ammunition.
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:029737_0262_0FE249EF175459E0"/>
In ſuch caſe they will only add to our preſent diſtreſs which is already far too great, and become diſguſted with the ſervice, though the time they are engaged for is only till the firſt of December. This will injure their enliſting for a longer term, if not wholly prevent it.</p>
                     <p>By three deſerters who came from the Galatea man-of-war about five days ago, we are informed that ſeveral tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports had ſailed, before they left her, for England, as it was generally reported, in order to return with a ſupply of proviſions, of which they ſay there is a want. General Mercer, in a letter, informed me that general Thompſon ſaid he had heard they were going to diſmiſs about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the ſhips from the ſervice. I am alſo adviſed by a letter from Mr. Derby at Boſton, of the twenty-ſixth ultimo, that, the day before, a tranſport ſnow had been taken and ſent into Piſcataqua by a privateer, in her paſſage from New-York to the Weſt-Indies. She ſailed with five more under the convoy of a man-of-war, in order to bring from thence the troops that are there, to join general Howe. They were all victualled for four months. From this intelligence it would ſeem as if they did not apprehend any thing to be meditating againſt them by the court of France.</p>

We had an alarm this morning a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before four o'clock, from ſome of our out-centries, who reported that a large body of the enemy was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing towards our lines. This put us in motion: however, it turned out entirely premature; or at leaſt we ſaw noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them.</p>

                     <p>BEFORE I knew of the late reſolutions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs which you did me the honour to incloſe in your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the twenty-fourth, and before I was favoured with the viſit of your committee, I took the liberty of giving you my ſentiments on ſeveral points which ſeemed to be
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:029737_0263_0FE2499874801FE0"/>
of importance. I have no doubt but that the committee will make ſuch report of the ſtate and condition of the army, as will induce Congreſs to believe that nothing but the moſt vigorous exertions can put matters upon ſuch a footing as to give this continent a fair proſpect of ſucceſs. Give me leave to ſay, Sir,—I ſay it with due deference and reſpect (and my knowledge of the facts, added to the importance of the cauſe, and the ſtake I hold in it, muſt juſtify the freedom,)—that your affairs are in a more unpromiſing way than you ſeem to apprehend.</p>
                     <p>Your army, as I mentioned in my laſt, is on the eve of its political diſſolution. True it is, you have voted a larger one in lieu of it: but the ſeaſon is late; and there is a material difference between voting of battalions and raiſing of men. In the latter there are more difficulties than Congreſs are aware of; which makes it my duty (as I have been informed of the prevailing ſentiments of this army) to inform them, that, unleſs the pay of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, eſpecially that of the field-officers, is raiſed, the chief part of thoſe that are worth retaining will leave the ſervice at the expiration of the preſent term, as the ſoldiers will alſo, if ſome greater encouragement is not offered them than twenty dollars and a hundred acres of land.</p>
                     <p>Nothing leſs, in my opinion, than a ſuit of clothes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually given to each non-commiſſioned officer and ſoldier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in addition to the pay and bounty, will avail; and I queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether that will do, as the enemy (from the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of one John Maſh, who, with ſix others, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by our guards) are giving ten pounds bounty for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits, and have got a battalion under major Rogers nearly completed upon Long-Iſland.</p>
                     <p>Nor will leſs pay, according to my judgment, than I have taken the liberty of mentioning in the incloſed eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, retain ſuch officers as we could wiſh to have contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The difference per month in each battalion will amount to better than a hundred pounds. To this may be added the pay of the ſtaff-officers; for it is preſumable they will alſo require an augmentation: but, being few in number, the ſum will not be greatly increaſed by them, and conſequently is a matter of no great moment: but it is a matter of no ſmall importance to make the ſeveral of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:029737_0264_0FE249F099821338"/>
deſirable. When the pay and eſtabliſhment of an officer once become objects of intereſted attention, the ſloth, negligence, and even diſobedience of orders, which at this time but too generally prevail, will be purged off. But while the ſervice is viewed with indifference,—while the officer conceives that he is rather conferring than receiving an obligation,—there will be a total relaxation of all order and diſcipline, and every thing will move heavily on, to the great detriment of the ſervice, and inexpreſſible trouble and vexation of the general.</p>
                     <p>The critical ſituation of our affairs at this time will juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify my ſaying that no time is to be loſt in making of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs experiments. An unavailing trial of a month to get an army upon the terms propoſed may render it impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to do it at all, and prove fatal to our cauſe; as I am not ſure whether any rubs in the way of our enliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or unfavourable turn in our affairs, may not prove the means of the enemy recruiting men faſter than we do. To this may be added the inextricable difficulty of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one corps out of another, and arranging matters with any degree of order, in the face of an enemy who are watching for advantages.</p>
                     <p>At Cambridge, laſt year, where the officers (and more than a ſufficiency of them) were all upon the ſpot, we found it a work of ſuch extreme difficulty to know their ſentiments (each having ſome terms to propoſe) that I deſpaired once of getting the arrangements completed: and I do ſuppoſe, that at leaſt a hundred alterations took place before matters were finally adjuſted. What muſt it be then under the preſent regulation, where the officer is to negociate this matter with the State he comes from, diſtant perhaps two or three hundred miles?—ſome of whom, without leave or licenſe from me, ſet out to make perſonal application, the moment the reſolve got to their hands. What kind of officers theſe are, I leave Congreſs to judge.</p>
                     <p>If an officer of reputation (for none other ſhould be applied to) is aſked to ſtay, what anſwer can he give, but in the firſt place, that he does not know whether it is at his option to do ſo, no proviſion being made in the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Congreſs, even recommendatory of this meaſure;
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:029737_0265_0FE24999F6888A70"/>
conſequently, that it reſts with the State he comes from (ſurrounded perhaps with a variety of applications, and influenced probably by local attachments) to determine whether he can be provided for or not? In the next place, if he is an officer of merit, and knows that the State he comes from is to furniſh more battalions than it at preſent has in the ſervice, he will ſcarcely, after two years' faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervices, think of continuing in the rank he now bears, when new creations are to be made, and men appointed to offices (nowiſe ſuperior in merit, and ignorant perhaps of ſervice) over his head. A committee, ſent to the army from each State, may upon the ſpot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ix things with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of propriety and certainty, and is the only method I can ſee of bringing matters to a deciſion with reſpect to the officers of the army. But what can be done in the meanwhile towards the arrangement in the country, I know not. In the one caſe you run the hazard of loſing your officers; in the other, of encountering delay, unleſs ſome method could be deviſed of forwarding both at the ſame inſtant.</p>
                     <p>Upon the preſent plan, I plainly foreſee an intervention of time between the old and new army, which muſt be fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed up with militia (if to be had) with whom no man who has any regard for his own reputation can undertake to be anſwerable for conſequences. I ſhall alſo be miſtaken in my conjectures, if we do not loſe the moſt valuable offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in this army, under the preſent mode of appointing them: conſequently, if we have an army at all, it will be compoſed of materials not only entirely raw, but (if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common pains are not taken) entirely unfit: and I ſee ſuch a diſtruſt and jealouſy of military power, that the commander in chief has not an opportunity, even by rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommendation, to give the leaſt aſſurances of reward for the moſt eſſential ſervices. In a word, ſuch a cloud of perplexing circumſtances appear before me, without one flattering hope, that I am thoroughly convinced, unleſs the moſt vigorous and deciſive exertions are immediately adopted to remedy theſe evils, that the certain and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute loſs of our liberties will be the inevitable conſequence; as one unhappy ſtroke will throw a powerful weight into the ſcale againſt us, enabling general Howe to recruit his

army as faſt as we ſhall ours,—numbers being diſpoſed [<hi>to join him</hi>] and many actually doing ſo already. Some of the moſt probable remedies, and ſuch as experience has brought to my more intimate knowledge, I have taken the liberty to point out: the reſt I beg leave to ſubmit to the conſideration of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>I aſk pardon for taking up ſo much of their time with my opinions. But I ſhould betray that truſt which they and my country have repoſed in me, were I to be ſilent upon a matter ſo extremely intereſting. With the moſt perfect eſteem, I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>I WAS laſt night honoured with your favour of the ſecond with ſundry reſolutions of Congreſs. * * *</p>
                     <p>In reſpect to the exchange of priſoners, I fear it will be a work of great difficulty, owing to their diſperſed and ſcattered ſituation throughout the States. In order to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, I have wrote to the eaſtern governments to have them collected, and to tranſmit me an account of their number, diſtinguiſhing the names and ranks of the field and commiſſioned officers, and the corps they belong to. I have alſo wrote to governor Livingſton of the Jerſeys up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject, and muſt take the liberty of requeſting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to give directions that a ſimilar return may be made of thoſe in Pennſylvania and Maryland, and for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to Brunſwic, that they may be ready to be exchanged for an equal number of thoſe of the ſame rank.</p>
                     <p>I obſerve, by the reſolve of the twenty-ſixth ultimo, that the exchange in particularly directed to be made of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and ſoldiers taken on Long-Iſland. But ſhould not that follow the exchange of thoſe officers and men who have lately returned from Quebec, whoſe impriſonment has been much longer, and whoſe ſervice has not been leſs ſevere, and, in many inſtances, conducted with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity? I have had many applications ſince their arrival, by which they claim a kind of preference as far as their number and the circumſtances of their rank will allow,
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:029737_0267_0FE249A462103318"/>
and which I thought it my duty to mention, that I may obtain ſome direction upon the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>You will obſerve by a paragraph of a letter received yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday from general Howe, a copy of which you have at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> length, that the non-performance of the agreement between captain Forſter and general Arnold, by which the latter ſtipulated for the return of an equal number of officers and priſoners in our hands for thoſe delivered him, is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an unfavourable light, and entirely imputed to me, as having the chief command of the armies of the States, and a controlling power over general Arnold. The point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manner in which Mr. Howe is pleaſed to expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could not perſonally affect me, ſuppoſing there had been no good grounds for the treaty not being ratified, having been nothing more than an inſtrument of conveying to him the reſolutions formed upon the ſubject. * * *</p>
                     <p>However, I would beg leave to obſerve, from the letters from the hoſtages,—from what has been reported by others reſpecting captain Forſter's having uſed his endeavours to reſtrain the ſavages from exerciſing their wonted barbarities, though in ſome inſtances they did,—his purchaſing ſome of the priſoners for a pretty conſiderable premium,—but, above all, from the delicate nature of ſuch treaties, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the non-obſervance of them muſt damp the ſpirits of the officers who make them, and add affliction to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of thoſe whom neceſſity and the nature of the caſe force into captivity to give them a ſanction by a long and irkſome confinement,—for theſe reaſons and many more that will readily occur, I could wiſh Congreſs to reconſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the matter, and to carry it into execution.</p>
                     <p>I am ſenſible the wrong was originally in their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſavages, and that whatever cruelties were committed by them ſhould be eſteemed their own acts: yet perhaps, in point of policy, it may not be improper to overlook theſe infractions on their part, and to purſue that mode which will be the moſt likely to render the hardſhips in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to war moſt tolerable, and the greateſt benefits to the State.</p>
                     <p>I have ventured to ſay thus much upon the ſubject from a regard to the ſervice, and becauſe ſuch gentlemen of the
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:029737_0268_0FE249FB660BF1C8"/>
army as I have heard mention it ſeem to wiſh the treaty had been ratified rather than diſallowed.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed is a liſt of vacancies in the third regiment of Virginia troops, in part occaſioned by the death of major Leitch who died of his wounds on Tueſday morning,—and of the gentlemen who ſtand next in regimental order, and who are recommended to ſucceed to them. You will obſerve that captain John Fitzgerald is ſaid to be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the duty of major. This I have done in order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the oldeſt captain in the regiment, and, I believe, an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of unexceptionable merit, and as it was highly neceſſary at this time to have the corps as well and fully officered as poſſible. There is alſo a vacancy in the firſt continental battalion by the promotion of lieutenant Clarke to a major<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in the flying camp, to which colonel Hand has recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended William Patten to ſucceed, as you will perceive by his letter incloſed.</p>
                     <p>I have taken the liberty to tranſmit a plan for eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a corps of engineers, artificers, &amp;c. ſketched out by colonel Putnam, and which is propoſed for the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Congreſs. How far they may incline to adopt it, or whether they may chooſe to proceed upon ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive ſcale, they will be pleaſed to determine. However, I conceive it a matter well worthy of their conſideration, being convinced from experience, and from the reaſons ſuggeſted by colonel Putnam who has acted with great dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igence and reputation in the buſineſs, that ſome eſtabliſhment of the ſort is highly neceſſary, and will be productive of the moſt beneficial conſequences.</p>
                     <p>If the propoſition is approved by Congreſs, I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by good authority that there is a gentleman in Virginia, in the colony ſervice, John Stadler, eſquire, a native of Germany, whoſe abilities in this way are by no means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable. I am told he was an engineer in the army under general Stanwix, and is reputed to be of ſkill and ingenuity in the profeſſion. In this capacity I do not know him myſelf, but am intimately acquainted with him in his private character, as a man of underſtanding and of good behaviour. I would ſubmit his merit to the inquiry of Congreſs; and if he ſhould anſwer the report I have
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:029737_0269_0FE249A5E58AFA28"/>
had of him, I make no doubt but he will be ſuitably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for.</p>
                     <p>The convention of this State have lately ſeized and had appraiſed two new ſhips, valued at ſix thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty-nine pounds York currency, which they have ſent down for the purpoſe of ſinking, and obſtructing the channel oppoſite Mount-Waſhington. The price being high, and the opinions various as to the neceſſity of the meaſure, ſome conceiving the obſtruction nearly ſufficient already, and others that they would render it ſecure, I would wiſh to have the direction of Congreſs upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject by the earlieſt opportunity, thinking myſelf, that, if the enemy ſhould attempt to come up, they ſhould be uſed, ſooner than to hazard their paſſing. I muſt be governed by circumſtances, yet hope for their ſentiments before any thing is neceſſary to be done.</p>
                     <p>Sundry diſputes having ariſen of late between officers of different regiments and of the ſame rank, reſpecting the right of ſucceſſion to ſuch vacancies as happen from death or other cauſes,—ſome ſuggeſting that it ſhould be in a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonial line and governed by the priority of their commiſſions; others, that it ſhould be regimentally,—and there being an inſtance now before me, between the officers of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia regiments, occaſioned by the death of major Leitch; it has become abſolutely neceſſary that Congreſs ſhould determine the mode by which promotions are to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,—whether colonially and by priority of commiſſions, or regimentally, reſerving a right out of the general rule they adopt, to reward for particular merit, or of withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from office ſuch as may not be worthy to ſucceed.</p>
                     <p>I have only propoſed two modes for their conſideration, being ſatisfied that promotions through the line (as they are called) can never take place without producing diſcord, jealouſy, diſtruſt, and the moſt fatal conſequences. In ſome of my letters upon the ſubject of promotions, and one which I had the honour of addreſſing to the board of war on the thirtieth ultimo, I adviſed that the mode ſhould be rather practiſed than reſolved on: but I am fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced now of the neceſſity there is of ſettling it in one of the two ways I have taken the liberty to point out, and under the reſtrictions I have mentioned; or the diſputes
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:029737_0270_0FE249FCEA67B298"/>
and applications will be endleſs, and attended with great inconveniences.</p>

                     <p>I DO myſelf the honour of tranſmitting to you a copy of a letter from the comte D'Emery, governor-gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral of the French part of St. Domingo, which I received yeſterday, and alſo my anſwer, which I have incloſed and left open for the conſideration of Congreſs, wiſhing that it may be ſealed if they approve of the ſieur De Chambea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>'s releaſement, which I think may be attended with many valuable conſequences. If Congreſs concur in ſentiment with me, they will be pleaſed to give direction for his paſſage by the firſt opportunity to the French iſlands: if they do not, I ſhall be obliged by your returning my letter.</p>
                     <p>I have alſo the pleaſure of incloſing a copy of a letter from monſieur P. Pennel, which came to hand laſt night, and which contains intelligence of an agreeable and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting nature, for which I beg leave to refer you to the copy. The polite manner in which monſieur Pennel has requeſted to be one of my aides-de-camp demands my acknowledgments. As the appointment will not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any expenſe, and will ſhew a proper regard for his complaiſance and the attachment he is pleaſed to expreſs for the ſervice of the American States, I ſhall take the liberty of complying with his requiſition, and tranſmit him a brevet commiſſion, provided the ſame ſhall be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Congreſs. Their ſentiments upon this ſubject you will be kind enough to favour me with by the firſt opportunity. The incloſed letter for the ſieur De Chambeau you will pleaſe to forward to him (if he is to be enlarged) after cloſing it.</p>
                     <p>Before I conclude, I muſt take the liberty to obſerve that I am under no ſmall difficulties on account of the French gentlemen that are here in conſequence of the commiſſions they have received,—having no means to employ them, or to afford them an opportunity of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that ſervice they themſelves wiſh to give, or which
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:029737_0271_0FE249A76B2BBE18"/>
perhaps is expected by the public. Their want of our language is an objection to their being joined to any of the regiments here at this time, were there vacancies, and not other obſtacles. Theſe conſiderations induce me to wiſh that Congreſs would adopt and point out ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mode to be obſerved reſpecting them. What it ſhould be, they will be beſt able to determine. But to me it appears that their being here now can be attended with no valuable conſequences, and that, as the power of appointing officers for the new army is veſted in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, &amp;c. of the ſeveral States, it will be neceſſary for Congreſs to direct them to be provided for in the regiments to be raiſed, according to the ranks they would wiſh them to bear—(or I am convinced they will never be taken in, let their merit be what it may;)—or to form them into a diſtinct corps which may be increaſed in time. They ſeem to be genteel, ſenſible men; and I have no doubt of their making good officers as ſoon as they can learn as much of our language as to make themſelves well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: but, unleſs Congreſs interfere by their particular direction to the States, they will never be incorporated in any of the regiments to be raiſed: and, without they are, they will be entirely at a loſs, and in the moſt irkſome ſituation, for ſomething to do, as they now are.</p>

                     <p>SINCE I had the honour of writing you yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, I have been favoured with a letter from the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able council of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, covering one from Richard Derby, eſquire, a copy of which is herewith tranſmitted, as it contains intelligence of an important and intereſting nature.</p>
                     <p>As an exchange of priſoners is about to take place, I am induced, from a queſtion ſtated in a letter I received from governor Trumbull this morning, to aſk the opinion of Congreſs, in what manner the States that have had the care of them are to be reimburſed the expenſes incurred on their account. My want of information in this inſtance,
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:029737_0272_0FE249FE6EA8CF18"/>
or whether any account is to be ſent in with the priſoners, would not allow me to give him an anſwer, as nothing that I recollect has ever been ſaid upon the ſubject. He alſo mentions another matter, viz. whether ſuch privates as are mechanics, and others who may deſire to remain with us, ſhould be obliged to return. In reſpect to the latter, I conceive there can be no doubt of our being under a neceſſity of returning the whole, a propoſition having been made on our part for a general exchange, and that agreed to: beſides, the balance of priſoners is greatly againſt us; and I am informed it was particularly ſtipulated by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Montgomery, that all thoſe that were taken in Canada ſhould be exchanged whenever a cartel was ſettled for the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Under theſe circumſtances, I ſhould ſuppoſe the ſeveral committees having the care of them ſhould be inſtructed to make the moſt exact returns of the whole, however wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a part ſhould be to continue with us. At the ſame time I ſhould think, it not improper to inform them of the reaſons leading to the meaſure, and that they ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to eſcape afterwards, which, in all probability, they may effect without much difficulty if they are attached to us, extending their influence to many more, and bringing them away alſo.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of our affairs and the preſent eſtabliſhment of the army requiring our moſt vigorous exertions to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a new one, I preſume it will be neceſſary to furniſh the pay-maſter-general as early as poſſible with money to pay the bounty, lately reſolved on, to ſuch men as will enliſt. Prompt pay perhaps may have a happy effect, and induce the continuance of ſome who are here: but, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, I am certain that nothing can be done; nor have we time to loſe in making the experiment. But then it may be aſked, who is to recruit? or who can conſider themſelves as officers for that purpoſe, till the conventions of the different States have made the appointments?</p>
                     <p>Yeſterday afternoon the exchange between lord Stirling and governor Browne was carried into execution; and his lordſhip is now here. He confirms the intelligence men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by captain Souther, about the tranſports he met, by the arrival of the Daphne man-of-war (a twenty-gun ſhip)
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:029737_0273_0FE249A8F8287700"/>
a few days ago, with twelve ſhips under her convoy, having light-horſe on board. They ſailed with about twenty in each, and loſt about eighty in their paſſage, beſides thoſe in the veſſel taken by captain Souther. He further adds that he had heard it acknowledged more than once, that, in the action of the ſixteenth ultimo, the enemy had a hundred men killed,—about ſixty Highlanders of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſecond regiment, and forty of the light-infantry. This confeſſion coming from themſelves, we may reaſonably conclude, did not exaggerate the number. * * *</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>October</hi> 9. About eight o'clock this morning, two ſhips, of forty-four guns each (ſuppoſed to be the Roebuck and Phenix,) and a frigate of twenty guns, with three or four tenders, got under way from about Bloomingdale where they had been lying ſome time, and ſtood with an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>epted their paſſage while our batteries played upon them: but, to our ſurpriſe and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, they ran through without the leaſt difficulty, and without receiving any apparent damage from our forts, though they kept up a heavy fire from both ſides of the river. Their deſtination or views cannot be known with certainty: but moſt probably they are ſent to ſtop the navigation, and cut off the ſupplies of boards, &amp;c. which we ſhould have received, and of which we are in great need. They are ſtanding up, and I have diſpatched an expreſs to the convention of this State, that notice may be immediately communicated to general Clinton at the Highland fortifications, to put him on his guard in caſe they ſhould have any deſigns againſt them, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions may be taken to prevent the craft belonging to the river falling into their hands.</p>

                     <p>I BEG leave to inform you, that, ſince my letter of the eighth and ninth inſtant which I had the honour of addreſſing you, nothing of importance has occurred, except that the ſhips of war which I then mentioned, in their
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:029737_0274_0FE24A06DDAF8878"/>
paſſage up the river, took a ſloop that was at anchor off the mouth of Spitendevil, and two of our row-gallies which they out-ſailed. The crews, finding that they could not prevent them falling into the enemy's hands, ran them near the ſhore, and effected their own eſcape. From the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence I have received, the ſhips are now lying at Tarry-town, without having landed any men (which ſeemed to be apprehended by ſome) or attempted any thing elſe. Their principal views, in all probability, are, to interrupt our navigation, and to receive ſuch diſaffected perſons as incline to take part againſt us. The former they will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beyond all queſtion; and I fear that their expectations reſpecting the latter will be but too fully anſwered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>October</hi> 12. The incloſed copy of a letter received laſt night from the convention of this State will ſhew you the apprehenſions they are under on account of the diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected among them. I have ordered up a part of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia from Maſſachuſetts under general Lincoln, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, if poſſible, the conſequences which they ſuggeſt may happen, and which there is reaſon to believe the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have in contemplation. I am perſuaded that they are upon the eve of breaking out, and that they will leave nothing uneſſayed that will diſtreſs us and favour the deſigns of the enemy, as ſoon as their ſchemes are ripe for it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>October</hi> 13. Yeſterday the enemy landed at Frog's-Point, about nine miles from hence, further up the Sound. Their number we cannot aſcertain, as they have not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced from the point,—which is a kind of iſland,—but the water that ſurrounds it is fordable at low tide. I have ordered works to be thrown up at the paſſes from the point to the main. From the great number of ſloops, ſchooners, and nine ſhips, that went up the Sound in the evening, full of men, and from the information of two deſerters who came over laſt night, I have reaſon to believe that the greateſt part of their army has moved upwards or is about to do it, purſuing their original plan of getting in our rear, and cutting off our communication with the country.</p>

                     <p>HIS excellency having gone this morning to viſit our poſts beyond Kingſbridge and the ſeveral paſſes leading from Frog's-Point and the necks adjacent, I have the honour to inform you by his command, that no intereſting event has taken place ſince his letter by yeſterday's poſt.</p>
                     <p>Every day's intelligence from the convention of this State holds forth diſcoveries of new plots and of new conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Some of the members ſeem to apprehend that inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections are upon the eve of breaking out, and have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted the neceſſity of ſeizing and ſecuring the paſſes through the Highlands, left the diſaffected ſhould do it. Their preſervation being a matter of the greateſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, his excellency, notwithſtanding the ſituation we are in with reſpect to troops, has detached colonel Taſh with his regiment, lately from New-Hampſhire, in addition to the militia mentioned in his laſt, with directions to receive orders from the convention, as to the ſtation and poſt he is to occupy.</p>
                     <p>There are now in our poſſeſſion ſeveral perſons, inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of this State, who had engaged to join the enemy, and were intercepted in going to them. There are alſo two who confeſs they have been with them, and that they had actually engaged in their ſervice; but, finding the terms (the bounty, pay, &amp;c.) not ſo advantageous as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the information they had received, they were induced to return. As the affairs of this government are in a precarious ſituation, and ſuch as, the convention them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeem to think, forbid their interpoſition farther than taking meaſures to apprehend them, his excellency would wiſh to obtain the ſentiments of Congreſs, and their direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon a ſubject ſo extremely critical and delicate, and
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:029737_0276_0FE24A0973A9C8C8"/>
which, in the conſideration of it, involves many important conſequences.</p>

I am directed by his excellency to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you that we are again obliged to change our diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to counteract the operations of the enemy. Declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an attack upon our front, they have drawn the main body of their army to Frog's-Point, with a deſign of hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming us in, and drawing a line in our rear. To prevent the conſequences which would but too probably follow the execution of their ſcheme, the general officers determined yeſterday that our forces muſt be taken from hence, and extended towards Eaſt and Weſt-Cheſter, ſo as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flank them. General Lee, who arrived on Monday, has ſtrongly urged the abſolute neceſſity of the meaſure. It is propoſed to leave a garriſon at Fort-Waſhington, and to maintain it if poſſible, in order to preſerve the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Jerſeys. They are landing their artillery and waggons upon the Point; and there are now ſeveral boats paſſing up the Sound, full of men.</p>

His excellency would have wrote himſelf, but was going to our ſeveral poſts, when the expreſs arrived.</p>
                     <p>The enemy are purſuing with great induſtry their plan of penetrating the country from the Sound, and of forming a line in our rear. They are now extended from Frog's-Point to New-Rochelle, from whence it is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured they mean to take their route by way of the White-Plains, and from thence to draw a line to the North-river. We on our part have drawn our whole force, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the regiments intended to garriſon Fort-Waſhington, from the iſland of New-York, and have poſſeſſed ourſelves of the heights, paſſes, and advantageous grounds, between
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:029737_0278_0FE24A0AF6D53370"/>
New-Rochelle where the van of their army now lies, and the North-river. They will in all probability attempt to effect their purpoſe by moving higher up. If they do, our forces will move accordingly, it being a principal object to prevent their outflanking us.</p>
                     <p>On Friday, one of their advanced parties, near Eaſt-Cheſter, fell in with part of colonel Glover's brigade, and a ſmart and cloſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>In reſpect to your requiſition for an immediate return of ordnance ſtores, his excellency ſays it cannot poſſibly be complied with in the preſent unſettled ſtate of the army.
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:029737_0279_0FE249B6291EFA40"/>
In order to effect the good purpoſes you have in view, he would take the liberty to recommend the eſtabliſhing of magazines of ammunition and other ordnance ſtores in prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er places of ſecurity, from whence ſupplies could be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally drawn. As large quantities are conſtantly in demand in time of war, he does not conceive your provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in theſe inſtances can be too great.</p>
                     <p>He will direct the regimental returns in future to include arms and accoutrements, and the commiſſary-general to tranſmit monthly liſts of rations. He thinks the regulation extremely proper, though he apprehends the information to be premature reſpecting the over-quantity ſuggeſted to have been drawn, having heard no ſuſpicion of the ſort in this army of late.</p>

                     <p>THE whole of our army is now here and on the neighbouring heights, except the troops left at Mount-Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington and Kingſbridge, (about fourteen hundred at the former, and ſix hundred at the latter) and general Lee's diviſion which now forms the rear, and which is on their march. Our removal, and that of the ſtores, have been attended with a great deal of trouble, owing to the ſcarcity and difficulty of procuring waggons. However, they are nearly effected, and without any loſs. The general officers are now reconnoitring the ſeveral paſſes leading from the enemy, that the moſt important may be immediately ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ſituation of their army remains nearly the ſame as when I had the honour of addreſſing you on the twenty-firſt inſtant. It differs in nothing unleſs it is that their main body is more collected about New-Rochelle. A few of their troops are extended as far as Momarioneck.</p>
                     <p>On Monday night a detachment of our men, under the command of colonel Hazlet, was ſent out to ſurpriſe and cut off major Rogers, if poſſible, with his regiment which was poſted there. By ſome accident or other the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not ſucceed ſo well as I could have wiſhed. However, our advanced party, led on by major Greene of
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:029737_0280_0FE24A0C79293590"/>
the firſt Virginia regiment, fell in with their out-guard, and brought off thirty-ſix priſoners, ſixty muſkets, and ſome blankets. The number killed is not certainly known: but it is reported by an officer who was there, that he counted about twenty-five. Our loſs, two killed, and ten or twelve wounded; among the latter, major Greene, whoſe recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery is very doubtful.</p>
                     <p>On Wedneſday there was alſo a ſmart ſkirmiſh between a party of colonel Hand's riflemen,—about two hundred and forty,—and nearly the ſame number of Heſſian chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeurs, in which the latter were put to the route. Our men buried ten of them on the field, and took two priſoners, one badly wounded. We ſuſtained no other loſs than having one lad wounded, ſuppoſed mortally.</p>
                     <p>The ſhips of war that are in the North-river fell down, yeſterday morning or the evening before, to Dobbs's ferry, to prevent our bringing ſtores from below by water, and the removal of thoſe that are landed there. As ſoon as the waggons, employed in bringing the baggage and ſtores of general Lee's diviſion, are diſengaged, they will be immediately ſent to aſſiſt thoſe already there to remove them.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday night we had the misfortune to loſe one of the new ſhips intended to be ſunk for obſtructing the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. She parted her cables in a ſevere ſquall, when prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly ballaſted, and bilged as ſoon as ſhe ſtruck the ſhore. The other ſhip was ſunk well; and yeſterday morning two brigs, both ready, were ſent down for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>About two o'clock this afternoon, intelligence was brought to Head-Quarters that three or four detachments of the enemy were on their march, and had advanced within about four miles of this place. It has been fully confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince by a variety of perſons who have been out to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onnoitre. Their number cannot be aſcertained: but it is generally conjectured that the detachments are or will be ſucceeded by as many columns compoſing their main body. Our drums have beat to arms, and the men are ordered to their ſeveral poſts. Moſt probably ſome important event is upon the eve of taking place: I hope it will be victory in favour of our arms. General Lee, with his diviſion, has not got up; but I hear he is on his march.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="282" facs="unknown:029737_0281_0FE249B8BAB338C0"/>
Experiment having proved it difficult, if not impoſſible, to prevent the enemy from poſſeſſing the navigation of the North-river, and rendering the communication and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between the States divided by it extremely hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and precarious by means of their ſhips of war, it has become a matter of important conſideration how to remedy the evil, and to guard againſt the conſequences which may reſult from it. I am charged by his excellency to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it to Congreſs as a matter that has employed much of his thought, and that ſeems worthy of their moſt ſerious attention. He has communicated it to ſeveral of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral and other officers, and to many gentlemen of ſenſe and diſcernment, who all agree with him, not only upon the propriety but the abſolute neceſſity that two diſtinct armies ſhould be formed,—one to act particularly in the States which lie on the eaſt, the other in thoſe that are on the ſouth of the river;—the whole however to be raiſed on a general plan, and not to be confined to any particular place by the terms of enliſtment. Theſe matters,—the apparent difficulty and perhaps impracticability of ſuccours being thrown acroſs the river while the enemy can command it,—have induced his excellency to ſubmit the meaſure to their conſideration, not knowing how their operations may be directed, and foreſeeing that innumerable evils may ariſe if a reſpectable force is not appointed to oppoſe their arms whereſoever they are carried.</p>

                     <p>THE ſituation of our affairs not permitting his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency to write himſelf, I have it in charge to inform you, that, on yeſterday morning about ten o'clock, the enemy appeared in ſeveral large columns in our front, and, from their firſt movements, ſeemed as if they meant an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack there. However, halting for a little time, their main body filed off to our left, and preſently began a moſt ſevere and inceſſant cannonade at a part of our troops who had taken poſt on a hill, with a view of throwing up ſome lines. At the ſame time they advanced in two diviſions, and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſmart engagement for about a quarter of an hour, obliged our men to give way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="283" facs="unknown:029737_0282_0FE24A17610E8258"/>
Our loſs is not certainly known; but, from conjecture, is between four and five hundred in killed, wounded, and miſſing. What theirs was, we have not heard.</p>
                     <p>After gaining the hill, (upon which they are entrenching) and leaving a ſufficient number of men and artillery to prevent our repoſſeſſing it, they proceeded to advance by our left; and, as far as I can diſcover, their poſts or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campments now form nearly a ſemicircle. It is evident their deſign is to get in our rear according to their original plan. Every meaſure is taking to prevent them: but the removal of our baggage, &amp;c. is attended with infinite diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and delays.</p>
                     <p>Our poſt, from its ſituation, is not ſo advantageous as could be wiſhed, and was only intended as temporary and occaſional, till the ſtores belonging to the army, which had been depoſited here, could be removed. The enemy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſo ſuddenly has diſtreſſed us much. They are now cloſe at hand, and moſt probably will in a little time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence their ſecond attack: we expect it every hour:—perhaps it is beginning: I have juſt heard the report of ſome cannon.

                     <p>SINCE I had the honour of addreſſing you on the twenty-ninth inſtant, no event of importance has occurred. The enemy are throwing up ſome lines and redoubts in our front, with a view of cannonading as ſoon as they are ready; and at the ſame time are extending their wings far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by our right and left. It is ſuppoſed that one of their objects is to advance a part of their troops, and ſeize on the bridge over Cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>on river, that the communication may be cut off with the upper country. To prevent this, a part of our force is detached, with orders to proceed with the utmoſt expedition, and to ſecure the paſs, if poſſible.</p>
                     <p>We are trying to remove, to guard againſt their deſigns, but are greatly impeded by reaſon of the ſcarcity of wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons in proportion to our baggage and ſtores. Every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion has been employed to obtain a ſufficiency; but they cannot be had in this part of the country. The quarter-maſter has ſent to Connecticut to get a ſupply, if poſſible.</p>

Our army is decreaſing faſt. Several gentlemen, who have come to camp within a few days, have obſerved large numbers of militia returning home on the different roads: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I AM directed by his excellency to acknowledge his receipt of your favour of the twenty-eighth ultimo which came to hand yeſterday evening, and to tranſmit you a copy of the letter. I had the honour of writing you by the Boſton expreſs by his command. Had the expreſs been charged with no other letter, the loſs would not have been attended with any material injury to us or advantage to the enemy, provided it ſhould come to their hands: but there were others from his excellency, of a very intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature, the miſcarriage of which gives him much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. As the bundle was taken away in ſo ſudden and ſecret a manner, I fear there is but little hope of recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it,—being done moſt probably for the expreſs purpoſe of furniſhing the enemy with intelligence, and a ſtate of our army. Beſides his excellency's letters, the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial of which was to Mr. Rutledge, there were five or ſix more from the gentlemen of his family.</p>
                     <p>My letters of the twenty-ninth and of yeſterday, which I had the honour of addreſſing you, will give a pretty full account of our ſituation, and of every matter reſpecting this army antecedent to this date.

                     <p>BY command of his excellency, I have the honour to acknowledge his receipt of your favour of the twenty-fourth ultimo, and to inform you that he eſteems the plan you propoſe to lay before Congreſs, for preventing more rations being drawn than may be due, well calculated to anſwer the end. That reſpecting the ſick ſeems to him not entirely perfect. The captains or commanders of companies are prohibited from drawing pay for ſuch ſick as may be diſcharged from the hoſpitals as unfit for ſervice. If, during their ſtay, and before it can be known whether their caſe will or will not admit of their return, it ſhould become neceſſary to make up a regimental pay-abſtract, in what manner are the officers to make up their rolls? are they to include the ſick, or not?</p>
                     <p>As this is a caſe which may and muſt of neceſſity fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happen, it appears to his excellency that the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed regulations ſhould be more general, and reſtrain the officers from including in their pay-abſtracts or rolls all the ſick they ſend to the hoſpitals, and the pay due them previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their going. In ſuch caſe, thoſe who are diſcharged as unfit for ſervice may receive their pay as intended; and thoſe who return to duty can obtain what was due to them when the regiment was paid, by applying to the paymaſter with the officer and ſurgeon's certificates, or be included in a ſubſequent abſtract. The inconveniences and abuſes which are deſigned to be remedied by theſe regulations, his excellency does not apprehend to ariſe ſo much from neceſſity (as incident to the nature of armies) as from the imperfect inſtitution of the preſent, and the great mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and diverſity of troops compoſing it, and alſo from the inattention of the officers. * * *</p>
                     <p>The defenceleſs ſtate of Pennſylvania, as communicated by the committee of ſafety to your honourable body, is a matter of much concern to his excellency, which is not a little aggravated by the part too many ſeem ready to take in favour of the enemy. He truſts, however, the defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be too inconſiderable to threaten any alarming conſequences.</p>

Before the receipt of your letter, his excellency had wrote to the commanding officer of the Virginia regiments at Trenton, directing him to march them forward towards general Greene's poſt, and there remain under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand till further orders, unleſs ſpecial inſtructions had been or ſhould be given to the contrary by Congreſs, or for their particular deſtination.</p>
                     <p>Agreeable to your requeſt, his excellency has conſulted with general Lee upon the beſt mode for employing the French gentlemen, and making them ſerviceable. The reſult is that they ſhould be appointed to regiments by Congreſs according to the ranks they have been pleaſed to give them, and with the ſame pay as is allowed other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in ſuch caſes. Their want of our language is rather an objection: but it is hoped they will attain a ſufficient knowledge of it, ere it be long, to be of great ſervice; and that, in the interim, their advice and aſſiſtance in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of works may be of uſe where they may be ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.

                     <p>I HAVE the honour to inform you that on yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning the enemy made a ſudden and unexpected movement from the ſeveral poſts they had taken in our front. They broke up their whole encampments the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding night, and have advanced towards Kingſbridge and the North-river. The deſign of this manoeuvre is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of much conjecture and ſpeculation, and cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for with any degree of certainty. The grounds we had taken poſſeſſion of were ſtrong and advantageous, and ſuch as they could not have gained without much loſs of blood in caſe an attempt had been made. I had taken every poſſible precaution to prevent their outflanking us;—which may have led to the preſent meaſure. They may ſtill have in view their original plan, and, by a ſudden wheel, try to accompliſh it. Detachments are conſtantly out to obſerve their motions, and to haraſs them as much as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence of this movement I called a council of general officers to-day, to conſult of ſuch meaſures as ſhould
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:029737_0287_0FE249C41486AB50"/>
be adopted in caſe they purſued their retreat to New-York; the reſult of which is herewith tranſmitted. In reſpect to myſelf, I cannot indulge an idea that general Howe, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he is going to New-York, means to cloſe the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, and to ſit down without attempting ſomething more. I think it highly probable, and almoſt certain, that he will make a deſcent with a part of his troops into Jerſey: and, as ſoon as I am ſatisfied that the preſent manoeuvre is real and not a feint, I ſhall uſe every means in my power to forward a part of our force to counteract his deſigns: nor ſhall I be diſappointed if he ſends a detachment to the ſouthward for the purpoſe of making a winter campaign.</p>
                     <p>From the information I have received, there is now a number of tranſports at Red-Hook, with about three thouſand troops on board. Their deſtination, as given out, is to Rhode-Iſland: but this ſeems altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable for various reaſons; among others, the ſeaſon is much againſt it. In the ſouthern States they will find it milder, and much more favourable for their purpoſes. I ſhall take the liberty of mentioning that it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to ſuggeſt the probability of ſuch a meaſure to the aſſemblies and conventions in thoſe States, that they may be on their guard,—and the propriety of their eſtabliſhing and laying up magazines of proviſions and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in ſuitable places. This is a matter of exceeding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and what cannot be too much attended to.</p>
                     <p>From the approaching diſſolutión of the army, and the departure of the new levies which is on the eve of taking place, and the little proſpect of levying a new one in time, I have wrote to the eaſtern States by the unanimous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the general officers, to forward ſupplies of militia in the room of thoſe that are now here, and who, it is fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will not be prevailed on to ſtay any longer than the time they are engaged for. The propriety of this appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation I truſt will appear, when it is known that not a ſingle officer is yet commiſſioned to recruit, and when it is conſidered how eſſential it is to keep up ſome ſhew of force and ſhadow of an army.</p>
                     <p>I expect the enemy will bend their force againſt Fort-Waſhington, and inveſt it immediately. From ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, it is an object that will attract their earlieſt attention.</p>

I am happy to inform you, that, in the engagement on Monday fe'nnight, I have reaſon to believe our loſs was by no means ſo conſiderable as was conjectured at firſt. By ſome deſerters and priſoners we are told, that of the enemy was tolerably great: ſome accounts make it about four hundred in killed and wounded: all agree that among the former there was a colonel Carr of the thirty-fifth regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>The force that will be ſent to Jerſey after I am ſatisfied of Mr. Howe's retreat, in addition to thoſe now there, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my preſent opinion, will make it neceſſary for me to go with them, to put things in a proper channel, and ſuch a way of defence as ſhall ſeem moſt probable to check the progreſs of the enemy, in caſe they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a deſcent there, or a move toward Philadelphia.</p>

The former was adviſed as the moſt eligible in reſpect to the gentlemen who were here before. It requires time to form an accurate opinion of the merits of an officer; and the preſent ſituation of the army will not allow me to pay a particular attention to monſieur Laytaniac, or ſuch notice as he may wiſh to receive, or I to give: nor is there any way of making his ſtay here agreeable.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE the honour to tranſmit you a copy of a letter from general Gates to general Schuyler, and of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other paper containing intelligence reſpecting the northern army and the ſituation of the enemy in that department. They this minute came to hand; and to them I beg leave to refer you for particulars.</p>
                     <p>By every information I can obtain, and the accounts I had laſt night by two deſerters who were very intelligent and particular, general Howe ſtill has in view an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Jerſeys, and is preparing for it with the greateſt induſtry. I have detached the firſt diviſion of our troops which was thought neceſſary to be ſent, and which I hope will croſs the river at Peekſkill to-day. The ſecond, I expect, will all march this evening; and to-morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I propoſe to follow myſelf, in order to put things in the beſt train I can, and to give him every poſſible oppoſition. I hope (when the two diviſions arrive, and are joined to ſuch other force as I expect to collect) to check his prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs and prevent him from penetrating any diſtance from the river, if not to oblige him to return immediately with ſome loſs. Whatever is in my power to effect, ſhall be done.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE only time to acknowledge the honour of your letter of the fifth inſtant, and its ſeveral incloſures, and to inform you, that, agreeable to the reſolves of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, I ſhall uſe every meaſure in my power that the moving and preſent confuſed ſtate of the army will admit of, to appoint officers for recruiting.</p>
                     <p>You will have been adviſed, before this, of the arrival of commiſſioners from Maſſachuſetts. Others have come from Connecticut: but, from the preſent appearance of things, we ſeem but little if any nearer to levying an army. I had anticipated the reſolve reſpecting the militia, by writing to the eaſtern States and to the Jerſey, by the
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:029737_0290_0FE24A25DAE9A9E8"/>
advice of my general officers, and from a conſciouſneſs of the neceſſity of getting in a number of men if poſſible, to keep up the appearance of an army. How my applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will ſucceed, the event muſt determine. I have little or no reaſon to expect that the militia now here will remain a day longer than the time they firſt engaged for. I have rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommended their ſtay, and requeſted it in general orders. General Lincoln and the Maſſachuſetts commiſſioners are uſing their intereſt with thoſe from that State: but, as far as I can judge, we cannot rely on their ſtaying.</p>
                     <p>I left White-Plains about eleven o'clock yeſterday;—all peace then. The enemy appeared to be preparing for their expedition to Jerſey according to every information. What their deſigns are, or whether their preſent conduct is not a feint, I cannot determine.</p>
                     <p>The Maryland and Virginia troops under lord Stirling have croſſed the river, as have part of thoſe from the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey: the remainder are now embarking. The troops, judged neceſſary to ſecure the ſeveral poſts through the Highlands, have alſo got up. I am going to examine the paſſes, and direct ſuch works as may appear neceſſary; after which, and making the beſt diſpoſition I can of things in this quarter, I intend to proceed to Jerſey, which I expect to do to-morrow.</p>
                     <p>The aſſemblies of Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut, to induce their men more readily to engage in the ſervice, have voted an advance pay of twenty ſhillings per month, in addition to that allowed by Congreſs to privates. It may perhaps be the means of their levying the quotas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted from them ſooner than they could otherwiſe have been raiſed: but I am of opinion, a more fatal and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken policy could not have entered their councils, or one more detrimental to the general cauſe. The influence of the vote will become continental, and materially affect the other States in making up their levies. If they could do it, I am certain, when the troops come to act together, that jealouſy, impatience and mutiny would neceſſarily ariſe. A different pay cannot exiſt in the ſame army. The reaſons are obvious, and experience has proved their force in the caſe of the eaſtern and ſouthern troops laſt ſpring. Senſible of this, and of the pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:029737_0291_0FE249CE88615320"/>
that would inevitably reſult from the advance, I have prevented the commiſſioners from proceeding or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing their terms till they could obtain the ſenſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs upon the ſubject, and remonſtrated againſt it in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to governor Trumbull. I am not ſingular in opinion: I have the concurrence of all the general officers, of its fatal tendency.</p>
                     <p>I congratulate you and Congreſs upon the news from Ticonderoga, and that general Carleton and his army have been obliged to return to Canada without attempting any thing.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE the honour to inform you of my arrival here yeſterday, and that the whole of the troops belonging to the States, which lay ſouth of Hudſon's-river, and which were in New-York government, have paſſed over to this ſide, except the regiment, lately colonel Small-wood's, which I expect is now on their march.</p>
                     <p>That they may be ready to check any incurſions the enemy may attempt in this neighbourhood, I intend to quarter them at Brunſwic, Amboy, Elizabethtown, New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark, and about this place, unleſs Congreſs ſhould conceive it neceſſary for any of them to be ſtationed at or more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to Philadelphia. In ſuch caſe they will be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſignify their pleaſure. There will be very few of them after the departure of thoſe who were engaged for the flying camp, which is faſt approaching. The diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have mentioned ſeems to me well calculated for the end propoſed, and alſo for their accommodation.</p>
                     <p>The movements and deſigns of the enemy are not yet underſtood. Various are the opinions and reports on this head. From every information, the whole have removed from Dobbs's ferry towards Kingſbridge; and it ſeems to be generally believed on all hands, that the inveſting of Fort-Waſhington is one object they have in view: but that can employ but a ſmall part of their force. Whether they intend a ſouthern expedition, muſt be determined by

time: to me there appears a probability of it, which ſeems to be favoured by the advices we have that many tranſports are wooding and watering. General Greene's letter would give you the ſubſtance of the intelligence brought by Mr. Mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap> from Staten-Iſland in this inſtance, which he received before it came to me.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed you have copies of two letters from general Howe, and of my anſwer to the firſt of them. The letter alluded to, and returned in his laſt, was one from myſelf to Mrs. Waſhington, of the twenty-fifth ultimo, from whence I conclude that all the letters which went by the Boſton expreſs have come to his poſſeſſion. You will alſo perceive that general Howe has requeſted the return of Peter jack, a ſervant to major Stewart, to which I have conſented, as he was not in the military line, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition agreeable to the cuſtom of war. This ſervant having been ſent to Philadelphia with the Waldockers and other priſoners, I muſt requeſt the favour of you to have him conveyed to general Greene by the earlieſt opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in order that he may be returned to his maſter.</p>
                     <p>Before I conclude, I beg leave not only to ſuggeſt but to urge the neceſſity of increaſing our field artillery very conſiderably. Experience has convinced me, as it has every gentleman of diſcernment in this army, that, while we remain ſo much inferior to the enemy in this inſtance, we muſt carry on the war under infinite diſadvantages, and without the ſmalleſt probability of ſucceſs. It has been peculiarly owing to the ſituation of the country where their operations have been conducted, and to the rough and ſtrong grounds we poſſeſſed ourſelves of, and over which they had to paſs, that they have not carried their arms, by means of their artillery, to a much greater extent. When theſe difficulties ceaſe by changing the ſcene of action to a level champaign country, the worſt of conſequences are to be apprehended. I would therefore, with the concurrence of all the officers whom I have ſpoken to upon the ſubject, ſubmit to the conſideration of Congreſs whether immediate meaſures ought not to be taken for procuring a reſpectable train.</p>
                     <p>It is agreed on all hands that each battalion ſhould be furniſhed at leaſt with two pieces, and that a ſmaller num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:029737_0293_0FE249D0660F9F30"/>
than a hundred of three pounds, fifty of ſix pounds, and fifty of twelve pounds, ſhould not be provided, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to thoſe we now have. Beſides theſe, if ſome eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen and twenty-four-pounders are ordered, the train will be more ſerviceable and complete. The whole ſhould be of braſs, for the moſt obvious reaſons: they will be much more portable, not half ſo liable to burſt: and, when they do, no damage is occaſioned by it, and they may be caſt over again. The ſizes before deſcribed ſhould be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly attended to: if they are not, there will be great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect miſtakes and confuſion in the charges in time of action, as it has frequently happened in the beſt regulated armies. The diſparity between thoſe I have mentioned and ſuch as are of an intermediate ſize is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to diſcern.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo agreed that a regiment of artilleriſts, with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and experienced officers, ſhould be obtained if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and ſome engineers of known reputation and abilities. I am ſorry to ſay, too ready an indulgence has been had to ſeveral appointments in the latter inſtance, and that men have been promoted, who ſeem to me to know but little if any thing of the buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps this train, &amp;c. may be looked upon by ſome as large and expenſive. True, it will be ſo: but when it is conſidered that the enemy, having effected but little in the courſe of the preſent campaign, will uſe their utmoſt efforts to ſubjugate us in the next, every conſideration of that ſort ſhould be diſregarded, and every poſſible preparation made to fruſtrate their * * * attempts. How they are to be procured, is to be inquired into. That we cannot provide them among ourſelves, or more than a very ſmall proportion, ſo trifling as not to deſerve our notice, is evident. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would adviſe, with all imaginable deference, that, without any abatement of our own internal exertions, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication ſhould be immediately made to ſuch powers as can and may be willing to ſupply them. They cannot be obtained too early, if ſoon enough: and I am told they may be eaſily had from France and Holland.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Trumbull the commiſſary-general has frequently mentioned to me of late the inadequacy of his pay to his trouble and the great riſk he is ſubject to on account of the
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:029737_0294_0FE24A28E5DC71A0"/>
large ſums of money which paſs through his hands. He has ſtated his caſe with a view of laying it before Congreſs and obtaining a more adequate compenſation. My ſentiments upon the ſubject are already known: but yet I ſhall take the liberty to add that I think his complaint to be well founded, and his pay, conſidering the important duties and riſks of his office, by no means ſufficient, and that the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſeems to think it ſhould be upon, himſelf, appears juſt and reaſonable.</p>
                     <p>A propoſition having been made long ſince to general Howe and agreed to by him, for an exchange of priſoners in conſequence of the reſolutions of Congreſs to that effect, I ſhall be extremely happy if you will give directions to the committees and thoſe having the charge of priſoners in the ſeveral States ſouth of Jerſey, to tranſmit me proper liſts of the names of all the commiſſioned officers, and of their ranks and the corps they belong to; alſo the number of non-commiſſioned and privates, and their reſpective regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. You will perceive by his letter, he ſuppoſes me to have affected ſome delay, or to have been unmindful of the propoſition I had made.</p>
                     <p>I propoſe to ſtay in this neighbourhood a few days, in which time I expect the deſigns of the enemy will be more diſcloſed, and their incurſions be made in this quarter, or their inveſtiture of Fort-Waſhington, if they are intended.</p>

The preſervation of the paſſage of the North-river was an object of ſo much conſequence that I thought no pains o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> expenſe too great for that purpoſe: and therefore, after ſending off all the valuable ſtores except ſuch as were neceſſary for its defence, I determined, agreeable to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of moſt of the general officers, to riſk ſomething to defend the poſt on the eaſt ſide, called Mount-Waſhington.</p>
                     <p>When the army moved up in conſequence of general Howe's landing at Frog-point, colonel Magaw was left on that command, with about twelve hundred men, and orders given to defend it to the laſt. Afterwards, reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſmallneſs of the garriſon, and the difficulty of their holding it if general Howe ſhould fall down upon it with his whole force, I wrote to general Greene who had the command on the Jerſey ſhore, directing him to govern himſelf by circumſtances, and to retain or evacuate the poſt as he ſhould think beſt, and revoking the abſolute order to colonel Magaw to defend the poſt to the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. General Greene, ſtruck with the importance of the poſt, and the diſcouragement which our evacuation of poſts muſt neceſſarily have given, reinforced colonel Magaw with detachments from ſeveral regiments of the flying camp, but chiefly of Pennſylvania, ſo as to make up the number about two thouſand.</p>
                     <p>In this ſituation things were yeſterday, when general Howe demanded the ſurrendry of the garriſon, to which colonel Magaw returned a ſpirited refuſal. Immediately upon receiving an account of this tranſaction, I came from Hackinſac to this place, and had partly croſſed the North-river when I met general Putnam and general Greene, who were juſt returning from thence, and informed me that the troops were in high ſpirits, and would make a good defence: and it being late at night, I returned.</p>
                     <p>Early this morning colonel Magaw poſted his troops partly in the lines thrown up by our army on our firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither from New-York, and partly on a commanding hill lying north of Mount-Waſhington,—the lines being all to the ſouthward. In this poſition the attack began about ten o'clock, which our troops ſtood, and returned the fire in ſuch a manner as gave me great hopes the enemy was entirely repulſed. But at this time a body of troops croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:029737_0297_0FE249D36FA382C8"/>
Haerlem-river in boats, and landed inſide of the ſecond lines, our troops being then engaged in the firſt.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Cadwallader, who commanded in the lines, ſent off a detachment to oppoſe them: but they, being over-powered by numbers, gave way; upon which, colonel Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallader ordered his troops to retreat in order to gain the ſort It was done with much confuſion; and the enemy croſſing over came in upon them in ſuch a manner, that a number of them ſurrendered.</p>
                     <p>At this time the Heſſians advanced on the north ſide of the fort in very large bodies. They were received by the troops poſted there, with proper ſpirit, and kept back a conſiderable time; but at length they were alſo obliged to ſubmit to a ſuperiority of numbers, and retire under the cannon of the fort.</p>
                     <p>The enemy, having advanced thus far, halted; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately a flag went in, with a repetition of the demand of the fortreſs, as I ſuppoſe. At this time I ſent a billet to colonel Magaw, directing him to hold out, and I would endeavour this evening to bring off the garriſon, if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs could not be maintained, as I did not expect it could, the enemy being poſſeſſed of the adjacent ground. But, before this reached him, he had entered too far into a treaty to retract: after which, colonel Cadwallader told another meſſenger who went over, that they had been able to obtain no other terms than to ſurrender as priſoners of war. In this ſituation matters now ſtand.

                     <p>I do not yet know the numbers killed or wounded on either ſide: but, from the heavineſs and continuance of the fire in ſome places, I imagine there muſt have been conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable execution.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I HAVE not been yet able to obtain a particular account of the unhappy affair of the ſixteenth, nor of the terms on which the garriſon ſurrendered. The intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that has come to hand is not ſo full and accurate as I could wiſh. One of the artillery, whoſe information is moſt direct, and who eſcaped on Sunday night, ſays the enemy's loſs was very conſiderable, eſpecially in the attack made above the fort by the diviſion of Heſſians that march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Kingſbridge, and where lieutenant-colonel Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, of the late colonel Stephenſon's regiment, was poſted.</p>
                     <p>They burned yeſterday one or two houſes on the heights, and contiguous to the fort, and appeared, by advices from general Greene, to be moving in the evening their main body down towards the city. Whether they will cloſe the campaign without attempting ſomething more, or make an incurſion into Jerſey, muſt be determined by the events themſelves.</p>
                     <p>As Fort-Lee was always conſidered as only neceſſary in conjunction with that on the eaſt ſide of the river, to preſerve the communication acroſs, and to prevent the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from a free navigation, it has become of no importance by the loſs of the other, or not ſo material as to employ a force for its defence. Being viewed in this light, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending that the ſtores there would be precariouſly ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, their removal has been determined on to Boundbrook above Brunſwic, Princeton, Springfield, and Acquacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunk bridge, as places that will not be ſubject to ſudden danger in caſe the enemy ſhould paſs the river, and which have been thought proper as repoſitories for ſome of our ſtores of proviſion and forage.</p>
                     <p>The troops belonging to the flying camp under generals Heard and Beall, with what remains of general Ewing's brigade, are now at Fort-Lee, where they will continue till the ſtores are got away. By the time that is effected, their term of enliſtment will be near expiring; and, if the enemy ſhould make a puſh in this quarter, the only troops that there will be to oppoſe them, will be Hand's, Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lett's, the regiments from Virginia, and that, lately Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's,—the latter greatly reduced by the loſſes it ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:029737_0299_0FE24AA92B79A768"/>
on Long-Iſland, &amp;c. and ſickneſs: nor are the reſt by any means complete. In addition to theſe, I am told there are a few of the militia of this State, who have been called in by governor Livingſton. I ſhall make ſuch a diſpoſition of the whole at Brunſwic and at the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate poſts, as ſhall ſeem moſt likely to guard againſt the deſigns of the enemy, and to prevent them making an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or foraging with detached parties.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed letter from colonels Miles and Atlee will ſhew Congreſs the diſtreſſed ſituation of our priſoners in New-York; and their diſtreſs will become greater every day by the cold inclement ſeaſon that is approaching. It will be happy if ſome expedient can be adopted, by which they may be furniſhed with neceſſary blankets and clothing. Humanity and the good of the ſervice require it. I think the mode ſuggeſted by theſe gentlemen, for eſtabliſhing a credit, appears as likely to ſucceed, and as eligible, as any that occurs to me. It is probable many articles that may be wanted can be obtained there, and upon better terms than elſewhere. In reſpect to proviſion, their allowance perhaps is as good as the ſituation of general Howe's ſtores will admit of: it has been ſaid of late by deſerters and others that they were rather ſcant.</p>
                     <p>By a letter from the paymaſter-general, of the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, he ſays there will be a neceſſity that large and early remittances ſhould be made him. The demands, when the troops now in ſervice are diſmiſſed, will be extremely great. Beſides, the bounty to recruits will require a large ſupply; and he adds that the commiſſary-general has informed him, that, between this and the laſt of December, he ſhall have occaſion for a million of dollars.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>November</hi> 21. The unhappy affair of the ſixteenth has been ſucceeded by further misfortunes. Yeſterday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a large body of the enemy landed between Dobbs's ferry and Fort-Lee. Their object was, evidently, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the whole of our troops and ſtores that lay between the North and Hackinſac rivers, which form a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row neck of land. For this purpoſe, they formed and marched as ſoon as they had aſcended the high grounds towards the fort. Upon the firſt information of their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing landed, and of their movements, our men were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:029737_0300_0FE24A72665A5C00"/>
to meet them: but finding their numbers greatly ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and that they were extending themſelves to ſeize on the paſſes over the river, it was thought prudent to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our men; which was effected, and their retreat ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. We loſt the whole of the cannon that was at the fort (except two twelve-pounders) and a great deal of baggage, between two and three hundred tents, about a thouſand barrels of flour, and other ſtores in the quarter-maſter's department. This loſs was inevitable. As many of the ſtores had been removed as circumſtances and time would admit of. The ammunition had been happily got away.</p>
                     <p>Our preſent ſituation between Hackinſac and Paſſaic rivers being exactly ſimilar to our late one, and our force here by no means adequate to an oppoſition that will promiſe the ſmalleſt probability of ſucceſs, we are taking meaſures to retire over the waters of the latter, when the beſt diſpoſition will be formed that circumſtances will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of.</p>
                     <p>By colonel Cadwallader, who has been permitted by general Howe to return to his friends, I am informed the ſurrender of the garriſon on the ſixteenth was on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon terms as priſoners of war; the loſs of the Heſſians, about three hundred privates and twenty-ſeven officers kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wounded; about forty of the Britiſh troops, and two or three officers; the loſs on our ſide but inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. I beg leave to refer you to him for a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account, and alſo for his relation of the diſtreſſes of our priſoners. Colonels Miles and Atlee's letter, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above, upon this ſubject, was through miſtake ſent from hence yeſterday morning. The mode of relief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by them was a credit or ſupply of caſh through the means of Mr. Franks.

                     <p>I HAVE not yet heard that any proviſion is making to ſupply the place of the troops compoſing the flying camp, whoſe departure is now at hand. The ſituation of our affairs is truly critical, and ſuch as requires uncommon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions on our part. From the movements of the enemy, and the information we have received, they certainly will make a puſh to poſſeſs themſelves of this part of the Jerſey. In order that you may be fully appriſed of our weakneſs, and of the neceſſity there is of our obtaining early ſuccours, I have, by the advice of the general officers here, directed general Mifflin to wait on you. He is intimately acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with our circumſtances, and will repreſent them better than my hurried ſtate will allow.</p>
                     <p>I have wrote to general Lee to come over with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental regiments immediately under his command: thoſe with general Health I have ordered to ſecure the paſſes through the Highlands. I have alſo wrote to governor Livingſton requeſting of him ſuch aid as may be in his power; and would ſubmit it to the conſideration of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs whether application ſhould not be made for part of the Pennſylvania militia to ſtep forth at this preſſing time.</p>
                     <p>Before I conclude, I would mention, if an early and immediate ſupply of money could be ſent to Mr. Dalham to pay the flying camp troops, it might have a happy effect. They would ſubſiſt themſelves comfortably on their return, provide many neceſſaries of which they are in great want; and moreover, it might be the means of inducing many, after ſeeing their friends, to engage again.</p>
                     <p>I expected, on coming here, to have met with many of the militia, but find from inquiry that there are not more than from four to five hundred at the different poſts.</p>

their ſeveral incloſures. The execution of the reſolves has been and will be attended to as far as in my power.</p>
                     <p>I have wrote to general Schuyler to ſend down as early as poſſible the troops in the northern department from this and the State of Pennſylvania. The propoſition for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing Mr. Franklin for general Thompſon I ſhall ſubmit to general Howe, as ſoon as circumſtances will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me.</p>
                     <p>I have nothing in particular to adviſe you of, reſpecting the enemy, more than that they are advancing this way. Part of them have paſſed the Paſſaic; and I ſuppoſe the main body that they have on this ſide the North-river would have done the ſame before now, (as they are coming on) had their progreſs not been retarded by the weather which has been rainy for ſeveral days paſt. I have ſcouts and detachments conſtantly out to haraſs them and watch their motions, and to gain, if poſſible, intelligence of their deſigns.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Miles, who has been permitted to go to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia for a few days by general Howe, will deliver you this, and inform you of the diſtreſſes of our priſoners, and the neceſſity of effecting their exchange as far as we have priſoners to give in return.</p>
                     <p>By a letter from the board of war on the ſubject of an exchange, they mention that ſeveral of the priſoners in our hands have enliſted. It is a meaſure, I think, that cannot be juſtified, though the precedent is furniſhed on the ſide of the enemy: nor do I conceive it good in point of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icy. But, as it has been done, I ſhall leave it with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to order them to be returned or not, as they ſhall judge fit.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE been honoured with your favour of the twenty-ſixth, and with its incloſures, by which I perceive the meaſures that have been adopted for forwarding a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement of militia. Their arrival is much to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſituation of our affairs being truly alarming, and
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:029737_0303_0FE24A3622B1D218"/>
ſuch as demands the earlieſt aids. As general Mifflin's preſence may have a happy influence on the diſpoſition and temper of many of the aſſociators, I ſhall not direct his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſo long as he can be done without, and till it becomes indiſpenſably neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>On Thurſday morning I left Newark, and arrived here yeſterday with the troops that were there. It was the opinion of all the generals who were with me, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to this place was requiſite, and founded in neceſſity, as our force was by no means ſufficient to make a ſtand, with the leaſt probability of ſucceſs, againſt an enemy much ſuperior in number, and whoſe advanced guards were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the town by the time our rear got out. It was the wiſh of all to have remained there longer, and to have halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before we came thus far; but, upon due conſideration of our ſtrength, the circumſtances attending the enliſtment of a great part of our little force, and the frequent advices that the enemy were embarking or about to embark an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other detachment for Staten-Iſland with a view of landing at Amboy to co-operate with this, which ſeemed to be confirmed by the information of ſome perſons who came from the iſland, that they were collecting and impreſſing all the waggons they could find,—it was judged neceſſary to proceed till we came here, not only to prevent their bringing a force to act upon our front and rear, but alſo that we might be more convenient to oppoſe any troops they might land at South-Amboy, which many conjectur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be an object they had in view. This conjecture too had probability and ſome advices to ſupport it.</p>
                     <p>I hoped we ſhould have met with large and early ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours by this time: but as yet no great number of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of this State has come in; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> have I much reaſon to expect that any conſiderable aid will be derived from the counties which lie beyond this river, and in which the enemy are. Their ſituation will prevent it in a great meaſure from thoſe parts where they are, provided the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the people were good. Added to this, I have no aſſurances that more than a very few of the troops compoſing the flying camp will remain after the time of their engagement is out: ſo far from it, I am told that ſome of general Ewing's brigade, who ſtand engaged to
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:029737_0304_0FE24A7EA29BA268"/>
the firſt of January, are now going away. If thoſe go whoſe ſervice expires this day, our force will be reduced to a mere handful.</p>
                     <p>From intelligence received this morning, one diviſion of the enemy was advanced laſt night as far as Elizabeth-town, and ſome of their quarter-maſters had proceeded about four or five miles on this ſide, to provide barns, &amp;c. for their accommodation. Other accounts ſay another diviſion, compoſed of Heſſians, are on the road through Springfield, and are reported to have reached that place laſt night. I do not know how far their views extend: but I doubt not, they mean to puſh every advantage reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſmall number and ſtate of our troops.</p>
                     <p>I early began to forward part of the ſtores from this place towards Philadelphia. Many are gone: the reſt we are removing, and hope to ſecure.</p>

                     <p>I remarked that the enliſtment of priſoners was not a politic ſtep:—my reaſon is this, that in time of danger I have always obſerved ſuch perſons moſt backward, for fear (I ſuppoſe) of falling into the hands of their former maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, from whom they expect no mercy: and this fear they are apt to communicate to their fellow-ſoldiers. They are alſo moſt ready to deſert when any action is expected, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by carrying intelligence, to ſecure their peace.</p>
                     <p>I met captain Heſketh on the road; and, as the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his family did not admit of delay, I permitted him to go immediately to New-York, not having the leaſt doubt but general Howe will make a return of any officer of equal rank who ſhall be required.</p>

                     <p>I YESTERDAY had the honour of writing you, and to adviſe you of our arrival here. I am now to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:029737_0306_0FE24A8026867128"/>
you that the enemy are ſtill advancing, and that their van-guard had proceeded as far as Bonem, a ſmall town about four miles this ſide of Woodbridge, according to my laſt intelligence. As to their number, reports are various. Some ſay they were joined yeſterday by a conſiderable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement from Staten-Iſland. How far this fact may be true, I cannot determine: but, from every information, before, they were between ſix and ſeven thouſand ſtrong.</p>
                     <p>I have for ſome time paſt ſuppoſed Philadelphia to be the object of their movement, and have every reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my opinion well founded,—the advices of ſundry perſons who have had an opportunity of mixing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with them on the march, agreeing that ſuch is the report. I have wrote to governor Livingſton upon the ſubject, requeſting his utmoſt exertions to forward on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuccour in his power. The ſame, I truſt, will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to in Pennſylvania. Without a ſufficient number of men and arms, their progreſs cannot be checked:—at preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent our force is totally inadequate to any attempt.</p>
                     <p>Several officers belonging to the enemy, who were priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, have obtained permiſſion to return. I have not yet ſent in the names of thoſe belonging to us, that are to be exchanged for them. By a Virginia paper, I perceive that captain Morgan and lieutenant Heath who were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoners at Quebec, and now on parole, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted in the late arrangement of officers in that State,—the former to a regiment, the latter to a majority. It would be well if they were releaſed: but, being Virginians, and not knowing that any gentlemen who were taken at the ſame time are ſo circumſtanced, I have declined claiming their return without the opinion of Congreſs, leſt I ſhould incur the charge of partiality.</p>
                     <p>I have ſent forward colonel Humpton to collect proper boats and craft at the ferry for tranſporting our troops: and it will be of infinite importance to have every other craft beſides what he takes for the above purpoſe, ſecured on the weſt ſide of Delaware: otherwiſe they may fall into the enemy's hands and facilitate their views.</p>

                     <p>IN a little time after I wrote you this evening, the enemy appeared in ſeveral parties on the heights oppoſite Brunſwic, and were advancing in a large body towards the croſſing-place. We had a ſmart cannonade whilſt we were parading our men, but without any or but little loſs on either ſide. It being impoſſible to oppoſe them with our preſent force with the leaſt proſpect of ſucceſs, we ſhall retreat to the weſt ſide of Delaware (and have advanced about eight miles) where it is hoped we ſhall meet a rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement ſufficient to check their progreſs.

By ſome means or other he has been delayed. I ſuppoſe he has paſſed the river, as his letter of the twenty-ſixth ultimo mentioned that he had marched a brigade the day before, and ſhould
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:029737_0308_0FE24A81AB205050"/>
follow the next himſelf. The remainder of the troops I conceived neceſſary to guard the ſeveral paſſes through the Highlands; nor do I think they can be called from thence.

                     <p>I ARRIVED here myſelf yeſterday morning with the main body of the army, having left lord Stirling with two brigades at Princeton and that neighbourhood, to watch the motions of the enemy, and give notice of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. I am informed that they had not entered Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wic yeſterday morning at nine o'clock, but were on the oppoſite ſide of the Rariton.</p>
                     <p>Immediately on my arrival here, I ordered the removal of all the military and other ſtores and baggage over the Delaware: a great quantity are already got over; and as ſoon as the boats come up from Philadelphia, we ſhall load them; by which means I hope to have every thing ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this night and to-morrow, if we are not diſturbed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being diſencumbered of my baggage and ſtores, my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſituation will depend entirely upon circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>I have not heard a word from general Lee ſince the twenty-ſixth of laſt month; which ſurpriſes me not a little, as I have diſpatched daily expreſſes to him, deſiring to know when I might look for him. This makes me fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:029737_0309_0FE24A42694EDC10"/>
that my letters have not reached him. I am informed by report that general St. Clair has joined him with three or four regiments from the northward. To know the truth of this, and alſo when I may expect him, and with what numbers, I have this minute diſpatched colonel Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard (general Gates's aide-de-camp) to meet general Lee and bring me an account.</p>
                     <p>I look out earneſtly for the reinforcement from Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia. I am in hopes, that, if we can draw a good head of men together, it will give ſpirits to the militia of this State, who have as yet afforded me little or no aſſiſtance; nor can I find they are likely to do much.</p>
                     <p>General Heard juſt informs me that a perſon, on whoſe veracity he can depend, has reported to him that on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt he counted a hundred and ſeventeen ſail of ſhips going out of the Hook.

                     <p>SINCE I had the honour of addreſſing you yeſterday, I received a letter from general Lee. On the thirtieth ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo he was at Peekſkill, and expected to paſs the river with his diviſion two days after. From this intelligence you will readily conclude that he will not be able to afford us any aid for ſeveral days. The report of general St. Clair's having joined him with three or four regiments, I believe to be altogether premature, as he mentions nothing of it. It has ariſen, as I am informed, from the return of ſome of the Jerſey and Pennſylvania troops from Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga, whoſe time of ſervice is expired. They have reached Pluckemin where I have wrote to have them halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and kept together, if they can be prevailed on, till further orders.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed is a copy of a letter which came to hand laſt night from major Clark, to which I beg leave to refer you for the intelligence it contains. The number of the enemy ſaid to be embarked is ſuppoſed to be rather exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated.
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:029737_0310_0FE24A8BA6ACB220"/>
That there has been an embarkation is not to be doubted, it being confirmed through various channels. By colonel Griffin, who went from Brunſwic on Sunday morning with a captain Sims, to paſs him by our guards, and who was detained by lord Cornwallis till Monday evening on account of his ſituation, the amount of general Clinton's force, from what he could collect from the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, was about ſix thouſand: as to their deſtination, he could not obtain the leaſt information. By him I alſo learn the enemy were in Brunſwic, and that ſome of their advanced parties had proceeded two miles on this ſide. The heavy rain that has fallen has probably checked their progreſs, and may prevent their further movement for ſome time.</p>

Lieutenant Symes came over to me at Brunſwic from Bethlehem without the leaſt guard or eſcort; and a lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the ſeventh regiment went through our whole army, and was at laſt diſcovered by a mere accident. He had a paſs from the council of ſafety, and that was all.

                     <p>AS nothing but neceſſity obliged me to retire before the enemy and leave ſo much of the Jerſeys unprotected, I conceive it my duty, and it correſponds with my incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to make head againſt them ſo ſoon as there ſhall be the leaſt probability of doing it with propriety. That the country might in ſome meaſure be covered. I left two brigades conſiſting of the five Virginia regiments and that of Delaware, containing in the whole about twelve hundred men ſit for duty, under the command of lord Stirling and general Stephen, at Princeton, till the baggage and ſtores could croſs the Delaware, or the troops under their reſpective commands ſhould be forced from thence. I ſhall now, having removed the greateſt part of the above articles, face about with ſuch troops as are here ſit for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and march back to Princeton, and there govern my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by circumſtances and the movements of general Lee.
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:029737_0312_0FE24A8D2A851DD8"/>
At any event, the enemy's progreſs may be retarded by this means if they intend to come on, and the people's fears in ſome meaſure quieted, if they do not. Sorry I am to obſerve, however, that the frequent calls upon the militia of this State, the want of exertion in the principal gentlemen of the country, or a fatal ſupineneſs and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of danger till it is too late to prevent an evil that was not only foreſeen but foretold, have been the cauſes of our late diſgraces.</p>
                     <p>If the militia of this State had ſtepped forth in ſeaſon (and timely notice they had,) we might have prevented the enemy's croſſing the Hackinſac, although without ſome previous notice of the time and place it was impoſſible to have done this at the North-river. We might with equal probability of ſucceſs have made a ſtand at Brunſwic on the Rariton. But as both theſe rivers were fordable in a variety of places (knee-deep only,) it required many men to defend the paſſes; and theſe we had not. At Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſac our force was inſufficient, becauſe a part was at Eliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abethtown, Amboy, and Brunſwic, guarding a coaſt which I thought moſt expoſed to danger; and at Brunſwic, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was diſappointed in my expectation of militia, and becauſe on the day of the enemy's approach (and probably the occaſion of it) the term of the Jerſey and Maryland brigades ſervice expired; neither of which would conſent to ſtay an hour longer.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, among ten thouſand other inſtances, might be adduced to ſhew the diſadvantages of ſhort enliſtments, and the little dependence upon militia in times of real danger. But, as yeſterday cannot be recalled, I will not dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſubject which, no doubt, has given much uneaſineſs to Congreſs, as well as extreme pain and anxiety to myſelf. My firſt wiſh is that Congreſs may be convinced of the impropriety of relying upon the militia, and of the neceſſity of raiſing a larger ſtanding army than what they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d. The ſaving in the article of ſtores, proviſions, and in a thouſand other things, by having nothing to do with mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia unleſs in caſes of extraordinary exigency, and ſuch as could not be expected in the common courſe of events, would amply ſupport a large army, which, well officered, would be daily improving, inſtead of continuing a deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, expenſive, and diſorderly mob.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="314" facs="unknown:029737_0313_0FE24A45A7B200A8"/>
I am clear in opinion, that, if forty thouſand men had been kept in conſtant pay ſince the firſt commencement of hoſtilities, and the militia had been excuſed doing duty during that period, the continent would have ſaved money. When I reflect on the loſſes we have ſuſtained for want of good troops, the certainty of this is placed beyond a doubt in my mind. In ſuch caſe, the militia, who have been haraſſed and tired by repeated calls upon them (and farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and manufactures in a manner ſuſpended,) would, upon any preſſing emergency, have <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>run with alacrity to arms; whereas the cry now is, "they may be as well ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined in one way as another;" and with difficulty they are obtained.</p>
                     <p>I mention theſe things to ſhew, that, in my opinion, if any dependence is placed in the militia another year, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will be deceived. When danger is a little removed from them, they will not turn out at all. When it comes home to them, the well-affected, inſtead of flying to arms to defend themſelves, are buſily employed in removing their families and effects,—whilſt the diſaffected are concerting meaſures to make their ſubmiſſion, and ſpread terror and diſmay all around, to induce others to follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Daily experience and abundant-proofs warrant this information.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall this day reinforce lord Stirling with about twelve hundred men, which will make his number about two thouſand four hundred. To-morrow I mean to repair to Princeton myſelf, and ſhall order the Pennſylvania troops (who are not yet arrived, except part of the German bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion and a company of light infantry) to the ſame place.</p>
                     <p>By my laſt advices, the enemy are ſtill at Brunſwic; and the account adds that general Howe was expected at Eliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abethtown with a reinforcement, to erect the king's ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and demand a ſubmiſſion of this State. I can only give this as a report brought from the enemy's camp by ſome of the country people.</p>

                     <p>COLONEL Reed would inform you of the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which I firſt met with on the road from Trenton to Princeton yeſterday. Before I got to the latter, I received a ſecond expreſs informing me, that, as the enemy were advancing by different routes, and attempting by one to get in the rear of our troops which were there, (and whoſe numbers were ſmall, and the place by no means defenſible) they had judged it prudent to retreat to Trenton. The retreat was accordingly made, and ſince to this ſide of the river.</p>

This information I thought it my duty to communicate as ſoon as poſſible, as there is not a moment's time to be loſt in aſſembling ſuch force as can be collected: and as the object of the enemy cannot now be doubted in the ſmalleſt degree. Indeed I ſhall be out in my conjecture (for it is only conjecture) if the late embarkation at New-York is not for Delaware river, to co-operate with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my under the immediate command of general Howe, who, I am informed from good authority, is with the Britiſh troops and his whole force upon this route.</p>
                     <p>I have no certain intelligence of general Lee, although I have ſent frequent expreſſes to him, and lately a colonel Humpton to bring me ſome accurate accounts of his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. I laſt night diſpatched another gentleman to him (major Hoops) deſiring he would haſten his march to the Delaware, in which I would provide boats near a place called Alexandria, for the tranſportation of his troops. I cannot account for the ſlowneſs of his march.</p>
                     <p>In the diſordered and moving ſtate of the army, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get returns: but, from the beſt accounts, we had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween three thouſand and three thouſand five hundred men, before the Philadelphia militia and German battalion arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:—they amount to about two thouſand.</p>

                     <p>I DID myſelf the honour of writing to you yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and informing you that I had removed the troops to this ſide of the Delaware. Soon after, the enemy made their appearance, and their van entered juſt as our rear guard quitted. We had removed all our ſtores, except a few boards. From the beſt information, they are in two bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, one at and near Trenton, the other ſome miles higher up, and inclining towards Delaware; but whether with intent to croſs there, or throw themſelves between general Lee and me, is yet uncertain.</p>
                     <p>I have this morning detached lord Stirling with his brigade, to take poſt at the different landing-places, and prevent them from ſtealing a march upon us from above:
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:029737_0316_0FE24A9031A30BE8"/>
for I am informed, if they croſs at Coryel's ferry or there-abouts, they are as near to Philadelphia, as we are here. From ſeveral accounts I am led to think that the enemy are bringing boats with them: if ſo, it will be impoſſible for our ſmall force to give them any conſiderable oppoſition in the paſſage of the river, [<hi>as they may</hi>] make a feint at one place, and, by a ſudden removal, carry their boats higher or lower before we can bring our cannon to play upon them.</p>
                     <p>Under theſe circumſtances, the ſecurity of Philadelphia ſhould be our next object. From my own remembrance, but more from information, (for I never viewed the ground) I ſhould think that a communication of lines and redoubts might ſoon be formed from the Delaware to Schuylkill on the north entrance of the city, the lines to begin on the Schuylkill ſide, about the heights of Springate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ry, and run eaſtward to Delaware, upon the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous and commanding grounds. If ſomething of this kind is not done, the enemy might, in caſe any misfortune ſhould b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>al us, march directly in, and take poſſeſſion. We have ever found that lin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>light, are very formidable to them: they would at leaſt give a check till people could recover of the fright and conſternation that naturally attends the firſt appearance of an enemy.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time every ſtep ſhould be taken to collect force, not only from Pennſylvania, but from the moſt neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly States. If we can keep the enemy from entering Philadelphia, and keep the communication by water open for ſupplies, we may yet make a ſtand, if the country will come to our aſſiſtance till our new levies can be collected.</p>
                     <p>If the meaſure of fortifying the city ſhould be adopted, ſome ſkilful perſon ſhould immediately view the grounds, and begin to trace out the lines and works. I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there is a French engineer of eminence in Philadelphia at this time: if ſo, he will be the moſt prope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ge, had advanced a party of about five hundred to Bordentown. By their taking this route, it confirms me in my opinion, that they have an intention to land between this and Philadelphia, as well as above, if they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure boats for that purpoſe.</p>

I laſt night directed commodore Seymour to ſtation all his galleys between Bordentown and Philadelphia, to give the earlieſt intelligence of any appearance of the enemy on the Jerſey ſhore.</p>
                     <p>I yeſterday rode up the river about eleven miles, to lord Stirling's poſt, where I found a priſoner of the forty-ſecond regiment who had been juſt brought in. He informed me that lord Cornwallis was at Pennytown with two battalions of grenadiers, and three of light infantry, all Britiſh, the Heſſian grenadiers, the forty-ſecond Highland regiment, and two other battalions, the names of which he did not remember. He knew nothing of the reaſons of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled there, nor what were their future intentions. But I laſt night received information from my lord Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which had been brought in by his ſcouts, which in ſome meaſure accounted for their being there. They had made a forced march from Trenton on Sunday night, to Coryel's ferry, in hopes of ſurpriſing a ſufficient number of boats to tranſport them; but, finding themſelves diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, had marched back to Pennytown, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained yeſterday. From their ſeveral attempts to ſeize boats, it does not look as if they had brought any with them, as I was at one time informed. I laſt night ſent a perſon over to Trenton, to learn whether there was any appearance of building any: but he could not perceive any preparations for a work of that kind; ſo that I am in hopes, if proper care is taken to keep all the craft out of their way, they will find the croſſing of Delaware a matter of conſiderable difficulty.</p>
                     <p>I received another letter from general Lee laſt evening: it was dated at Chatham (which I take to be near Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtown) the eighth of this month. He had then received my letter ſent by major Hoops, but ſeemed ſtill inclined to hang upon the enemy's rear, to which I ſhould have no objection, had I a ſufficient force to oppoſe them in front: but as I have not at preſent, nor do I ſee much probabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of further reinforcement, I have wrote to him in the moſt preſſing terms, to join me with all expedition.</p>
                     <p>Major Sheldon, who commands the volunteer horſe from Connecticut, waits upon Congreſs to eſtabliſh ſome mode of pay. I can only ſay that the ſervice of himſelf
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:029737_0319_0FE24A53994698A8"/>
and his troop has been ſuch as merits the warmeſt thanks of the public, and deſerves a handſome compenſation for their trouble. Whatever is ſettled now, will ſerve for a precedent in future. From the experience I have had, this campaign, of the utility of horſe, I am convinced there is no carrying on the war without them; and I would therefore recommend the eſtabliſhment of one or more corps (in proportion to the number of foot) in addition to thoſe already raiſed in Virginia. If major Sheldon would undertake the command of a regiment of horſe on the continental eſtabliſhment, I believe he could very ſoon raiſe them; and I can recommend him as a man of activ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and ſpirit, from what I have ſeen of him.</p>

I doubt not but there are ſome who have propagated the report: but what if they have? Their remaining in or leaving Philadelphia muſt be governed by circumſtances and events. If their departure ſhould become neceſſary, it will be right: on the other hand, if there ſhould not be a neceſſity for it, they will remain, and their continuance will ſhew the report to be the production of calumny and falſehood. In a word, Sir, I conceive it a matter that may be as well diſregarded; and that the removal or ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Congreſs, depending entirely upon events, ſhould not have been the ſubject of a reſolve.</p>
                     <p>The intelligence we obtain reſpecting the movements and ſituation of the enemy is far from being ſo certain and ſatisfactory as I could wiſh, though every probable means in my power, and that I can deviſe, are adopted for that
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:029737_0320_0FE24A9B787B5DA8"/>
purpoſe. The lateſt I have received was from lord Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling laſt night. He ſays that two grenadiers of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſkillen regiment, who were taken and brought in by ſome countrymen, inform that generals Howe, Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis, Vaughan, &amp;c. with about ſix thouſand of the flying army, were at Pennytown, waiting for pontons to come up, with which they mean to paſs the river near the Blue Mounts, or at Coryel's ferry,—they believe, the latter;—that the two battalions of guards were at Brunſwic, and the Heſſian grenadiers, chaſſeurs, and a regiment or two of Britiſh troops, are at Trenton.</p>
                     <p>Captain Miller of colonel Hand's regiment alſo informs me, that a body of the enemy were marching to Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton yeſterday morning. He had been ſent over with a ſtrong ſcouting party, and, at day-break, fell in with their advanced guards conſiſting of about four hundred Heſſian troops, who fired upon him before they were diſcovered, but without any loſs, and obliged him to retreat with his party and to take boat. The number of the whole he could not aſcertain: but it appeared to be conſiderable. Captain Miller's account is partly confirmed by commodore Seymour, who reports that four or five hundred of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy had entered the town. Upon the whole, there can be no doubt but that Philadelphia is their object, and that they will paſs the Delaware as ſoon as poſſible. Happy ſhould I be if I could ſee the means of preventing them: at preſent, I confeſs, I do not. All military writers agree that it is a work of great difficulty, nay, impracticable, where there is any extent of coaſt to guard. This is the caſe with us; and we have to do it with a force ſmall and inconſiderable, and much inferior to that of the enemy. Perhaps Congreſs have ſome hope and proſpect of rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements: I have no intelligence of the ſort, and wiſh to be informed on the ſubject. Our little handful is daily decreaſing by ſickneſs and other cauſes: and, without aid, without conſiderable ſuccours and exertions on the part of the people, what can we reaſonably look for o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The ſubject is diſagreeable: but yet it is true. I will leave it, wiſhing that our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

may become ſuch as to do away the apprehenſions which at this time ſeem to fill the minds of too many, and with too much juſtice.</p>
                     <p>By a letter from general Heath, dated at Peekſkill, the eighth, I am adviſed that lieutenant-colonel Voſe was then there with Greaton's, Bond's, and Porter's regiment, amounting in the whole to between five and ſix hundred men, who were coming this way. He adds that generals Gates and Arnold would be at Goſhen that night, with S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ark's, Poor's, and Read's regiments; but for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he does not mention.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed extract of a letter which I received laſt night contains intelligence of an agreeable nature. I wiſh to hear its confirmation by the arrival of the ſeveral prizes: that with clothing and arms will be an invaluable acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall be glad to be adviſed of the mode I am to obſerve in paying the officers; whether they are to be allowed to draw the pay lately eſtabliſhed, and from what time, or how long they are to be paid under the old eſtabliſhment. A pay-roll which was preſented yeſterday, being made up for the new, has given riſe to theſe propoſitions. Upon my objecting to it, I was told that Congreſs or the board of war had eſtabliſhed the precedent, by paying the ſixth regiment of Virginia troops commanded by colonel Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, agreeable to the latter, as they came through Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia.</p>

                     <p>THE apparent deſigns of the enemy being to avoid this ferry, and land their troops above and below us, have induced me to remove from this place the greater part of the troops, and throw them into a different diſpoſition on the river, whereby I hope not only to be more able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede their paſſage, but alſo to avoid the danger of being incloſed in this angle of the river. And notwithſtanding the extended appearances of the enemy on the other ſide, made, at leaſt in part, to divert our attention from any
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:029737_0322_0FE24A9CFADCE8A0"/>
particular point as well as to haraſs us by fatigue, I cannot diveſt myſelf of the opinion that their principal deſign is to ford the river ſomewhere above Trenton; to which deſign I have had particular reſpect in the new arrangement, wherein I am ſo far happy as to have the concurrence of the general officers at this place.</p>
                     <p>Four brigades of the army, under generals lord Stirling, Mercer, Stephen and De Fermoy, extend from Yardley's up to Coryel's ferry, poſted in ſuch a manner as to guard every ſuſpicious part of the river, and to afford aſſiſtance to each other in caſe of attack. General Ewing, with the flying camp of Pennſylvania, and a few Jerſey troops under general Dickinſon, are poſted from Yardley's ferry down to the ferry oppoſite Bordentown. Colonel Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallader, with the Pennſylvania militia, occupies the ground above and below the mouth of Neſhaminy river as far down as Dunk's ferry, at which place colonel Nixon is poſted with the third battalion of [<hi>Pennſylvania. </hi>] A proper quantity of artillery is appointed to each brigade; and I have ordered ſmall redoubts to be thrown up oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite every place where there is a poſſibility of fording. I ſhall remove further up the river to be near the main body of my ſmall army, with which every poſſible oppoſition ſhall be given to any further approach of the enemy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>As general Armſtrong has a good deal of influence in this State, and our preſent force is ſmall and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I think he cannot be better employed than to repair to the counties where his intereſt lies, to animate the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, promote the recruiting ſervice, and encourage the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia to come in. He will alſo be able to form a proper judgment of the places ſuitable for magazines of proviſion to be collected. I have requeſted him to wait upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs on this ſubject: and if general Smallwood ſhould go to Maryland on the ſame buſineſs, I think it would have a happy effect: he is popular and of great influence, and, I am perſuaded, would contribute greatly to that State's furniſhing her quota of men in a little time. He is now in Philadelphia.</p>

                     <p>ABOUT one o'clock to day I received a letter from general Sullivan, a copy of which you have incloſed. I will not comment on the melancholy intelligence which it contains, only adding that I ſincerely regret general Lee's unhappy fate, and feel much for the loſs of my country in his captivity.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect to the enemy, they have been induſtrious in their attempts to procure boats and ſmall craft: but as yet their efforts have not ſucceeded. From the lateſt advices that I have of their movements by ſome priſoners and others, they appear to be leaving Trenton, and to be filing off towards Princeton and Allentown. What their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns are, whether they mean to retreat, or only a feint, cannot be determined.

                     <p>IN a late letter which I had the honour of addreſſing you, I took the liberty to recommend that more battalions ſhould be raiſed for the new army than what had been voted. Having fully conſidered the matter, I am more and more convinced not only of the propriety but of the neceſſity of the meaſure. That the enemy will leave noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing un-eſſayed in the courſe of the next campaign to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe States to the rule of a moſt * * *, muſt be obvious to every one; and that the militia is not to be depended on, or aid expected from them but in caſes of the moſt preſſing emergency, is not to be doubted. The
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:029737_0324_0FE24A9E81968650"/>
firſt of theſe propoſitions is unqueſtionable, and fatal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience has given her ſanction to the truth of the latter: indeed their lethargy of late, and backwardneſs to turn out at this alarming criſis, ſeem to juſtify an apprehenſion that nothing can bring them from their homes. For want of their aſſiſtance, a large part of Jerſey has been expoſed to ravage and to plunder; nor do I know that Pennſylvania would ſhare a better fate, could general Howe effect a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage acroſs the Delaware with a reſpectable force. Theſe conſiderations have induced me to wiſh that no reliance, except ſuch as may ariſe from neceſſity, ſhould ever be had in them again; and to make further mention to Congreſs of the expediency of increaſing their army. I truſt the meaſure will meet their earlieſt attention.</p>
                     <p>Had I leiſure and were it neceſſary, I could ſay much upon this head: but, as I have not, and the matter is well underſtood, I will not add much. By augmenting the number of your battalions, you will augment your force: the officers of each will have their intereſt and influence; and, upon the whole, their numbers will be much greater, though they ſhould not be complete. Added to this, from the preſent confuſed ſtate of Jerſey, and the improper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of officers in many inſtances, I have little or no expectation that ſhe will be able to raiſe all the troops ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted from her, though I think it might be done, were ſuitable ſpirited gentlemen commiſſioned, who would exert themſelves, and encourage the people, many of whom (for a failure in this inſtance, and who are well diſpoſed) are making their ſubmiſſions. In a word, the next will be a trying campaign: and as all that is dear and valuable may depend upon the iſſue of it, I would adviſe that nothing ſhould be omitted, that ſhall ſeem neceſſary to our ſucceſs. Let us have a reſpectable army, and ſuch as will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to every exigency.</p>
                     <p>I will alſo add that the critical ſituation of our affairs, and the diſſolution of our preſent force, (now at hand) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that every nerve and exertion be employed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting the new battalions. One part of general Howe's movements at this time, I believe, is with a deſign to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract us and prevent this buſineſs. If the inclemency of the weather ſhould force him into winter-quarters, he will not remain there longer than neceſſity ſhall oblige him: he
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:029737_0325_0FE24A60001D76F8"/>
will commence his operations in a ſhort ſpace of time; and in that time our levies muſt be made up, to oppoſe him, or I fear the moſt melancholy of all events muſt take place.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed extract of a letter from the commiſſary-general will ſhew his demands for money, and his plans for procuring ſalted proviſions and a quantity of flour from the ſouthward. The whole is ſubmitted to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Congreſs; and I wiſh the reſult of their opinion to be tranſmitted him, with ſuch ſupplies of money as may be neceſſary for himſelf and the departments he mentions.</p>
                     <p>The clothing of the troops is a matter of infinite import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and, if it could be accompliſhed, would have a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effect. Their diſtreſſes are extremely great, many of them being entirely naked, and moſt ſo thinly clad as to be unfit for ſervice. I muſt entreat Congreſs to write to the agents and contractors upon this ſubject, that every poſſible ſupply may be procured and forwarded with the utmoſt expedition. I cannot attend to the buſineſs myſelf, having more than I can poſſibly do beſides.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE waited with much impatience to know the determinations of Congreſs on the propoſitions made ſome time in October laſt for augmenting our corps of artillery and eſtabliſhing a corps of engineers. The time is now come when the firſt cannot be delayed without the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt injury to the ſafety of theſe States; and therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reſolution of Congreſs bearing date the twelfth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, at the repeated inſtances of colonel Knox, and by the preſſing advice of all the general officers now here, I have ventured to order three battalions of artillery to be immediately recruited. Theſe are two leſs than colonel Knox recommends, as you will ſee by his plan incloſed: but then this ſcheme comprehends all the United States, whereas ſome of the States have corps already eſtabliſhed, and theſe three battalions are indiſpenſably neceſſary for the operations in this quarter, including the northern de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment.</p>

                        <pb n="327" facs="unknown:029737_0326_0FE24AA65B36B878"/>
The pay of our artilleriſts bearing no proportion with that in the Engliſh or French ſervice,—the murmuring and diſſatisfaction thereby occaſioned, and the abſolute impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility (as I am told) of getting them upon the old terms,—and the unavoidable neceſſity of obtaining them at all events,—have induced me (alſo by advice) to promiſe officers and men that their pay ſhould be augmented twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five per cent, or that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> engagements ſhall become null and void. This may appear to Congreſs premature and unwarrantable. But, Sir, if they view our ſituation in the light it ſtrikes their officers, they will be convinced of the utility of the meaſure, and that the execution could not be delayed till after their meeting at Baltimore. In ſhort, the preſent exigency of our affairs will not admit of delay either in council or the field: for well convinced I am, that, if the enemy go into quarters at all, it will be for a ſhort ſeaſon. But I rather think the deſign of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Howe is to poſſeſs himſelf of Philadelphia this winter, if poſſible; and in truth I do not ſee what is to prevent him, as ten days more will put an end to the exiſtence of our army. That one great point is to keep us as much haraſſed as poſſible, with a view to injure the recruiting ſervice and hinder a collection of ſtores and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for the next campaign, I am as clear in, as I am of my exiſtence. If therefore,—[<hi>when</hi>] we have to provide in this ſhort interval, and make theſe great and arduous preparations,—every matter that in its nature is ſelf-evident is to be referred to Congreſs at the diſtance of a hundred and thirty or forty miles, ſo much time muſt neceſſarily elapſe, as to defeat the end in view.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſaid that this is an application for powers that are too dangerous to be entruſted. I can only add that deſperate diſeaſes require deſperate remedies; and with truth declare that I have no luſt after power, but wiſh with as much fervency as any man upon this wide-extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed continent for an opportunity of turning the ſword into a ploughſhare. But my feelings, as an officer and a man, have been ſuch as to force me to ſay that no perſon ever had a greater choice of difficulties to contend with than I have. It is needleſs to add that ſhort enliſtments, and a miſtaken dependence upon militia, have been the origin of all our misfortunes and the great accumulation of our debt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="328" facs="unknown:029737_0327_0FE24A61B13AD438"/>
We find, Sir, that the enemy are daily gathering ſtrength from the diſaffected. This ſtrength, like a ſnow-ball, by rolling, will increaſe, unleſs ſome means can be deviſed to check effectually the progreſs of the enemy's arms. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia may poſſibly do it for a little while: but in a little while alſo, the militia of thoſe States which have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called upon will not turn out at all; or, if they do, it will be with ſo much reluctance and ſloth, as to amount to the ſame thing:—inſtance, New Jerſey!—wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pennſylvania!—Could any thing but the river Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware have ſaved Philadelphia?—Can any thing (the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the caſe indeed may juſtify it) be more deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the recruiting ſervice, than giving ten dollars bounty for ſix weeks' ſervice of the militia, who come in, you cannot tell how,—go, you cannot tell when,—and act, you cannot tell where,—conſume your proviſions, exhauſt your ſtores, and leave you at laſt at a critical moment?</p>
                     <p>Theſe, Sir, are the men I am to depend upon ten days hence: this is the baſis on which your cauſe will and muſt forever depend, till you get a large ſtanding army ſufficient of itſelf to oppoſe the enemy. I therefore beg leave to give it as my humble opinion, that eighty-eight battalions are by no means equal to the oppoſition you are to make, and that a moment's time is not to be loſt in raiſing a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number,—not leſs, in my opinion and the opinion of my officers, than a hundred and ten. It may be urged that it will be found difficult enough to complete the firſt number. This may be true, and yet the officers of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten battalions will recruit many more men, than thoſe of eighty-eight. In my judgment this is not a time to ſtand upon expenſe: our funds are the only object of conſideration. The State of New-York have added one battalion (I wiſh they had made it two) to their quota. If any good officers offer to raiſe men upon continental pay and eſtabliſhment in this quarter, I ſhall encourage them to do ſo, and regiment them when they have done it. If Congreſs diſapprove of this proceeding, they will pleaſe to ſignify it, as I mean it for the beſt.</p>
                     <p>It may be thought that I am going a good deal out of the line of my duty, to adopt theſe meaſures, or to adviſe thus freely. A character to loſe,—an eſtate to forfeit,—
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:029737_0328_0FE1BFA7F1194660"/>
the ineſtimable bleſſings of liberty at ſtake,—and a life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted,—muſt be my excuſe.</p>
                     <p>I have heard nothing of the light-horſe from Virginia, nor the regiment from the Eaſtern-Shore. I wiſh to know what troops are to act in the different departments, and to have thoſe from the ſouthward (deſigned for this place) ordered on as faſt as they ſhall be raiſed. The route ſhould be pointed out by which they are to march; aſſiſtant-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries and quarter-maſters upon the communication, to ſupply their wants; the firſt or ſecond officer of each bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion to forward them, and the other to come on, receive and form them at their place of deſtination. Unleſs this is immediately ſet about, the campaign, if it ſhould be cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will be opened in the ſpring before we have any men in the field.</p>
                     <p>Every exertion ſhould be uſed to procure tents: a clothier-general ſhould be appointed without loſs of time for ſupplying the army with every article in that way:—he ſhould be a man of buſineſs and abilities. A commiſſary of priſoners muſt be appointed to attend the army:—for want of an officer of this kind, the exchange of priſoners has been conducted in a moſt ſhameful and injurious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. We have had them from all quarters puſhed into our camps at the moſt critical junctures, and without the leaſt previous notice. We have had them travelling through the different States in all directions by certificates from committees, without any kind of control; and have had inſtances of ſome going into the enemy's camp without my privity or knowledge, after paſſing in the manner before mentioned. There may be other officers neceſſary which I do not recollect at this time, and which, when thought of, muſt be provided: for this, Sir, you may rely on, that the commanding officer, under the preſent eſtabliſhment, is obliged to attend to the buſineſs of ſo many different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, as to render it impoſſible to conduct that of his own with the attention neceſſary;—than which, nothing can be more injurious.</p>
                     <p>In a former letter, I intimated my opinion of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of having a brigadier for every three regiments, and a major-general to every three brigades, at moſt. I think no time is to be loſt in making the appointments, that the arrangements may be conſequent. This will not only aid
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:029737_0329_0FE24A633506D828"/>
the recruiting ſervice, but will be the readieſt means of forming and diſciplining the army afterwards, which, in the ſhort time we have to do it, is of amazing conſequence. I have laboured, ever ſince I have been in the ſervice, to diſcourage all kinds of local attachments and diſtinctions of country, denominating the whole by the greater name of <hi>'American:'</hi> but I found it impoſſible to overcome preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices; and, under the new eſtabliſhment, I conceive it beſt to ſtir up an emulation; in order to do which, would it not be better for each State to furniſh (though not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point) their own brigadiers?—This, if known to be part of the eſtabliſhment, might prevent a good deal of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and jealouſy; and would, I believe, be the means of promotions going forward with more ſatisfaction, and quiet the higher officers.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt I am ſpeaking of promotions, I cannot help giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as my opinion, that, if Congreſs think proper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what I have done with reſpect to the corps of artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, colonel Knox (at preſent at the head of that depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but who, without promotion, will reſign) ought to be appointed to the command of it, with the rank and pay of brigadier. I have alſo to mention, that, for want of ſome eſtabliſhment in the department of engineers agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the plan laid before Congreſs in October laſt, colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Putnam, who was at the head of it, has quitted, and taken a regiment in the State of Maſſachuſetts. I know of no other man tolerably well qualified for the conducting of that buſineſs. None of the French gentlemen whom I have ſeen with appointments in that way appear to me to know any thing of the matter. There is one in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, who, I am told, is clever: but him I have never ſeen.</p>
                     <p>I muſt alſo once more beg leave to mention to Congreſs the expediency of letting promotions be in a regimental line. The want of this has already driven ſome of the beſt officers that were in your army, out of the ſervice. From repeated and ſtrict inquiry I am convinced you can adopt no mode of promotion that will be better received, or that will give more general ſatisfaction. I wiſh therefore to have it announced.</p>
                     <p>The caſting of cannon is a matter that ought not to be one moment delayed: and therefore I ſhall ſend colonel Knox to put this in a train, as alſo to have travelling car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:029737_0330_0FE24AAAAFA2D6E8"/>
and ſhot provided,—elaboratories to be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, one in Hartford<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. As our great loſs laſt year proceeded from a want of teams. I ſhall direct the quarter maſter-gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral to furniſh a certain number to each regiment to anſwer the common purpoſes thereof, that the army may be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to remove from place to place differently from what we have done, or could do, this campaign. Ammunition carts, and proper carts for intrenching tools, ſhould alſo be provided, and I ſhall direct about them accordingly. Above all, a ſtore of ſmall arms ſhould be provided, or men will be of little uſe. The conſumption and waſte of theſe, this year, has been great:—militia, flying-camp men, &amp;c. coming in without, were obliged to be furniſhed, or become uſeleſs. Many of theſe threw their arms away: ſome loſt them, whilſt others deſerted, and took them away. In a word, although I uſed every precaution to preſerve them, the loſs has been great; and this will forever be the caſe in ſuch a mixed and irregular army as ours has been.</p>
                     <p>If no part of the troops already embarked at New-York has appeared in Virginia, their deſtination doubtleſs muſt be to ſome other quarter; and that State muſt, I ſhould think, be freed from any invaſion, if general Howe can be effectually oppoſed in this. I therefore incloſe a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum given me by brigadier Stephen of Virginia, which Congreſs will pleaſe to adopt in the whole,—in part,—or reject,—as may be conſiſtent with their plans and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
                     <p>The diviſion of the army, late under the command of general Lee, now general Sullivan, is juſt upon the point of joining us. A ſtrange kind of fatality has attended it. They had orders on the ſeventeenth of November to join, now more than a month. General Gates, with four eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern regiments, is alſo near at hand: three others from thoſe States were coming on, by his order, by the way of Peekſkill, and had joined general Heath whom I had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered on with Parſons's brigade, to join me, leaving Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's brigade and ſome militia (that were at Forts Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery and Conſtitution) to guard thoſe important paſſes of the Highlands. But the convention of the State of
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:029737_0331_0FE24A64B9640C10"/>
New-York ſeeming to be much alarmed at Heath's coming away,—a fleet appearing off New-London,—and ſome part of the enemy's troops retiring towards Brunſwic,—induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to countermand the order for the march of Parſons's brigade, and to direct the three regiments from Ticonderoga to halt at Morriſtown in Jerſey (where I underſtand about eight hundred militia had collected,) in order to inſpirit the inhabitants, and, as far as poſſible, cover that part of the country. I ſhall ſend general Maxwell this day to take the command of them, and, if to be done, to haraſs and annoy the enemy in their quarters, and cut off their convoys.</p>
                     <p>The care and vigilance, which were uſed in ſecuring the boats on this river, have hitherto baffled every attempt of the enemy to croſs: but, from concurring reports and appearances, they are waiting for ice to afford them a paſſage.</p>
                     <p>Since writing the foregoing I have received a letter from governor Cooke of Rhode-Iſland, of which the incloſed is a copy. Previous to this, and immediately upon the firſt intelligence obtained of a fleet's going through the Sound, I diſpatched orders to generals Spencer and Arnold to proceed without the leaſt delay to the eaſtward. The firſt, I preſume, is gone: the latter, not getting my letter till he came to a place called Eaſton, was, by advice of general Gates who alſo met my letter at the ſame place, induced to come on hither before he proceeded to the eaſtward. Moſt of our brigadiers are laid up: not one has come on with the diviſion under general Sullivan, but they are left ſick at different places on the road.</p>
                     <p>By accounts from the eaſtward, a large body of men had aſſembled in Rhode-Iſland from the States of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts and Connecticut. I preſume (but I have no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of it) that the militia, ordered from the firſt to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous at Danbury (ſix thouſand in number) under the command of major general Lincoln, for ſupplying the place of the diſbanded men of that State in the continental army, will now be ordered to Rhode-Iſland.</p>
                     <p>In ſpeaking of general Lincoln, I ſhould not do him juſtice, were I not to add that he is a gentleman well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of notice in the military line. He commanded the militia from Maſſachuſetts laſt ſummer, or fall rather, and much to my ſatisfaction,—having proved himſelf on all
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:029737_0332_0FE24AAC31AB39A8"/>
occaſions an active, ſpirited, ſenſible man. I do not know whether it is his wiſh to remain in the military line, or whether, if he ſhould, any thing under the rank he now holds in the State he comes from would ſatisfy him. How far an appointment of this kind might offend the continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal brigadiers, I cannot undertake to ſay: many there are, over whom he ought not to be placed; but I know of no way to diſcriminate. Brigadier Reed of New-Hampſhire does not, I preſume, mean to continue in ſervice: he ought not,—as I am told, by the ſeverity of the ſmall-pox, he is become both blind and deaf.</p>

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>THAT I ſhould dwell upon the ſubject of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, cannot be more diſagreeable to Congreſs than it is painful to myſelf. The alarming ſituation to which our affairs are reduced impels me to the meaſure. Inquiry and inveſtigation,—which in moſt caſes ſerve to develop and point out a remedy, in ours, preſent more and greater difficulties. Till of late, I was led to hope from report that no inconſiderable part of the troops compoſing the regiments that were with general Lee, and thoſe from Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga under general Gates, had enliſted again. This intelligence, I confeſs, gave me reaſon to expect that I ſhould have, at the expiration of the preſent year, a force ſomewhat more reſpectable than what I find will be the caſe.</p>
                     <p>Having examined into the ſtate of thoſe regiments, I am authoriſed to ſay from the information of their officers, that but very few of the men have enliſted. Thoſe who have are of the troops from Ticonderoga, and were permitted to viſit their friends and homes, as part of the terms on which they would re-engage. In reſpect to thoſe who marched
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:029737_0333_0FE24A6CC7DC2178"/>
with general Lee, I cannot learn that any have. Their refuſal, I am told, has not proceeded more from an averſion to the ſervice, or any fixed determination not to engage again, than from their wiſhes to return home,—the non-appointment of officers in ſome inſtances,—the turning out of good, and appointing of bad,—and in others, the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete or rather no arrangement of them,—a work unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed to the management of their States: nor have I the moſt diſtant proſpect of retaining them a moment longer than the laſt of this inſtant, notwithſtanding the moſt preſſing ſolicitations and the obvious neceſſity for it.</p>
                     <p>By the departure of theſe regiments I ſhall be left with five from Virginia, Smallwood's from Maryland, a ſmall part of Rawlins's, Hand's from Pennſylvania, a part of Ward's from Connecticut, and the German battalion, amounting in the whole at this time from fourteen to fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred effective men. This handful, and ſuch mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia as may chooſe to join me, will then compoſe our army.</p>
                     <p>When I reflect upon theſe things they fill me with much concern, knowing that general Howe has a number of troops cantoned in the towns bordering on and near the Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aware,—his intentions being to paſs, as ſoon as the ice is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently formed, to invade Pennſylvania and to poſſeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of Philadelphia if poſſible. To guard againſt his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and the execution of them, ſhall employ my every exertion: but how is this to be done? As yet but few militia have gone to Philadelphia, and they are to be our ſupport at this alarming criſis. Had I entertained a doubt of general Howe's intentions to paſs the Delaware on the diſſolution of our army, and as ſoon as the ice is made, it would now be done away. An intercepted letter from a gentleman of Philadelphia (who has joined the enemy) to his friend and partner in the city declares that to be their deſign,—that the army would be there in ten or twenty days from the ſixteenth inſtant, the time of his writing, if the ice ſhould be made;—adviſes him by no means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their ſtores,—that they would be ſafe.</p>
                     <p>The obſtacles which have ariſen to the raiſing of the new army, from the mode of appointing the officers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to hope, if Congreſs reſolve on an additional num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of battalions to thoſe already voted, that they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe ſome other rule by which the officers, eſpecially the
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:029737_0334_0FE24AB4DE892F38"/>
field-officers, ſhould be appointed. In caſe an augmentation ſhould be made to the eaſtern regiments, a deviation from the former m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>de will operate more ſtrongly as to them than to other battalions, becauſe there have been many more officers in ſervice from thoſe States, than the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments voted to be raiſed would admit of; by which means ſeveral deſerving men could not have been provided for, had the utmoſt pains been uſed for the purpoſe; and many others of merit have been neglected in the late appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and thoſe of little worth and leſs experience put in their places or promoted over their heads. This has been the caſe with many of the beſt officers.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed letter from the paymaſter-general will ſhew the ſtate of the military cheſt, and the neceſſity of a large and immediate ſupply of caſh. The advances to the officers, for bounty and the recruiting ſervice, are great: beſides, the regiments, at the expiration of this month, will require pay of their claims. * * *</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I HAVE your obliging favours of the twenty-firſt and twenty-third. The blankets are come to hand; but I would not have any of the other goods ſent on till you hear again from me.</p>
                     <p>I agree with you that it is in vain to ruminate upon, or even reflect upon the authors or cauſes of, our preſent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes: we ſhould rather exert ourſelves, and look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with hopes that ſome lucky chance may yet turn up in our favour. Bad as our proſpects are, I ſhould not have the leaſt doubt of ſucceſs in the end, did not the late treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery and defection of thoſe, who ſtood foremoſt in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:029737_0335_0FE24A6F5FFDF4E8"/>
while fortune ſmiled upon us, make me fearful that many more will follow their example, who, by uſing their influence with ſome and working upon the fears of others, may extend the circle ſo as to take in whole towns, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nay, provinces. Of this we have a recent inſtance in Jerſey; and I wiſh many parts of Pennſylvania may not be ready to receive the yoke.</p>
                     <p>The ſecurity of the continental ſhips of war in Delaware is certainly a capital object; and yet to draught the many hands, neceſſary to fit them out, from the militia, might be dangerous juſt now: perhaps in a little time hence their places may be ſupplied with country militia; and then, if the exigency of affairs requires it, they certainly ought to be ſpared. I will juſt hint to you a propoſition that was made, or rather talked of, a few days ago by the officers of two New-England regiments whoſe time of ſervice will expire on the firſt of January. They are moſt of them water men: and they ſaid their men would willingly go on board the frigates, and navigate them round to any of the ports in New-England, if it was thought they would be ſafer there than in Delaware. You may think of this, and let me hear from you on the ſubject, if the propoſition pleaſes you.</p>
                     <p>Lieutenant Boger of the navy is already gone in, and I have made a demand of lieutenant Joſiah in exchange; but I have not heard whether lord Howe accedes to it. I will procure the releaſe of doctor Hodge as ſoon as it can be done without injuring others by giving him the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as I have always made it a rule to demand thoſe firſt who have been longeſt in captivity. I will take the ſame ſteps in regard to Mr. Jones, commander of the ſloop taken by the Andrew Doria.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall take the earlieſt opportunity of ſending in your letter to general Lee, with the bill drawn upon major Small.</p>
                     <p>From an intercepted letter from a perſon in the ſecrets of the enemy, I find their intentions are to croſs Delaware as ſoon as the ice is ſufficiently ſtrong. I mention this, that you may take the neceſſary ſteps for the ſecurity of ſuch public and private property as ought not to fall into their hands ſhould they make themſelves maſters of Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adelphia, of which they do not ſeem to entertain the leaſt doubt.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE the pleaſure of congratulating you upon the ſucceſs of an enterpriſe which I had formed againſt a detachment of the enemy lying in Trenton, and which was executed yeſterday morning.</p>
                     <p>The evening of the twenty-fifth I ordered the troops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for this ſervice to parade back of M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Konkey's fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that they might begin to paſs as ſoon as it grew dark, imagining we ſhould be able to throw them all over, with the neceſſary artillery, by twelve o'clock, and that we might eaſily arrive at Trenton by five in the morning, the diſtance being about nine miles. But the quantity of ice, made that night, impeded the paſſage of the boats ſo much, that it was three o'clock before the artillery could all be got over; and near four, before the troops took up their line of march.</p>
                     <p>This made me deſpair of ſurpriſing the town, as I well knew we could not reach it before the day was fairly broke. But as I was certain there was no making a retreat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being diſcovered, and haraſſed on re-paſſing the river, I determined to puſh on at all events. I formed my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment into two diviſions, one to march by the lower or river road, the other by the upper or Pennington road. As the diviſions had nearly the ſame diſtance to march, I ordered each of them, immediately upon forcing the out-guards, to puſh directly into the town, that they might charge the enemy before they had time to form.</p>
                     <p>The upper diviſion arrived at the enemy's advanced poſt exactly at eight o'clock; and in three minutes after, I found, from the fire on the lower road, that that diviſion had alſo got up. The out-guards made but ſmall oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though, for their numbers, they behaved very well, keeping up a conſtant retreating fire from behind houſes.
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:029737_0337_0FE24A70E2DDCFD0"/>
We preſently ſaw their main body formed: but, from their motions, they ſeemed undetermined how to act.</p>
                     <p>Being hard preſſed by our troops, who had already got poſſeſſion of their artillery, they attempted to file off by a road on their right, leading to Princeton. But, perceiving their intention, I threw a body of troops in their way; which immediately checked them. Finding from our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that they were ſurrounded, and that they muſt inevitably be cut to pieces if they made any further reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they agreed to lay down their arms. The number that ſubmitted in this manner was twenty-three officers and eight hundred and eighty-ſix men. Colonel Rahl the commanding officer, and ſeven others, were found wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the town. I do not exactly know how many they had killed; but I fancy not above twenty or thirty, as they never made any regular ſtand. Our loſs is very trifling indeed,—only two officers and one or two privates wounded.</p>
                     <p>I find that the detachment of the enemy conſiſted of the three Heſſian regiments of Lanſpach, Kniphauſen, and Rahl, amounting to about fifteen hundred men, and a troop of Britiſh light horſe: but, immediately upon the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the attack, all thoſe who were not killed or taken puſhed directly down the road towards Bordentown. Theſe would likewiſe have fallen into our hands, could my plan have been completely carried into execution. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Ewing was to have croſſed before day at Trenton fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and taken poſſeſſion of the bridge leading out of town: but the quantity of ice was ſo great, that, though he did every thing in his power to effect it, he could not get over. This difficulty alſo hindered general Cadwallader from croſſing with the Pennſylvania militia from Briſtol. He got part of his foot over: but finding it impoſſible to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark his artillery, he was obliged to deſiſt.</p>
                     <p>I am fully confident, that, could the troops under gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erals Ewing and Cadwallader have paſſed the river, I ſhould have been able with their aſſiſtance to have driven the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from all their poſts below Trenton. But the numbers I had with me being inferior to theirs below me, and a ſtrong battalion of light infantry being at Princeton above me, I thought it moſt prudent to return the ſame evening
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:029737_0338_0FE24AB905347948"/>
with the priſoners and the artillery we had taken. We found no ſtores of any conſequence in the town.</p>
                     <p>In juſtice to the officers and men, I muſt add that their behaviour upon this occaſion reflects the higheſt honour upon them. The difficulty of paſſing the river in a very ſevere night, and their march through a violent ſtorm of ſnow and hail, did not in the leaſt abate their ardour: but, when they came to the charge, each ſeemed to vie with the other in preſſing forward: and were I to give a prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to any particular corps, I ſhould do great injuſtice to the others.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Baylor, my firſt aide-de-camp, will have the honour of delivering this to you; and from him you may be made acquainted with many other particulars. His ſpirited behaviour upon every occaſion requires me to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommend him to your particular notice.</p>

                     <p>I AM juſt ſetting out to attempt a ſecond paſſage over the Delaware with the troops that were with me on the morning of the twenty-ſixth. I am determined to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it if poſſible; but know that it will be attended with much fatigue and difficulty on account of the ice, which will neither allow us to croſs on foot, nor give us an eaſy paſſage with boats. General Cadwallader croſſed from Briſtol on the twenty-ſeventh, and, by his letter of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, was at Bordentown with about eighteen hundred men. In addition to theſe, general Mifflin ſent over five hundred from Philadelphia on Friday, three hundred yeſterday evening from Burlington, and will follow to-day with ſeven or eight hundred more. I have taken every precaution in my power for ſubſiſting the troops, and ſhall, without loſs of time, and as ſoon as circumſtances will admit of it, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the enemy in their retreat,—try to beat up more of their quarters,—and, in a word, in every inſtance, adopt ſuch meaſures as the exigency of our affairs requires, and our ſituation will juſtify.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="340" facs="unknown:029737_0339_0FE24ABA887F23F0"/>
Had it not been for the unhappy failure of generals Ew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Cadwallader in their attempts to paſs on the night of the twenty-fifth,—and if the ſeveral concerted attacks could have been made,—I have no doubt but that our views would have ſucceeded to our warmeſt expectations. What was done occaſioned the enemy to leave their ſeveral poſts on the Delaware with great precipitation. The peculiar diſtreſſes to which the troops who were with me were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the ſeverities of cold, rain, ſnow, and ſtorm,—the charge of the priſoners they had taken,—and another reaſon that might be mentioned,—and the little proſpect of receiving ſuccours on account of the ſeaſon and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the river,—would not authorize a further purſuit at that time.</p>
                     <p>Since tranſmitting the liſt of priſoners, a few more have been diſcovered and taken in Trenton,—among them a lieutenant-colonel, and a deputy-adjutant-general,—the whole amounting to about a thouſand.</p>
                     <p>I have been honoured with your letter of the twenty-third and its ſeveral incloſures, to which I ſhall pay due attention. A flag goes in this morning with a letter to general Howe, and another to general Lee. For the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Robert Morris, eſquire, has tranſmitted a bill of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, drawn by two Britiſh officers, for a hundred and ſixteen pounds nine ſhillings and three pence, on major Small, for money furniſhed them in South-Carolina, which I truſt will be paid. This ſupply is excluſive of the ſum you have reſolved to be ſent him, and which Mr. Morris will procure in time.</p>

                     <p>YOUR reſolves of the twenty-ſeventh ultimo were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me laſt night by meſſieurs Clymer, Morris, and Walton. The confidence which Congreſs have honoured me with by theſe proceedings has a claim to my warmeſt acknowledgments. At the ſame time I beg leave to aſſure them, that all my faculties ſhall be employed to direct prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly the powers they have been pleaſed to veſt me with, and to advance thoſe objects, and only thoſe, which gave riſe to this honourable mark of diſtinction. If my exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould not be attended with the deſired ſucceſs, I truſt the failure will be imputed to the true cauſe,—the peculiarly diſtreſſed ſituation of our affairs, and the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I have to combat,—rather than to a want of zeal for my country, and the cloſeſt attention to her intereſts, to promote which has ever been my ſtudy.</p>
                     <p>On Monday morning I paſſed the Delaware myſelf; the whole of our troops and artillery not till yeſterday, owing to the ice which rendered their paſſage extremely difficult and fatiguing. Since their arrival, we have been parading the regiments whoſe time of ſervice is now expired, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to know what force we ſhould have to depend on, and how to regulate our views accordingly. After much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion and the exertions of their officers, half or a greater proportion of thoſe from the eaſtward have conſented to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:029737_0342_0FE24AC59C3CDDD8"/>
ſtay ſix weeks on a bounty of ten dollars. I feel the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of this advance, and I know the conſequences which will reſult from it:—but what could be done?—Pennſylvania had allowed the ſame to her militia:—the troops felt their importance, and would have their price. Indeed, as their aid is ſo eſſential, and not to be diſpenſed with, it is to be wondered they had not eſtimated it at a higher rate. I perceive that Congreſs, apprehenſive of this event, had made unlimited proviſion for it.</p>
                     <p>General Mifflin is at Bordentown with about eighteen hundred men, and general Cadwallader at Croſwix's, with about the ſame number. We are now making our arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and concerting a plan of operations, which I ſhall attempt to execute as ſoon as poſſible, and which I hope will be attended with ſome ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>As to the number and ſituation of the enemy, I cannot obtain certain intelligence: but, from the accounts moſt to be relied on, they have collected the principal part of their force, from Brunſwic and the neighbouring poſts, at Princeton, where they are throwing up ſome works. The number there is reported to be from five to ſix thouſand; and it is confidently ſaid they have ſent the chief part of their baggage to Brunſwic. It is added that general Howe landed at Amboy a day or two ago with a thouſand light troops, and is on his march from thence.</p>
                     <p>I have ſent into different parts of Jerſey, men of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſpirit up the militia, and flatter myſelf that the many injuries they have received will induce ſome to give their aid. If what they have ſuffered does not rouſe their reſentment, they muſt not poſſeſs the common feelings of humanity. To oppreſſion, ravage, and a deprivation of property, they have had the more mortifying circumſtance of inſult added:—after being ſtripped of all they had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt compenſation, protections have been granted them for the free enjoyment of their effects.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE the honour to inform you, that, ſince the date of my laſt from Trenton, I have removed with the army under my command to this place. The difficulty of croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Delaware on account of the ice made our paſſage over it tedious, and gave the enemy an opportunity of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ſeveral cantonments, and aſſembling their whole force at Princeton. Their large picquets, advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Trenton,—their great preparations, and ſome intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence I had received,—added to their knowledge that the firſt of January brought on a diſſolution of the beſt part of our army,—gave me the ſtrongeſt reaſons to conclude that an attack upon us was meditating.</p>
                     <p>Our ſituation was moſt critical, and our force ſmall. To remove immediately was again deſtroying every dawn of hope which had begun to revive in the breaſts of the Jerſey militia; and to bring thoſe troops which had firſt croſſed the Delaware and were lying at Croſwix's under general Cadwallader, and thoſe under general Mifflin at Bordentown, (amounting in the whole to about three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred) to Trenton, was to bring them to an expoſed place. One or the other however was unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: the latter was preferred, and they were ordered to join us at Trenton, which they did, by a night-march on the firſt inſtant.</p>
                     <p>On the ſecond, according to my expectation, the enemy began to advance upon us; and, after ſome ſkirmiſhing, the head of their column reached Trenton about four o'clock, whilſt their rear was as far back as Maidenhead. They attempted to paſs Sanpink creek which runs through Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, at different places; but, finding the fords guarded, halted, and kindled their fires. We were drawn up on the other ſide of the creek. In this ſituation we remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till dark, cannonading the enemy, and receiving the fire of their field pieces, which did us but little damage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="unknown:029737_0344_0FE24AC71E25A6C0"/>
Having by this time diſcovered that the enemy were greatly ſuperior in number, and that their deſign was to ſurround us, I ordered all our baggage to be removed ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Burlington ſoon after dark; and at twelve o'clock, after renewing our fires, and leaving guards at the bridge in Trenton, and other paſſes on the ſame ſtream above, marched by a round-about road to Princeton, where I knew they could not have much force left, and might have ſtores. One thing I was certain of, that it would avoid the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a retreat, (which was of courſe,—or to run the hazard of the whole army being cut off) whilſt we might by a fortunate ſtroke withdraw general Howe from Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and give ſome reputation to our arms. Happily we ſucceeded. We found Princeton about ſun-riſe with only three regiments, and three troops of light-horſe in it, two of which were on their march to Trenton. Theſe three regiments, eſpecially the two firſt, made a gallant reſiſtance, and, in killed, wounded, and priſoners, muſt have loſt five hundred men: upwards of one hundred of them were left dead in the field; and, with what I have with me and what were taken in the purſuit and carried acroſs the Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aware, there are near three hundred priſoners, fourteen of whom are officers, all Britiſh.</p>
                     <p>This piece of good fortune is counterbalanced by the loſs of the brave and worthy general Mercer, colonels Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let and Potter, captain Neal of the artillery, captain Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who commanded the firſt Virginia regiment, and four or five other valuable officers, who, with about twenty-five or thirty privates, were ſlain in the field. Our whole loſs cannot be aſcertained, as many who were in purſuit of the enemy (who were chaſed three or four miles) are not yet come in.</p>
                     <p>The rear of the enemy's army lying at Maidenhead (not more than five or ſix miles from Princeton) was up with us before our purſuit was over: but as I had the precaution to deſtroy the bridge over Stoney-brook, (about half a mile from the field of action) they were ſo long retarded there as to give us time to move off in good order for this place. We took two braſs field-pieces; but, for want of horſes, could not bring them away. We alſo took ſome blankets, ſhoes, and a few other trifling articles, burned the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029737_0345_0FE24B1AC14A71C0"/>
hay, and deſtroyed ſuch other things as the ſhortneſs of the time would admit of.</p>
                     <p>My original plan, when I ſet out from Trenton, was, to have puſhed on to Brunſwic: but the haraſſed ſtate of our troops, (many of them having had no reſt for two nights and a day) and the danger of loſing the advantage we had gained by aiming at too much, induced me, by the advice of my officers, to relinquiſh the attempt: but, in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſix or eight hundred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>eſh troops upon a forced march would have deſtroyed all their ſtores and magazines,—taken (as we have ſince learned) their military cheſt, containing ſeventy thouſand pounds,—and put an end to the war. The enemy, from the beſt intelligence I have been able to get, were ſo much alarmed at the apprehenſion of this, that they marched immediately to Brunſwic without halting, except at the bridges, (for I alſo took up thoſe on Millſtone, on the dffierent routes to Brunſwic) and got there before day.</p>
                     <p>From the beſt information I have received, general Howe has left no men either at Trenton or Princeton. The truth of this I am endeavouring to aſcertain, that I may regulate my movements accordingly.</p>
                     <p>The militia are taking ſpirits, and, I am told, are coming in faſt from this State: but I fear thoſe from Philadelphia will ſcarcely ſubmit to the hardſhips of a winter campaign much longer, eſpecially as they very unluckily ſent their blankets with their baggage to Burlington. I muſt do them the juſtice however to add, that they have undergone more fatigue and hardſhip, than I expected militia (eſpecially cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens) would have done at this inclement ſeaſon. I am juſt moving to Morriſtown, where I ſhall endeavour to put them under the beſt cover I can:—hitherto we have been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any; and many of our poor ſoldiers quite barefoot, and ill clad in other reſpects.</p>

                     <p>I AM happy to inform you that the account of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Mercer's death, tranſmitted in my laſt, was premature, though it was mentioned as certain by many who ſaw him
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029737_0346_0FE24AC9B4582580"/>
after he was wounded. By intelligence from Princeton yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday evening, he was alive, and ſeemed as if he would do well:—unhappily he is a priſoner. Had it not been for the information I had of his death, I would have tried to have brought him away, though I believe it could not have been effected.</p>
                     <p>The enemy have totally evacuated Trent and Prince towns, and are now at Brunſwic and the ſeveral poſts on the communication between that and Hudſon's river, but chiefly at Brunſwic. Their numbers and movements are variouſly reported: but all agree that their force is great. There have been two or three little ſkirmiſhes between their parties and ſome detachments of militia, in which the latter have been ſucceſsful, and made a few priſoners. The moſt conſiderable was on Sunday morning near Springfield, when eight or ten Waldeckers were killed and wounded, and the remainder of the party (thirty-nine or forty) made priſoners, with two officers, by a force not ſuperior in number, and without receiving the leaſt damage.</p>
                     <p>The ſeverity of the ſeaſon has made our troops, eſpecially the militia, extremely impatient, and has reduced the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber very conſiderably. Every day more or leſs leave us. Their complaints, and the great fatigues they had undergone, induced me to come to this place, as the beſt calculated of any in this quarter to accommodate and refreſh them. The ſituation is by no means favourable to our views; and, as ſoon as the purpoſes are anſwered for which we came, I think to remove, though I confeſs I do not know how we ſhall procure covering for our men elſewhere.</p>

Colonel Ralle died the day after the action; and we left one of the majors ſo ill of his wounds, that I am in doubt of his recovery. I can however make a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> offer of all that remain, in exchange for general Lee, except one whom you order to be propoſed for colonel Allen. If the offer is rejected by general Howe, I ſhall think myſelf then at liberty to remonſtrate to him on his treatment of general Lee. If he will not exchange him, he ſhould at leaſt admit him to his parole, as we have ever done their priſoners who have fallen into our hands.</p>
                     <p>I underſtand from undoubted authority that they intend to try the general by a court-martial, as a deſerter from their ſervice, pretending that his reſignation was never accepted of. But I ſhall inform general Howe, that, if any ſuch ſtep is taken under ſo ſhallow and illegal a pretext, and their ſentence ſhould extend either to affect his life or liberty, they may depend upon the moſt ſevere and adequate retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation upon our part.</p>
                     <p>The enemy have made no move ſince my laſt. By every account, they begin to be diſtreſſed, particularly for forage, of which there is little or none remaining in the ſmall circle they poſſeſs, except ſalt hay.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE not had the honour of any of your favours ſince I wrote to you on the fourteenth inſtant.—No material alterations have happened in this quarter. The enemy, from every account, mean to make Brunſwic their advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed poſt for this winter. They are endeavouring to draw in all the forage they can get; in the courſe of which, they have daily ſkirmiſhes with our advanced parties: but I think, do what they will, they muſt be diſtreſſed greatly before the winter is over.</p>
                     <p>By a late reſolve of Congreſs, the towns of Carliſle in Pennſylvania, and Brookfield in Maſſachuſetts, are fixed upon for the proper places to erect elaboratories, and lay
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029737_0349_0FE24B1DCA99D630"/>
up magazines of military ſtores. Upon communicating this reſolve to general Knox, who will have the principal direction of theſe matters, he was of opinion that Hartford in Connecticut would be on many accounts more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for that purpoſe than Brookfield, particularly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to buildings, which are already erected, and, though not ſuch as are immediately fit for the uſes they are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may be eaſily converted to them.—General Knox, and others whom I have conſulted upon the occaſion, alſo think that Yorktown will be full as ſafe, and more convenient than Carliſle.—If theſe two alterations ſhould, upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideration, appear to you in the ſame light, and no ſteps ſhould have been taken towards carrying matters into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, I ſhould be glad that you would, by a new reſolve, permit me to direct the works to be carried on at the places laſt mentioned.</p>

                     <p>THE fluctuating ſtate of an army compoſed chiefly of militia bids fair to reduce us to the ſituation in which we were ſome little time ago,—that is, of ſcarce having any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at all,—except reinforcements ſpeedily arrive. One of the battalions from the city of Philadelphia goes home to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,—and the other two only remain a few days longer upon courteſy. The time for which a country brigade un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der general Mifflin came out is expired, and they ſtay from day to day by dint of ſolicitation,—their numbers much reduced by deſertions. We have about eight hundred of the eaſtern continental troops remaining of twelve or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred who at firſt agreed to ſtay,—part engaged to the laſt of this month, and part to the middle of next. The five Virginia regiments are reduced to a handful of men, as are colonel Hand's, Smallwood's, and the German battalion. A few days ago general Warner arrived with
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029737_0350_0FE24AD45CCAC9E0"/>
about ſeven hundred Maſſachuſetts militia engaged to the fifteenth of March.</p>
                     <p>Thus you have a ſketch of our preſent army, with which we are obliged to keep up appearances before an enemy already double to us in numbers, and who from every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count are withdrawing their troops from Rhode-Iſland, to form a junction of their whole army, and make another at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt either to break up ours, or penetrate towards Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,—a thing by no means difficult now, as the ice af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords an eaſy paſſage over the Delaware.</p>
                     <p>I do not yet know what effect general Heath's moving down towards New-York will have. Yeſterday morning a conſiderable firing was heard, which ſeemed to be about Kingſbridge. I am in hopes that his appearance on that quarter with a pretty large force will oblige them to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw part of theirs from Jerſey, to ſecure the city of New-York, which, by late accounts, is weakly garriſoned. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Heath has all the eaſtern and York militia with him, except the ſmall brigade under general Warner that I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, one regiment of Connecticut, ſtopped at Providence in Rhode-Iſland, and a number (how many I do not know) requeſted by general Schuyler to be ſent to Ticonderoga.—If it ſhould appear that they are regardleſs of the diverſion made by general Heath, and perſiſt in their plan of drawing their whole army together in Jerſey, I muſt order him over with all his troops, except as many as are neceſſary to garriſon the forts and guard the paſſes in the Highlands.</p>
                     <p>I have ordered away every officer that could be ſpared, ſome to recruit, and ſome to collect the ſcattered men of the different regiments, who are diſperſed almoſt over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent: for, of the vaſt numbers ſent to the hoſpitals at different times, few ever returned after they got well.</p>
                     <p>As militia muſt be our dependence till we can get the new army raiſed and properly arranged, I muſt entreat you to continue your endeavours with the States of Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Maryland and Virginia to turn out every man they poſſibly can, and for ſome longer time than they generally have ſtipulated for. If they agree for a month or any lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited time, it ſhould commence from the time they actually join the army, and not from the time they leave their
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029737_0351_0FE24B27CEBFFC58"/>
homes: otherwiſe the marching backwards and forwards conſumes the term of engagement.</p>
                     <p>I think theſe demands of aid ſhould be made as quietly as the nature of the caſe will admit of, eſpecially at this time when we are deceiving our enemies with falſe opinions of our numbers: for, to boaſt of our ſuperiority in that reſpect on one hand, and to call publickly on the people for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the other, is an impropriety too glaring:—indeed it has been already noticed in ſome publications that I have ſeen from New-York.</p>

                     <p>I AM favoured with yours of the fifteenth inſtant, with the ſundry reſolves incloſed in it. If that reſpecting the continental currency is carried ſtrictly into execution, it cannot fail of fully re-eſtabliſhing its credit.</p>
                     <p>I have no objection to the three gentlemen who are recommended for field-officers in the New-Hampſhire regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they ſeem fully entitled to it, as they have raiſed the regiment. I will furniſh them with commiſſions from the date of their appointment, when applied to for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>There is ſomething particular in the application of colonel Dubois and his officers for the ſum of five hundred and thirteen dollars and two thirds. They were to have been commiſſioned provided they could raiſe the men; but, from their own pay-abſtract, it appears that fourteen officers only brought twenty-five men into the field. As they certainly did not comply with their agreement, I would, after ſtating the matter as it really was, ſubmit it to Congreſs who have the diſpoſal of the public money.</p>
                     <p>I have peruſed the petition of monſieur Faneuil and other French gentlemen. If they could raiſe ſuch a regiment as they propoſe, it would certainly be uſeful: but I have no conception that there are Canadians enough to be found even for a regiment of the common number, much leſs of two thouſand three hundred and forty-ſeven, which is the number propoſed. I know, neither colonel Livingſton nor colonel Hazen could ever complete their Canadian regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029737_0352_0FE24AD5E054EAA0"/>
when they had the country open to them. As I would give encouragement to foreigners of real merit, I would put the thing upon this footing:—if monſieur Faneuil can procure a ſufficient number of officers to fill a regiment of the common ſize, and they can give any aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of being able to raiſe the men, I would grant them commiſſions.</p>
                     <p>I would beg leave to remark here, that, except we can throw the many foreigners who have commiſſions in our army into a corps together, they will be entirely uſeleſs, as they can neither converſe with officers nor men in any other kind of regiment.</p>
                     <p>I am ſo well aſſured that you would not recommend doctor Potts to ſucceed doctor Stringer in the northern de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment except you had ſufficient proof of his abilities in the medical line, that I readily concur with you in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
                     <p>I have received a piece of information which I am afraid is true,—and that is, that the Britiſh cruiſers have taken a French veſſel, with a large parcel of cannon and mortars on board. I know ſuch a one was expected, and therefore more readily credit the account.</p>

                     <p>MY laſt to you was on the twentieth inſtant. Since that, I have the pleaſure to inform you that general Dick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon, with about four hundred militia, has defeated a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging party of the enemy of an equal number, and has taken forty waggons, and upwards of a hundred horſes, moſt of them of the Engliſh draft breed, and a number of ſheep and cattle which they had collected. The enemy retreated with ſo much precipitation, that general Dickinſon had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an opportunity of making nine priſoners. They were obſerved to carry off a good many dead and wounded in light waggons.—This action happened near Somerſet court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe on Millſtone river. General Dickinſon's behaviour reflects the higheſt honour upon him: for, though his troops were all raw, he led them through the river middle-deep,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029737_0353_0FE24B2995E88158"/>
and gave the enemy ſo ſevere a charge, that, although ſupported by three field-pieces, they gave way and left their convoy.</p>
                     <p>I have not heard from general Heath ſince the ſiring near Kingſbridge laſt Saturday; which I cannot account for, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the North-river ſhould have been rendered impaſſable by the ice. But the account of his having ſurpriſed and taken Fort-Independence on Friday night laſt comes ſo well au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticated by different ways, that I cannot doubt it. It is ſaid that he took four hundred priſoners in that fort, and that he inveſted Fort-Waſhington on Saturday, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the ſiring. This is brought out by three of our officers who made their eſcape from New-York on Sunday, and is confirmed by a ſpy who went into Amboy, who ſays an expreſs had arrived at Amboy from New-York, with an account of the loſs of Fort-Independence, and calling for a reinforcement to protect the city; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, a number of troops had gone over. I have ſent in ſpies to Brunſwic and Amboy to know the truth of this: and if it appears that they have weakened themſelves to reinforce New-York, I ſhall probably make ſome attempt upon them, if we have men enough left to do it.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall be glad to know what ſtock of ſmall-arms you at preſent have, and what are your expectations ſhortly. The neceſſity that we have been and are now under, of calling in and arming the militia, ſcatters our armory all over the world, in a manner: their officers are ſo irregular that they generally ſuffer their men to carry home every thing that is put into their hands, which is forever loſt to the public. The new-raiſed regiments will call for a great number of arms; and I do not at preſent ſee how they are to be ſupplied.</p>
                     <p>I would again beg leave to recall the attention of Congreſs to the appointment of general officers. I will not ſuppoſe the nomination of them is poſtponed upon a ſaving principle, becauſe the advantage in having proper officers to examine the pay-rolls of their ſeveral regiments, and compare them with the returns of their brigades,—to ſee that the regiments are provided with what is proper, and that no more than a ſufficiency is allowed,—to keep officers to their duty, and not, while the ſpirited officer is encountering all the fatigues

and hardſhips of a rigorous campaign, ſuffer a number of others, under various frivolous pretences and imaginary ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, to enjoy themſelves at the public expenſe at their own fireſides;—I ſay, if the appointments are withheld upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimonious principles, the Congreſs are miſtaken: for I am convinced, that, by the correction of many abuſes which it is impoſſible for me to attend to, the public will be benefited in a great degree in the article of expenſe. But this is not all. We have a very little time to do a very great work in. The arranging, providing for, and diſciplining a hundred and odd battalions is not to be accompliſhed in a day; nor is it to be done at all with any degree of propriety, when we have once entered upon the active part of the campaign. Theſe duties muſt be branched out, or they will be neglected, and the public injured. Beſides, were the brigadiers appointed, they might be facilitating the recruiting ſervice; they would have time to get a little acquainted with their brigades, the wants of them, and eaſe me of the great weight and burden which I at preſent feel.</p>
                     <p>On whom the choice will or ought to light, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſay. In a former letter I took the liberty of ſubmitting to the conſideration of Congreſs the propriety of appointing, out of each State, brigadiers to command the troops of that State,—thinking, as a diſtinction is now fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a ſpirit of emulation might ariſe by this means. At any rate, I ſhall take the liberty of recommending general Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallader as one of the firſt for the new appointments. I have found him a man of ability, a good diſciplinarian, firm in his principles, and of intrepid bravery. I ſhall alſo beg leave to recommend colonel Reed to the command of the horſe, as a perſon, in my opinion, every way qualified: for he is extremely active and enterpriſing; many ſignal proofs of which he has given this campaign. For the reſt, the members of Congreſs can judge better than I can: I can only ſay, that, as the army will probably be divided in the courſe of the next campaign, there ought, in my opinion, to be three lieutenant-generals, nine major-generals, and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeven brigadiers:—in other words, there ought, at leaſt, to be a brigadier to every four regiments, and a major-gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral to every three brigades. The lieutenant-generals will, I preſume, be appointed out of the oldeſt major-generals, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029737_0355_0FE24B2B1A59CDC8"/>
the major-generals from the oldeſt brigadiers. Nine briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers will then be to nominate.</p>
                     <p>I forgot before this to inform Congreſs, that, including the regiment of light dragoons from Virginia, and colonel Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don's to be raiſed in Connecticut, I have only commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed officers for four regiments. I was willing to try how theſe could be equipped before I put more officers into commiſſion. It is apprehended we ſhall find difficulty in providing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries or even horſes for theſe four regiments: if we ſhould not, I ſhall immediately ſet about the reſidue. Colonel Baylor, colonel Moylan, (who, as volunteer, has remained conſtantly with the army ſince his diſcontinuance in the quarter-maſter's department) and colonel Sheldon, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the three new regiments of light dragoons.</p>
                     <p>The treaſury has been for ſome time empty, and the army has laboured under the greateſt inconvenience for want of money. The recruiting ſervice is particularly injured by this, as many officers are now waiting only for bounty-money. I have alſo complaints from the eaſtward, of the want of money to carry on their recruiting ſervice. If we are not ſupplied with that neceſſary article, all matters muſt be at a ſtand. I muſt therefore beg, that, if Mr. Palfrey has not been already ſupplied with a large ſum, it may be done with the utmoſt expedition, and that you will endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to keep up the ſupply by conſtantly ſending on ſmaller parcels.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I WAS laſt night honoured with yours of the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth inſtant, incloſing a letter from the State of New-York to Congreſs. From the particular ſituation of their State in regard to their being totally deprived of commerce, they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly muſt ſtand in need of the aſſiſtance of the other States to provide them with clothing and every thing neceſſary for the equipment of their forces; and it ever was my intention
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029737_0356_0FE24AE0AA87F080"/>
to allow them a full proportion of the clothing purchaſed to the eaſtward, whenever it came to hand. Little or none of it has yet reached this army, though in the greateſt want, and expoſed to the ſeverities of a winter campaign.</p>
                     <p>The convention have in one inſtance already provided for themſelves out of the public ſtock, by ſtopping and making uſe of twenty-ſix bales of clothing coming on from the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the army here. As this was done without conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, I took the liberty of deſiring them not to do the like in future; not that I meant to deprive them of their ſhare, but becauſe it diſappointed me of many articles which I ſtood in immediate want of, and had not provided from other quarters. But you may be aſſured, that, whenever returns are made of the whole ſtock of clothing, they ſhall have their proportion, and more than that,—allowance for their peculiar ſituation.</p>
                     <p>I am amazed to hear complaints of the hoſpital on the eaſt ſide of Hudſon's-river. Doctor Morgan, with moſt of his mates, has been conſtantly there ſince I left it with the main body of the army. It is in vain however to look back upon paſt misfortunes. I will not pretend to point out the cauſes; but I know matters have been ſtrangely conducted in the medical line. I hope your new appointment, when it is made, will make the neceſſary reform in the hoſpital, and that I ſhall not, the next campaign, have my ears, and eyes too, ſhocked with the complaints and looks of poor creatures periſhing for want of proper care, either in the regimental or hoſpital ſurgeons.</p>
                     <p>I agree with the convention in the expediency of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the paſſage of the North-river in ſome place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the mouth and the Highlands. We have found that our labour and expenſe has been thrown away in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do it below, where the channel is amazingly wide and deep; but, from the ſlight view I have had of the river above, I think the paſſage may be eaſily obſtructed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by proper fortifications, as the river is ſo narrow that no veſſel going up could poſſibly eſcape the fire. I am no judge of what can be done towards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>itting out the frigates at Poughkeepſie:—that muſt be left to the gentlemen of the marine committee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="unknown:029737_0357_0FE24B2C9CA17F90"/>
The hint given by the convention of New-York, of the neceſſity and utility of a commiſſary of forage, had ſtruck me before, and had been mentioned by general Mif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flin, whoſe department of quarter-maſter-general muſt be eaſed of part of the load which is at preſent thrown upon it. He is obliged in many inſtances to act entirely out of his proper line; and, inſtead of being confined to the duty of quarter-maſter-general, is alſo waggon-maſter, and forage-maſter-general.—I have wrote to two perſons that I think qualified to fill the office of waggon-maſter; and I hope one of them will accept.—That of commiſſary of forage ſhall be attended to.</p>
                     <p>The want of accurate maps of the country which has hitherto been the ſcene of war, has been of great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to me. I have in vain endeavoured to procure them, and have been obliged to make ſhift with ſuch ſketches as I could trace out from my own obſervation and that of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen around me. I really think, if gentlemen of known character and probity could be employed in making maps (from actual ſurvey) of the roads,—the rivers, and bridges and fords over them,—the mountains, and paſſes through them—it would be of the greateſt advantage.</p>
                     <p>I had, previous to the receipt of your letter, wrote to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Howe, and propoſed the fixing an agent for priſoners at New-York. I have not received an anſwer: but if he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes to the propoſal, I ſhall appoint Mr. Lewis Pintard.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorry that I am obliged to contradict the report of the taking of Fort-Independence as mentioned in my laſt. I believe the evacuation of ſome detached redoubts gave riſe to the report.—I have not heard from general Heath ſince the fourteenth inſtant, which I am amazed at. I am quite in the dark as to his numbers, and what progreſs he has made.</p>
                     <p>On the twenty-third, a party of four hundred of our men, under colonel * * *, fell in with two regiments of the enemy, convoying a number of waggons from Brunſwic to Amboy. Our advanced party under colonel Parker en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged them with great bravery upwards of twenty minutes, during which time the colonel-commandant was killed, and the ſecond in command mortally wounded. The people living near the field of action ſay their killed and wounded
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029737_0358_0FE24AE250BFB070"/>
were conſiderable. We loſt only two men, who were made priſoners. Had colonel * * * come up with the main body, colonel Parker and the other officers think we ſhould have put them to the rout, as their confuſion was very great, and their ground diſadvantageous. I have ordered * * * under arreſt, and ſhall bring him to trial to anſwer for ſo extraordinary a piece of conduct.</p>
                     <p>Reinforcements come up ſo extremely ſlow, that I am afraid I ſhall be left without any men before they arrive: The enemy muſt be ignorant of our numbers, or they have not horſes to move their artillery, or they would not ſuffer us to remain undiſturbed. I have repeatedly wrote to all the recruiting officers, to forward on their men as faſt as they could arm and clothe them; but they are ſo extremely averſe to turning out of comfortable quarters, that I cannot get a man to come near me, though I hear from all parts that the recruiting ſervice goes on with great ſucceſs. It would be well if the board of war, in whoſe department it is, would iſſue orders for all officers to equip and forward their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits to Head-Quarters with the greateſt expedition.</p>
                     <p>By a reſolve of Congreſs paſſed ſome time ago, general Schuyler is directed to apply to me for ninety-four tons of powder—a quantity which it is impoſſible I ſhould have by me, and for which I do not know where to direct him to apply. I could wiſh that returns were made to me of the quantity of powder on hand, and where it is to be found, that I may not be at a loſs at any time of emergency.</p>
                     <p>Since the reſignation of colonel Reed, the important of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of adjutant-general has been left unfilled, (I mean as to a principal) and I am much at a loſs how or where to find a perſon in every way capable and proper to execute the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. My inclinations lead me to confer the appointment upon a major Morris: but ample teſtimonials ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and full proof of fidelity ought to be made, before an office of ſo high truſt ſhould be conferred upon a perſon in a manner a ſtranger to me. I only know major Morris from a ſhort perſonal acquaintance, and from report: he never even brought a letter of recommendation to me. From his converſation, and from the accounts I have received from others, he is a man of conſiderable military abilities; and, from his behaviour in two inſtances, he is a man of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:029737_0359_0FE24B36767ECE40"/>
bravery and conduct. His ſtory is ſimply this—that he left the Britiſh ſervice in diſguſt upon not receiving a promotion to which he was juſtly entitled. Perhaps ſome gentlemen of Congreſs may know more about him, or may be able to make ſuch inquiries as might ſatisfy them as to the ſafety and propriety of appointing him. I have no other motive for wiſhing him a preference than that I think him the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereſt perſon that has come under my notice, provided all matters before mentioned were cleared up. I ſhall wait the reſult of a determination of Congreſs before I proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this appointment: and I wiſh to be favoured with their advice as ſpeedily as poſſible; for the remains of the old army is much diſarranged for want of a good adjutant-general, and the formation of the new in a great meaſure depends upon an able officer in that line.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE none of your favours unanſwered at preſent. There is ſuch a demand upon me from all quarters for money, which I am unable to anſwer, that I cannot help again preſſing you to ſend on a ſupply. The recruiting ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is almoſt at a ſtop here for want of money; and gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor Trumbull writes me word that it is totally ſo in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut. He adds that their loan officers cannot proceed in their buſineſs for want of proper check-books and notes; but that, if they were furniſhed with them, they could ſoon take in a ſufficient quantity to anſwer their purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall be glad to be informed whether I have a right to draw warrants upon the loan-officers in the different States. The State of Connecticut advanced colonel Sheldon, at my requeſt, ten thouſand pounds lawful, to raiſe his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of horſe. For their reimburſement they deſired me to give them a draught upon the loan-office: but, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether I had a right to draw upon that fund, I deferred it till I heard from you.</p>
                     <p>I muſt beg you to write to the aſſemblies of the different States, and inſiſt upon their paſſing a law to inflict a ſevere and heavy penalty upon thoſe who harbour deſerters, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029737_0360_0FE24AE3D286E798"/>
them to be ſuch. Our army is ſhamefully reduced by deſertion; and, except the people in the country can be forced to give information when deſerters return to their old neighbourhoods, we ſhall be obliged to detach one half of the army to bring back the other.</p>
                     <p>I have a letter from general Heath, of the twenty-fourth inſtant. He was at and near Kingſbridge with his army. I do not find that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I AM honoured with yours of the twenty-fourth of January, with ſundry reſolves of Congreſs, and a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of monſieur Pelliſier's incloſed. I am not the proper <hi>[perſon]</hi> to refer the petition to, as I am no judge of his merit as an engineer, having never had an opportunity of ſeeing any of his performances. At any rate I do not ſee the neceſſity of appointing him or any other perſon principal engineer at Ticonderoga: for that would exclude any other, though of ſuperior abilities, from being ſent there. Beſides, as a corps of engineers will in all probability be ſoon eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, monſieur Pelliſier's rank can then be ſettled with more propriety.</p>
                     <p>I forgot to mention in any of my former letters that I had appointed captain Nathaniel Gueſt, of Virginia, to the command of a regiment to be raiſed upon the frontiers of Virginia and Carolina; and I have directed him, if poſſible, to bring a company or two of Cherokee Indians. If they can be procured, they will anſwer two valuable purpoſes—one, as excellent ſcouts—the other, that they will be in fact hoſtages, and will ſecure the good behaviour of their nation.</p>
                     <p>Major Bland, commandant of the Virginia horſe, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know whether there is not a neceſſity of giving a bounty and re-enliſting his regiment as continental troops. They were enliſted to ſerve in the colony; and the men
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029737_0361_0FE24B37FABB2030"/>
were with ſome difficulty prevailed upon to march hither: but the major thinks they would be entirely reconciled upon receiving the bounty.</p>
                     <p>I received a letter from Mr. Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe, deſiring I would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point proper perſons to make inquiry into and take depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the behaviour of the Britiſh and foreign troops in Jerſey. This would be an endleſs taſk, as their line of march is marked with devaſtation, and is a thing of ſuch public notoriety that it demands no further proof.</p>
                     <p>I remonſtrated with general Howe upon the treatment of our wounded at Princeton. You will ſee by the incloſed letter from him, that he diſavows and deteſts the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but I fear that too much encouragement is given to ſuch barbarous behaviour by the Britiſh officers; for, in a late ſkirmiſh in which Sir William Erſkine commanded, lieutenant Kelly of the fifth Virginia regiment was flightly wounded in the thigh; but, before he could get off the field, he was overtaken and murdered in a moſt cruel manner. General Stephen informed me that he would write to Sir William, and inform him, that, unleſs ſuch practices were put a ſtop to, our ſoldiers would not be reſtrained from making retaliation.</p>
                     <p>By a letter from general Heath, of the thirteenth of laſt month, I find that he had decamped from the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Kingſbridge, and removed back towards the White-Plains. His reaſons for doing ſo were, that the troops could not ſtand the inclemency of the weather, and that he feared the troops expected from Rhode-Iſland would land upon his back. I have however directed him to leave a body of light troops under an active officer, in order to haraſs their foraging parties, and to cover our own who are to remove as much of the forage from Weſt-Cheſter county as they can; and, after leaving as many men as will ſecure the paſſes in the Highlands, the remainder are to be ſent over here to join me; for I am apprehenſive that the enemy are reinforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves at Brunſwic.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall to-morrow ſend out parties from every quarter, to remove all the waggons, horſes, cattle and ſheep, or as many as poſſible, from the neighbourhood of the enemy's lines. They are to attend particularly to the horſes: for if we can reduce thoſe that they at preſent have, and can hinder them
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029737_0362_0FE24AE5558B2AD0"/>
from getting freſh ones from the adjacent country, it will be impoſſible for them to move their artillery and waggons forward, ſhould they incline to make another puſh towards Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>I obſerve by your laſt reſolves that the militia of Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Harford and Cecil counties in Maryland, are order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out and to march this way. Let me entreat you to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer none to go forward to Philadelphia but what are equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with arms, accoutrements and blankets: they hurt the ſervice much by taking thoſe things only for a ſhort time from the continental troops, many of whom would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be enabled to take the field.</p>
                     <p>The ſecretary of the board of war has tranſmitted me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts of general Schuyler's letters, in which he calls preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly for ſome general officers to be ſent to his aſſiſtance. This will ſhew you the neceſſity of immediately making the promotions recommended in mine of the twenty-ſecond of January; for at preſent I cannot ſpare a general officer from this quarter without injuring the ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Nothing of conſequence has happened ſince I wrote to you laſt, except a ſkirmiſh on the firſt of this month, five or ſix miles from Brunſwic-landing, between our advanced par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (about ſeven hundred in the whole) and upwards of two thouſand of the enemy, under Sir William Erſkine. The heat of the engagement was <hi>[borne by]</hi> colonel Scott of the fifth Virginia regiment, who, with about a hundred men, beat back two hundred of the Britiſh grenadiers. Sev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral other officers behaved with great ſpirit; but there is ſome reaſon to ſuſpect that colonel * * *, who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our main body, did not behave altogether as he ought. I have ordered a court upon him, that the matter may be fairly canvaſſed, and that he may ſtand condemned or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by the evidence of thoſe who were preſent.</p>
                     <p>Colonel * * *, who was under arreſt upon a charge of cowardice, broke his parole and went over to Bucks-county, I ſuppoſe with an intent to make his eſcape: but I diſpatched a troop of light horſe after him, who brought him back yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday; and he is to take his trial on Friday.</p>
                     <p>The ſmall-pox has made ſuch head in every quarter, that I find it impoſſible to keep it from ſpreading through the whole army in the natural way. I have therefore deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:029737_0363_0FE24B3984E8B6C0"/>
not only to inoculate all the troops now here that have not had it, but ſhall order doctor Shippen to inoculate the recruits as faſt as they come in to Philadelphia. They will loſe no time, becauſe they will go through the diſorder while their clothing, arms and accoutrements are getting ready.</p>
                     <p>From the firſt inſtitution of civil government, it has been the national policy of every precedent State to endeavour to engage its members to the diſcharge of their public duty by the obligation of ſome oath: its force and happy influence has been felt in too many inſtances, to need any arguments to ſupport the policy or prove its utility. I have often thought the States have been too negligent in this particular, and am more fully convinced of it from the effect general Howe's excurſion has produced in New-Jerſey. An oath is the only ſubſtitute that can be adopted to ſupply the defect of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. By our inattention in this article, we loſe a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cement to our own force, and give the enemy an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to make the firſt tender of the oath of allegiance to the king. Its baneful influence is but too ſeverely felt at this time. The people generally confeſs they were compelled to take protection, and ſubſcribe the <hi>Declaration:</hi> yet it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes many with arguments to refuſe taking any active part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and further they allege themſelves bound to a neutrality at leaſt. Many conſcientious people who were well-wiſhers to the cauſe, had they been bound to the States by an oath, would have ſuffered any puniſhment rather than have taken the oath of allegiance to the king; and are now loſt to our intereſt for want of this neceſſary tie. Notwithſtanding the obligation of the <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> they do not conceive it to have the ſame effect as an oath. The more united the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants appear, the greater difficulty general Howe will have in reconciling them to regal government, and conſequently the leſs hope of conquering them. For theſe reaſons and many more that might be urged, I ſhould ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend every State to fix upon ſome oath or affirmation of allegiance to be tendered to all the inhabitants without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and to outlaw thoſe that refuſe it.</p>

                     <p>I WAS yeſterday waited upon by two French gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, monſieur Romand de Liſle, and Robillard. The firſt produced a commiſſion ſigned by you in November laſt, appointing him a major of artillery: but, by the incloſed let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from him to me, he claims much higher rank under the promiſe of Congreſs—that of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Robillard claims a captaincy of artillery: but, upon what he grounds his pretenſions, I do not know. I never ſaw him but once before; and that was upon his way from Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton to Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>You cannot conceive what a weight theſe kind of people are upon the ſervice, and upon me in particular. Few of them have any knowledge of the branches which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to underſtand; and thoſe that have are entirely uſeleſs as officers, from their ignorance of the Engliſh language.

                     <p>SINCE I had the honour of addreſſing you on the fifth inſtant, no event of an important and intereſting nature has occurred, unleſs the ſucceſſes of our parties in foraging and bringing off ſeveral horſes, waggons, and ſome fat cattle and ſheep, which were contiguous to and around the enemy's lines, are conſidered as ſuch. I then mentioned that I had ſuch a ſcheme in contemplation, which was happily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed the next day without any loſs. The enemy in turn have made frequent efforts in that way, but with little ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Whenever they made the attempt, it never failed to produce a ſkirmiſh. They have been common of late, but with little damage to either ſide.</p>

We have certain intelligence that they have drawn the greateſt part of their troops from Rhode-Iſland, and are told that part of them have landed on Staten-Iſland and at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, with a view of augmenting their force at Brunſwic.</p>
                     <p>Colonel * * *, agreeable to the information contained in my laſt, has been tried by a court-martial, and caſhiered. The proceedings and ſentence I directed to be tranſmitted to the ſecretary of the war-office, and to the printers of this State and Virginia, to be publiſhed.</p>
                     <p>General Lincoln is juſt arrived with a regiment of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts militia, about two hundred and fifty. This, he ſays, is ſucceeded by three more, which will make in the whole near eighteen hundred: but in this I think he muſt be miſtaken, unleſs thoſe on the march are much fuller and larger than what they uſually are. The whole are of the troops that were with general Heath.</p>
                     <p>General Knox, by a letter of the firſt inſtant, informs me, that, on mature inquiry and examination, he finds Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field to be more convenient and much better calculated for an elaboratory and cannon-foundery, than any other part of the New-England States. He adds that a quantity of copper, tin, and other uſeful materials, can be had there; and that the neceſſary works and preparations, from theſe and other advantages, can be accompliſhed at leaſt three or four months ſooner there than any where elſe.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence of his opinion, which I eſteem of weight, particularly in this inſtance—and knowing the importance of, and how eſſential theſe eſtabliſhments are—I have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to order the works to be begun there, without regard to what had been done at Brookfield, which was of but little conſequence. The former, beſides the many advantages mentioned by general Knox, ſtands on Connecticut-river, and has a good navigation: yet is entirely ſecure againſt any attempts of the enemy, being twenty miles above Hartford, where the river is narrow, and too ſhoal to admit veſſels that can give the leaſt annoyance. As nothing but the good of the ſervice could have led to this meaſure, I truſt it will be approved.</p>
                     <p>I have wrote to the aſſembly of Maſſachuſetts State and the convention of New-Hampſhire, requeſting their good offices and exertions to promote the raiſing of their regiments

Their contiguity to that poſt more than to any other—the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, and general Schuyler's apprehenſions that the enemy may attempt to paſs the lake (if not on the ice) as ſoon as it is open—added to the great trouble, expenſe, and loſs of time it will ſave in marching them elſewhere, and others there who are much more diſtant and remote—induced me to determine ſo. I find the council of the former, on general Schuyler's earneſt application, before my letter reached them, had determined to ſend four regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as ſoon as they could be completed. I only wiſh the whole may be made up in a ſhort time, and that their arrival may be early enough to prevent thoſe inconveniences and fatal conſequences which the want of a ſufficient force in that quarter would ſubject us to, were the enemy to paſs the lakes at this time.</p>
                     <p>Mr. James Meaſe is now here in conſequence of being appointed clothier-general. He is adjuſting a plan for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the end of his appointment, and making an eſtimate, to be laid before Congreſs or their ſecret committee, of ſuch clothes as may be neceſſary to import for the army.</p>
                     <p>It is with much concern that the ſituation of our affairs obliges me to mention ſo frequently the want of money, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when I am perſuaded every means are uſed to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it. Our diſtreſs on this account is great indeed; and the injury the ſervice receives, almoſt inconceivable:—not a day, an hour, or ſcarcely a minute paſſes, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and applications on this head.

the arrangement and future regulation of the general hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. As this plan is very extenſive, the appointments numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the ſalaries affixed to them at preſent, large, I did not think myſelf at liberty to adopt any part of it before I laid it before Congreſs for their approbation. I will juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that, though the expenſe attending an hoſpital upon the incloſed plan will be very great, it will in the end not only be a ſaving to the public, but the only poſſible method of keeping an army a-foot.</p>
                     <p>We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> now at an enormous bounty, and with no ſmall difficulty, recruiting an army of upwards of a hundred bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions. The enſuing campaign may, from the ſame cauſes, prove as ſickly as the laſt: and if the hoſpitals are in no better condition for the reception of the ſick, our regiments will be reduced to companies by the end of the campaign; and thoſe poor wretches who eſcape with life will be either ſcattered up and down the country, and not to be found, or, if found, totally enervated and unfit for further duty. By theſe means not only the bounty is loſt, but the man is loſt alſo: and I leave you to judge whether we have men enough to allow of ſuch a conſumption of lives and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions as have been loſt the laſt campaign. For my own part I am certain, that, if the army which I hope we ſhall have in the field this year is ſuffered to moulder away by ſickneſs as it did the laſt, we muſt look for reinforcements to ſome other places than our own States.</p>
                     <p>The number of officers mentioned in the incloſed plan I preſume are neceſſary for us, becauſe they are found ſo in the Britiſh hoſpitals: and, as they are eſtabliſhed upon the ſureſt baſis,—that of long experience under the ableſt phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians and ſurgeons,—we ſhould not heſitate a moment in adopting their regulations, when they ſo plainly tend to correct and improve our former want of method and knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge in this important department.</p>
                     <p>The pay affixed to the different appointments is, as I ſaid before, great, and perhaps more than you may think adequate to the ſervice. In determining upon the ſum that is to be allowed to each, you ought to conſider that it ſhould be ſuch as will induce gentlemen of character and ſkill in their profeſſion to ſtep forth, and in ſome manner adequate to the practice which they have at home: for unleſs ſuch
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:029737_0368_0FE24AF16E7B1FC8"/>
gentlemen are induced to undertake the care and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our hoſpitals, we had better truſt to the force of nature and conſtitution, than ſuffer perſons entirely ignorant of medicine to deſtroy us by ill-directed applications.</p>
                     <p>I hear from every quarter, that the dread of undergoing the ſame miſeries for want of proper care and attention when ſick, has much retarded the new enliſtments, particularly to the ſouthward. This is another reaſon for eſtabliſhing our hoſpitals upon a large and generous plan: for we ought to make the ſervice as agreeable and enticing as poſſible to the ſoldiery, many of whom (eſpecially when we call forth the militia) not only quit the comforts but the luxuries of life.</p>
                     <p>A few days ago doctor * * * ſent me the incloſed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſcript, which is a vindication of his conduct, upon which he deſires a court of inquiry may be held. I tranſmit it to you by his direction. As I do not know what particular charges were alleged againſt him, I can ſay nothing to it or about it. You will find a plan of his alſo incloſed, for the better regulation of the hoſpital: but I think all his hints are included in doctor Shippen's plan.</p>
                     <p>As no time is to be loſt in appointing the neceſſary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, fixing upon the proper places for hoſpitals, and many other preparations, I could wiſh that Congreſs would take this matter under their immediate conſideration, and favour me with their ſentiments thereon as ſoon as poſſible.</p>

                     <p>THE principal deſign of this is to inform you, that we have ſtrong reaſons to believe that the enemy are on the point of making ſome puſh. What their object is,—whether to beat up our quarters and to extend their own, to make a large forage and collection of provender, of which they are in great want, or to turn their views towards the Delaware,—is a matter of uncertainty: but it ſeems probable that one of theſe things they have in contemplation. Such of their troops as have returned from Rhode-Iſland have landed at Amboy, and, with them, ſeveral pieces of heavy artillery. General Howe is come over too, and it is ſaid, lord Percy.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:029737_0369_0FE24B465D9FC938"/>
Their number at Brunſwic and the landing place, before the arrival of this laſt reinforcement, was eſtimated from ſeven to eight thouſand.</p>
                     <p>I have ordered the utmoſt vigilance and attention to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at our ſeveral poſts, to guard againſt ſurpriſes, and every preparation to be made that the weak and feeble ſtate of our little army will admit of. At this time we are only about four thouſand ſtrong; a force, you will ſuppoſe, une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to a ſucceſsful oppoſition, if they were not militia, and far too ſmall for the exigencies of our affairs. It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to obtain exact returns, though they are daily called for, owing to the frequent and almoſt conſtant departure of ſome of the corps.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Nielſon of Brunſwic, with a detachment of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, on the morning of the eighteenth, ſurpriſed major Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, whom he took with fifty-nine privates of general Skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's corps, killing four, and bringing away the arms of the whole, with ſome blankets. This about balances the loſs of a militia guard which a party of Britiſh troops took laſt week in Monmouth, near the Hook.</p>

                     <p>MONSIEUR Faneuil, who ſome time ago laid a plan before you for raiſing and officering a corps of Frenchmen, waited upon me yeſterday. His ſucceſs, as I expected, has been ſmall in enliſting or rather engaging Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adians. I cannot find that he has met with more than thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or forty who would be willing to ſerve with him. He is now upon another ſcheme,—that of raiſing, arming and clothing a number of men in the French iſlands. To grant a commiſſion of that kind is without the extent of my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and I have therefore deſired him to go forward, and lay
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:029737_0370_0FE24AF2F113CC08"/>
his propoſals before Congreſs. If they appear feaſible, they may be adopted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I would beg leave to obſerve that one precaution will be neceſſary, that is, that the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of monſieur Faneuil and his officers ſhould depend upon the performance of their agreement for raiſing any certain number of men.</p>
                     <p>I have often mentioned to you the diſtreſs I am every now and then laid under by the application of French of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers for commiſſions in our ſervice. This evil, if I may call it ſo, is a growing one: for, from what I learn, they are coming in ſwarms from old France and the iſlands. There will therefore be a neceſſity of providing for them or diſcountenancing them. To do the firſt is difficult; and the laſt, diſagreeable, and perhaps impolitic, if they are men of merit:—and it is impoſſible to diſtinguiſh theſe from mere adventurers, of whom, I am convinced, there are the greateſt number. They ſeldom bring more than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and paſſport, which, we know, may belong to a bad as well as a good officer.</p>
                     <p>Their ignorance of our language, and their inability to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit men, are unſurmountable obſtacles to their being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into our continental battalions: for our officers, who have raiſed their men, and have ſerved through the war up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pay that has hitherto not borne their expenſes, would be diſguſted if foreigners were put over their heads:—and I aſſure you, few or none of theſe gentlemen look lower than field-officers' commiſſions. To give them all brevets, by which they have rank and draw pay without doing any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is ſaddling the continent with a vaſt expenſe: and to form them into corps, would be only eſtabliſhing corps of officers; for, as I ſaid before, they cannot poſſibly raiſe any men.</p>
                     <p>Some general mode of diſpoſing of them muſt be adopted; for it is ungenerous to keep them in ſuſpenſe, and at great charge to themſelves: but I am at a loſs how to point out this mode. Suppoſe they were told in general, that no man could obtain a commiſſion, except he could raiſe a number of men in proportion to his rank. This would effectually ſtop the mouths of common appliers, and would leave us at liberty to make proviſion for gentlemen of undoubted

military character and merit, who would be very uſeful to us as ſoon as they acquired our language.</p>

                     <p>CONGRESS having reſolved that ſeveral regiments of cavalry ſhould be raiſed to form a part of their army, I beg leave, through you, to lay before them the incloſed liſt of officers which appear neceſſary to be appointed to each corps, and which they will be pleaſed to eſtabliſh. At the ſame time I ſhould ſuppoſe it highly expedient to fix their pay and that of the privates. There is now one regiment in ſervice, and three more recruiting: this makes it indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary that it ſhould be done. Applications are conſtantly making to know what the pay is, and objections raiſed againſt the ſervice for want of due information.</p>
                     <p>I have tranſmitted a liſt of ſuch pay as ſeemed to be thought reaſonable for part of the officers to receive when colonel Sheldon's regiment was directed to be levied, and a copy of the memorandum made at that time. This, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Sheldon conceived, would not be more than adequate to their ſervices, trouble, and expenſe, and which in ſome degree was founded on the opinions of other gentlemen of whom inquiry was made upon the ſubject. I did not fix it in the inſtances where it is ſet down with certainty, as the memorandum will ſhew. A criterion, by which I was alſo governed upon that occaſion, was the reſolve appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Sheldon lieutenant-colonel-commandant, with the rank and pay of colonel. From thence I attempted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion that of ſome other officers. Upon the whole, I
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:029737_0372_0FE24AFC6C680AC0"/>
think it ſhould be ſettled without further loſs of time, and wiſh the earlieſt attention of Congreſs to be had to it.</p>
                     <p>Our delicate and truly critical ſituation, for want of a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient force to oppoſe the enemy who are now ready, and, before many days elapſe, will take the field, induced me to expect that the troops raiſing in the ſouthern States, and intended for this army, would march in companies or half companies as they were made up, without waiting for their regiments to be complete. Policy ſtrongly ſuggeſted the propriety of the meaſure, and I requeſted it: but, to my great anxiety and ſurpriſe, I am told that this line of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is totally neglected, though a great number of recruits are actually engaged. I muſt entreat Congreſs to interpoſe again with their moſt preſſing applications and commands that this expedient be adopted without a moment's delay. No injury can reſult from it, becauſe a ſufficient number of proper officers can and muſt be left, to recruit the corps to their full complement.</p>
                     <p>Nor will my fears reſpecting the ſtate of our arms allow me to be ſilent on that head. Let the States be urged to ſend their men equipped with them and every other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, if poſſible. I know not what ſupplies may be in ſtore elſewhere, or in the power of Congreſs: but they muſt not depend upon their being furniſhed here with any, or but with very few:—no human prudence or precaution could ſecure but a ſmall part of thoſe belonging to the public, and in the hands of the ſoldiery, from being embezzled and carried off when their time of ſervice expired; nor can the ſame abuſes be reſtrained in the militia.</p>

It turned out to be only a ſtronger

foraging party than uſual. They were however oppoſed in ſo ſpirited a manner by our advanced parties, that they were checked, and retired in the afternoon towards Amboy, from whence they came. Their loſs in the courſe of the day, from the beſt accounts I can get, amounts to about one hundred in killed, wounded, priſoners, and deſerters. Some people who were near the ſcene of action, and who have picked up accounts from thoſe who have ſince been in Amboy, are ſanguine enough to ſuppoſe that they have loſt five hundred all together: but of this I have no conception. Our loſs was only two killed and ten wounded.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I WAS this evening honoured with your favour of the twenty-third ultimo, accompanied by ſundry proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Congreſs. Thoſe reſpecting general Lee, and which preſcribe the treatment of lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the five Heſſian field-officers, are the cauſe of this letter.</p>
                     <p>Though I ſincerely commiſerate the misfortunes of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Lee, and feel much for his preſent unhappy ſituation, yet, with all poſſible deference to the opinion of Congreſs, I fear that theſe reſolutions would not have the deſired ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect—are founded in impolicy—and will, if adhered to, produce conſequences of an extenſive and melancholy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Retaliation is certainly juſt, and ſometimes neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, even where attended with the ſevereſt penalties: but, when the evils which may and muſt reſult from it exceed thoſe intended to be redreſſed, prudence and policy require that it ſhould be avoided. Having premiſed thus much, I beg leave to examine the juſtice and expediency of it in the inſtances now before us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="unknown:029737_0375_0FE24B515DE60D80"/>
From the beſt information I have been able to obtain, general Lee's uſage has not been ſo diſgraceful and diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable as to authoriſe the treatment decreed to thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, was it not prohibited by many other important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. His confinement, I believe, has been more rigorous than has been generally experienced by the reſt of our officers, or thoſe of the enemy who have been in our poſſeſſion: but if the reports be true, (received on that head) he has been provided with a decent apartment and with moſt things neceſſary to render him comfortable. This is not the caſe with one of the officers comprehended in the reſolves, if his letter, of which a copy is tranſmitted, deſerves your credit. Here retaliation ſeems to have been prematurely begun; or, to ſpeak with more propriety, ſeverities have been and are exerciſed towards colonel Campbell, not juſtified by any that general Lee has yet received.</p>
                     <p>In point of policy, under the preſent ſituation of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, this doctrine cannot be ſupported. The balance of priſoners is greatly againſt us; and a general regard to the happineſs of the whole ſhould mark our conduct. Can we imagine that our enemies will not mete the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the ſame indignities, the ſame cruelties, to thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to us, in their poſſeſſion, that we impoſe on theirs in our power? Why ſhould we ſuppoſe them to poſſeſs more humanity than we have ourſelves? or why ſhould an inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual attempt to relieve the diſtreſſes of one brave unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate man involve many more in the ſame calamities?</p>
                     <p>However diſagreeable the fact may be, the enemy at this time have in their power, and ſubject to their call, near three hundred officers belonging to the army of the United States. In this number there are ſome of high rank; and moſt of them are men of bravery and of merit. The quota of theirs in our hands bears no proportion, being not more than fifty at moſt. Under theſe circumſtances we ſhould certainly do no act to draw upon the gentlemen belonging to us, and who have already ſuffered a long captivity, greater puniſhments than they have and now experience. If we ſhould, what will their feelings be, and thoſe of their numerous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive connexions?—Suppoſe the treatment preſcribed for the Heſſians ſhould be purſued, will it not eſtabliſh what the enemy have been aiming to effect by every artifice and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:029737_0376_0FE24B00BB5DD488"/>
the groſſeſt miſrepreſentations,—I mean, an opinion of our enmity towards them, and of the cruel conduct they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience when they fall into our hands,—a prejudice which we on our part have heretofore thought it politic to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and to root out by every act of lenity and of kindneſs? It certainly will:—the Heſſians would hear of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with all the circumſtances of heightened exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—would feel the injury, without inveſtigating the cauſe, or reaſoning upon the juſtice or neceſſity of it. The miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, which may and muſt inevitably flow from the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reſolves, appear to be endleſs and innumerable.</p>
                     <p>On my own part, I have been much embarraſſed on the ſubject of exchanges already. Applications are daily made by both friends and enemies, to complete them as far as circumſtances of number and rank will apply. Some of the former have complained that a diſcrimination is about to be adopted, perhaps injurious to their reputation, and certainly depriving them of their right of exchange in due courſe, as eſtabliſhed upon the principles of equality pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed laſt year, acceded to by both parties, and now ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting. The latter charge me with a breach of faith, and call upon me to perform the agreement.</p>
                     <p>Many more objections might be ſubjoined, were they material:—I ſhall only obſerve that the preſent ſtate of our army (if it deſerves that name) will not authoriſe the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of retaliation or the ſtyle of menace. This will be conceded by all who know that the whole of our force is weak and trifling, and compoſed of militia (a very few reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular troops excepted) whoſe ſervice is on the eve of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral other matters which might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned upon this ſubject, would time and opportunity per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: but as they will not, I beg leave to refer you to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Walker, who will deliver this, and give ſatisfaction to any inquiries that may be deemed neceſſary. Perſuading myſelf that Congreſs will indulge the liberty I have taken upon this occaſion, I have only to wiſh for the reſult of their deliberations after they have reconſidered the reſolves, and to aſſure them that I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>I DO myſelf the honour to tranſmit you the incloſed copy of a letter from general Lee, received by a flag on Tueſday laſt. You will perceive from thence his wiſhes and expectations of ſeeing ſome members of Congreſs in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his letter upon that ſubject. None of the paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which he mentions were ſent out, though the letter came by general Howe's permiſſion as the others did. I ſhould be happy to relieve his anxiety as far as I could, by ſending in major Morris: but this I cannot do till a ſafe-conduct is granted.</p>
                     <p>The more I conſider the reſolves reſpecting lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the Heſſian officers, the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced I am of their impolicy. The propoſition made by Congreſs for the exchange of priſoners, and which by their direction was tranſmitted to general Howe, was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on principles of equality in number and in rank. From hence no demand, as a matter of right, can be made of general Lee's releaſement for any officer or number of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of inferior rank: whatever is or might be done in ſuch inſtance, would be of favour and indulgence. The only cartel that now ſubſiſts is the one I have mentioned. This, ſo far as it goes, is a beneficial one: it recogniſes the rank of our officers, and inſures their diſcharge from captivity whenever we are poſſeſſed of a like number belonging to them, and of the ſame rank. If on our part it ſhould be violated,—if it is not obſerved,—ſurely it will and muſt ceaſe to be obligatory on general Howe. What conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences may then enſue, I leave to your conjecture.</p>
                     <p>If it be objected that the above obſervations, and what I ſaid in my former letter, prove that no treatment receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our officers ſhould be retaliated on theirs,—my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that the proportion of officers in their hands is at leaſt ſix to one in ours. This conſideration, ſuppoſing we had a right to demand general Lee's liberty, would be of great weight, and ſufficient to prevent, in my opinion, the execution of the reſolves. I have the honour to be, in haſte, your moſt obedient ſervant,</p>

                     <p>I WAS honoured ſeveral days ago with your letter of the twenty-fifth ultimo, with its incloſures, the receipt of which was omitted to be acknowledged in my laſt.</p>
                     <p>Could I accompliſh the important objects ſo eagerly wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Congreſs,—"confining the enemy within their preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quarters,—preventing their getting ſupplies from the country, and totally ſubduing them before they are rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced,"—I ſhould be happy indeed. But what proſpect or hope can there be of my effecting ſo deſirable a work at this time? The incloſed return, to which I ſolicit the moſt ſerious attention of Congreſs, comprehends the whole force I have in Jerſey. It is but a handful, and bears no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, on the ſcale of numbers, to that of the enemy. Added to this, the major part is made up of militia. The moſt ſanguine in ſpeculation cannot deem it more than ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the leaſt valuable purpoſes of war.</p>
                     <p>The reinforcements mentioned to be drawn from general Heath were merely ideal,—nearly the whole of the eaſtern troops which were with him being here before. They were only engaged till to-day: and to-day they leave the camp. Their ſervice has been of pretty long continuance, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole of the winter months. What proſpect there may be of immediate ſuccours from other quarters, I know not: but from the militia of this State I cannot expect to derive much more aid. Thoſe who are well affected have been ſo frequently called from their homes, that they are tired out, and almoſt profeſs an abhorrence of the ſervice: nor have I heard as yet that any continental troops are on the way. I have wrote to the brigadiers-general in moſt of the States upon the ſubject, and alſo to the colonels, urging them by every motive to exert themſelves in filling the reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iments, and to forward them on.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs, Sir, I feel the moſt painful anxiety when I reflect on our ſituation and that of the enemy. Unleſs the levies arrive ſoon, we muſt, before it be long, experience ſome intereſting and melancholy event. I believe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy have fixed their object, and the execution will ſurely be attempted as ſoon as the roads are paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ble. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared ſtate in which we are, favours all their deſigns;
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029737_0379_0FE24B556ED2D8D0"/>
and it is much to be wiſhed that they may not ſucceed to their warmeſt expectations.</p>
                     <p>On recurring to the late promotions of brigadiers, I find the number appointed to be ſhort of what I took the liberty to recommend, and not competent to the exigencies of the ſervice, ſuppoſing the whole in office before, and thoſe lately created, conſent to act, which I have reaſon to believe will not be the caſe. I ſhall only beg leave to refer you to my former letters upon this ſubject, and to aſſure you that many diſadvantages will reſult from not having a ſufficient number of officers of this rank. We have always been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in this inſtance; and certain I am that the ſervice has been greatly injured by it. The proportion I mentioned was full ſmall, and, in my opinion, ſhould not be diſpenſed with.</p>
                     <p>I would alſo take the liberty of mentioning again (having received no anſwer upon the ſubject) that ſettling the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital plan and eſtabliſhment becomes more and more nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary. It is an object of infinite importance; and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of doing it on a proper foundation will be great, if not almoſt inſurmountable, ſhould it be deferred till the campaign opens, and the enemy begin their operations. The benefits of the inſtitution will ſoon be known:—the want was ſeverely felt in the courſe of the laſt year.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing more which claims, in my opinion, the earlieſt attention of Congreſs,—I mean the pay of the regimental ſurgeons, and that of the mates. Theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments are ſo eſſential, that they cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. The pay, in the firſt inſtance, is ſo low, ſo inadequate to the ſervices which ſhould be performed, that no man ſuſtaining the character of a gentleman, and who has the leaſt medical abilities or ſkill in the profeſſion, can think of accepting it: that in the latter is ſo paltry and trifling, that none, of the leaſt generoſity of ſentiment or pretenſions to merit, can conſent to act for it. In a word, theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of an intereſting nature:—they amount to an excluſion of perſons who could diſcharge the duties of thoſe offices; and, if not redreſſed, there is not the ſmalleſt prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability that any can be prevailed on to enter them again.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral matters alſo which I referred to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſome time ſince, and upon which I have not received
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029737_0380_0FE24B0C3951DFB8"/>
the reſult of their deliberations.—One inquiry, about the ſtate of arms and ammunition, I am peculiarly anxious to be ſatisfied in.</p>
                     <p>From the inconveniences and injuries to the ſervice of late for want of money, I am induced to requeſt that the ſtricteſt regard ſhould be had to furniſhing the pay-maſter with conſtant and ſufficient ſupplies. On Sunday he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived five hundred thouſand dollars, half of which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready expended, and the balance in a day or two will be entirely ſwept away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without diſcharging the ſeveral claims. By his report, the commiſſary here requires an immediate draught for a hundred thouſand; and the militia returning and about to leave camp, a hundred and twenty thouſand more. The expenſe incurred by calling on them ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is almoſt incredible. Beſides theſe, there are ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral arrears due to the old troops, and to moſt of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral and ſtaff officers.</p>

However, from the moſt accurate eſtimate that I can form, the whole of our numbers in Jerſey, fit for duty at this time, is under three thouſand. Theſe (nine hundred and eighty-one excepted) are militia, and ſtand engaged only till the laſt of this month. The troops under inoculation, including their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, amount to about one thouſand.</p>

                     <p>COLONEL Palfrey, having expreſſed a deſire to ſettle the accounts of his office to this time, has obtained my permiſſion to repair to Philadelphia, and now waits on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs with his books and vouchers, hoping that a committee will be appointed to examine and adjuſt the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The diſadvantages which have ariſen to the ſervice, and which have been ſeverely felt, for want of conſtant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in the military cheſt, are almoſt incredible, and are

not to be deſcribed but with great difficulty to thoſe who are not immediately in the army, and privy to the frequent and importunate applications that are made. To prevent inconveniences of the like nature in future, I have thought it proper that an eſtimate of the monthly advances ſhould be formed and laid before Congreſs. This colonel Palfrey will do; and though it cannot be effected with a degree of ſcrupulous exactneſs and preciſion, yet from his intimate knowledge of the incidental charges and expenſes in the common courſe of things, the calculation, I apprehend, will be attended with many benefits. It will ſhew Congreſs the neceſſary proviſions of money to be made for ordinary contingencies, and enable them to form a rule for their government in the inſtance of ſupplies for the army.</p>

                     <p>YESTERDAY a letter, of which the incloſed is a copy, came to my hands. The account is confirmed by a countryman who is ſince come in: but nothing diſtinct has yet been received.</p>
                     <p>The aid required of me in colonel Hay's letter cannot be given: I have no men to oppoſe the enemy's deſigns in any one quarter, although called upon from every quarter. All that was poſſible for me to do towards collecting a force at Peekſkill, I had attempted before: I had in peremptory terms called upon the officers of Rhode-Iſland and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut to forward on their recruits under proper officers as faſt as poſſible to that place: I had directed ſuch of the New-York regiments as had been ordered to Ticonderoga, to repair thither: I had requeſted eight of the Maſſachuſetts regiments to be marched to that poſt: and left theſe ſhould not arrive in time, I urged governor Trumbull, in a letter of the ſixth inſtant, to ſend two thouſand of his militia to the ſame place. But ſorry I am to obſerve, the militia have got tired; and the colonels of the continental regiments have been greatly deceived themſelves,—have greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me,—or the moſt unheard-of deſertions * * * have prevailed * * *: for regiments, reported two or
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029737_0383_0FE24B60A86C4828"/>
three months ago to be half completed, are, upon the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels being called upon in poſitive terms for a juſt ſtate of them, found to contain leſs than one hundred men; and this not the caſe of a ſingle regiment only, but of many. In Connecticut alone, by a letter from general Parſons, of the ſixth inſtant, four regiments are mentioned as not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than eighty rank and file, each.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, Sir, are melancholy truths: but facts they are, and neceſſary to be known to Congreſs, however prudent it may be to conceal them from the obſervation of others.</p>
                     <p>To ſuperintend the buſineſs of recruiting,—to ſee that the officers were diligent,—to prevent impoſitions if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,—to appoint fit places of rendezvous,—to ſee that the recruits were actually brought to thoſe places, and there equipped and trained for the field,—were among the great objects which early and repeatedly induced me to preſs the appointment of general officers: but unfortunately the delay of appointing, being followed by the reſignation of ſome officers and non-acceptance of others, will involve the army in a mere chaos of confuſion at a time when the utmoſt order and regularity ſhould prevail, and when all our arrangements ought to be completely eſtabliſhed. The medical department will, it is much to be feared, be in the ſame ſituation:—not an officer yet appointed to it.</p>
                     <p>For want of proper and coercive powers,—from diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and other cauſes,—the militia of this State are not to be depended upon. They are drawn out with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and at a moſt enormous expenſe, as their accounts will ſhew: they come, you can ſcarce tell how; they go, you hardly know when. In the ſame predicament are thoſe of Pennſylvania.</p>
                     <p>Numbers from this State have joined the enemy; and many more are diſpoſed to do ſo, as the letter from Mr. Hoff (a copy of which is incloſed, correſponding with ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral others of the ſame tenor) ſufficiently evinces.</p>

                     <p>The arrival of the arms, locks and flints, you have been pleaſed to mention, is a moſt fortunate and happy event. I join you moſt ſincerely in congratulations upon the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>I have not yet obtained a certain account of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt and deſtruction of Peekſkill. Information of thoſe events has not been yet tranſmitted by generals M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal or Clinton, or the convention of the State. There is no doubt but that the town is deſtroyed, and, with it, ſome ſtores:—neither the quality nor amount of them is known. It is ſaid that it was done in part by our own people when they found that they could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them falling into the enemy's hands. The ſhips and troops have gone down the river again.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Kirkland, the Oneida miſſionary, arrived here this week, with a chief warrior and five other Indians of that nation. They had been to Boſton, and came from thence to this place to inquire into the true ſtate of matters, that they might report them to a grand council to be ſhortly held. They ſaid things were ſo falſely and variouſly rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſented by our enemies through their agents, that they did not know what to depend on. I invited them to go to Philadelphia: but they declined it, declaring they were well ſatisfied with what they had ſeen, and that they were authoriſed to tell their nation, all they had heard from the enemy was falſe. Being told that France was aſſiſting us, and about to join in the war, they ſeemed highly pleaſed; and Mr. Kirkland ſaid he was perſuaded it
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:029737_0385_0FE24B625CAB4778"/>
would have a conſiderable effect on the minds of ſeveral of the nations, and ſecure to us their neutrality, if not a declaration and commencement of hoſtilities in our favour. I ſhewed them every civility in my power, and every thing that I thought material to excite in them an idea of our ſtrength and independence. After ſtaying two days, they ſet off for their nation, expreſſing their deſire of the moſt ſpeedy return to the council, and profeſſing the moſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſentiments towards us.</p>

                     <p>Captain Deſhields ſays it ſeemed to be the general opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and converſation that this embarkation was for Cheſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peak-bay, with a view of making a deſcent on the Eaſtern-Shore, or that the troops were to proceed to the Head of Elk, taking Annapolis and Baltimore in their way. There were ſome who thought it probable they mean to go up the North-river and attempt the Highland fortifications. I have written to general M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal and Clinton, deſiring them to make the beſt preparation that circumſtances will admit of, for their reception, in caſe the latter ſhould be their object.</p>
                     <p>Captain Deſhields being in company with the captain of the packet, but unknown to him, heard him ſay that a war with France was much expected when he left England, which was about the beginning of February.</p>

Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prudential ſtep appears to have been taken by the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and as good a diſpoſition made as his ſmall number of men would admit of.</p>
                     <p>I have heard nothing further reſpecting the embarkation of troops which I mentioned in my laſt. I am in hopes the Connecticut militia will arrive at Peekſkill before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other expedition is made up the North-river. I have wrote to haſten them as much as poſſible, leſt ſuch another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign ſhould be really in agitation. In my opinion, Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware-bay is their object, and Cheſapeak only thrown out by way of blind: their late attempt to procure Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware pilots ſeems to confirm it.</p>
                     <p>I obſerve by your late promotions that a foreign gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is appointed to the command of the German battalion. I could wiſh that he was ordered to join immediately,

                     <p>I AM honoured with yours of the fourth, incloſing ſundry reſolves of Congreſs from the twenty-ninth of March to the fifth inſtant. I am extremely glad to ſee the reſolve for the immediate removal of military ſtores from Baltimore and Annapolis: for, although I do not imagine that the enemy intend an expedition of any great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in Cheſapeak-bay, yet while the ſtores lay at the above-mentioned places, they were always ſubject to be deſtroyed by a ſudden attack of a ſhip of war with a few land forces.</p>
                     <p>The regulations for the pay-maſter-general's department are very ſalutary, and, if carried ſtrictly into execution, will make a vaſt ſaving to the public. It may be eaſily done when the army is put upon a regular footing: but while we are obliged to make uſe of militia, we muſt ſubmit to all the irregularities that naturally attend them, and muſt not therefore expect to have the rule as ſcrupulouſly complied with by them as could be wiſhed. * * *</p>
                     <p>The muſter-maſter-general complained that the duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him was more than he could perform: but by the late reſolves there is an ample allowance for deputies; and therefore no further excuſe can be made upon that head.</p>
                     <p>I moſt ardently wiſh to ſee the hoſpital eſtabliſhed. I am afraid too much time has been loſt in the conſideration
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:029737_0388_0FE24B1C450D0B88"/>
of the plan: but the gentlemen who ſhall be appointed to the ſuperintendence muſt endeavour to make up for loſt time by their diligence.</p>
                     <p>By the lateſt accounts from Brunſwic, it looks as if the enemy were projecting an embarkation. They have been ſtripping the buildings of boards, and cutting ſmall timber, and tranſporting them from Brunſwic to Amboy. It is imagined this is to build births in their tranſports. I ſhall keep a conſtant look-out upon the motions of their veſſels, and ſhall endeavour to obtain every intelligence by ſending people into their quarters. I think Delaware-bay muſt be their deſtination, if they move by water.</p>

                     <p>I WAS juſt now honoured with your letter of the ninth inſtant, covering ſundry reſolutions of Congreſs. Thoſe for regulating the hoſpital and medical department, I truſt, will prove of the moſt ſalutary conſequences. It is only to be regretted that this neceſſary and liberal inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution had not been gone into and completed at an earlier period.</p>
                     <p>The honours Congreſs have decreed to the memory of generals Warren and Mercer afford me the higheſt pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure: their character and merit had a juſt claim to every mark of reſpect; and I heartily wiſh that every officer of the United States, emulating their virtues, may by their actions ſecure to themſelves the ſame right to the grateful tributes of their country.</p>
                     <p>Since writing to you yeſterday I have received further intelligence of the enemy's preparations in York, indicating a movement before long. It is contained in the incloſed letter, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1, and corroborates the opinion I have long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained that they would make a puſh againſt Philadelphia. The tory regiments mentioned, we are told, are at Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſac, and are about five hundred ſtrong, excluſive of a company of Highlanders which is with them.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed letter from le chevalier count De Vrecourt came to hand this morning,—which I have thought proper
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:029737_0389_0FE299D28050EEC0"/>
to tranſmit to Congreſs, that they may conſider his caſe, and adopt ſuch meaſures reſpecting him as his character and teſtimonials deſerve. I never heard of him before: but if he is a ſkilful engineer, he will be extremely uſeful, and ſhould be employed, though he may not underſtand our language. At this time we have not one with the army, nor one to join it, of the leaſt reputation or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to ſkill. If this gentleman came in conſequence of an agreement with doctor Franklin, and brought creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials from him, I ſhould ſuppoſe him to be acquainted with what he was recommended for.</p>
                     <p>The cartel, propoſed to be ſettled, and ſo long in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not accompliſhed yet: the laſt meeting on that buſineſs was the ſecond inſtant, when nothing was done: nor is a further interview appointed reſpecting it. I have tranſmitted a copy of lord Cornwallis's letter which came out the next day, with that of the paper alluded to by him, which Mr. Harriſon refuſed to receive from colonel Walcot, and of my anſwer to the latter in a letter to general Howe. The objections or articles mentioned by colonel Walcot were thoſe general Greene had with him, and which he left when he came from Philadelphia: the original I have by me. Thoſe points were inſiſted on again, and rejected, and a tender made of the paper by colonel Walcot, which he brought with him prepared.</p>
                     <p>I have appointed John Wilkens, John Steel, Mathew Irvine, and Samuel Kerſley, eſquires, captains of companies to be raiſed by them, in conſequence of the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of general Armſtrong. As the intereſt of thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen lies in Pennſylvania chiefly, and it would be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing money from the pay-maſter here to carry to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, (ſuppoſing there was a ſupply in the cheſt, which is not the caſe) I ſhall be obliged by Congreſs's ordering ſix hundred dollars to be advanced to each of them on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the recruiting ſervice; the firſt of whom I imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine is in Philadelphia. If this requiſition can be complied with, he, I preſume, will give notice to the reſt; or, if general Armſtrong is informed of it, he will do it.</p>

                     <p>I AM honoured with yours of the tenth, accompanied with one from the committee of Congreſs to whom I have wrote very fully upon the ſubject of the reſolve for forming an army upon the weſt ſide of Delawar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to which I refer you. I wiſh I could ſee any proſpect of an army, fit to make proper oppoſition, formed any where. You will perhaps be ſurpriſed at this, after the public reports of the great ſucceſs of recruiting in all the States; but, to convince you that theſe are but bare reports, I will give you the beſt information I have been able to collect from actual returns and other accounts.</p>
                     <p>New-Hampſhire.—No returns: but a letter from gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Heath ſays they are tolerably forward. All their regiments go to the northward.</p>
                     <p>Maſſachuſetts.—About four hundred men raiſed to a regiment; many of theſe yet to undergo inoculation. Seven of their regiments go to the northward, and eight are to come to Peekſkill for the preſent.</p>
                     <p>Rhode-Iſland.—Only three hundred and ſixty men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted in both regiments the firſt of April. Two hundred of theſe are yet to be inoculated. General Varnum writes me that he deſpairs of filling up the regiments.</p>
                     <p>Connecticut.—By a return from general Parſons, of the fourth of April, about eighteen hundred men were recruited through the whole State,—they, much diſperſed;—many to have the ſmall-pox; and recruiting at a ſtand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="unknown:029737_0391_0FE299D55AC706B8"/>
New-York.—About two hundred men to a regiment: and, from the peculiar ſituation of that province, it will be almoſt impoſſible for them to fill up their regiments though they exert themſelves very much.</p>
                     <p>New-Jerſey.—Between two and three hundred to a regiment. They alſo lie under many difficulties on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the diſaffection of their State: but their officers are active and diligent.</p>
                     <p>Pennſylvania.—Moſt of her regiments are very back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; thoſe moſt ſo who have been longeſt recruiting.</p>
                     <p>Delaware State.—No return of their regiment.</p>
                     <p>Maryland.—I have only the return of one regiment, which conſiſts of two hundred men; but I do not believe the others are in more forwardneſs. The diſputes about the rank of officers have prevailed ſo much, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting ſervice has been in a manner neglected.</p>
                     <p>Virginia.—The nine old regiments will not exceed eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred effective men: and governor Henry, in a letter which I received yeſterday, informs me that he did not think that more than four of the ſix new ones would be filled. He propoſes the expediency of raiſing volunteer companies to ſerve ſeven or eight months, to make up the deficiency: but this I ſhall object to on many accounts, particularly that it would be introducing a body of men who would look upon themſelves at liberty to do what they pleaſed, and, the moment their time expired, would leave us, though at the moſt critical juncture.</p>
                     <p>If the men that are raiſed, few as they are, could be got into the field, it would be a matter of ſome conſolation; but every method that I have been able to deviſe has prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ineffectual. If I ſend an officer to collect the ſick and ſcattered of his regiment, it is ten to one but he neglects his duty, goes home on pleaſure or buſineſs, and the next that I hear of him is that he has reſigned:—furloughs are no more attended to than if there was no limitation of time: and in ſhort, Sir, there is ſuch a total depreſſion of that mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary ardour which I hoped would have inſpired every of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer when he found his pay genteelly augmented, and the army put upon a reſpectable footing, that it ſeems to me as if all public ſpirit was ſunk. * * *</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="unknown:029737_0392_0FE24B7004062AA8"/>
I ſhall as ſoon as poſſible tranſmit to the board of war a liſt of the appointments I have made in conſequence of the powers veſted in me.</p>
                     <p>If the appointments in the hoſpital are not filled up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the receipt of this, I would take the liberty of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning a gentleman whom I think highly deſerving of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, not only on account of his abilities, but for the very great aſſiſtance which he has afforded in the courſe of this winter, merely in the nature of a volunteer. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is doctor John Cochran, well known to all the faculty, and particularly to doctor Shippen, who, I ſuppoſe, has mentioned him among the candidates. The place for which the doctor is well fitted, and which would be moſt agreeable to him, is ſurgeon-general to the middle depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In this line he ſerved all the laſt war in the Britiſh ſervice, and has diſtinguiſhed himſelf this winter, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his attention to the ſmall-pox patients and the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who, but for him and doctor Bond, muſt have ſuffered much, if not been totally neglected, as there were no other medical gentlemen to be found. If the appointment of ſurgeon-general is filled up, that of deputy-director of the middle department would be acceptable.</p>
                     <p>I have been thus full in my recommendation becauſe doctor Cochran in a manner had my promiſe of one of the capital appointments in the hoſpital, upon a preſumption that I ſhould have had ſome hand in the nomination by the reſolution of Congreſs empowering me to fill all commiſſions under the rank of brigadiers-general.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>April</hi> 13.—I have this moment received a line from general Lincoln, informing me that the enemy attempted to ſurpriſe him early this morning at his poſt at Bound-brook; but he made good his retreat to the paſs of the mountains juſt in his rear, with trifling loſs.</p>

An enterpriſe of a ſimilar nature was formed againſt that at Amboy, in which the party ſent to effect it did not ſucceed ſo well, though the moſt advanced of them ſeized and ſecured three of their out-centries without giving an alarm.</p>
                     <p>By a letter from general M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal, of yeſterday, I am informed that he had received accounts of thirty-ſix ſail of tranſports having left Newport on Friday laſt, with troops on board. Other reports he had were that a number of ſhips were coming up the Sound, ſo that we may reaſonably conclude general Howe is drawing his forces from the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. General Arnold, in a letter of the ſixth, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, from the preparation of tranſports, and other circumſtances, he thought it probable an embarkation was about to take place.</p>
                     <p>There are grounds to ſuſpect, from information received, that ſome unfair practices have been and are meant to be uſed in certain exports from Philadelphia. It is ſaid that a veſſel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>avigated by Frenchmen loaded there, belonging to * * * of New-York, which carried her cargo to gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Howe; alſo that * * * and * * * of Monmouth-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty intend to load one or more for the ſame purpoſe, under the idea of ſending them to foreign markets. I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the board of war for Pennſylvania upon the ſubject,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:029737_0394_0FE24B718A5F3660"/>
and doubt not but theſe hints will be properly improved, and ſuch frauds guarded againſt as well as circumſtances will admit.</p>
                     <p>I have incloſed a copy of an advertiſement publiſhed in Gaine's paper of the fourteenth, which ſhews that no arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are left untried by the enemy to injure us. Before the appearance of this unparalleled piece, I had heard that a perſon was gone from York to Rhode-Iſland with a quantity of counterfeit money.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing which I beg leave to mention to Congreſs, and which I think highly deſerving their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, that ſupplies of hard money, or bills of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to procure it, ſhould, if poſſible, be ſent to our priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners in the hands of the enemy, at leaſt to the officers, to relieve their wants. By letters which I have received from them of late, I find they are in great diſtreſs, and ſuch as ought to be removed, if it can be done. No inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will reſult to the public from ſuch ſupplies, if they can be furniſhed, as proper ſtoppages and deductions can be made from their pay.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>April</hi> 19.—I was honoured with your letter of the ſixteenth between twelve and one o'clock yeſterday, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by ſundry reſolutions. I hope the meaſures Congreſs have adopted will produce the ſalutary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences they had in view: but I fear that the States, unleſs they are delicate in exerciſing the powers they are inveſted with for filling vacancies in inſtances of removal from office, and pay ſtrict attention to a proper line of ſucceſſion where there are no capital objections, will renew much of that confuſion and diſorder we have been endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring to extricate ourſelves from. Nor will this be of ſmall difficulty, if they diſplace many officers: for, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to have kept the moſt accurate liſts of their orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal appointments, changes have taken place in ſeveral inſtances from various cauſes unknown to them, and of which they cannot be appriſed.</p>
                     <p>I can aſſure Congreſs the appellation given to the reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iments officered by me was without my conſent or privity. As ſoon as I heard it, I wrote to ſeveral of the officers in terms of ſevere reprehenſion, and expreſsly charged them to ſuppreſs the diſtinction, adding that all the battalions
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:029737_0395_0FE299D8649CC5B0"/>
were on the ſame footing, and all under the general name of Continental.</p>
                     <p>An attack upon the king's troops at Rhode-Iſland was certainly a deſirable event, could it have been conducted with ſucceſs, or upon equal terms. It being an object of great moment, and involving in its iſſue many important conſequences, I am led to believe the practicability of it has had much conſideration, and the meaſure was found to be unadviſeable under the circumſtances of the troops collected for the purpoſe. If the enemy have not evac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated the iſland, I ſuppoſe the matter will be further weighed.</p>
                     <p>I do not find in the medical arrangement any mention of regimental ſurgeons'-mates, or proviſion made for their payment. Whether Congreſs mean to diſpenſe with ſuch officers or not, I cannot tell: I have heard that they do: but they appear to me to be abſolutely neceſſary. We are often obliged to divide regiments and ſend a part to a diſtant poſt: when this is the caſe, it is eſſential that there ſhould be ſome perſon with them to take charge of the ſick or wounded, if ſuch there ſhould be. I have only mentioned this of many reaſons that might be urged to ſhew the expediency of ſuch appointments.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the many circumſtances inducing a belief that Philadelphia will be the firſt object of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's attention,—yet, as the ſtratagems of war are various, and they may be eaſily changed, eſpecially when they have the entire command of the water,—I cannot but conſider the detention of the troops at Philadelphia, farther than mentioned in my letter in anſwer to that from the board of war, as inexpedient, and ſubject to great inconvenience and injury. In the preſent divided, ſeparated ſtate of the army, we are weak at all points, and not able to make the leaſt oppoſition promiſing ſucceſs. Suppoſing they were collected here, they would be ready to act as neceſſity and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might require. If the enemy puſhed for Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, we ſhould have notice of it, and could hang upon their flank and rear: nor is it likely they would undertake ſuch an expedition without attempting the deſtruction or diſperſion of the army firſt. If they embarked and ſhould go by ſea, we ſhould have information of it, and could be
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:029737_0396_0FE24B730FF88810"/>
there in time. On the other hand, ſhould all they have done prove a feint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they ſhould turn their views to the North-river, we ſhould be in a much better ſituation to counteract their deſigns, and to check the progreſs of their arms in that quarter. Added to this, ſeveral of the reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iments, eſpecially thoſe which came firſt from Virginia and Pennſylvania, are ſo broken that it is impoſſible to do any thing with the parts that are here; and that ſpirit which is always derived from a corps being full, or as much ſo as circumſtances of number will admit of, is entirely done away.</p>

                     <p>I WAS laſt night honoured with your letter of the twenty-fifth, with ſundry reſolves of Congreſs. Such of them as are neceſſary for my government and conduct I ſhall ſtrictly attend to.</p>
                     <p>The money and bills for our priſoners had better be tranſmitted to Elias Boudinot, eſquire, to whom I ſhall give directions to adopt ways and means for ſending the ſame, and for a proper appropriation and diſtribution of the money amongſt them. Bills, I think, will be moſt eligible, provided they are duly paid. As to procuring clothes in New-York, I have reaſon to believe that it will not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and that the priſoners, will obtain no ſupplies but what we ſend them.</p>
                     <p>I heard of Mr. Franklin's practices ſome time ago, and adviſed governor Trumbull of the ſame, that his conduct might be properly attended to. It is very unhappy for us that, through the intrigues of ſuch men, the enemy have found means to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I LAST night received the favour of your letter of the twenty-ſixth, with the reſolves to which it alludes.</p>
                     <p>The views of Congreſs, in ſending general officers to the eaſtward to haſten on the troops, have been long an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated: general Poor is in New-Hampſhire for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,—general Heath in Maſſachuſetts-Bay, with the brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adiers Nixon, Glover and Patterſon,—general Varnum in Rhode-Iſland, and general Parſons in Connecticut. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erals Spencer and Arnold too have been deſired to attend to the buſineſs. To theſe gentlemen I have wrote repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly in the moſt preſſing terms upon the ſubject, and I have no reaſon to doubt but every exertion on their part has been employed to promote the end. The delay of thoſe who have enliſted has ariſen from the late period when they engaged, and from their being inoculated ſince, which could not be diſpenſed with, without ſubjecting them to the calamities and ravage of the ſmall-pox in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way.</p>
                     <p>At three o'clock this morning I received a letter from general M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal incloſing three from colonel Huntington, copies of the whole of which I have tranſmitted. By theſe
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:029737_0399_0FE299E3B4880368"/>
you will perceive the impreſſion which a part of general Howe's army has made into Connecticut, and the proſpect they had of deſtroying ſuch of our ſtores as were depoſited in Danbury, which unfortunately were but too large and conſiderable, if the event has taken place. A circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, perhaps more to be regretted, is that the enemy marched through a ſtrong and rough country, and were near that place, without the ſmalleſt oppoſition. I have no other information upon the ſubject than what theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers contain: but we have little ground to expect that they have not accompliſhed their purpoſe. Further intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence will be probably received to-day or to-morrow, when I ſhall be happy to hear that they have paid for their enterpriſe. Of this, I confeſs however, I am not very ſanguine in my expectations.</p>
                     <p>This poſt had been conſidered as a proper depoſitory for ſtores, by gentlemen acquainted with it; and its ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not thought queſtionable whilſt troops were paſſing through it. I had alſo directed that as many of the draughts in Connecticut as the place was capable of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating, ſhould be collected there and inoculated, to anſwer the purpoſe of a guard, hoping by the time of their recovery, that the ſituation of the army would be ſuch as to admit a ſtrong one to be ſtationed there and continued: but, unhappily for us, ſuch languor and ſupineneſs prevails every where, that we ſeem unable to effect any point we wiſh, though never ſo important and intereſting. So ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the ſixth of March, I wrote to governor Trumbull, earneſtly requeſting two thouſand militia to be ſent to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal to be employed at Peekſkill and on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication in Weſt-Cheſter county for ſix weeks. With this requiſition he moſt readily complied ſo far as his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were neceſſary, and (I am certain) his influence would extend. This I have repeated, and this ſupply he has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted himſelf to furniſh: yet ſo ineffectual have his endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours been, that not more than eight hundred had come out by general M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal's return on the ſeventeenth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; nor did he expect more, from the accounts he had. In a word, Sir, no expedient or pains have been unattempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me to bring on troops, and to keep our affairs on a favourable footing.</p>

                        <pb n="62" facs="unknown:029737_0400_0FE24B7E3B5583A0"/>
I would again mention the caſe of our priſoners with the enemy, and pray that the ſecret committee would ſend to Mr. Boudinot ſupplies of money for them as early as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. They are in great diſtreſs, and many officers have lately eſcaped, contrary to the tenor of their parole; ſome of whom are now here, urging that neceſſity compelled them to the meaſure.</p>

The brigadiers gone there for the preſent are Fermoy, Poor, Patterſon and Learned.

but left the matter to major-general Heath, who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in general terms to purſue ſuch meaſures as ſeemed moſt likely to promote the ſervice.</p>
                     <p>The colonels appointed to the New-Hampſhire regiments I never knew. Thoſe ordered to Ticonderoga from Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts by general Heath, and who I preſume have marched, were Bailey, Weſſon, Jackſon, Marſhall, Brewer-Bradford and Francis. What proportions of their regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have marched, I cannot aſcertain: but I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded they were detached as faſt as they were raiſed, and circumſtances would admit. Francis's, the firſt of April, was returned five hundred ſtrong; and, by a letter from colonel Marſhall about the fifteenth of laſt month, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to march in a day or two with the laſt diviſion of his regiment that was ready, which would make about four hundred, including thoſe who had gone. The remainder (about ſixty) were to follow with the proper officers as ſoon as they were fit—they having been inoculated.</p>
                     <p>I have written to generals M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal and Clinton to have the proviſion removed from Derby, &amp;c. and directed that they ſhould point out proper places for its reception in Ulſter; alſo that ſmall works and guards of militia will be eſſential for its protection. * * *</p>
                     <p>The damage we ſuſtained at Danbury, nor the enemy's loſs, have not been tranſmitted with any accuracy: but, from the lateſt accounts from thence, the former was not ſo great, and the latter more conſiderable, than was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended at firſt.</p>
                     <p>I congratulate Congreſs upon the fortunate arrival of the Amphitrite with military and ordnance ſtores:—it is an important event. That of the French ſhip at Boſton, and of the ſloop from Martinique, added to the capture of the two proviſion ſhips, are to be regarded as intereſting too. I would here take the liberty to mention that I think all the military and ordnance ſtores ſhould be moved without a moment's delay to Springfield or ſome interior part of the country. Springfield ſhould be the place, becauſe the elab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oratory is there, and they will be more convenient to uſe as exigences require. In their preſent ſituation their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity is queſtionable; and, if an attack ſhould be made in the eaſtern quarter, their loſs is much to be apprehended.
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:029737_0402_0FE24B7FD6694248"/>
Before I quit this ſubject, I would beg leave to obſerve alſo that the diſpoſal and direction of military ſtores ſhould be only with one body or with one perſon. At preſent this power is exerciſed through ſo many channels, that much confuſion is introduced; and it cannot be avoided: nor will it be poſſible that matters in this line ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted with any degree of propriety, unleſs Congreſs come into ſome regulations reſpecting them. The incloſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of a letter from general Heath will prove the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. Many other inſtances might be mentioned, were it neceſſary.</p>

                     <p>I could wiſh ſome means could be deviſed to cauſe more frequent deſertions of <hi>[the enemy's]</hi> troops.

                     <p>I WAS this morning honoured with your letter of the third inſtant, with its incloſures. General Arnold's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion gives me much pleaſure. He has certainly diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, in every inſtance where he has had an opportunity, much bravery, activity and enterpriſe. But what will be done about his rank?—He will not act moſt probably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe he commanded but a few weeks ago.</p>
                     <p>I truſt the appointment of Mr. Ludwick as ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of bakers will have the ſalutary conſequences you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I have been long aſſured that many abuſes have been
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:029737_0403_0FE299E6BA851828"/>
committed for want of ſome proper regulations in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment.</p>
                     <p>By major Troop, one of general Gates's aides, and who left Albany on Tueſday laſt, I am informed the accounts of general Carleton's approach towards Ticonderoga were premature. He ſays general Gates received a letter before he came away, from brigadier-general Wayne, of the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-fourth ultimo, in which he mentioned nothing of it;—that three thouſand troops had arrived there, all in high ſpirits and health, except nine;—and that that poſt could never be carried without the loſs of much blood. The proceedings of Congreſs and your letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo were the firſt and only information I had of Mr. Carleton's being on the lake, having heard nothing upon the ſubject from general Gates or any other perſon.</p>
                     <p>In my laſt I mentioned that ſixteen dollars bounty were given by general Howe to deſerters with arms. I have reaſon to believe from information received ſince, and which ſeems to be generally credited, that he has advanced the bounty to twenty-four dollars.</p>
                     <p>It is much to be wiſhed that our printers were more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet in many of their publications. We ſee, almoſt in ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery paper, proclamations or accounts tranſmitted by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy, of an injurious nature. If ſome hint or caution could be given them on the ſubject, it might be of material ſervice.</p>
                     <p>By a perſon who has juſt arrived here, it is reported that general Wooſter is dead of his wounds.</p>
                     <p>I would mention to Congreſs that in a day or two our military cheſt will be exhauſted. I beg that a ſupply may be forwarded as ſoon as poſſible: if there ſhould be a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, we ſhall have many things to apprehend.</p>

                     <p>THIS will be delivered you by colonel Conway<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an Iriſh gentleman in the ſervice of France, who came paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger in the Amphitrite, and was introduced to me yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, by a letter from Mr. Deane and one from general Heath, copies of which are tranſmitted.</p>
                     <p>This gentleman waits on Congreſs to obtain an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in the army of the States, and, from Mr. Deane's recommendation, is an officer of merit. He ſays no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular command was agreed on between him and Mr. Deane; nor does he wiſh otherwiſe than that Congreſs ſhould exerciſe their own diſcretion: at the ſame time he obſerves that it will be mortifying to him to hold a rank under that of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I cannot pretend to ſpeak of colonel Conway's merits or abilities, of my own knowledge, having had but little opportunity to be acquainted with him. From what I can diſcover, he appears to be a man of candour: and if he has been in ſervice as long as he ſays he has, I ſhould ſuppoſe him infinitely better qualified to ſerve us, than many who have been promoted, as he ſpeaks our language. He ſeems extremely anxious to return to camp, as the campaign may be expected to become active every day; and wiſhes Congreſs to determine whatever command they may think proper to honour him with, as ſoon as they ſhall think it expedient.</p>

                     <p>THE incloſed is copy of a letter which was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me by monſieur Mottin de la Balme, from Silas Deane, eſquire. For a more particular account of his merit and ſervices, I muſt refer you to himſelf. I have ſounded him as to his expectations, and find that nothing under a lieutenant-colonelcy of horſe will content him.
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029737_0405_0FE299F18DA3ED98"/>
If you ſhould, from his own account, or from what you can collect from others, think proper to confer this rank upon him, there is no vacancy in any other corps except that of colonel Sheldon.</p>
                     <p>I am afraid we ſhall never be able to find places va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, equal to the expectations of the French gentlemen who are now here, much leſs for thoſe that will follow.

Indeed it is not to be imagined that a gentleman and an old ſoldier can ſubmit to be commanded by a perſon in this country, whom he remembers to have been his inferior in France. I know not how we can remedy this evil, or put a ſtop to the growth of it, but by being very circumſpect for the future, on whom we confer rank above that of a ſubaltern.</p>

                     <p>SINCE I had the honour of addreſſing you on the fifth inſtant nothing material has occurred.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed you will be pleaſed to receive a general return of our forces in Jerſey, the ſixth inſtant, which is the firſt I have been able to obtain with any degree of accuracy.</p>
                     <p>I have not heard from general De Haas ſince his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion. As ſoon as I was informed of it, I wrote and requeſted him to repair to camp: but, having received no anſwer, I am apprehenſive my letter miſcarried. I wiſh Congreſs to give him notice of his appointment, and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to join the army, if he accepts his commiſſion and is not prevented by indiſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>Through the board of war I have been favoured with a copy of general Gates's letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo. Hudſon's-river and the paſſes in the Highlands I always conſidered as objects of great importance, and accordingly have provided for their ſecurity in the beſt manner my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could direct, and the circumſtances of the army admit.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:029737_0406_0FE299988C044F28"/>
If they are leſs ſecure than we wiſh them to be, it is owing to our inability, and not to inattention. I have written to general M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal, and will do it again, to employ much of his care upon this ſubject. War, in theory, and the modes of defence, are obvious and eaſy; but, in practice, they are more difficult. Unhappily for us, the means in our power do not always accord with our wiſhes or what would be our intereſt to purſue.</p>
                     <p>As yet none of the eaſtern troops have paſſed the North-river, except two ſmall detachments from Connecticut and Rhode-Iſland, amounting to about two hundred and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which miſſed my orders till they had got over. The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> I ſhall ſend back after we are more reinforced, unleſs the movements of the enemy in this quarter make their detention neceſſary. The reſt of the eaſtern troops which have marched (except the ſeven regiments from Massachuſetts and three from New-Hampſhire, ordered immediately to Ticonderoga) are at and on their way to Peekſkill, as mentioned in my letter of the third—where they are to remain with all the York troops except Vanſchaick's and Ganſevoort's now at the northward, till general Howe's deſigns and intended operations are better underſtood. This diſpoſition appearing to me and my general officers the beſt that could be made in our ſtate of uncertainty, was adopted. The two troops of horſe, recommended by Congreſs to be ſent to general Gates, ſhall go as ſoon as circumſtances will admit. At preſent we have not more than are conſtantly employed at the different poſts.</p>
                     <p>General Heath, in a letter of the thirtieth ultimo, mentions that the military cheſt at the eaſtward is exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that a ſupply will be wanted much to defray the expenſes which will ariſe on the removal of the military and ordnance ſtores to Springfield. He ſays Mr. Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock was to write upon the ſubject, and requeſted I would alſo mention it to Congreſs in my firſt letter.</p>
                     <p>Accounts have been frequently exhibited of late by the officers, reſpecting ſubſiſtence whilſt recruiting and on their march. As I do not recollect the proviſion Congreſs have made in ſuch caſes, I wiſh to be informed, and to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with a copy of their ſeveral reſolves upon the ſubject.</p>

                     <p>THIS will be delivered you by general Arnold, who arrived here to-day in his way to Philadelphia. He ſeems to be anxious to ſettle his public accounts which are of conſiderable amount, and waits on Congreſs, hoping they will appoint a committee of their body, or of such gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as they ſhall judge proper, to take the matter into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. This he conſiders the more neceſſary, as he has heard ſome reports have been propagated, injurious to his character as a man of integrity. If any ſuch aſperſions lie againſt him, it is but reaſonable that he ſhould have an opportunity of vindicating himſelf and evincing his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
                     <p>I find he does not conſider the promotion Congreſs have been pleaſed to confer upon him ſufficient to obviate the neglect ariſing from their having omitted him in their late appointments of major-generals. He obſerves it does not give him the rank he had a claim to from ſeniority in the line of brigadiers, and that he is ſubject to be commanded by thoſe who had been inferior to him. He further adds, that Congreſs, in their laſt reſolve reſpecting him, have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him competent to the ſtation of major-general, and therefore have done away every objection implied by their former omiſſion. Theſe conſiderations are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their weight, though I pretend not to judge what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives may have influenced the conduct of Congreſs upon this occaſion. It is needleſs to ſay any thing of this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's military character: it is univerſally known that he has always diſtinguiſhed himſelf as a judicious, brave officer, of great activity, enterpriſe and perſeverance.</p>

                     <p>The conduct of two many officers in withholding the pay of their ſoldiers, I am perſuaded, is reprehenſible, and has been the cauſe of uneaſineſs and of many deſertions. Every meaſure in my power will be exerted to prevent ſuch abuſes in future, and every aid given to puniſh the offenders in an exemplary manner. But Congreſs will excuſe me when I tell them it will be impoſſible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their recommendation upon this ſubject, unleſs the general officers withdraw their attention from matters of the utmoſt importance, and ſuch as require their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant care. Were this not the caſe, the diſperſed ſituation of the officers at this time through the different States on the recruiting ſervice would prohibit the inquiry.

Such officers will be proper to ſtate the accounts in the firſt inſtance, and to receive vouchers, &amp;c. but will not do to ſettle them final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as their connexions with the regiments will ſubject them much to the influence of the officers.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould ſuppoſe, if two or three gentlemen of integrity and of ability in accounts, were appointed auditors to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the army till the buſineſs is finiſhed, it would be the beſt expedient that could be fallen on. They would be a check on the pay-maſters, and, I am perſuaded, will be the means of the accounts being fairly and juſtly liquidated. If a ſettlement can be once obtained, I truſt the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion will never take place again, as the pay-maſters will receive and pay all money due to the regiments, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it, and as the army is on a more permanent footing than it ever was before: for this, like moſt other inconveniences and difficulties which we have experienced, is to be imputed in a great meaſure to ſhort enliſtments and the frequent diſſolution of our troops.</p>
                     <p>A return of the army in Jerſey, as late as the ſixth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, I tranſmitted yeſterday morning in a letter by Mr.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:029737_0409_0FE299F49847D200"/>
Randolph of Cheſnut-ſtreet, which you will probably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to-day, and from which Congreſs will be able to determine the expediency of calling out the militia from Delaware and Pennſylvania. Though it gives me pain that we ſhould be under the neceſſity of recurring to ſuch a meaſure, yet I ſhould ſuppoſe it to be adviſeable. Our army is weak, and by no means equal to that of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and, till their deſigns are known and we are more reinforced with regular troops, we ſhould be prepared in the beſt manner we can. I would obſerve, if the militia are called out, it ſhould be for a fixed determinate time: for, though they will certainly return when that expires, yet that is more tolerable than for them to go off in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties every day, as their whim and caprice ſuggeſt,—which has always been the caſe when the time was not ſtated. I would alſo obſerve, if it is poſſible, they ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to march out of their States if ordered. If their ſervice is located, they will move with great reluctance, if they do at all.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday a ſmart ſkirmiſh happened with a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our troops who attacked a number of the enemy near Piſcatawa, in which our men behaved well, and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the enemy to give way twice (as reported to me) with loſs. The enemy receiving a ſtrong reinforcement, our people retreated to their poſt. I cannot give the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as they have not been ſufficiently aſcertained. Their piquets were alſo attacked yeſterday by ſome of our parties from Boundbrook, and forced within their lines.</p>

I fear it will be hardly poſſible to ſatisfy the views and claims of ſome of the French gentlemen. The late pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of monſieur Malmady, though highly honourable, and ſuch as ſhould be conſidered fully if not more than adequate to his pretenſions taken upon any principle, does not come up to his demands. He arrived here yeſterday morning, and has been writing to me upon the ſubject. From the high marks of diſtinction but too readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon theſe men in many inſtances, they ſeem to have loſt ſight of what is juſt and reaſonable. It would have been happy for us, particularly for me and for the gentlemen themſelves, if a too eaſy grant of favours had not induced them to contemn all rank in our army under that of field-officers:—nor is it in my power to give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to every appointment. I ſhall inform monſieur Armand (and reconcile him to it in the beſt manner I can) that there is no vacancy for him at preſent: and I would beg leave to ſuggeſt, that, where promotions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I BEG leave to inform Congreſs, that, immediately after the receipt of their reſolve of the twenty-ſixth of March, recommending the office of adjutant-general to be filled by the appointment of a perſon of abilities and unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected attachment to our cauſe, I wrote to colonel Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Pickering of Salem, offering him the poſt in the firſt inſtance, and tranſmitting at the ſame time a letter for col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel William Lee, whom Congreſs had been pleaſed to mention, to be delivered him in caſe my offer could not be accepted. This conduct, in preference of colonel Picker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I was induced to adopt from the high character I had of him, both as a great military genius cultivated by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious attention to the ſtudy of war, and as a gentleman of liberal education, diſtinguiſhed zeal, and great method and activity in buſineſs. This character of him I had from gentlemen of diſtinction and merit, and on whoſe judgment I could rely.</p>
                     <p>When my letter reached colonel Pickering, at firſt view he thought his ſituation in reſpect to public affairs would not permit him to accept the poſt. That for colonel Lee he ſent immediately to him, who, in conſequence of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to head-quarters. By colonel Lee I received a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from colonel Pickering, ſtating more particularly the
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:029737_0412_0FE299A6D14088D0"/>
cauſes which prevented him accepting the office when it was offered, and aſſuring me that he would in a little time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate his affairs in ſuch a manner as to come into any military poſt in which he might be ſerviceable, and thought equal to.</p>
                     <p>Here I am to mark with peculiar ſatisfaction, in juſtice to colonel Lee who has deſervedly acquired the reputation of a good officer, that he expreſſed a diſtruſt of his abilities to fill the appointment intended for him; and, on hearing that colonel Pickering would accept it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e not only offered but wiſhed to relinquiſh his claim to it in favour of him, whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e declared he conſidered, from a very intimate and friendly acquaintance, as a firſt military character; and that he knew no gentleman better or ſo well qualified for the poſt among us. Matters being thus circumſtanced, and colonel Lee pleaſed with the command he was in, I wrote to colonel Pickering on his return, who accepted the office, and is daily expected.</p>
                     <p>In this buſineſs I beg Congreſs to be aſſured, though col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Lee was poſtponed in the firſt inſtance, their recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation had its due weight; and that no motive, other than a regard to the ſervice, induced me to prefer colonel Pickering. His acknowledged abilities and equal zeal—without derogating from the merits of colonel Lee who holds a high place in my eſteem—gave him a preference; and I flatter myſelf the cauſe will be promoted in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, eſpecially as we ſhall have two good officers in lieu of one, who, I am perſuaded, will do honour to themſelves in the line in which they move.</p>
                     <p>Conſidering the paſſes through the Highlands of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt importance to ſecure, I ſent generals Greene and Knox about a fortnight ago to ſee what had been done for their defence, and to conſult with the general officers they ſhould meet, upon ſuch further meaſures as might be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neceſſary for their greater ſafety. The incloſed copy of their report will fully convey their ſentiments upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; to which I beg leave to refer Congreſs. I have ſent general Putnam to command in that quarter, and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him to uſe every poſſible means in his power for expediting and effecting the works and obſtructions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the report. Fearing that the cables might not
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:029737_0413_0FE299FE9FC70668"/>
be procured in time, I have directed his particular and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate attention to fixing the boom. However, as the cables would render that more ſecure, and will be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerviceable in the opinion of the officers—if they are to be had in Philadelphia, I would adviſe Congreſs to order them to be purchaſed and forwarded without loſs of time: they cannot be got elſewhere. They muſt be proportioned to the width of the river, which is about five hundred and forty yards; and, as they will be of moſt uſe if diagonally laid, the gentlemen think they ſhould not be leſs than four hundred and fifty fathoms long, and of the largeſt ſize that can be had. Unleſs they are large and ſubſtantial, they will anſwer no purpoſe, and will not ſuſtain their weight when ſtretched.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould be glad to know whether it be the intention of Congreſs that one of the already-appointed general officers may be aſſigned to the command of the light-horſe, or wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they have in contemplation the appointing of one for this purpoſe: if the firſt, I ſhall immediately name one to that duty; if the ſecond, they will be pleaſed to chooſe one, as it is time we ſhould have our arrangements complete.</p>
                     <p>I have nothing of importance to communicate, unleſs it is that ſeventeen ſhips are ſaid to have arrived at New-York on the twenty-ſecond, and that others were in the offing. A report has alſo prevailed, and has come through two or three channels, that governor Tryon (that was) is dead of the wound he received in the Danbury expedition: and one account is that lieutenant-colonel Walcot fell in the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Ridgefield. I do not know how far the facts are to be depended on:—it ſeems certain that Mr. Tryon was wounded.</p>

                     <p>THE incloſed is a copy of a letter received yeſterday from general Howe. Congreſs will perceive, by referring to the copy of his letter of the twenty-firſt of April tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in mine of the twenty-ſixth, that he perſevered in his demand for an equal number of priſoners to be returned for thoſe ſent out by him; which has been the ſubject of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy between us. As general Howe has called upon me again for my final deciſion upon the ſubject, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs are fully poſſeſſed of it, having received tranſcripts of every paper reſpecting it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I wiſh them to take the matter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their earlieſt conſideration, and to inform me as ſoon as they can, whether the grounds on which it has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by me are agreeable to their ideas, and whether my objections are or are not to be departed from. The affair is particularly ſtated in my letter of the ninth ultimo to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Howe, in anſwer to the paper addreſſed to me by lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-colonel Walcot; copies of which were incloſed in my letter to the preſident on the tenth of the ſame month. The diſpute, ſo far as general Lee is concerned, reſts at preſent on their declaring him exchangeable, as other priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are, on the principle of equality of rank; to enſure which, or his ſafety, lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the Heſſian field-officers are detained. The other objection to returning their priſoners is, that a great proportion of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe ſent out by them were not fit ſubjects of exchange when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed, and were made ſo by the ſeverity of their treatment and confinement, and therefore a deduction ſhould be made, from the liſt.</p>
                     <p>Good faith ſeems to require that we ſhould return as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theirs at leaſt as we received effectives from them—I mean ſuch as could be conſidered capable of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed; and perhaps ſound policy, that the agreement ſubſiſting for exchanges ſhould continue. On the other hand it may be ſaid, that our priſoners in general, in the enemy's hands at preſent, will have greater ſecurity by our retaining them, and that general Howe will be leſs apt to relinquiſh any part of his claim, the more the number in our hands is diminiſhed by an exchange.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs I am under great difficulty in this buſineſs. But what is more particularly the cauſe of this application
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:029737_0415_0FE29A019027BA18"/>
is the latter part of the firſt paragraph of the incloſed copy.—<hi>"and for your determination reſpecting the priſoners now here, that I may make my arrangements accordingly."</hi> This is couched in terms of great ambiguity; and I am really at a loſs what interpretation to give it,—whether he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that his conduct reſpecting them ſhall be as I adviſe (this appears more favourable than can well be expected) or that, if the previous demand is not anſwered in a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory manner, he ſhall conſider them on a different foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that on which our former priſoners were, and the agreement totally diſſolved. We are told government of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the priſoners they took to the India company, and they have procured an act diſpenſing with that of the habeas-corpus in particular caſes of perſons ſuppoſed inimical to them, &amp;c. How far they or their commanders may adopt theſe meaſures, remains to be known: I have only mentioned them as they reſpect the general ſubject of my letter.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding my recommendation agreeable to what I conceived to be the ſenſe of Congreſs, lieutenant-colonel Campbell's treatment continues to be ſuch as cannot be juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified either on the principles of generoſity, or ſtrict retal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iation; as I have authentic information, and I doubt not you will have the ſame, that general Lee's ſituation is far from being rigorous or uncomfortable: except his not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing permitted to go at large on parole, he has reaſon to be content with every other circumſtance of his treatment.</p>
                     <p>I am juſt moving to Boundbrook, from whence I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yeſterday morning. On Monday morning a body of the enemy advanced near that poſt. They retreated, on ſeeing a detachment march to meet them. There was ſome firing at long ſhot, but without any great damage. We had only three men ſlightly wounded. What their loſs was, I know not: three of their light-horſe were killed. By advices from the eaſtward, the troops are coming from Rhode-Iſland.</p>

I recollect, when one was aſſigned in the courſe of laſt year to two regiments, the prevailing opinion was, and that founded on a variety of reaſons, that it would not do; and the old mode of appointment was introduced again.</p>
                     <p>General Schuyler's propoſal for raiſing one or two troops of horſe, I think a good one. I intended to write to him upon the ſubject before the receipt of your favour, and ſhall do it by the firſt opportunity.</p>

                     <p>SINCE I did myſelf the honour to write to you the twenty-ninth, I have received the incloſed intelligence. As it comes from a perſon of veracity, and one who is much in the confidence of the enemy, I have no doubt as to the fact of the two brigades having come over from New-York to Amboy, and alſo that a number of waggons have been brought from Staten and Long-Iſland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe accounts are corroborated by information of the ſame kind from ſeveral different quarters. But I do not place ſo much dependence upon the account of the intended attack upon this place, becauſe I think, if ſuch a matter was really in agitation, it would be kept a profound ſecret; I rather am opinion that it is thrown out to deceive. But at any rate, taking it for granted that they are aſſembling their troops and carriages, what can they have in view but a move, either immediately, or when their reinforcement (if they get any) arrives? and if they do move, I can ſee no other object but Philadelphia. It is true they have ſeemed for ſome time paſt to have laid aſide all thoughts of attempting that city by land: but if they had only the attacking this army in contemplation, they would never encumber themſelves with a large train of waggons, which,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:029737_0417_0FE29A03187E37C8"/>
if they were ſucceſsful, would retard them in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, and, if defeated, would be in danger of falling into our hands.</p>
                     <p>I incloſe you an extract of a letter which I received from general Sullivan. If the two India ſhips which have been cut down are gone out to ſea, I ſhould ſuppoſe they are intended for the Delaware, becauſe they are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of performing a rough or long voyage. This, if true, looks if a ſudden correſponding move by land was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; for they will never ſend their ſhips long before their troops.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, you will pleaſe to obſerve, are mere conjectures upon circumſtances: for the actions of the enemy have for a long time paſt been ſo different from appearances, that I hardly dare to form an opinion. But I would wish to profit by every piece of intelligence, and be prepared to ward off every danger that threatens. I would therefore recommend that the Pennſylvania militia, who are aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at Briſtol for the expreſs purpoſe of guarding the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and oppoſing the paſſage of the enemy, ſhould be put under the command of a good general officer, who would ſee that they are kept to their duty, and prepared for a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den emergency. Except this is done, they may as well be at home.</p>
                     <p>I laſt night received a letter from general M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal, an extract of which you have incloſed. By this it appears that a reinforcement is arrived, but whether from Canada or Europe, is uncertain. You will obſerve that he likewiſe mentions, that eight tranſports with foot, and a ſchooner with horſes and hay, had fallen down. We can only form conjectures at preſent of the place of their deſtination: but if they ſtand ſouthward, Philadelphia is the moſt probable place.</p>
                     <p>I have the pleaſure to communicate a very agreeable piece of intelligence which I have received from general Parſons, of the deſtruction of twelve of the enemy's veſſels in Sag-harbour upon the eaſt end of Long-Iſland. I give you his letter at length, which I think reflects high honour upon the conduct and bravery of colonel Meigs, his officers, and men.</p>

                     <p>MONSIEUR Coudray is juſt arrived at camp, and propoſes to ſet out to-morrow for Philadelphia. What his views are, I am uncertain, having had no converſation with him upon the ſubject: but I find an idea prevails that there is an agreement between Mr. Deane and him, that he ſhall have the chief command of the artillery. How well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this opinion may be, I cannot determine: but if it be true, it may involve the moſt injurious conſequences. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Knox, who has deſervedly acquired the character of one of the moſt valuable officers in the ſervice, and who, combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt innumerable difficulties in the department he fills, has placed the artillery upon a footing that does him the greateſt honour—he, I am perſuaded, would conſider him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf injured by an appointment ſuperſeding his command, and would not think himſelf at liberty to continue in the ſervice. Should ſuch an event take place in the preſent ſtate of things, there would be too much reaſon to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend a train of ills, ſuch as might convulſe and unhinge this important department.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſing monſieur Coudray to have made ſuch an agreement, the caſe is of great difficulty, and, in my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, is worthy of the moſt delicate conſideration of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. Yet may not means be ſtill deviſed to ſatisfy this gentleman by appointing him to ſome command not derog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory to his promiſed rank, and which will be agreeable to him? From the recommendations we have had of him, I am obliged to eſteem him of high character, and of great knowledge in what he profeſſes: and, from this conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and the manner in which he is mentioned to us, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that much addreſs and delicacy muſt be uſed, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate matters.</p>
                     <p>Many reaſons, beſides thoſe I have noted, might be aſſigned for continuing general Knox firſt in command in this department, which, on reflection, will readily occur. I would only obſerve, without inſinuating the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſhadow of diſtruſt of monſieur Coudray's honour, candour, or integrity, that, on the general maxims of prudence and policy, it may be queſtioned with much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety whether ſo important a command as that of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery

ſhould be veſted in any but a native, or one attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ties of intereſt to theſe States.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs will be pleaſed to excuſe the freedom I have uſed upon this occaſion, and, I truſt, will impute it to the importance of the ſubject which gave riſe to it.</p>

I wiſh our accounts from that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be happy, if Mr. Carleton makes an attack. The ſhameful deficiency in all our armies affords but too juſt grounds for diſagreeable apprehenſions: if the quotas aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the different States are not immediately filled, we ſhall have every thing to fear. We ſhall never be able to reſiſt their force, if the militia are to be relied on; nor do I know whether their aid, feeble and ineffectual as it is, is much to be expected. Can no expedients be deviſed to complete the regiments, and to rouſe our unthinking countrymen from their lethargy?—If there can, the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of our affairs calls loudly for it.</p>

                     <p>I WOULD take the liberty of addreſſing a few lines to Congreſs on a matter which appears to me of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:029737_0420_0FE299AB9F1B7870"/>
and which is conſidered in the ſame light by many of our officers, and others not in the military line. The ſubject I allude to is the condition of many perſons now with the enemy, who, deluded by their arts and a miſguided attachment to their meaſures, fled from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the States, to find ſecurity with them, and who in many inſtances, are in arms againſt us.</p>
                     <p>It has been ſuggeſted through various channels,—and the ſuggeſtion ſeems to be credited, eſpecially as ſome have already eſcaped,—that many of theſe unhappy people, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their error and the wicked part they have takes, would embrace the earlieſt opportunity of leaving the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and returning among us, were they ſure of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into our friendſhip again, and of enjoying their prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and the rights of citizens.</p>
                     <p>This ſubject, in the conſideration of it, ſtrikes me as important, intereſting, and delicate,—involving many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences worthy of mature deliberation and attention. As ſuch,—and deeming myſelf incompetent to it,—I think it my duty to ſubmit it to Congreſs for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, to take ſuch meaſures therein as they ſhall eſteem neceſſary and right.</p>
                     <p>If theſe people, particularly thoſe in arms, are ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in what has been hinted, and it is their wiſh, or that of any conſiderable part of them, to return,—I ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that it would be expedient, and founded in found policy, to give every ſuitable aſſurance to induce them to come. Such an event would be attended with ſalutary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, would weaken the enemy, diſtreſs them greatly, and would probably have a moſt happy influence in preventing others from joining their arms. On the other hand, the indulgence may be liable to great abuſe, ſuppoſing it not to be duly guarded: or if the effects produced by it ſhould be partial, they will not be adequate to the ends in view. Yet, as the enemy on their part are uſing every device they are capable of, to ſeduce both ſoldiers and citizens from our ſervice into theirs, and have ſucceeded but too well, it is generally thought in the military line that ſomething ſhould be attempted to counteract them. Whether Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will be of the ſame ſentiment, and, if they ſhould, what and how extenſive the mode and indulgence ought to be, is entirely with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="unknown:029737_0421_0FE29A0F25059D88"/>
There is one difficulty that occurs to me, ſuppoſing the meaſure to be adopted. What line of diſcrimination can be drawn upon ſuch an occaſion, though circumſtances ſhould differ and ſeem to require it? While the poor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, ignorant, duped by artifices and a thouſand cauſes to lead them wrong, have a claim to their country's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and indulgence, there are many of well-informed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, who, from their early-avowed hoſtile diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and inveterate diſregard of her rights, and thoſe who have taken a double and triple part, cannot have the ſame pretenſions; whoſe only view in returning may be to ſerve their own ſordid purpoſes, and the better to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote thoſe plans they have ſteadily purſued.</p>
                     <p>One thing more I would obſerve, which is, that if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs judge an adoption of meaſures eligible on the ſubject of my letter, the ſooner it is come into, the better, for the moſt obvious reaſons; and the time allowed for thoſe to return who wiſh the indulgence, ſhould be fixed at a ſhort period,—not longer, in my opinion, than till the<note n="*" place="bottom">Left blank in the original.</note> day of<note n="*" place="bottom">Left blank in the original.</note> next: otherwiſe they may avail themſelves of the circumſtance, and wait events to decide their choice. If any good conſequences are produced, the means can be renewed and further extended.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs will be pleaſed to excuſe me for thus freely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating my ſentiments, eſpecially when I aſſure them that they are dictated by what I eſteem my duty.</p>

I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think, if the meaſure propoſed ſhould be deemed expedient, that it will be better that the indulgencies and aſſurances for their return ſhould be communicated through the medium of ſome ſecond, ſecret hand, qualified to offer them and negociate the buſineſs, rather than by an act of public authority. Opportunities, I ſhould ſuppoſe, may be found, by which they may obtain due information in that way, and which will not hold out to the enemy the ſame cauſe of ſuſpicion and of vigilance to prevent their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping. Whatever mode ſhall be conſidered moſt adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſhould be immediately adopted. What time ſhould
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:029737_0422_0FE299B6DAB50940"/>
be allowed in the firſt inſtance, I am at a loſs to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: if the continuance is too ſhort, there may be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their not being appriſed ſo as to get off: if it is too long, they will defer matters to the laſt, and act then as circumſtances of intereſt dictate. To err in the former will be leaſt injurious.</p>

                     <p>I THIS morning had the honour of your letter of the fifth, with its incloſures. The reſolution of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of May, reſpecting the French gentlemen who came paſſengers in the Amphitrite, reached camp before your letter, and has excited much uneaſineſs in the artillery corps. The incloſed copy of a letter from general Knox will convey their anxiety upon the ſubject,—which I think it neceſſary to tranſmit, as well from duty as on account of his requeſt.</p>
                     <p>The difficulties upon this occaſion ariſe from the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar circumſtances of moſt of the officers compoſing the artillery regiments at this time. I do not know, for my own part, what operation Congreſs preciſely meant the reſolution ſhould have; but if the commiſſions which theſe gentlemen are to receive ſhould give them rank from the date of thoſe they had from the king of France, or from
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029737_0423_0FE1BFADD29873C8"/>
their compact with Mr. Deane, there are but few officers now in the artillery who will not be ſuperſeded in their command, unleſs ſome method is adopted to prevent it. This, I am perſuaded, Congreſs had not in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe it is oppoſed to policy and to juſtice; and I am led to believe the reſolution was come into for want of due information how matters were circumſtanced in this inſtance.</p>
                     <p>The officers now in the artillery I am obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of great merit: experience has proved them to be moſt warmly attached to the rights of their country; and their conduct in the line of their profeſſion has been ſuch as does the higheſt honour to themſelves and the gentleman who immediately commands them. Without derogating in the leaſt from the character of the French officers who are to be commiſſioned, and whom I wiſh to receive every countenance they merit, there is ſtrong reaſon to doubt (laying aſide every conſideration of policy) whether they have ſeen as much real ſervice as our own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the courſe of two campaigns. It would be hard, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſay unjuſt, that the latter ſhould loſe their command when they have a claim to every mark of favour, and after they have taken great pains to form their companies: the ſervice requires that they ſhould not; and I am convinced the event would be attended with the moſt fatal conſequences.</p>
                     <p>But what is to be done? This is a caſe of difficulty, view it as you will. I am not for rejecting the French gentlemen:—far otherwiſe—I am for employing them: and public faith, and the encouragements given to bring them over, demand that it ſhould be done. After much thought and conſideration upon the ſubject, two modes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to me, as the only poſſible ones by which it can be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and by which the inconveniences I have mentioned can be remedied. One is, that a new corps of artillery ſhould be formed, and theſe gentlemen attached to it. This, we have reaſon to fear, cannot be done, from the difficulties we have experienced in raiſing men, and from their having no intereſt or connexions with the people. Their ſituation in ſuch caſe, if they are men of ſentiment and active diſpoſitions, would be irkſome and diſtreſſing. The other is, that our preſent officers now under conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029737_0424_0FE299B85D790370"/>
ſhould have their commiſſions antedated, to give them precedency of rank: and this may be done with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er propriety, as moſt of them were intended to hold the poſts they now ſuſtain, before the French gentlemen had any claim upon us. It is true they were not commiſſioned, becauſe the old corps exiſted under the firſt arrangement. Further it is ſaid—and there is no doubt of the fact—that theſe gentlemen were promoted by brevet juſt before their departure from France, merely to give them rank here; antecedent to which, our officers were ſuperior to them in this point; and theſe brevets only confer local <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>de appears the moſt eligible: if it is adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they will be diſtributed through the corps as aſſiſtant officers. Their want of a knowledge in our language inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitates them for command in the firſt inſtance; and not only ſo, but to place them at the head of companies, over officers that have been at great trouble, pains and expenſe in raiſing the men, would be both unmilitary and unjuſt. I ſhall now quit the ſubject, wiſhing that whatever will beſt conciliate matters and advance the public good, may be done; ſuggeſting at the ſame time, with all deference, as it is much eaſier to prevent evils than to remedy them after they have happened, it will be well, in all caſes of foreign and indeed other applications, that the conſequences, which granting them will involve, ſhould be maturely weighed and taken in every point of view. In the preſent caſe of difficulty, things I am perſuaded, might have been adjuſted with the greateſt facility, had the committee of foreign ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications been fully poſſeſſed of all the circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the artillery regiments.</p>
                     <p>By a letter from general Gates, of the ſecond inſtant, tranſmitting a copy of one from general Poor, the enemy, who were at Split-Rock according to their laſt advices which I forwarded, have returned down the Lake. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Whitcomb had been ſent out to reconnoitre, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported on his return that only one boat remained.</p>
                     <p>From ſundry accounts from New-York, there is reaſon to believe the enemy are on the point of making ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. Their preparation of ſhips for troops, light-horſe, &amp;c. indicates that they intend to go by water. What their
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:029737_0425_0FE29A126EA79A80"/>
object is, yet remains a ſecret. The incloſed copy of an examination is very particular, and as recent as any that I have received. The perſon who gave the information be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Cape-May county, and appeared to be a ſenſible intelligent lad. A deſerter of the ſeventy-firſt this moment came in: you alſo have his examination incloſed.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall order a return to be made of the chaplains in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which ſhall be tranſmitted as ſoon as it is obtained. At preſent, as the regiments are greatly diſperſed, part in one place and part in another, and accurate ſtates of them have not been made, it will not be in my power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it immediately. I ſhall here take occaſion to mention that I communicated the reſolution appointing a brigade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaplain in the place of all others, to the ſeveral brigadiers. They are all of opinion that it will be impoſſible for them to diſcharge the duty; that many inconveniences and much diſſatisfaction will be the reſult; and that no eſtabliſhment appears ſo good in this inſtance as the old one. Among many other weighty objections to the meaſure, it has been ſuggeſted that it has a tendency to introduce religious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes into the army, which, above all things, ſhould be avoided,—and in many inſtances would compel men to a mode of worſhip which they do not profeſs. The old eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment gives every regiment an opportunity of having a chaplain of their own religious ſentiments,—is founded on a plan of a more generous toleration,—and the choice of chaplains to officiate has been generally in the regiments. Suppoſing one chaplain could do the duties of a brigade,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029737_0426_0FE299B9F0E37CD8"/>
(which ſuppoſition however is inadmiſſible when we view things in practice) that being compoſed of four or five per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in ſome inſtances, ſix regiments, there might be ſo many different modes of worſhip. I have mentioned the opinion of the officers and theſe hints to Congreſs upon this ſubject, from a principle of duty, and becauſe I am well aſſured it is moſt foreign to their wiſhes or intention to excite, by any act, the ſmalleſt uneaſineſs and jealouſy among the troops.</p>
                     <p>There remains no room to believe otherwiſe than that the enemy are on the point of moving: this is confirmed by intelligence from all quarters, and through ſo many different channels, that we muſt conſider it certain. Whether they will move by land or water, or by both, cannot be aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nor is their deſtination preciſely known: but every circumſtance points out Philadelphia as their object. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this opinion, I have directed the return of general Mifflin. Before he left Philadelphia, I wrote, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the order for his coming here; but he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my letter. I would alſo mention to Congreſs that I think the military ſtores, lately arrived, and at or coming to Philadelphia, ſhould be removed to a place of perfect ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. Though I would not excite needleſs uneaſy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, prudence requires that things ſo eſſential ſhould not be expoſed to riſk.</p>

                     <p>INCLOSED you will receive a copy of a letter from me to lord Cornwallis, on the inhuman treatment of lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Martin by a party of the enemy's horſe. My re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance and ſending his corpſe produced nothing more than a ſhort anſwer from his lordſhip, which you alſo have. It was thought unneceſſary to view the body, the fact being admitted and juſtified.</p>
                     <p>I have alſo taken the liberty to incloſe a copy of my letter to general Howe, in anſwer to his of the twenty-firſt of April, twenty-ſecond of May, and fifth inſtant. From the latter part of the firſt paragraph in that of the twenty-ſecond
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:029737_0427_0FE29A13F358BEB0"/>
of May, I was induced to propoſe an exchange of all the priſoners now in his hands, ſo far as it can be effected on the principles of the agreement ſubſiſting between us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the Heſſian field-officers who are to be retained till general Lee is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared exchangeable. I did not expect the propoſition would be acceded to: but, as his letter is of doubtful meaning in this inſtance, I thought it expedient to make the offer,—firſt, as it will be a happy event if we releaſe our priſoners,—and ſecondly, as the propoſition may draw from him an explanation of his ſentiments, though he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it.</p>
                     <p>The New-York paper of the ninth inſtant I tranſmit for your peruſal: it contains an extract of a letter from gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Tryon to Chriſtopher Billop of Long-Iſland. This extract, I think, is worthy of attention, and may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to great advantage if publiſhed in the papers with ſuch ſtrictures and obſervations as it will well warrant, and as will occur to an ingenious pen. The enemy, on their part, uſe the moſt artful publications, and avail themſelves of every thing they can, going from us. We ſhould prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, where we can, by their productions.</p>
                     <p>I would mention to Congreſs that ſeveral officers in the corps of cavalry have applied to me, to know in what point of view their horſes are conſidered—whether as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic property, or as private belonging to themſelves, to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at their own expenſe. When colonel Sheldon's regiment was ordered to be raiſed, the officers thought the horſes ſhould be a matter of public charge: but as it had never been determined, and I was not perfectly ſatisfied with the cuſtom in ſuch caſes, I did not conſider myſelf authoriſed to decide upon it. I promiſed to recommend it to the conſideration of Congreſs; and this I have done ſince on ſimilar occaſions. The officers urge, that, as horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are eſſential to the diſcharge of their duty, they ſhould be provided at the public expenſe; that they have riſen to ſuch enormous prices, that, if the contrary is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they muſt, from the nature of the ſervice, not only ſink their pay, but make a large ſacrifice of their private intereſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="unknown:029737_0428_0FE299BB75598C08"/>
Though the practice may have been againſt their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in other armies, yet their reaſoning ſeems plauſible and to be founded in juſtice. There are objections too againſt the meaſure, but not of ſufficient validity, in my opinion, to oppoſe to their claim. Another reaſon may be ſuggeſted, why the public ſhould find them horſes; which is, that if they were to provide them themſelves, the apprehenſion of loſing them might prevent a proper diſcharge of duty, and in ſome caſes produce too great a degree of cautious prudence.</p>
                     <p>This matter I have thought it neceſſary to lay before Congreſs, not doubting but it will have that attention which it may ſeem to deſerve. There is one thing more I would add upon the ſubject, which is, if their application is conſidered juſt, I ſhould ſuppoſe it beſt to fix a certain determinate ſum to be allowed for the horſes they have brought and may have occaſion to purchaſe, in preference to leaving it to their diſcretion and judgment.</p>
                     <p>It being evident, ſo far as we can reaſon from circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and appearances, that general Howe deſigns Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adelphia to be the firſt object of his purſuits, or the defeat of this army; and, for one or both of theſe purpoſes, is collecting nearly his whole force at Brunſwic,—a board of general officers determined yeſterday evening after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation, that all the continental troops at Peekſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kill and its dependencies, except one thouſand effectives, ſhould be immediately marched to reinforce this army. That number, with the convaleſcents and ſuch aids of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia as are now and may be aſſembled in caſe of emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, was deemed competent to the defence of thoſe poſts againſt any attempt that may be made to poſſeſs them in the preſent ſituation of things.</p>
                     <p>I have incloſed a general return ſhewing our whole ſtrength in Jerſey at this time, from which it will appear our circumſtances in this reſpect are by no means ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable as could be wiſhed. I eſteem it my duty to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit information of this ſort from time to time to Congreſs, and am encouraged the more to do it from a conviction that they, ſenſible of the neceſſity of the moſt profound ſecrecy, will not ſuffer the leaſt intimation of our numbers to tranſpire.</p>

                        <hi>June</hi> 14.—Your favour of the thirteenth, with its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures, was received laſt night.</p>
                     <p>Having propoſed to general Howe an exchange of the priſoners now in his poſſeſſion, as you will perceive by the incloſed copy of my letter, and alſo added, that <hi>"his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards priſoners would govern mine,"</hi> it appears to me that it would be improper to tranſmit him a copy of your firſt reſolution of the tenth inſtant, till we have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more from him on the ſubject propoſed. I confeſs I did not, nor do I yet, underſtand the paragraph of his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the twenty-ſecond ultimo, to which I have alluded, and which induced me to propoſe an exchange if that was his wiſh, and to ſubjoin, that his conduct to our priſoners ſhould govern mine,—as a caution to prevent him exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeverity or a new mode of treatment of them, contrary to the ſpirit of the agreement between us, and the ideas entertained upon the ſubject when it was firſt entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,—if ſuch was his meaning.</p>
                     <p>Finding that there would be great difficulty in filling the battalions intended to be raiſed, I did not commiſſion officers for all the ſixteen additional ones: I apprehended ſuch a meaſure would accumulate expenſe without increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſtrength, and therefore did not ſet the whole on foot. I ſhall be happy, on governor Caſwell's letter and your recommendation of colonel Shepard, that he ſhould have a regiment: from the character given him, and the terms on which he offers his ſervices, there can be no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. Congreſs will be pleaſed to appoint him to the command they wiſh him to have; and I ſhould think it adviſeable that he be ordered to march with his corps to join this army, leaving proper officers to recruit the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency.</p>
                     <p>I have peruſed monſieur De Coudray's opinion about the fortifications, and have no doubt but that it is well founded. I have not ſufficient knowledge of them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce an opinion with certainty myſelf.</p>
                     <p>You will obſerve by the New-York paper the execution of * * *. His family well deſerves the generous notice of Congreſs. He conducted himſelf with great fidelity to our cauſe, rendering <hi>[his country eſſential]</hi> ſervices, and has fallen a ſacrifice in promoting her intereſt. Perhaps
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:029737_0430_0FE299C5B2EF8918"/>
a public act of generoſity (conſidering the character he was in) might not be ſo eligible as a private donation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>June</hi> 15.—When I wrote yeſterday, my information was that one diviſion of the enemy was advancing on the Princeton road, and it was believed from the general movement of their army that they were proceeding towards Delaware. What their real deſign was, is not yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Thoſe that advanced on that road, after marching ſome diſtance, filed off to the right, down Millſtone-river, and joined the other column on the Coryel-ferry road leading by Somerſet court-houſe. One object of their movement might be to incloſe general Sullivan and his diviſion between their two columns: another (which moſt probably was the principal cauſe, if they did not mean to proceed to Delaware when they ſet out) to manoeuvre us out of our preſent encampment into action upon diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous terms. The firſt they could not hope to ſucceed in after general Sullivan changed his poſt to Rocky-Hill; an event which took place only the evening before, and which it is preſumed they were not well adviſed of when they left Brunſwic. A conſiderable body of them remain at Somerſet court-houſe, and on the communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and Brunſwic. We have been and are harraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them with light troops: but they being in open ground with a large train of artillery, we cannot do it ſo effectually as could be wiſhed.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall be glad to be informed whether general De Haas conſiders himſelf an officer in the army. He has never joined it ſince his promotion, or written a ſingle line to me upon the ſubject. If he accepts his commiſſion, it will be well for Congreſs to order him to repair to the army immediately. The brigade intended for him is without a general officer, and has brought on a diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpute between two of the colonels, each claiming the command. This is not the only inconvenience:—officers of high rank remaining at home, afford a bad example to others who are inferior, and grounds of application for the like indulgence.</p>
                     <p>This letter, except the paragraphs of this date, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſend yeſterday, but was prevented by the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the enemy which rendered it unadviſeable.</p>

I am now to acquaint you, that, after encamping between theſe two poſts and beginning a line of redoubts, they changed their ground yeſterday morning and in the courſe of the preceding night, and returned to Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wic again, burning, as they went, ſeveral valuable dwelling houſes. We had conſtantly light troops hovering round them as far as circumſtances would permit: but, being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured on their flanks by the Rariton and Millſtone, they were difficult to approach; and, without loſs, effected their return to their former poſts. This ſudden and precipitate change in their operations has afforded matter for much ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation. We ſuppoſe their original deſign was to attempt an impreſſion on our right, or to manoeuvre us out of our ground, or to advance towards the Delaware. Whether theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures were well founded, cannot be aſcertained: but it is probable, if they had an impreſſion in view, they found

it could not be attempted without great loſs—(as to bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on an attack, they effectually ſecured themſelves againſt one by the poſt they took)—or if paſſing the Delaware was their object, that, from the temper of the people, the proſecution of it (if not impracticable) would meet with much greater oppoſition than what they expected: for I muſt obſerve—and with peculiar ſatisfaction I do it—that, on the firſt notice of the enemy's movements, the militia aſſembled in the moſt ſpirited manner, firmly determined to give them every annoyance in their power, and to afford us every poſſible aid. This I thought it my duty to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in juſtice to their conduct; and I am inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that general Howe's return, thus ſuddenly made, muſt have been in conſequence of the information he received that the people were in and flying to arms in every quarter to oppoſe him. I ſhall not reaſon upon this event: but I cannot but conſider it as a moſt fortunate and happy one to us, and the moſt diſtressing Mr. Howe has yet experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, unleſs he has ſchemes in contemplation beyond the reach of my conjecture.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould have written to Congreſs more frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the enemy after they came from Brunſwic, had I not been almoſt conſtantly on horſe-back, and had their deſigns been clear: but as they were not, I did not wiſh to puzzle them with conjectures, more eſpecially as I wrote general Arnold (with whom I was obliged to correſpond, that he might co-operate with me as circumſtances ſhould require) to tranſmit them copies of my letters.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed you will be pleaſed to receive an extract of a letter from colonel Jackſon of Boſton to general Knox. The intelligence it contains is intereſting; and I ſhall be happy to hear that the two brigs mentioned have captured the remainder of the Heſſians, and more particularly ſo if the capture ſhould not be far from the Britiſh coaſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they arrive ſafe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Twelve o'clock.</hi>—I juſt now received a letter from gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Schuyler, a copy of which, and of its incloſures, is herewith tranſmitted. The enemy, from appearances, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing changed their views for the preſent, or at leaſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them dark and myſterious, I have ſent expreſſes to brigadiers M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal and Glover to halt their diviſions, if

they have proceeded any conſiderable diſtance from Peekſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kill, till further orders—otherwiſe to return. I have alſo written to general Putnam to hold four regiments in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to embark for general Schuyler's aid, ſhould further intelligence from Canada reſpecting the enemy's move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments make it neceſſary. The uncertainty of general Howe's operations will not permit more to be done at this time. General Parſons arrived here this morning, and his diviſion is marching to their ground towards the left of the lines.</p>
                     <p>I omitted to mention in my laſt, that, in conſultation with my general officers, it was agreed that promotions ſhould be regimental in the army for all officers under the rank of field officers,—and for all of that rank, in the line of their ſtate. This is now ſettled as a general rule; a right being reſerved however, that it may be made for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular merit out of this line, or refuſed for demerit or any ſubſtantial objection.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE the honour and pleaſure to inform you that the enemy evacuated Brunſwic this morning and retired to Amboy, burning many houſes as they went along.
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:029737_0434_0FE299C8BB3AC010"/>
Some of them, from the appearance of the flames, were conſiderable buildings.</p>
                     <p>From ſeveral pieces of information and from a variety of circumſtances, it was evident that a movement was in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and it was the general opinion that it was intended this morning. I therefore detached three brigades under the command of major-general Greene to fall upon their rear, and kept the main body of the army paraded upon the heights, to ſupport them if there ſhould be occaſion. A party of colonel Morgan's regiment of light-infantry at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked and drove the Heſſian piquet about ſun-riſe: and upon the appearance of general Wayne's brigade and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan's regiment (who got firſt to the ground) oppoſite Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wic, the enemy immediately croſſed the bridge to the eaſt ſide of the river, and threw themſelves into redoubts which they had before conſtructed. Our troops advanced briſkly upon them; upon which they quitted the redoubts without making any oppoſition, and retired by the Amboy road.</p>
                     <p>As all our troops, from the difference of their ſtations in camp, had not come up when the enemy began to mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e off, it was impoſſible to check them, as their numbers were far greater than we had any reaſon to expect,—being, as we were informed afterwards, between four and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men. Our men purſued them as far as Piſcatawa: but finding it impoſſible to overtake them, and fearing they might be led on too far from the main body, they returned to Brunſwic.</p>
                     <p>By information of the inhabitants, general Howe, lord Cornwallis, and general Grant, were in the town when the alarm was firſt given: but they quitted it very ſoon after.</p>
                     <p>In the purſuit, colonel Morgan's riflemen exchanged ſeveral ſharp fires with the enemy, which, it is imagined, did conſiderable execution. I am in hopes that they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>General Greene deſires me to make mention of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and bravery of general Wayne and colonel Morgan, and of their officers and men, upon this occaſion, as they conſtantly advanced upon an enemy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

General Sullivan advanced from Rocky-Hill to Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wic with his diviſion; but, as he did not receive his order of march till very late at night, he did not arrive till the enemy had been gone ſome time.</p>
                     <p>I have ſent down lord Stirling's diviſion to reinforce general Maxwell; and in the morning I ſhall move the main body of the army to ſome ſecure poſt nearer Amboy, from whence we can with more caſe annoy the enemy than from this diſtance. I am inclined to think they mean to croſs to Staten-Iſland: if they do, we may perhaps find an opportunity of making a ſtroke upon their rear: at any rate we ſhall have a chance of obliging them to make a total evacuation of the State of Jerſey.</p>

                     <p>WHEN I had the honour to addreſs you laſt, it was on the ſubject of the enemy's retreat from Brunſwic to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, and of the meaſures purſued to annoy them. At the time of writing, the information I had received reſpecting their loſs was rather vague and uncertain: but we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, from intelligence through various channels ſince, that it was pretty conſiderable, and fell chiefly on the grenadiers and light-infantry, who formed their covering party. The incloſed copy of a letter, containing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of a perſon juſt from New-York, correſponds with other accounts on this head, and with the declarations of ſome deſerters. Some of the accounts are, that officers were heard to ſay they had not ſuffered ſo ſeverely ſince the affair at Princeton.</p>
                     <p>After the evacuation of Brunſwic, I determined, with the advice of my general officers, to move the whole army the next morning to this poſt, where they would be nearer the enemy, and might act according to circumſtances. In this I was prevented by rain, and they only moved yeſterday morning. I have advanced lord Stirling's diviſion and ſome other troops lower down in the neighbourhood of Metuchin meeting-houſe, and intended to have poſted more there; but found, on reconnoitring the ground, that it was low and
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:029737_0436_0FE299CA456C6998"/>
diſadvantageous, and ſtill more unfavourable through a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of water. Theſe reaſons, added to that of there not being the ſmalleſt proſpect of attacking the enemy in Amboy with a probability of ſucceſs—ſecured on their flanks by water, and in their front by ſtrong redoubts acroſs the Neck—would not permit me, either in my own opinion or that of my general officers, to keep any greater body of men in that quarter, where they would have been diſperſed, and of conſequence extremely inſecure.</p>
                     <p>I have light parties lying cloſe on the enemy's lines, to watch their motions, and who will be ready to act in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with lord Stirling's diviſion and ſuch other troops as it may be necessary to detach; though I think—and ſo do the reſt of the officers—that no event is likely to take place that will require more, ſince the idea of forcing their lines, or bringing on a general engagement on their own ground, is univerſally held incompatible with our intereſt, and that that number is ſufficient to avail us of any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages we can expect to ariſe from their retreating from Amboy, ſuppoſing notice of the fact ſhould be obtained. Their contiguity to the Sound, and the ſmall diſtance acroſs it, (having boats prepared to paſs in) will enable them to get off (ſhould they ſo incline) againſt every prudent and juſtifiable exertion on our part. Whether ſuch is their deſign, is more than I can poſitively determine: but there is every reaſon to believe that they have been and are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting their baggage to Staten-Iſland, and making every preparation to embark on board their tranſports for ſome new expedition.</p>
                     <p>Your favour of the twenty-fourth I juſt now received, and am extremely obliged by your cordial congratulations on the enemy's retreat from Brunſwic, and favourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the event of my conduct. The reſolution you did me the honour to tranſmit ſhall have my attention.</p>
                     <p>It is much to be regretted, that an expreſs ſent off to general Maxwell on Saturday night, to inform him of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Greene's movement towards Brunſwic that he might conduct himſelf accordingly, did not reach him. Wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the expreſs went deſignedly to the enemy, or was taken, is not known: but there is reaſon to believe he fell into their hands. If general Maxwell had received the order,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:029737_0437_0FE29A2EE87D2C60"/>
there is no doubt but their whole rear-guard would have been cut off. This the enemy confeſſed themſelves, as we are well informed by perſons in Bonemtown.</p>
                     <p>By a reconnoitring party juſt returned, it is reported as a matter of doubt whether any of the enemy have removed from Amboy; though it is almoſt certain they have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported a great deal of their baggage.</p>

                     <p>ON Thurſday morning general Howe advanced with his whole army in ſeveral columns, from Amboy, as far as Weſtfield. We are certainly informed that the troops ſent to Staten-Iſland returned the preceding evening, and, it is ſaid, with an augmentation of marines, ſo that carrying them there was a feint with intention to deceive us. His deſign in this ſudden movement was either to bring on a general engagement upon diſadvantageous terms, conſidering mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in any point of view—or to cut off our light parties, and lord Stirling's diviſion which was ſent down to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them—or to poſſeſs himſelf of the heights and paſſes in the mountains on our left. The two laſt ſeemed to be the firſt objects of his attention, as his march was rapid againſt theſe parties, and indicated a ſtrong diſpoſition to gain thoſe paſſes.</p>
                     <p>In this ſituation of affairs it was thought abſolutely nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary that we ſhould move our force from the low grounds, to occupy the heights before them; which was effected. As they advanced, they fell in with ſome of our light par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and part of lord Stirling's diviſion, with which they had ſome pretty ſmart ſkirmiſhing, with but very little loſs I believe on our ſide, except in three field-pieces which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately fell into the enemy's hands: but, not having obtained returns yet, I cannot determine it with certainty; nor can we aſcertain what the enemy's loſs was.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as we had gained the paſſes, I detached a body of light troops under brigadier-general Scott, to hang on their flank, and to watch their motions; and ordered Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan's corps of riflemen to join him ſince. The enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:029737_0438_0FE29BAA2964CD40"/>
at Weſtfield till yeſterday afternoon, when, about three o'clock, they moved towards Spanktown, with our light troops in their rear and purſuing. The enemy have plundered all before them, and, it is ſaid, burned ſome houſes.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE not been able to aſcertain yet with any degree of preciſion the loſs ſuſtained by the enemy in the ſeveral ſkirmiſhes on Thurſday, though we have many reaſons to believe it was much more conſiderable than what it was apprehended to be when I had the honour of addreſſing you upon the ſubject. The incloſed copy of a letter from lord Stirling contains the fulleſt and moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular information that I have received: and the accounts given by ſundry inhabitants to perſons who have been in the neighbourhood where the ſkirmiſhes were, and where the enemy were encamped, countenance this intelligence.</p>
                     <p>As to our loſs, as reported by the enemy, I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it is exaggerated beyond all bounds of truth or prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, being aſſured by lord Stirling that it was trifling—and by ſuch deſerters as have come in, that they ſaw but very few priſoners taken. It would have been certainly known before this, (that is, the number not yet returned) had not ſome of the parties, and I believe the moſt which were then out, joined the corps ſince detached.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect to the enemy's deſigns or intended move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they are not to be determined. It is certain they got into Amboy yeſterday evening: and, from advices this morning from officers ſent to South-Amboy to obſerve their motions, there were ſtrong reaſons to conclude they were evacuating the town, as their horſe had gone over to Staten-Iſland, and as ſeveral boats were alſo paſſing with baggage, and others with troops. There were further cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances favouring this opinion, ſuch as apparent breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in ſome of their lines: yet general Sullivan informs me, by a letter juſt new received, that, from all the intelligence
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:029737_0439_0FE29A7F607D4A90"/>
he has been able to obtain to-day, he does not think they have any ſerious intention of quitting it, and that all their movements are a feint, calculated merely to deceive, and to cover ſome plans they have in view.</p>
                     <p>I have two brigades—Scott's and Conway's—now lying at and near Woodbridge, as corps of obſervation, and to act as circumſtances may require. General Sullivan was down in the ſame neighbourhood with his diviſion, till this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he returned, it appearing to him unneceſſary to remain longer, and that the brigades I have mentioned would be ſufficient for any event likely to take place.</p>

                        <p>P. S. <hi>June</hi> 30.—From intelligence received laſt night, the opinion that the enemy are evacuating Amboy ſeems to be more confirmed.</p>
                        <p>As the facts in lord Stirling's letter are rather taken up on report than from any certain knowledge of their having happened, I cannot conſider them ſufficiently authentic for publication; nor are they tranſmitted for that purpoſe, though I am well perſuaded the enemy's loſs was much more conſiderable than it was at firſt imagined to be. It has been reported to me to-day that the enemy took ſixty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four priſoners in the whole. Whether they were all of our army, or in part countrymen, I cannot decide; for, having detached at that time a number of light parties, and man, of them having fallen in with the corps ordered out ſince, returns could not be made with accuracy. The priſoners taken by us were thirteen, two of whom are light dragoons, the reſt infantry. Generals Scott and Conway intended to move towards Amboy this morning: but it is probable the rain has prevented them.</p>

                     <p>YESTERDAY afternoon the enemy totally evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Amboy, and encamped oppoſite to it on Staten-Iſland.

                     <p>THE incloſed copies of general St. Clair's letters, tranſmitted yeſterday afternoon and laſt night by general Schuyler, I have thought it my duty to ſend you. The intelligence they contain is important and intereſting; nor are there circumſtances wanting beſides theſe, to induce a belief, or at leaſt to raiſe a ſtrong preſumption, that the enemy have in contemplation a junction of their two armies by way of the Lakes and the North-river. If they have their whole Canada force on the former, it is certainly their object.</p>
                     <p>On receiving theſe accounts, I wrote immediately to general Putnam to embark Nixon's brigade for reinforcing the northern army—to wait however the arrival or near approach of generals Parſons and Varnum's brigades from this place, who march this morning—or the coming in of an equal number of militia to ſupply their place before they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. This I have done by the advice of my general offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>, and is all that is thought practicable in the preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain indeterminate ſituation of things. The reſt of the army here will be held in readineſs to move according to information and circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>As I have obſerved, if we were certain general Burgoyne was approaching Ticonderoga with his whole army, I ſhould not heſitate a moment in concluding that it is in conſequence of a preconcerted plan with general Howe, and that the latter is to co-operate with him, by puſhing his whole force up the North-river, and aiming a ſtroke in
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:029737_0441_0FE29A88850C9270"/>
the firſt inſtance and immediately againſt the Highland paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. But as the appearance of the enemy on the Lake may be a feint, calculated to amuſe and diſtract (though it may ſeem like a real attack) to draw this army to Peekſkill and more to the northward, that general Howe may with more facility turn his arms againſt Philadelphia—it has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined unadviſeable for us to move till we have further proofs of his intentions, and that our conduct muſt be gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned by his.</p>
                     <p>Our ſituation is truly delicate and embarraſſing. Should we march to Peekſkill, leaving general Howe on Staten-Iſland, there will be nothing to prevent him paſſing to South Amboy, and puſhing from thence to Philadelphia, or in ſhort by any other route; though the marching ſuch of his troops from the point oppoſite Amboy as were encamped there, and the ſailing of the ſhips from Princeſs-bay yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday morning, are circumſtances indicating that an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation has or will take place. On the other hand, if the North-river and the poſſeſſion of the Highlands are his objects, our remaining here till his views are certainly known may ſubject us to a riſk that we wiſh to avoid.</p>
                     <p>Thus, let us examine matters as we will, difficulties ſtare us in the face. We ſhall attempt to conſult, and to do the beſt we can. I have written to generals Putnam and George Clinton fully upon the ſubject, urging them to put forth every exertion in their power, and inſtantly to call in a reſpectable body of militia to aid in the defence of thoſe important poſts at this critical conjuncture. I truſt they will come out; their ſervices in all probability will not be wanted but for a very ſhort time.</p>
                     <p>I muſt earneſtly requeſt that you will ſend Mr. Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art, the iſſuing commiſſary-general, to camp immediately. There is reaſon to apprehend the army will be in great diſtreſs and confuſion for want of iſſuing commiſſaries in three or four days. On Saturday, thoſe with Mr. Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball declare they will leave him, without they are put on a different footing from what they now are. I need not mention the conſequences that will reſult from ſuch an event, if there are not others here to ſupply their places.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing more I would add, which is, that there is not more than forty thouſand dollars in the milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:029737_0442_0FE1BFC974398D78"/>
cheſt, and two months' pay due to all the army, except two or three regiments which have juſt obtained warrants. A hundred and fifty-ſix thouſand, out of the laſt ſupply ſent the paymaſter, I was obliged to order to Peekſkill for the troops in that quarter, whoſe demands are great and preſſing alſo. I muſt earneſtly entreat that you will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a ſupply directly to the paymaſter:—ſhould we be obliged to move before the troops are paid, much uneaſineſs and murmuring will be the certain attendants, and, I fear, ſomething worſe.</p>
                     <p>As the enemy will adopt every ſtratagem and device to deceive and diſtract us,—notwithſtanding the preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in favour of their making an expedition up the North-river, I doubt not but you will have the moſt vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant look-outs kept along Delaware-bay, and proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes and ſignals for communicating the earlieſt intelligence. I think it would be highly expedient that ſome ſenſible judicious men ſhould be employed in that buſineſs at this time, who would view things as they ought to be, and from whoſe accounts certain inferences and concluſions may be drawn, ſo as to form a proper line for our conduct. The moſt fatal conſequences may flow from falſe information at this period: things ſhould be examined with all poſſible certainty. I ſhall not be ſurpriſed to hear of ſeveral ſhips appearing in or off Delaware, though general Howe's deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination ſhould be elſewhere. Their fleet give them the moſt ſignal advantages, and an opportunity of practiſing a thouſand feints.</p>

                     <p>I THIS morning received a letter of the ſeventh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from general Schuyler, a copy of which, and of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure, I herewith ſend you. The intelligence which they contain is truly intereſting, ſuppoſing it juſt: but it differs ſo widely from what we had reaſon to expect from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts mentioned in general St. Clair's letters to general Schuyler (copies of which you would receive in his letter tranſmitted from hence laſt night by major Hoops) that I would fain flatter myſelf it is not true. I am the more encouraged to hope this, as captain Farmam's letter from Fort-Ann to brigadier Learned ſeems to be the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole, and does not authoriſe the unfavourable and unhappy concluſions built upon it. I ſhould rather ſuppoſe, if any accident has befallen us, it muſt have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the detachment of men from the Grants, under colonel Warner: for we find from general St. Clair's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he expected ſomething from him. The whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is ſo confuſed that we cannot eſtabliſh any certain deduction from it; and I ſhall be happy if it proves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature and groundleſs.</p>
                     <p>I am told by a gentleman who came to camp yeſterday evening, that Nixon's brigade would certainly arrive at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany on Tueſday morning, as he ſaw the veſſels, in which it was embarked, ſtanding up the evening before with a fair wind.</p>
                     <p>If the event mentioned by general Schuyler ſhould not have happened, we cannot doubt but general Burgoyne has come up the Lake, determined, if poſſible, to carry his point,—I mean, to poſſeſs himſelf of our poſts in that quarter, and to puſh his arms further. Suppoſing this not to have happened, as our continental levies are ſo deficient in their number, our ſecurity and ſafety will require that aids from the militia ſhould be called forth in caſes of
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:029737_0445_0FE29A8CE24DEFC8"/>
emergency: if it has, there is now an abſolute neceſſity for their turning out to check general Burgoyne's progreſs; or the moſt diſagreeable conſequences may be apprehended. Upon this occaſion I would take the liberty to ſuggeſt to Congreſs the propriety of ſending an active, ſpirited of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, to conduct and lead them on. If general Arnold has ſettled his affairs, and can be ſpared from Philadelphia, I would recommend him for this buſineſs, and that he ſhould immediately ſet out for the northern department: he is active, judicious, and brave, and an officer in whom the militia will repoſe great confidence. Beſides this, he is well acquainted with that country, and with the routes and moſt important paſſes and defiles in it. I do not think he can render more ſignal ſervices, or be more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully employed at this time, than in this way. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded his preſence and activity will animate the militia greatly, and ſpur them on to a becoming conduct. I could wiſh him to be engaged in a more agreeable ſervice—to be with better troops: but circumſtances call for his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this way, and I have no doubt of his adding much to the honours he has already acquired.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence of the advices from general St. Clair, and the ſtrong probability there is that general Howe will puſh againſt the Highland paſſes to co-operate with general Burgoyne, I ſhall, by the advice of my officers, move the army from hence to-morrow morning towards the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>river. If ſuch ſhould be his intention, we ſhall not be too early, as a favourable wind and tide will carry him up in a few hours. On the other hand, if Philadelphia is his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he cannot get round before we can arrive there; nor can he well debark his troops, &amp;c. and proceed acroſs the land, before we can oppoſe him.</p>

                     <p>WHEN I had the honour of addreſſing you laſt. I hoped the intelligence received reſpecting our affairs in the northern department was not true, or at leaſt that they were not ſo unfavourable as they were then repreſented.
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:029737_0446_0FE29A322737C798"/>
But the incloſed copy of a letter from general Schuyler, which came to hand yeſterday evening, confirms it, moſt unhappily for us, in its fulleſt latitude. This event, (the evacuation of our poſts on the Lake) among the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate that could have befallen us,—is rendered more intereſting by the manner in which it took place. I have no further information upon the ſubject than what the copy contains, and ſhall be happy to hear by my next advices, that the main body of the army, of whoſe ſituation general Schuyler knew nothing with certainty, have not become priſoners: for I fear, from the diſpoſition they diſcovered on this diſtreſſing occaſion, they would have surrendered to the enemy, in caſe they fell in with them, though infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in number.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect to general Schuyler's demands, it is not in my power to comply with the whole of them. Not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle tent can be furniſhed: the kettles will be, and are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered on; and an expreſs is going to Springfield for all the muſket-cartridges, ſixty barrels of powder, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable quantity of lead and cartridge-paper for his uſe. Ten pieces of artillery, with harneſs, are alſo ordered, with proper officers from Peekſkill. I have written to him to procure horſes and drivers himſelf, as they are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with much more eaſe where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e is, than here: nor can he be ſupplied with the heavy cannon which he requeſts, ſuppoſing them neceſſary,—not having one to ſpare from a more important uſe,—the defence of the Highlands Colonel Putnam, I imagine, will be with him before this, as his regiment is part of Nixon's brigade,—who will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer every purpoſe he can poſſibly have for an engineer at this criſis. A ſupply of intrenching tools was ſent him four or five days ago, in conſequence of an application then made.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould be extremely happy if our ſituation would allow me to afford him a large reinforcement of men: but I cannot with any degree of propriety, in the opinion of my general officers, ſend more to his aid at this time than a number of recruits on the march from Maſſachuſetts State, belonging to ſome of the regiments under his command, who amount to ſix hundred at leaſt, and are now, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, pretty well advanced towards Peekſkill. With this
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:029737_0447_0FE29A8E6671EB40"/>
augmentation to what he already has,—ſuppoſing general St. Clair and his force to have come in, and any number of militia to have turned out,—he will have an army, equal if not ſuperior to general Burgoyne's, from the only accounts we have obtained. Beſides this conſideration, it is moſt probable that general Burgoyne will ſuſpend his operations till general Howe makes a movement and an effort on his part. His deſigns, I think, are moſt unqueſtionably againſt the Highlands, and that he will attempt the execution as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>We have been prevented marching to-day by the rain; but, as ſoon as the weather permits, ſhall proceed as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiouſly as we can towards the North-river, and croſs, or not, as ſhall appear neceſſary from circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>In my laſt I took the liberty of ſuggeſting the propriety of ſending an active officer to animate the militia that may aſſemble for checking general Burgoyne's progreſs, and mentioned general Arnold for that purpoſe. Being more and more convinced of the important advantages that will reſult from his preſence and conduct, I have thought it my duty to repeat my wiſhes on the ſubject, and that he may, without a moment's loſs of time, ſet out from Philadelphia for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>When this arrives, it is likely general Howe's intention will be well underſtood: but whether it is or not, as there are ſtrong reaſons to believe his operations will be up the North-river and on the eaſt ſide of it, I ſhall take the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty to recommend the ſending on the North-Carolina and other continental troops at Philadelphia, to join this army, unleſs Congreſs have ſome information that a ſouthern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition is intended, of which I am not appriſed.</p>
                     <p>If Congreſs have taken colonel Procter and his corps into the ſervice of the States, it will be expedient for them to come on with all the field-artillery which colonel Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers the commiſſary may have ready.

                     <p>I WAS yeſterday evening honoured with yours of the fourteenth. I have heard nothing from the northward ſince my laſt. I this day received advice from Staten-Iſland, that, on Sunday, ſeventy ſail of the enemy's ſhips fell down from the watering-place to the Hook: But wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they have ſince gone out to ſea, I have not heard. Till I have more certain information of the ſtate of our affairs to the northward, and of general Howe's real intentions, I have concluded to halt the army at this place, from whence. I can either march forward or return, as circumſtances may require.</p>
                     <p>If general Naſh ſhould not have begun his march before this reaches you, be pleaſed to order him to proceed as far as Trenton only, and there wait my further orders. In caſe he ſhould have marched, be pleaſed to diſpatch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs after him, with orders to halt at Trenten.</p>
                     <p>I am pleaſed to hear that you have taken colonel Proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's corps of artillery into continental ſervice. You will be kind enough to order them to join the army immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for I expect the light artillery in a few days from the eaſtward; and artillery-men will be wanted to man them.</p>
                     <p>I have no doubt but the militia from the weſtern parts of New-England will turn out to general Schuyler's aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as I hope thoſe of this State and Jerſey will to mine, ſhould they be wanted.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall be very happy if the committee of Congreſs can arrange the commiſſary's department in ſuch a manner as will ſatisfy the officers concerned in the buſineſs, and at the ſame time ſerve to ſupply the army with more regularity than has been done for ſome time paſt. I can aſſure you the complaints have been many of late, and not without foundation.</p>

                     <p>I BEG leave to congratulate Congreſs on the captiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of major-general Preſcot and one of his aides. The
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:029737_0450_0FE29A3E3426C4E0"/>
particulars of this fortunate event you will find in the incloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed extract of a letter this minute received from general Spencer, which, I preſume, are at large in the packet Mr. Greenleaf will deliver. Lieutenant-colonel Barton, who conducted the enterpriſe, and the ſmall handful under his command, have great merit. I ſhall immediately propoſe to general Howe his exchange for that of major-general Lee, which, if acceded to, will not only do away one ground of controverſy between general Howe and myſelf, but will releaſe lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian field-officers, and procure the enlargement of an equal number of ours in his hands.</p>
                     <p>In mine of this morning I deſired that colonel Procter's regiment ſhould join this army without loſs of time. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſulting general Knox, we are of opinion they had better halt at Trenton with general Naſh till further or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as the operations of general Howe are not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtood. I have nothing new from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern department,—and only to add, that I have the honour to be, with great reſpect, Sir, your moſt obedient ſervant,</p>

                     <p>I JUST now received a letter from general Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, of the fourteenth inſtant, incloſing the proceedings of the council of war which he alludes to, a copy of which, and of his letter, I herewith tranſmit. He repreſents mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in a diſtreſſing point of view. I believe they are bad: but I hope they are not ſo alarming as they are painted by him.</p>
                     <p>My letter of the twelfth would adviſe Congreſs how far his demand of neceſſaries had or would be complied with. In addition to the ſupplies then ordered, I directed, a day or two after, ſix tons of muſket-ball to be forwarded to him from Peekſkill with all poſſible expedition, which, I doubt not, have arrived at Albany. As to ſending him more troops than thoſe mentioned in my letter above referred to, it is not in my power; and I am perſuaded the force he now has, with ſuch ſuccour as may be had from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:029737_0451_0FE29A9AEA7C86A0"/>

                     <p>General Arnold arrived here laſt night, and will ſet out this evening for Albany. From his activity and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for enterpriſe, I flatter myſelf his preſence and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in that quarter will be attended with happy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences: I am well aſſured his utmoſt exertions will be employed to baffle the enemy's views: and, wiſhing that they may ſucceed, I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>THE little notice I had of your coming to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the ſhortneſs of your ſtay in camp, will more than probably occaſion the omiſſion of many matters which of right ought to be laid before you; and the interruption which my thoughts conſtantly meet by a variety of occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, muſt apologize for the crude and indigeſted manner in which they are offered.</p>
                     <p>The completion of the continental regiments is a matter of ſuch infinite importance, that I think no means ſhould be left uneſſayed to accompliſh it. Draughting, where the powers of government are adequate, would be the ſpeedieſt and moſt effectual: but if it ſhould be thought unadviſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to attempt this mode,—next to it I would recommend that the buſineſs of recruiting ſhould be taken entirely out of the hands of the officers of the army, and that each State ſhould appoint ſome perſon of known activity (one, for inſtance, who has been a good under-ſheriff) in each county or townſhip, not only to recruit, but to apprehend deſerters;—theſe perſons to be liberally rewarded for each recruit and deſerter whom they ſhall deliver, at ſtated pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods and places, to officers appointed to receive, diſcipline, and march them to the army;—none of theſe recruiters to have the ſmalleſt power to act out of their own diſtricts, but to be abſolutely fixed to them.</p>
                     <p>A mode of this kind would, in my humble opinion, be leſs burdenſome to the public than the preſent,—prevent

                        </gap>dle habits which recruiting officers contract, not only injurious to themſelves, but to others,—the moſt effectual means which can be deviſed for the recovery of deſerters,—the ſureſt way of keeping your regiments of equal ſtrength, and of making the duty more equal in the detail of it: in a word, many valuable advantages would reſult from it, whilſt I can ſuggeſt but one reaſon againſt it,—and that, (fully ſatisfied I am) when weighed in the ſcale of intereſt, will not operate,—I mean, the keeping ſo many officers in camp, who might be ſpared from the duties of the field till the regiments are ſtronger than at preſent. The ſixteen additional regiments labour under ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages in ſome States, as to render the interpoſition of Congreſs, in ſome ſhape or other, indiſpenſably neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to food, conſidering we are in ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and abundant country, no army was ever worſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied than ours, with many eſſential articles of it. Our ſoldiers, the greateſt part of laſt campaign and the whole of this, have ſcarcely taſted any kind of vegetables,—had but little ſalt;—and vinegar, which would have been a tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable ſubſtitute for vegetables, they have been in a great meaſure ſtrangers to. Neither have they been provided with proper drink: beer or cider ſeldom comes within the verge of the camp, and ruin in much too ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Thus, to devouring large quantities of animal food untempered by vegetables or vinegar, or by any kind of drink but water,—and eating indifferent bread, (but for this laſt a remedy is provided)—are to be aſcribed the many putrid diſeaſes incident to the army, and the lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mortality that attended us laſt campaign. If theſe evils can be remedied, the expenſe and trouble ought not to be obſtacles. Though ſome kinds of vegetables are not to be had, others are, which, together with ſour krout and vinegar, might eaſily be had, if proper perſons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the buſineſs were employed therein.</p>
                     <p>Soap is another article in great demand. The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental allowance is too ſmall: and, dear as every neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of life is now got, a ſoldier's pay will not enable him to purchaſe; by which means his conſequent dirtineſs adds not a little to the diſeaſes of the army.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="unknown:029737_0453_0FE29A9C83F0E940"/>
I have no reaſon to accuſe the clothier-general of inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to his department; and therefore, as his ſupplies are incompetent to the wants of the army, I am to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his reſources are unequal. Ought not each State then to be called upon to draw ſuch ſupplies from the country manufactories, as can be afforded? particularly of ſhoes, ſtockings, ſhirts and blankets,—articles indiſpenſably nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary, and of which ſcarce too many can be provided:—in the mean while, every proviſion to be making, for cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the troops uniformly and warm in the winter. It is a maxim which needs no illuſtration, that nothing can be of more importance in an army, than the clothing and feeding it well. On theſe the health, comfort and ſpirits of the ſoldiers eſſentially depend; and it is a melancholy fact, that the American army are miſerably defective in both theſe reſpects. The diſtreſs moſt of them are in for want of cloathing is painful to humanity, diſpiriting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and diſcouraging to every officer. It makes every pretenſion to the preſervation of cleanlineſs impoſſible, expoſes them to a variety of diſorders, and abates or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys that military pride, without which nothing can be expected from any army.</p>
                     <p>The conſequence of giving rank indiſcriminately is much to be dreaded: great diſſatisfaction has already ariſen on account of beſtowing this on officers in the civil departments of the army, on the inferior ſtaff, waggon-maſter, &amp;c. who, by cuſtom, propriety, and every other motive, are excluded from it in all well-regulated armies. The too great liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality practiſed in this reſpect will deſtroy the pride of rank where it ought to exiſt, and will not only render it cheap, but contemptible. It is the policy of all armies to make it valued and reſpected, as a ſtimulus to emulation, and an incitement to bold and gallant undertakings: it muſt be very unadviſeable therefore, in our infant ſtate of war, to adopt novel cuſtoms to bring it into diſcredit—which muſt and will be the conſequence of making it too common, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the diſguſt it creates in others.</p>
                     <p>An auditor of accounts, to be conſtantly with the army, is abſolutely requiſite. It is impoſſible for me, crowded as I am with other buſineſs, to examine and adjuſt the numerous complex accounts of the army with-that correctneſs the
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:029737_0454_0FE29A417AB4AFC0"/>
public have a right to expect, before warrants paſs for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and, without doing it, great impoſitions may follow. The proviſion for making regimental pay-maſters regulate all regimental accounts is altogether incompetent to the end propoſed from it: for theſe men being appointed generally agreeable to the recommendation of the field-officers of the regiments they belong to—aſſociating conſtantly with the officers of their corps, and in a great meaſure under their control—cannot be conſidered as ſufficiently uninfluenced: nor are auditors at a diſtance from the army of much uſe, as it would require a delay not admiſſible, to ſend accounts to them to audit before they were paſſed and paid in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of warrants from the commander-in-chief of the army.</p>
                     <p>A good geographer, to ſurvey the roads and take ſketch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the country where the army is to act, would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely uſeful, and might be attended with exceeding valuable conſequences. He might with propriety have the chief direction of the guides, and muſt have a head to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, govern, and pay them. If ſuch a perſon ſhould be approved of, I would beg leave to recommend Mr. Robert Erſkine, who is thoroughly ſkilled in this buſineſs, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready aſſiſted us in making maps of the country, and has (as I am informed) uniformly ſupported the character of a faſt friend to America.</p>
                     <p>A ſmall travelling preſs, to follow head-quarters, would be productive of many eminent advantages. It would enable us to give ſpeedy and exact information of any mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary tranſactions that take place, with proper comments upon them, and thereby fruſtrate the pernicious tendency of falſehood and miſrepreſentation, which in my opinion, of whatever complexion they may be, are, in the main, detrimental to our cauſe. If the people had a channel of intelligence, that, from its uſual authenticity, they could look up to with confidence, they might often be preſerved from that deſpondency which they are apt to fall into from the exaggerated pictures our enemies and their emiſſaries among us commonly draw of any misfortunes we meet with,—and from that diffidence of truths favourable to us, which they muſt naturally feel from the frequent deception they are expoſed to by the extravagant colourings our
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:029737_0455_0FE29A9E09D68A18"/>
friends often give to our ſucceſſes. It would alſo be very uſeful to diſpatch buſineſs in camp, being the moſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious means of taking copies of orders or other matters that require to be diſperſed, and would ſave a good deal in returns and other papers we are often obliged to get printed in Philadelphia. An ingenious man, to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this preſs and be employed wholly in writing for it, might render it ſingularly beneficial.</p>
                     <p>I am exceedingly embarraſſed how to diſpoſe of the French officers in general, but more eſpecially the artillery officers, who are come out under the ſanction of a compact. I can think of no other way than that of forming a ſeparate corps of them, and draughting men from the whole line to compoſe that corps: but even this will be attended with many diſagreeable effects;—among others this is not the leaſt, that officers will think themſelves much injured to have the men they have had the trouble of raiſing, taken from them and given to others. There is ſomething in this which is diſcouraging, and breaks the ſpirit of a good officer, who prides himſelf in having a full and complete corps.</p>
                     <p>A doubt has ariſen, whether a perſon who belongs to any of the United States of America, and who owed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to any of the ſaid States,—that went to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſome time paſt, and ſince that time has been lurking about any of the fortifications, or about any of the encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the armies of the United States,—plundering and driving off cattle to the enemy, recruiting for them, or committing any other atrocious crime,—or who is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an officer in the enemy's army,—can be tried by a general court-martial, under the reſolution of Congreſs of the twenty-firſt of Auguſt, 1776, and puniſhed as a ſpy.</p>

                     <p>WE have been under great embarraſſments reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the intended operations of general Howe, and ſtill are, notwithſtanding the utmoſt pains to obtain intelligence of the ſame. At preſent it would appear that he is going
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:029737_0456_0FE29A445A93AE30"/>
out to ſea. By authentic information, there are only forty ſhips at New-York; the reſt are gone elſewhere, and have fallen down between the Narrows and the Hook: between theſe two places, the number, from the moſt accurate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, was about one hundred and twenty yeſterday. As I obſerved before, their deſtination is uncertain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known: but I have thought it my duty to inform Congreſs of theſe facts, that they may give orders to the militia to hold themſelves in readineſs to march on the ſhorteſt notice, in caſe Philadelphia ſhould be their object. At the ſame time I am to requeſt that they will have a ſufficient number of proper look-outs fixed at the Capes of Delaware, (to whoſe accounts implicit confidence may be given) to make the earlieſt reports of the arrival of any ſleet,—which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will tranſmit me by the ſpeedieſt conveyance.</p>
                     <p>As the enemy will probably make many feints, and have it unhappily but too much in their power from their ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, I would adviſe that the look-outs ſhould be cautioned to be extremely accurate in their obſervations and reports, mentioning, with as much preciſion as poſſible, the number of ſhips that may appear. Our ſituation is already criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and may be rendered ſtill more ſo by inaccurate and ill-grounded intelligence.</p>
                     <p>From the advices received on Saturday, of the movements of part of the enemy's ſhips, and the ſtrong reaſons there were to ſuppoſe general Howe would puſh up the North-river to co-operate with general Burgoyne, I detached lord Stirling with his diviſion to Peekſkill on Sunday morning:—they croſſed the river that evening and the next morning. This movement will prove unneceſſary, ſhould his deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be to the ſouthward. I have alſo ordered general <hi>Nixon'</hi>s brigade from Peekſkill to reinforce general Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, from his repreſentations of the inadequacy of his force to oppoſe general Burgoyne, and of the ſeeming backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the people in that quarter to afford him aid.</p>

                     <p>I DO myſelf the honour to tranſmit you a copy of my letter to general Howe, of the ſixteenth inſtant, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing

an exchange between generals Lee and Preſcot. I diſpatched it early the next morning, and preſume it got to hand on the eighteenth. As yet I have not received his anſwer.</p>
                     <p>The amazing advantage the enemy derive from their ſhips and the command of the water, keeps us in a ſtate of conſtant perplexity and the moſt anxious conjecture. We are not yet informed of their deſtination, nor can any plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible concluſions be drawn reſpecting it, at leaſt not ſuch as appear ſatisfactory. What renders the matter ſtill more difficult and confuſed, is their extreme inactivity and delay: for it is certain they began to embark immediately after the evacuation of Amboy, and now remain between the Narrows and the Hook, or were there when I was laſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed upon the ſubject. I have two active officers, with an eſcort, now out, for the purpoſe of intelligence, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connoit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ing their ſituation from Fort-Lee and along the river in that neighbourhood.</p>
                     <p>Things being thus circumſtanced, and various opinions, as to their real object, prevailing among us,—ſome ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be Philadelphia, others the North-river, and others an expedition more eaſterly,—I would ſubmit it to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs whether the militia of the neighbouring counties ſhould not be immediately called to the firſt, or at Cheſter,—the lower counties, at Wilmington. This meaſure appears to me highly expedient, and no objection can lie againſt it, of ſufficient validity to prevent it, as a few days muſt certainly determine their real deſigns. Should they be againſt Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adelphia, and they have favourable winds, their voyage will be made in a ſhort time, when it may be too late to obtain their aid, and to arrange them properly for defence, ſuppoſing them to come in. I am the more induced to recommend this meaſure, as the ſeveral objects we have to attend to necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily oblige this army to continue at a conſiderable diſtance from that place till their intentio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="121" facs="unknown:029737_0459_0FE29AAAC4B41230"/>
yet their operations may be greatly retarded by them, and may be checked till other ſuccours arrive. The report of a force, eſpecially if it is in any wiſe reſpectable, let it be of what ſort it may, will have ſome influence on their conduct, and may prevent enterpriſes that would otherwiſe be undertaken.</p>
                     <p>From the intelligence we received on Saturday evening that a number of the enemy's ſhips were ſtanding up the North-river,—and in the courſe of that and the preceding day, that forty ſail were in the Sound, going into Fairfield harbour,—I had not the leaſt doubt in my mind but gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Howe had in view a ſtroke againſt the Highlands and the fortifications there, and to co-operate with general Burgoyne. In conſequence of theſe advices, I judged it expedient to move the army the next morning, from our then encampment, towards thoſe poſts. Lord Stirling's diviſion was ordered to take the route to King's-ferry, and to paſs the river to Peekſkill; and I proceeded myſelf with the remainder, which compoſed the main body, by the route leading through the Clove towards New-Windſor. We marched over a very difficult and rugged road till night, when we halted,—the firſt diviſion having advanced about eighteen miles. In this ſituation we lay till yeſterday morning, when, from the information received before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the enemy's fleet being at and near the Hook, and no further accounts of the ſhips in the Sound, a change in our meaſures took place. Stephen and Lincoln's diviſions were ordered to proceed to Cheſter, (there to wait fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directions, as a place from whence they may move with much more eaſe either to Philadelphia or Hudſon's river, being ſeven miles nearer the former, and equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to the latter) and general Greene's diviſion to this ground. By dividing, and this arrangement, I am in hopes our movements will be more expeditious, whereſoev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they may be neceſſary.</p>

                     <p>YOUR favour of this date, with its incloſures, is now before me. At the ſame time that I expreſs my thanks for the high mark of confidence which Congreſs have been pleaſed to repoſe in me by their reſolve authoriſing me to ſend an officer to command the northern army, I ſhould wiſh to be excuſed from making the appointment. For this, many reaſons might be mentioned, which I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, will occur to Congreſs upon reflection. The north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern

department, in a great meaſure, has been conſidered as ſeparate, and more peculiarly under their direction; and the officers commanding there, always of their nomination. I have never interfered further than merely to adviſe, and to give ſuch aids as were in my power, on the requiſitions of thoſe officers. The preſent ſituation of that department is delicate and critical, and the choice of an officer to the command may involve very intereſting and important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.</p>
                     <p>It is certainly neceſſary that a body of militia ſhould be immediately called out to reinforce the northern array. In the conference which your committee honoured me with yeſterday evening, I mentioned the number which I thought ſufficient; but my opinion on this point, and the apportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the different States, I wiſh to ſubmit to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, who can beſt determine the quotas that ſhould come from each. I would only obſerve that Connecticut and New-York are already, and may be again, called on, to afford ſuccours to the army at Peekſkill.</p>

I ſhall pay attention to the reſolves tranſmitted; and, as ſoon as circumſtances ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, ſhall propoſe to general Howe an exchange between lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the Heſſian field-officers, and a like number of ours, of equal rank in his hands.</p>
                     <p>I would beg leave to lay before Congreſs a copy of a report made by a board of general officers, held on the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enth inſtant, to conſult of ſeveral matters reſpecting the army.

Congreſs, I am perſuaded, will give it their attention—and, if no good objections of a public nature appear againſt the meaſure, will grant what the officers wiſh and the board have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>

As theſe gentlemen have received the letter upon this ſubject by this time, and will probably be down in the courſe of a few days, I ſhall be glad to be informed

                     <p>THE diſappearance of the enemy's fleet for ſo many days rendering it rather improbable that they will again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, I have thought it adviſeable to remove the army back to Coryel's, where it will be near enough to ſuccour Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, ſhould the enemy, contrary to appearances, ſtill make that the object of their next operation; and will be ſo much the more conveniently ſituated to proceed to the northward, ſhould the event of the preſent ambiguous and perplexing ſituation of things call them that way. I was the more inclined to this ſtep, as the nearneſs of the army to the city, beſides other diſadvantages, afforded a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation both to officers and men, to indulge themſelves in licenſes inconſiſtent with diſcipline and order, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of an injurious tendency.</p>
                     <p>But before my departure, I eſteem it my duty to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to Congreſs the reſult of my examination into the nature of the river-defence proper to be adopted, according to the means in our poſſeſſion, to prevent the ſucceſs of any attempt upon Philadelphia by water. I therefore beg leave to lay before Congreſs what appears to me moſt eligible, conſidering all circumſtances, and comparing my own obſervations with the different opinions of the gentlemen whom I conſulted on the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>It is generally a well-founded maxim, that we ought to endeavour to reduce our defence as much as poſſible to a certainty by collecting our ſtrength and making all our prep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arations at one point, rather than to riſk its being weak and ineffectual every where, by dividing our attention and force to different objects:—in doing this, we may diſable ourſelves from acting with ſufficient vigour any where, and a misfortune in one place may pave the way for a ſimilar
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:029737_0466_0FE29A5C544D53A0"/>
one in another. In our circumſtances we have neither men, cannon, nor any thing elſe to ſpare, and perhaps can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with propriety hazard them on objects, which, being attended with the greateſt ſucceſs we can promiſe ourſelves, can be productive of only partial and indeciſive advantages, and which may poſſibly fail of the end propoſed,—may have ſome ſerious ill conſequences,—and muſt at all events have ſome diſadvantages.</p>
                     <p>It is then to be conſidered where our defence can be moſt effectually made—whether at Billingſport or at Fort-Iſland. It appears to me that the laſt deſerves greatly the preference: Billingſport has but one row of chevaux-de-friſe: Fort-Iſland has three, and, in addition to them, a boom, and another chevaux-de-friſe ready to be ſunk in the channel on the approach of the enemy: of courſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, in this reſpect, are four times as great at the one as at the other. The gallies and floating batteries that could be brought for the defence of the chevaux-de-friſe at Billingſport would be unable to maintain their ſtation when once the enemy were in poſſeſſion of the commanding ground on the Jerſey ſide, to which they would be entirely expoſed; and, notwithſtanding the works raiſing there, even ſuppoſing them complete, the ſtrongeſt advocates for making our defence in this place do not pretend that the event can be protracted more than fifteen or twenty days at moſt; at the end of which time, we ſhould be obliged, with the loſs of our cannon at leaſt, to abandon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and leave it in the power of the enemy to remove or deſtroy the chevaux-de-friſe at pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it by any means certain that a ſingle row of che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaux-de-friſe would be an impenetrable barrier to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's ſhips:—experiments have been made, that lead to a contrary ſuppoſition; and if they ſhould hazard one (which it might be well worth their while to do with ſome of their leſs valuable ſhips) under favour of a leading breeze and tide, and ſhould ſucceed in it,—the conſequence might be the loſs of our gallies and floating batteries, which I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend might be intercepted, and (with the aſſiſtance of their gallies and ſmall armed veſſels) taken: and this would greatly weaken the oppoſition we might otherwiſe give at Fort-Iſland, and tend powerfully to tender it abortive.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="129" facs="unknown:029737_0467_0FE29ABB4E2B78D0"/>
But if they ſhould not attempt this, contenting themſelves with ſafer though ſlower operations, I have already obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it is agreed on all hands, in fifteen or twenty days they would be able to poſſeſs themſelves of infallible means of fruſtrating our oppoſition there by the capture of our works. And if we add to this that it might very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly happen in leſs time,—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> no other cauſe, yet, from the garriſon being intimidated by a conſciouſneſs of its own inferiority and inability to ſupport itſelf againſt a ſo much ſuperior force of numbers, which might occaſion a conduct deſtructive to itſelf,—there will remain no ſufficient reaſons to juſtify the making this the principal point of defence.</p>
                     <p>At Fort-Iſland, the boom and chevaux-de-friſe are an ample ſecurity againſt any forcible impreſſion of the enemy's ſhips, which it would be imprudent in them to attempt. On the Jerſey ſide, the ſituation of the ground is ſuch, that the gallies, floating-batteries, and forts, employed in the defence of the obſtructions, would have little to fear from any batteries erected there. Red-bank ſeems by its eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be the only advantageous ſpot for annoying them: but as it is computed to be above nineteen hundred yards from Fort-Iſland, the diſtance is rather too great to allow any battery raiſed there to act with ſuch effect as to be able to ſilence our fire. On this ſide, the ground, by dikes and ſluices, may be laid under water to ſo conſiderable an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as to leave no danger of our river force being annoyed from thence; for which purpoſe ſuitable preparations ought at once to be made, againſt it be neceſſary to carry them into effect.</p>
                     <p>But though a battery upon Red-bank would not, in my apprehenſion, be able to prevent the efficacy of our defence, or give any material diſturbance to Fort-Iſland in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, yet it might ſerve to make the ſituation of ſome of our gallies rather uneaſy; and this perhaps makes it worth while to pre-occupy it in order to keep it out of the enemy's hands, erecting a ſmall but ſtrong work there, capable of containing about two hundred men, with ſix or eight pieces of light cannon and a proportionable quantity of ſtores. As the approaches to it are difficult on account of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent creeks, and a communication can be kept open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and our army,—by which means the garriſon
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:029737_0468_0FE29A5E0CA5D6B8"/>
might receive ſuccours from time to time,—though we could not expect to make it impregnable, yet we ſhould have a proſpect of holding it much longer than we could the work at Billingſport. In the poſition, which, from my preſent view of it, I ſhould think it beſt for our army to take, the left wing of it would be nearly oppoſite to Red-bank, and therefore in a condition to relieve and ſupport it;—whereas Billingſport being more remote from the probable poſition of the army, and detached from any other work, could not eaſily derive any aſſiſtance from without, and muſt rely wholly upon its own ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Either at Billingſport or at Fort-Iſland, I believe there is not much to be apprehended from the fire of the enemy's ſhips unaided by land-batteries: for, as by the information of thoſe who ought to be acquainted with the fact, not more than three ſhips can act a-breaſt at a time at either place,—and as the gallies, not requiring the ſame depth of water, can extend themſelves at pleaſure, and beſides carry a ſuperior weight of metal to that which frigates commonly have,—a much ſuperior fire could be oppoſed to them than any they could bring, and (from the difference of ſize and make between the frigates and gallies) to much better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than theirs. The comparative extent of the river at Billingſport and at Fort-Iſland has been aſſigned as a motive of preference to the former,—the river being narrower there than at the latter, and ſuppoſed to admit of fewer ſhips op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erating at a time: but as it is aſſerted by the gentlemen in the river department, that the ſand-banks and ſhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the river in moſt places near Fort-Iſland compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate for the width of it, and make it impoſſible for more than three ſhips to act together at a time,—this reaſon for preferring the poſition at Billingſport ſeems to have no foundation. And if we conſider that our whole force of gallies and floating batteries would be collected at Fort-Iſland, aſſiſted by the fort itſelf,—and that it would not be ſafe to truſt them all out for the defence of Billingſport for fear of the diſaſter already ſuggeſted,—it ſeems evident enough that this is the place where our defence may be moſt ſucceſsfully made.</p>
                     <p>One of the moſt weighty conſiderations with me is that our army, as before intimated, could more conveniently
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:029737_0469_0FE29ABCD4E84F68"/>
co-operate with the defence by water here than at Billingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. The ground on this ſide is better ſituated here than at the other place: and the army being ſo much nearer the city, it is ſo much the leſs likely that the enemy ſhould be able, by a circuitous route, to fall into the rear of it, and ſeparate it from the city,—which is a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that ought carefully to be attended to.</p>
                     <p>Some gentlemen are of opinion that our principal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence ought to be upon Fort-Iſland and its appendages: but, at the ſame time, that we ſhould make a part of our defence at Billingſport,—propoſing, for that purpoſe, that the works there ſhould be continued on the new contracted ſcale, to be garriſoned by four or five hundred men. The reaſons for this are, that it would ſerve to delay the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and give our army time to come up, ſhould it be at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ay diſtance,—and that it would prevent thoſe diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble impreſſions which never fail to accompany the aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning works that have been once raiſed, and plans that have been once in execution, eſpecially when the perſons concerned in the defence of them repoſe a degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in them,—which is ſaid to be the caſe in the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent inſtance.</p>
                     <p>But theſe reaſons may perhaps not be ſo concluſive as it is imagined: for it is a queſtion, whether, if our army was ſo remote as to make ſuch a delay neceſſary, the enemy would embarraſs themſelves with removing the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obſtructions in the firſt place, but would not rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark and make a rapid march by land, poſſeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the city, and of thoſe poſitions which would make the ſurrender of the gallies, &amp;c. in ſome ſort a nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural conſequence. And it is worthy of conſideration whether the abandoning the works begun at this time, which will probably allow ſome leiſure for any diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able impreſſions it might make to be effaced, will not be leſs injurious than the abandoning them hereafter when they have coſt more expenſe, time and labour, and in the critical moment of an attack, when every misfortune, and the loſs of the moſt inconſiderable poſt, is too apt to have a much worſe influence on the mind, than the real import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it will juſtify.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="132" facs="unknown:029737_0470_0FE29A5F91943A98"/>
Add to this the poſſibility that the garriſon, diſmayed at the approach of numbers ſo ſuperior to their own, might not anſwer the end expected from them, and might even be loſt by their timidity;—the certainty of loſing the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non after the time limited for the defence, and thereby weakening that of the upper poſition;—the chance of loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gallies and floating-batteries requiſite for covering the chevaux-de-friſe, by a hazardous and ſucceſsful attempt to break through them,—and the garriſon with them, which would fall of courſe upon ſuch an event. It is however ſubmitted to Congreſs to balance the advantages and diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and determine accordingly. I would only beg leave to give it clearly as my opinion that our principle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence ought to be upon Fort-Iſland and the obſtructions there, and that Billingſport ought not by any means to be defended more than as a ſecondary object: and, to that end, I would recommend that the works on Fort-Iſland,—which, on their preſent conſtruction, are by no means calculated for the defence of the chevaux-de-friſe,—be immediately altered and adapted to that purpoſe, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing care at the ſame time to make them defenſible with a ſmall number of men againſt any ſudden attempt to land in boats and carry them by aſſault.</p>
                     <p>But, whatever ſcheme is purſued, I could wiſh the greateſt diligence and diſpatch may be uſed in bringing it to maturity: for, though the danger which lately threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened ſeems to have ſubſided, there is no knowing how ſoon it may return: and certainly it will be prudent to do every thing in our power to be prepared for it, as we can loſe nothing by being ſo, and may loſe a great deal by neglecting to improve the interval of leiſure they have given us, ſhould it be their intention to reviſit this quarter. As the means to this, it will be neceſſary to furniſh Mr. Coud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, to whom the ſuperintendency of thoſe works is entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a competent number of workmen, tools, and what other things he may want, to enable him to carry them on with propriety, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aſe, and expedition.</p>
                     <p>On the whole, I am of opinion that the obſtructions in the river, with the help of gallies, floating-batteries, and with tolerable induſtry to put the land works in a proper ſtate, will be extremely formidable to the enemy, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe

a reaſonable expectation of their being effectual. The fire-ſhips alſo will contribute to this end: for though there are many obſtacles to render their ſucceſs precarious, and a happy concurrence of circumſtances is neceſſary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it,—any of which failing may diſappoint the project, and there is therefore no room to be ſanguine, yet there is ſome probability of its ſucceeding; and they will be at leaſt an embarraſſment and terror to the enemy, and will oblige them to uſe precautions inconvenient to them, and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to us.</p>
                     <p>As an accurate knowledge of the country is eſſential to a good defence,—and as the enemy's approach may be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and we may be called to act, without having time, when it happens, to examine it ſufficiently if it is not done beforehand, it would anſwer a valuable purpoſe to have it immediately carefully reconnoitred, and ſketches taken of all the landing places, great roads, and by-paths, encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounds, heights, rivers, creeks, moraſſes, and every thing that it can be of any importance to know. Marcus-Hook ſeems to be the moſt advanced place at which it is conjectured the enemy will land; the ſurvey ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore comprehend all the country between that and Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia. Monſieur Du Coudray has offered his ſervice, with his engineers, to do this buſineſs, if authoriſed by Congreſs, only requiring that they may be ſupplied with horſes and a hand or two. If Congreſs approve of it, I ſhall be glad they may be deſired to enter upon it without loſs of time.</p>

                     <p>MONSIEUR Du Coudray has laid before me a plan of the river, by which it appears that, for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſpace between the two ſand-banks on the eaſt ſide of Fort-Iſland, there is from four to four and a half fathoms depth of water. According to this repreſentation, there would be room for three frigates to lie between thoſe banks in ſuch a poſition as to en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ilade the works at Fort-Iſland, and make it difficult to maintain them.</p>
                     <p>There are but two ways of remedying this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;—one by having a ſufficient number of chevaux-de-friſe ſunk at the entrance between the two banks;—and the other, by having the leſt flank of Fort-Iſland fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſupported by a good battery capable of reſiſting the cannon of the ſhips, and obliging them to quit their ſtation. The firſt is evidently preferable, becauſe the efficacy of it will be more certain. A few chevaux-de-friſe properly placed might effectually bar all acceſs to the ſhips: but there is a poſſibility that any battery we can conſtruct might be overpowered by the fire of the ſhipping: and as
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:029737_0473_0FE29AC6DEDE5418"/>
we have few cannon, and Fort-Iſland is itſelf a marſhy ſpot, incapable of affording earth for the batteries neceſſary to be raiſed upon it, which muſt be brought from the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſhore,—it would not be prudent to multiply works there more than cannot be avoided. It would alſo be a great advantage gained, to ſecure the Iſland from annoyance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in one point, and that in front, from only three ſhips at a time,—which would be effected by ſtopping up the paſſage between the two banks with chevaux-de-friſe. I ſhould therefore think it of importance to have this meaſure immediately adopted and carried into execution.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I DO myſelf the honour of addreſſing a few lines to Congreſs on a ſubject which appears to me of infinite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and to have a claim to their ſerious attention. The matter I allude to is the exorbitant price exacted by merchants and venders of goods for every neceſſary they diſpoſe of. I am ſenſible the trouble and riſk in importing give the adventurers a right to a generous price, and that ſuch, from motives of policy, ſhould be paid: but yet I cannot conceive that they, in direct violation of every prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of generoſity, of reaſon, and of juſtice, ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed (if it is poſſible to reſtrain them) to avail themſelves of the difficulties of the times, and to amaſs fortunes upon the public ruin.</p>
                     <p>This grievance is now an object of univerſal complaint, and of univerſal apprehenſion: and the conſequences that are likely to reſult from a continuance of it excite in every well-affected mind the moſt diſagreeable feelings. The incloſed copy of a memorial from a part of the Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia officers ſhews their ſentiments upon the ſubject: and I am perſuaded thoſe of the whole army are ſimilar, as they have and do experience the groſs abuſes they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of. I know that ways and means for preventing this evil wholly, are difficult (if practicable) to find out: but I ſhould hope that Congreſs themſelves, or the ſupreme
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:029737_0474_0FE29A6BA7DB8590"/>
powers in the reſpective States, through their recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may deviſe ſome mode by which it may be redreſſed in part.</p>
                     <p>I think there are two meaſures, which, if adopted and put under proper regulations, would be of conſiderable ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the public, and to the army, at the ſame time that they would contribute a good deal to do away part of the uneaſineſs of the latter, ariſing from the enormous prices they are compelled to pay for neceſſaries. The firſt is the eſtabliſhment of public tanneries in three or four of the States, under care of a judicious commiſſary or director, to which all the hides of the cattle killed for the army ſhould be carried, and tanned. There ſhould be alſo deputies to attend the army to collect the hides: and it appears to me that eſtabliſhing the tanneries in different States,—for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance one in this, and another in Connecticut,—will be much more adviſeable than fixing only one in either of them; as the buſineſs may be carried on more extenſively, with more convenience, and at leſs expenſe, than if the raw hides were to be tranſported to one place only, from which probably there would be a neceſſity of carrying them the whole diſtance back again after they were dreſſed. This ſubject was under conſideration of Congreſs once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and a commiſſary (if I recollect, a Mr. Phillips) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, who declined the office. Leather is of ſuch eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential uſe, and ſo indiſpenſably neceſſary for ſhoes and other purpoſes in the army, that too much care nor too effectual means cannot be taken to procure it.</p>
                     <p>What I have ventured to mention, if gone into, will add much to our ſupplies, and, I am certain, will prevent the high and unjuſtifiable prices demanded for this article when in the hands of private owners. Beſides, at thoſe tanne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, a number of artiſts, ſuch as ſhoe and harneſs makers, might be employed to work the leather up.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, ſince our imports of ſpirit have become ſo precarious, nay impracticable, on account of the enemy's fleet which infeſts our whole coaſt,—I would beg leave to ſuggeſt the propriety of erecting public diſtilleries in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent States. The benefits ariſing from the moderate uſe of ſtrong liquor have been experienced in all armies, and are not to be diſputed. In the preſent ſituation of affairs, our
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:029737_0475_0FE29AC9EF5C92A0"/>
ſoldiery cannot obtain ſuch ſupplies as are abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and if they are fortunate enough to get any, it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> from the ſutlers at moſt extravagant rates, and at ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to tell of. This is a ſource of much complaint, and, I ſhould hope, may be removed by appointing proper perſons to buy grain and diſtil it for the army,—large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of which may be eaſily procured, and on reaſonable terms, in many of the States.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect to the obſervation in the memorial about ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> certain the preſent allowed value is by no means ſufficient; nor does it anſwer the purpoſe intended. Since that was fixed, proviſions, like every other article, though not from the ſame cauſes, have become extremely dear; and what at that time was a juſt equivalent, is totally inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate now. This matter, I doubt not, will have the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Congreſs, and ſuch regulations be made reſpecting it, as may be right and equitable.</p>
                     <p>It appears to me, from the information I have received, that two companies, each to conſiſt of ſixty men at leaſt, under proper officers, of unſuſpected attachment, ſpirit and activity,—ſhould be immediately raiſed, to guard the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory and ſtores at Carliſle. Their ſecurity is of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able importance, and ought to be attended to. Theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, beſides ſerving as a guard, will be frequently of uſe as eſcorts and convoys to ſtores. If Congreſs ſhould deem them neceſſary, and order them to be enliſted, yet I would recommend that they ſhould not be raiſed as merely ſtation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary or local,—having found from experience that regiments or companies formed upon ſuch a footing enter upon other ſervices with great diſcontent and reluctance, though the occaſion ſhould be never ſo preſſing.</p>
                     <p>In a letter of the thirteenth of June, I ſubmitted to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs an application from the officers of cavalry reſpecting their horſes,—whether they were to be provided at their own or the public expenſe. I alſo laid before them, in a letter of the fifth of July, captain Sullivan's requiſition for pay. I ſhall be glad to be honoured with their determination upon theſe ſubjects, and alſo in general reſpecting the line of conduct I ſhould purſue as to the pay of officers taken priſoners at any time before the cloſe of the laſt campaign, who have been permitted to be on parole;—and wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:029737_0476_0FE29A6D2B899D58"/>
there is to be any diſtinction between ſuch of them as are continued by new appointments, and thoſe who are not. I have frequent applications in theſe inſtances, and wiſh to know how to act.</p>
                     <p>Since the expreſs from general Schuyler left this, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a letter from governor Clinton, a copy of which, and of its incloſures, I herewith tranſmit, as they give a much more favourable account of the affair at Fort-Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, than was contained in his letter.</p>

                     <p>SINCE I wrote to you on the twelfth inſtant on the ſubject of the militia under the command of general New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, I have received another letter from him, which you have incloſed. By this it appears that the men were not employed in any way while they were at Red-bank, and that they are now anxious to get home to their farms, as they ſee no immediate occaſion for their ſervices. As I had in ſome meaſure put them under the direction of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Du Coudray, I did not chooſe to give them a diſcharge without conſulting you, though in my opinion they had better be ſuffered to go home than be kept diſcontented, as they will turn out with more ſpirit when they are wanted again. The bearer waits upon you for your determination.</p>

                     <p>FROM the time which has clapſed ſince general Howe departed from the Capes of Delaware, there is the ſtrongeſt reaſon to conclude that he is gone far either to the eaſtward or ſouthward, and with a deſign to execute ſome determined plan. The danger of the ſea,—the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his troops muſt ſuſtain from being ſo long confined,—the loſs of time, ſo late in the campaign,—will ſcarcely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ſuppoſition that he is merely making a feint, and ſtill
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:029737_0479_0FE29ACCF74DBAE8"/>
intends to return either to Delaware or the North-river, without performing ſome enterpriſe firſt in another quarter. The probability is in favour of a ſouthern expedition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has been ſeen, ſince his departure from the Capes, off Sinapuxent, ſteering a ſouthern courſe,—and becauſe, had his deſtination been to the eaſtward, his arrival there, from the general ſtate of the winds, muſt have announced it before this, or his fleet would have been diſcovered by ſome of the cruiſers on that coaſt.</p>
                     <p>If he is gone to the ſouthward, he muſt be gone far that way: for, had Cheſapeak-bay been his object, he would have been there long ſince, and the fact well eſtabliſhed. Beyond that, there is no place ſhort of Charleſton, of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient importance to engage his attention. The extenſive commerce,—the vaſt accumulation of military and other ſtores in that town and its dependencies,—with the eclat it would give his arms if he ſhould unfortunately take it,—afford him ſtronger inducements to direct his operations there, than he could poſſibly have elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>Matters being thus circumſtanced, an important queſtion ariſes,—how this army is to be employed?—If his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſuch as I have ſuppoſed them, it appears to me that an attempt to follow him would not only be fruitleſs, but would be attended with the moſt ruinous conſequences. The diſtance is ſo immenſe that general Howe might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh every purpoſe he had in view, before we could poſſibly arrive to oppoſe him; and ſo long a march through an unhealthy climate at this ſeaſon would debilitate and waſte a principal part of our force. Added to this,—after we had made a conſiderable progreſs, he might eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embark his troops and turn his arms againſt Philadelphia or elſewhere, as he ſhould think proper, without our being in a condition to give the leaſt aid.</p>
                     <p>As theſe, and many other reaſons which will readily occur to Congreſs, will ſhew the impracticability of our counteracting general Howe in that quarter with any good effect, we have no other alternative left than to remain here idle and inactive, on the remote probability of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning this way,—or to proceed towards Hudſon's-river, with a view of oppoſing general Burgoyne, or making an attempt on York-Iſland, as the ſituation of affairs ſhall
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:029737_0480_0FE29A703148DDF8"/>
point out. A ſucceſsful ſtroke with reſpect to either would be attended with the moſt ſignal advantages, and would be the beſt compenſation we could make for any loſſes we may ſuſtain to the ſouthward. Beſides theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,—if, after all our conjectures and reaſoning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject, general Howe ſhould be gone to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to co-operate with Mr. Burgoyne, the army will be, by the movement propoſed, ſo far on its way, to prevent, I hope, the ſucceſs of his enterpriſe.</p>
                     <p>The above reaſons led me to call a council of general officers this morning, to take the ſubject of removing the troops from hence into conſideration: and I am happy to inform Congreſs they were in ſentiment with me upon the occaſion, as they will perceive by a copy of the proceedings then had, which I do myſelf the honour of laying before them. Nevertheleſs, as it is a movement which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the moſt important conſequences, I have thought proper to ſubmit it to Congreſs for their deliberation and deciſion. If it is deemed expedient, we have perhaps not a moment to loſe in carrying it into execution; and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this perſuaſion, I have ſent colonel Hamilton, one of my aides, (who will have the honour of delivering this) to bring me the reſult of their opinion.</p>
                     <p>As the northern department has been all along conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered ſeparate, and in ſome meaſure diſtinct, and there are ſpecial reſolves veſting the command in particular perſons,—in caſe it ſhould hereafter appear eligible to unite the two armies, it may perhaps be neceſſary that Congreſs ſhould place the matter upon ſuch a footing as to remove all ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or difficulties about the command, that could poſſibly ariſe on my arrival there. This I requeſt, from a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to harmony, and from my knowing the ill and fatal conſequences that have often ariſen from ſuch controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and not from the moſt diſtant apprehenſion that one would take place upon ſuch an event. The thing however is poſſible; and to guard againſt it, can do no injury.</p>

                     <p>I AM this moment honoured with yours of this morning, containing ſeveral pieces of intelligence of the fleet's having been ſeen off the Capes of Virginia on the fifteenth inſtant. I ſhall, in conſequence of this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, halt upon my preſent ground till I hear ſomething further.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Pinckney of South-Carolina paid me a viſit two days ago. He informed me that the military ſtores in Charleſton and the neighbourhood were immenſe, and that he did not believe that the governor or commanding officer there had had the leaſt intimation of the fleet's hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtood to the ſouthward; and he ſeemed very apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, that if Charleſton was their object, they would find them lulled into ſecurity, and quite unprepared for an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack. As I cannot yet think that general Howe ſeriouſly intends to go into Cheſapeak, I would by all means adviſe that an expreſs be immediately diſpatched (if one has not already gone) to warn them of their danger, to let them prepare in the beſt manner for defence, and to adviſe them to remove all ſupernumerary ſtores.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall immediately call upon governor Livingſton to furniſh the number of militia from the State of Jerſey, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by requiſition of Congreſs, to garriſon the forts in the Highlands, while the New-York militia march to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the northern army.</p>

No letters came for you from general Schuyler; and therefore, agreeable to your requeſt, I tranſmit you a copy of one I received from him, and of the material papers which it covered. Among the copies, you will find general Burgoyne's inſtructions at large to lieutenant-colonel Baum, pointing out the objects of his command when he was firſt detached. What we had before was after he marched, and was an anſwer to a report he had received from him. There was alſo a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in his name before, being called Bom in the copies ſent by general Lincoln.</p>

                     <p>Two diviſions of the army moved this morning, and will proceed after a ſhort halt near this place to refreſh themſelves: the remainder will continue on their ground to-day, in order to reſt and recover from the fatigue of the march yeſterday and the day before.

I could not find out from inquiry what number is landed, nor form an eſtimate of it from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant view I had of their encampment. But few tents were to be ſeen from Iron-hill and Gray's-hill, which are the only eminences about Elk. I am happy to inform you that all the public ſtores are removed from thence, except about ſeven thouſand buſhels of corn. This I urged the commiſſary there to get off as ſoon as poſſible, and hope it will be effected in the courſe of a few days, if the enemy ſhould not prevent,—which their ſituation gives them but too eaſy an opportunity of doing. The ſcarcity of teams in proportion to the demand will render the removal rather

tedious, though I have directed the quarter-maſter to ſend ſome from hence to expedite the meaſure.</p>
                     <p>A part of the Delaware militia are ſtationed there; and about nine hundred more from Pennſylvania are now on the march that way. I alſo intended to move part of the army that way to-day, but am under the neceſſity of deferring it till their arms are put in order, and they are furniſhed with ammunition,—both having been greatly injured by the heavy rains that fell yeſterday and laſt night.</p>

                     <p>HAVING endeavoured, at the ſolicitation of the count De Pulaſki, to think of ſome mode for employing him in our ſervice, there is none occurs to me, liable to ſo few inconveniences and exceptions as the giving him the command of the horſe. This department is ſtill without a head, as I have not, in the preſent deficiency of brigadiers with the army, thought it adviſeable to take one from the foot for that command. The nature of the horſe ſervice with us being ſuch that they commonly act in detachments, a general officer with them is leſs neceſſary than at the head of the brigades of infantry. In the abſence of gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Smallwood, who is ordered to put himſelf at the head of the Maryland militia, we ſhall have two brigades without general officers.</p>
                     <p>But though the horſe will ſuffer leſs from the want of a general officer than the foot, a man of real capacity, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and knowledge in that ſervice, might be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſeful. The count appears, by his recommendations, to have ſuſtained no inconſiderable military character in his own country: and as the principal attention in Poland has been for ſome time paſt paid to the cavalry, it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed this gentleman is not unacquainted with it. I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to Congreſs how far it may be eligible to confer the appointment I have mentioned upon him: they will be ſenſible of all the objections attending the meaſure, without my particulariſing them, and can determine accordingly.</p>

This gentleman, we are told, has been, like us, engaged in defending the liberty and independence of his country, and has ſacrificed his fortune to his zeal for thoſe objects. He derives from hence a title to our reſpect, that ought to operate in his favour, as far as the good of the ſervice will permit: but it can never be expected we ſhould loſe ſight of this.</p>

                     <p>The enemy advanced a part of their army yeſterday to Gray's-hill about two miles on this ſide of Elk,—wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with intent to take poſt there, or to cover while they remove what ſtores they found in the town, I cannot yet determine. I do not know what quantity of private prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty remained: but of the public there were ſeveral thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand buſhels of corn and oats, which might have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved alſo, had not moſt of the teams in the country been employed by private perſons in bringing off very valuable goods.</p>
                     <p>Our light parties yeſterday took between thirty and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty priſoners: twelve deſerters from the navy and eight from the army have already come in; but they are able to give us very little intelligence. They generally agree that their troops are healthy, but that their horſes ſuffered very much by the voyage.</p>

                     <p>How far the enemy have it in view to extend themſelves in a line from bay to bay, I cannot determine: but the idea has taken place with many; and it is ſaid to be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their hints to ſome perſons, who, from accident in ſome inſtances, and perhaps choice in others, have had a more familiar intercourſe with them. I cannot ſuppoſe they have any ſuch deſign, or, if they have, that it can be more than temporary for procuring ſupplies of proviſions.</p>
                     <p>General Howe's declaration is agreeable to his conſtant uſage, and is what we might reaſonably expect. The only difference is, the preſent exhibition is ſtyled a <hi>'declaration.'</hi> It is another effort to ſeduce the people to give up their rights, and to encourage our ſoldiery to deſert. The facts contained in the depoſition of Francis Alexander, which you have alſo incloſed, ſeem to be oppoſed to that regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and diſcipline which are promiſed by the declaration.</p>
                     <p>Yeſterday there was ſome ſkirmiſhing between one of our advanced parties and one of the enemy's, in which they were obliged to retreat, with the loſs of an officer and
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:029737_0488_0FE29AE459041D20"/>
three men killed, according to report. We had one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate wounded.</p>
                     <p>I have received no particular accounts reſpecting the Maryland eaſtern ſhore militia: from the beſt informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have, a great many are well diſpoſed to turn out, but are prevented giving their aid through the want of arms. Apprehending that the militia there would ſtand in need of an officer to arrange them, I wrote to general Cadwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lader, requeſting his good offices, which I am told have been exerted. Colonel Giſt is now gone down, and I expect will move on as ſoon as poſſible, with ſuch as are armed, towards the enemy. General Smallwood is gone to take the command of thoſe on the weſtern ſhore, of whom I hear many are collecting:—but I have no authentic ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices on the ſubject.</p>

                     <p>I THIS minute returned to head-quarters, where I found your favour of this date, with the reſolves reſpecting general Sullivan, and colonel Richardſon's battalion. I had converſed with general Sullivan upon the ſubject, and obſerved to him that it was neceſſary an inquiry ſhould be had relative to the affair of Staten-Iſland, as his conduct was cenſured, and much diſſatisfaction prevailed. He was ſenſible of the propriety of the meaſure, and expreſſed a deſire that it ſhould take place, provided he could have the benefit of general Smallwood's teſtimony, who was on the expedition. That gentleman happens at this time to be in Maryland; which muſt neceſſarily delay the inquiry, unleſs ſome mode can be agreed upon for obtaining his ſentiments upon the matter.</p>
                     <p>This morning the enemy came out with a conſiderable force and three pieces of artillery, againſt our light advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed corps, and, after ſome pretty ſmart ſkirmiſhing, obliged them to retreat,—being far inferior in number, and without cannon. The loſs on either ſide is not yet aſcertained: ours, though not exactly known, is not very considerable: theirs, we have reaſon to believe, was much greater, as ſome of our parties, compoſed of expert markſmen, had opportunities of giving them ſeveral cloſe, well-directed fires,—more particularly in one inſtance, when a body of riflemen formed a kind of ambuſcade. They advanced about two miles this ſide of Iron-hill, and then withdrew to that place, leaving a piquet at Couch's mill, about a mile in front. Our parties now lie at White Clay creek, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the advanced piquets, which are at Chriſtiana bridge.</p>
                     <p>On Monday a large detachment of the enemy landed at Cecil court-houſe; and this morning I had advice of their having advanced on the Newcaſtle road as far as Carſon's tavern. Parties of horſe were ſent out to reconnoitre them, which went three miles beyond the Red Lion, but could neither ſee nor hear of them; whence I conjecture they filed off by a road to their left, and fell in with their main body. The deſign of their movement this morning ſeems to have been to diſperſe our light troops who had been troubleſome to them, and to gain poſſeſſion of Iron-hill,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:029737_0490_0FE29AE72FBB92F0"/>

had no expectation that more than three hundred of the thouſand called for to garriſon the poſts in the Highlands, would march, notwithſtanding he had iſſued orders for that purpoſe; and that three weeks would probably elapſe before that number went. If the requiſition can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, he has no doubt of general Dickinſon's exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and is ſatisfied of the propriety of appointing him to the command. This, he imagines, would have followed of courſe, as he is major-general of all the militia in the State, and has given ample teſtimony, as well of his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity as of his firmneſs and bravery.</p>

Upon reconnoitring their ſituation, it appeared proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they only meant to amuſe us in front, while their real intent was to march by our right, and, by ſuddenly paſſing the Brandiwine and gaining the heights upon the north ſide of that river, get between us and Philadelphia, and cut us off from that city. To prevent this, it was judged expedient to change our poſition immediately: the army accordingly marched at two o'clock this morning, and will take poſt this evening upon the high grounds near

                     <p>YESTERDAY evening I received the honour of your letter of the ninth, with its ſeveral incloſures. I have written to general Putnam to detach the fifteen hundred men mentioned by Congreſs, and incloſe my letter upon the ſubject, which you will be pleaſed to forward to him by the earlieſt opportunity.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect to the ſubject of monſieur Du Coudray's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I would beg leave to obſerve, however eligible the meaſure might otherwiſe be which he recommends, an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to carry it into execution at this time would anſwer no valuable purpoſe, as the work in all probability could not be more than marked out when it would be wanted. I would alſo add that I do not conceive any great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages could be derived from it, ſuppoſing it could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted,—as we are certain the enemy will never attack lines which they can avoid. If they were obliged to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach Philadelphia by a particular route, in ſuch caſe no exertions ſhould be ſpared to erect works, and the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the plan would be highly expedient.</p>
                     <p>The enemy are now lying near Kennet's Square, and in a tolerably compact body. They have parties advanced on the Lancaſter road, and on thoſe leading over this ford and to Wilmington. Manoeuvring appears to be their plan. I hope, notwithſtanding, that we ſhall be able to find out their real intended route, and to defeat their purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>By light-horſemen this inſtant come in, the enemy are in motion, and appear to be advancing towards us. His excellency is giving the neceſſary orders, and getting the troops under arms, which prevents him from ſigning this himſelf, as was intended at firſt.</p>

By the laſt advices from our reconnoitring par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they had halted in a low ground ſtrongly flanked by two hills, about a mile below Welch's tavern. It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed they moved from the poſt they occupied this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for want of water.

                     <p>WHEN I had the honour of addreſſing you this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I mentioned that the enemy were advancing, and had begun a cannonade. I would now beg leave to inform you that they have kept up a briſk fire from their artillery ever ſince. Their advanced party was attacked by our light troops under general Maxwell, who croſſed the Brandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine for that purpoſe, and had poſted his men on ſome high grounds on each ſide the road. The fire from our people was not of long duration, as the enemy preſſed on in force,—but was very ſevere.</p>
                     <p>What loſs the enemy ſuſtained, cannot be aſcertained with preciſion: but, from our ſituation and the briſkneſs
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:029737_0494_0FE29AEB94CDA730"/>
of the attack, it is the general opinion, particularly of thoſe who were engaged, that they had at leaſt three hundred men killed and wounded. Our damage is not exactly known: but, from the beſt accounts we have been able to obtain, it does not exceed fifty in the whole.</p>
                     <p>After this affair, the enemy halted upon the heights, where they have remained ever ſince, except a detachment of them which filed off about eleven o'clock from their left, and which has ſince paſſed Brandiwine a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There has been a ſcattering looſe fire between our parties on each ſide the creek ſince the action in the morning, which juſt now became warm, when general Maxwell paſſed over with his corps, and drove them from their ground with the loſs of thirty men left dead on the ſpot, (among them a captain of the forty-ninth) and a number of entrenching tools with which they were throwing up a battery.</p>
                     <p>At half after four o'clock the enemy attacked general Sullivan at the ford next above this, and the action has been very violent ever ſince. It ſtill continues. A very ſevere canonade has begun here too; and I ſuppoſe we ſhall have a very hot evening:—I hope it will be a happy one.</p>

                     <p>I AM ſorry to inform you, that, in this day's engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we have been obliged to leave the enemy maſters of the field. Unfortunately, the intelligence received, of the enemy's advancing up the Brandiwine and croſſing at a ford about ſix miles above us, was uncertain and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory, notwithſtanding all my pains to get the beſt. This prevented me making a diſpoſition adequate to the force
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:029737_0495_0FE29B58EC8D1338"/>
with which the enemy attacked us on our right; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, the troops firſt engaged were obliged to retire before they could be reinforced. In the midſt of the attack on the right, that body of the enemy, which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the other ſide of Chad's ford, croſſed it, and attacked the diviſion there under the command of general Wayne, and the light troops under general Maxwell, who, after a ſevere conflict, alſo retired. The militia under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of general Armſtrong, being poſted at a ford about two miles below Chad's, had no opportunity of engaging.</p>
                     <p>But, though we fought under many diſadvantages, and were, from the cauſes above mentioned, obliged to retire, yet our loſs of men is not, I am perſuaded, very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,—I believe much leſs than the enemy's. We have alſo loſt ſeven or eight pieces of cannon, according to the beſt information I can at preſent obtain. The baggage, having been previouſly moved off, is all ſecure, ſaving the men's blankets, which being at their backs, many of them doubtleſs are loſt.</p>
                     <p>I have directed all the troops to aſſemble behind Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where they are now arranging for this night. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the misfortune of the day, I am happy to find the troops in good ſpirits: and I hope another time we ſhall compenſate for the loſſes now ſuſtained.</p>
                     <p>The marquis La Fayette was wounded in the leg, and general Woodford in the hand: divers other officers were wounded, and ſome ſlain; but the numbers of either can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now be aſcertained.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE been honoured with your favour of this date. I heartily wiſh the works on Delaware were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted: but I think,—and in this opinion my officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,—that the ſervice will be injured if any part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental troops were now to be employed about them. If
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:029737_0496_0FE29AF48463E6C0"/>
we ſhould be able to oppoſe general Howe with ſucceſs in the field, the works will be unneceſſary: if not, and he ſhould force us from hence, he will certainly poſſeſs himſelf of them. But, to prevent his attempting it now, I have directed the meadows on Province-Iſland to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed immediately, and any other grounds that may be thought neceſſary for that purpoſe. The works have been more peculiarly under the direction of monſieur Du Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dray; and I doubt not he will pay every attention to their completion and ſecurity, that the ſituation of affairs will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of.</p>
                     <p>A part of the militia under general Armſtrong will be poſted along Schuylkill, to throw up redoubts at the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fords which will be occaſionally occupied, whilſt I move to the other ſide with the main body of the army. This diſpoſition appears to me the moſt eligible from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all circumſtances, and better than if any part of our preſent force was to be employed at the forts. If further reinforcements of the militia ſhould come in, they perhaps may be more properly aſſigned to that buſineſs than any we now have.</p>
                     <p>Your letter reſpecting general De Borre juſt now came to hand: I ſhall tranſmit him a copy of it and of the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. There can be no court of inquiry into his conduct at this time:—as ſoon as the ſtate of the army will admit, it will be held.</p>

                     <p>YOUR favour of yeſterday, with its ſeveral inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, came to hand laſt night. Though I would willingly pay every attention to the reſolutions of Congreſs, yet, in the late inſtance reſpecting the recal of general Sullivan, I muſt beg leave to defer giving any order about it till I hear further from that honourable body. Our ſituation at this time is critical and delicate; and nothing ſhould be done to add to its embarraſſments. We are now moſt probably on the point of another action, and to derange the army by withdrawing ſo many general officers from it, may and muſt be attended with many diſagreeable if not ruinous conſequences. Such a proceeding at another time might not produce any bad effects: but how can the army be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly conducted with a proſpect of ſucceſs, if the general of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers are taken off in the moment of battle?—Congreſs may rely upon it, ſuch a meaſure will not promote but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the ſervice.</p>
                     <p>It is not my wiſh to prevent or to delay a proper inquiry into general Sullivan's conduct a ſingle inſtant, when the circumſtances of the army will admit: but now they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit it, and (I think) the ſuſpenſion in his command alſo. The recal of general St. Clair obliged me to part with general Lincoln whom I could but ill ſpare; ſo that the whole charge of his diviſion is now upon general Wayne, there being no other brigadier in it than himſelf. The Maryland troops, if general Sullivan is taken away, will not have one general officer, general Smallwood being at the head of the militia coming from that State, and general De Borre ſuſpended:—added to this, colonel Gift, who commands one regiment of them, is now from it by order. In a word, Sir, whether the charges alleged againſt general
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:029737_0498_0FE29AF643193E50"/>
Sullivan are true or falſe, or whether his conduct has been exceptionable or not, I am ſatisfied the reſolution for his recal at this time was unhappily adopted, and, if carried into execution, will not fail to add new difficulties to our preſent diſtreſſes: and I am obliged to obſerve, in juſtice to my own character, that I cannot be anſwerable for the conſequences which may ariſe from a want of officers to aſſiſt me.</p>
                     <p>It gives me great pleaſure to find general Gates is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> reſpectable a footing; and I hope our affairs in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the courſe of a little time, will be in as proſperous a train as we could reaſonably wiſh.</p>
                     <p>The main body of the enemy, from the beſt intelligence I have been able to get, lies near Dilworthtown, not far from the field of action, where they have been buſily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in burying their dead, which, from accounts, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a very conſiderable number. We are moving up this road to get between the enemy and the Swedes' ford, and to prevent them from turning our right flank, which they ſeem to have a violent inclination to effect, by all their movements.</p>
                     <p>I would beg leave to recommend in the moſt earneſt manner, that ſome board or committee be appointed, or ſome mode adopted, for obtaining ſupplies of blankets for the troops:—many are now without; and the ſeaſon becoming cold, they will be injured in their health, and unfitted for ſervice, unleſs they are immediately provided with them. Our ſupplies in this inſtance, as well as in every article of cloathing, cannot be too great, as there are frequent loſſes not eaſily to be avoided. I would alſo obſerve that I think, in point of prudence and ſound policy, every ſpecies of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions ſhould be removed from the city, except ſuch as will be neceſſary to ſupply the preſent demands of this army. I have been told there are conſiderable quantities in private Lands, which ſhould not be ſuffered to remain a moment longer than they can be conveyed away.</p>

                     <p>I have ordered all the troops to be refreſhed this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they were late in getting to their ground laſt night, and they are now cooking their proviſion.

                     <p>The enemy ſeem now to be ſtraining every nerve to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their purpoſe: but I truſt, whatever preſent ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs they may have, they will, ere long, experience a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of fortune. If they have four thouſand men in the Jerſies, it is probable they have ſomething more ſerious in view than a mere diverſion: but I am in hopes, when gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal comes to unite his force with the militia, general Dickinſon will be ſtrong enough effectually to make head againſt them.</p>

Yeſterday the enemy moved from Concord, by the Edgemont towards the Lancaſter road, with evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to gain our right flank. This obliged us to alter our poſition and march to this place, from whence we intend immediately to proceed to Warwick. We ſuffered much from the ſevere weather yeſterday and laſt night, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably ſeparated from our tents and baggage,—which not only endangers the health of the men, but has been very injurious to our arms and ammunition. Theſe, when we arrive at Warwick, we ſhall endeavour, as ſoon as poſſible, to put again into a proper condition,—to do which, and to refreſh the men, are two principal motives for going there.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE not had the honour of addreſſing you ſince your adjournment to Lancaſter, and I ſincerely wiſh that my firſt letter was upon a more agreeable ſubject. The enemy, by a variety of perplexing manoeuvres through a country from which I could not derive the leaſt intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, (being to a man diſaffected) contrived to paſs the Schuylkill laſt night at the Flat-land and other fords in the neighbourhood of it. They marched immediately to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Philadelphia, and I imagine their advanced parties will be near that city to-night.</p>
                     <p>They had ſo far got the ſtart before I received certain intelligence that any conſiderable number had croſſed, that I found it in vain to think of overtaking their rear, with troops haraſſed as ours had been with conſtant marching ſince the battle of Brandiwine; and therefore concluded, by the advice of all the general officers, to march from this place to-morrow morning towards Philadelphia, and on the way endeavour to form a junction with the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental troops under general M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal from Peekſkill, and the Jerſey militia under general Dickinſon, both of whom are, I hope, on this ſide the Delaware. I am alſo oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wait for general Wayne and general Smallwood, who were left upon the other ſide of Schuylkill, in hopes
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:029737_0501_0FE29B5D756FFE20"/>
of falling upon the enemy's rear:—but they have eluded them as well as us.</p>
                     <p>When I laſt recroſſed the Schuylkill, it was with a firm intent of giving the enemy battle whereever I ſhould meet them, and accordingly advanced as far as the Warren tavern upon the Lancaſter road, near which place the two armies were upon the point of coming to a general engagement, but were prevented by a moſt violent flood of rain, which continued all the day and following night. When it held up, we had the mortification to find that our ammunition, which had been completed to forty rounds a man, was entirely ruined; and in that ſituation we had nothing left for it but to find out a ſtrong piece of ground which we could eaſily maintain till we could get the arms put into order, and a recruit of ammunition.</p>
                     <p>Before this could be fully effected, the enemy marched from their poſition near the White-horſe tavern, down the road leading to the Swedes' ford. I immediately croſſed the Schuylkill above them, and threw myſelf full in their front, hoping to meet them in their paſſage, or ſoon after they had paſſed the river. The day before yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday they were again in motion, and marched rapidly up the road leading towards Reading. This induced me to believe that they had two objects in view,—one to get round the right of the army,—the other perhaps to detach parties to Reading where we had conſiderable quantities of military ſtores.</p>
                     <p>To fruſtrate thoſe intentions, I moved the army up on this ſide the river to this place, determined to keep pace with them: but early this morning I received intelligence that they had croſſed the fords below. Why I did not follow immediately, I have mentioned in the former part of my letter: but the ſtrongeſt reaſon againſt being able to make a forced march is the want of ſhoes. Meſſieurs Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll, Chaſe and Penn, who were ſome days with the army, can inform Congreſs in how deplorable a ſituation the troops are, for want of that neceſſary article. At leaſt one thouſand men are bare-footed, and have performed the marches in that condition. I was told of a great number of ſhoes in the hands of private people in Philadelphia, and ſent down to ſecure them: but I doubt the approach of the enemy will prevent it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="164" facs="unknown:029737_0502_0FE29AF948BB5DE8"/>
I have planned a method of throwing a garriſon into Fort Mifflin. If it ſucceeds, and they, with the aſſiſtance of the ſhips and gallies, ſhould keep the obſtructions in the river, general Howe's ſituation in Philadelphia will not be the moſt agreeable: for if his ſupplies can be ſtopped by water, it may be eaſily done by land. To do both ſhall be my utmoſt endeavour; and I am not yet without hope that the acquiſition of Philadelphia may, inſtead of his good fortune, prove his ruin.</p>
                     <p>General St. Clair, who has been conſtantly with the army for ſome time paſt, can give you many pieces of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which may have eſcaped me, and therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to him for many particulars.</p>
                     <p>If there are any ſhoes and blankets to be had in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter or that part of the country, I earneſtly entreat you to have them taken up for the uſe of the army. I have been informed that there are large parcels of ſhoes in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular there.</p>
                     <p>Finding that the incloſed came from colonel Gibſon, I took the liberty of opening it, as I wanted much to know what route he was taking.</p>
                     <p>I have ordered all the Virginia militia who are tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly armed to come forward and join the army. Thoſe who have no arms are to wait at Frederic-Town in Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land till they hear whether any can be provided for them at Lancaſter: you will therefore be pleaſed to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry what number can be procured there, and ſend an expreſs to Frederic with orders for as many men to come forward, as there are arms.</p>

                     <p>Since my letter of the twenty-ninth, no favourable change has taken place in our affairs; on the contrary, we have ſuſtained an additional loſs in the capture of the Delaware. She fell into the enemy's hands in a day or two after they were in poſſeſſion of the city, and in a manner not yet well underſtood. Some have ſuppoſed the crew mutinied,—while another report is, that ſhe was diſabled in her rudder by a ſhot, and drove on ſhore. This misfortune takes off the ſucceſs of captain Biddle's cruiſe. I will not dwell longer on the ſubject. Congreſs may reſt aſſured, all the means in my power ſhall be employed to put our affairs in a more agreeable train, and to accompliſh the end they ſo earneſtly wiſh.</p>

                     <p>HAVING received intelligence through two inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted letters, that general Howe had detached a part of his force for the purpoſe of reducing Billingſport and the forts on Delaware, I communicated the accounts to my general officers, who were unanimouſly of opinion that a favourable opportunity offered to make an attack upon the troops which were at and near Germantown. It was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly agreed that it ſhould take place yeſterday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the following diſpoſitions were made.</p>
                     <p>The diviſions of Sullivan and Wayne, flanked by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way's brigade, were to enter the town by the way of Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-hill, while general Armſtrong with the Pennſylvania militia ſhould fall down the Manatawny road by Vandeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:029737_0504_0FE29B0419478AD8"/>
mill, and get upon the enemy's left and rear. The diviſions of Greene and Stephen, flanked by M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal's brigade, were to enter, by taking a circuit by way of the lime-kiln road, at the market-houſe, and to attack their right wing; and the militia of Maryland and Jerſey, under gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erals Smallwood and Forman, were to march by the old York road, and fall upon the rear of their right. Lord Stirling, with Naſh and Maxwell's brigades, was to form a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>orps-de-reſerve.</p>
                     <p>We marched about ſeven o'clock the preceding evening, and general Sullivan's advanced party, drawn from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way's brigade, attacked their piquet at Mount Airy or Mr. Allen's houſe about ſun-riſe the next morning, which preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently gave way; and his main body, conſiſting of the right wing, following ſoon, engaged the light-infantry and other troops encamped near the piquet, which they forced from their ground. Leaving their baggage, they retreated a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance, having previouſly thrown a party into Mr. Chew's houſe, who where in a ſituation not to be eaſily forced, and had it in their power, from the windows, to give us no ſmall annoyance, and in a great meaſure to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct our advance.</p>
                     <p>The attack from our left column under general Greene began about three-quarters of an hour after that from the right, and was for ſome time equally ſucceſsful. But I cannot enter upon the particulars of what happened in that quarter, as I am not yet informed of them with ſufficient certainty and preciſion.</p>
                     <p>The morning was extremely foggy, which prevented our improving the advantages we gained, ſo well as we ſhould otherwiſe have done. This circumſtance, by concealing from us the true ſituation of the enemy, obliged us to act with more caution and leſs expedition than we could have wiſhed, and gave the enemy time to recover from the effects of our firſt impreſſion: and, what was ſtill more unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, it ſerved to keep our different parties in ignorance of each other's movements, and hindered their acting in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert. It alſo occaſioned them to miſtake one another for the enemy,—which, I believe, more than any thing elſe, contributed to the misfortune which enſued. In the midſt of the moſt promiſing appearances, when every thing gave
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:029737_0505_0FE29B68643EBF60"/>
the moſt flattering hopes of victory, the troops began ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to retreat, and entirely left the field, in ſpite of every effort that could be made to rally them.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, it may be ſaid the day was rather unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate than injurious. We ſuſtained no material loſs of men, and brought off all our artillery, except one piece which was diſmounted. The enemy are nothing the better by the event; and our troops, who are not in the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited by it, have gained what all young troops gain by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in actions. We have had however ſeveral valuable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers killed and wounded, particularly the latter. General Naſh is among the wounded, and his life is deſpaired of. As ſoon as it is poſſible to obtain a return of our loſs, I will tranſmit it.</p>
                     <p>In juſtice to general Sullivan and the whole right wing of the army, whoſe conduct I had an opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, as they acted immediately under my eye,—I have the pleaſure to inform you that both officers and men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with a degree of gallantry that did them the higheſt honour.</p>

                     <p>SINCE I had the honour of addreſſing you on the fifth, I have obtained a return of our loſs in the action on Saturday, by which it appears to be much more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than I at firſt apprehended, though I always imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf that it was greater than it was generally ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be. The copy of the return incloſed will ſhew the amount as it now ſtands; but I hope many of thoſe who are miſſing will yet come in: I fear however there are ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral under that denomination to be added to the number of the ſlain, as the action was warm in every quarter, from
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:029737_0506_0FE29B05D149DB88"/>
the information of the officers who commanded the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent attacks.</p>
                     <p>What loſs the enemy ſuſtained, I am not able preciſely to aſcertain: but from a variety of correſponding accounts of perſons who left the city ſince, and thoſe of a deſerter, it was very conſiderable. The deſerter, who is intelligent, ſays general Agnew was killed, Sir William Erſkine wounded in the head and leg, and that their general loſs, in killed and wounded, amounted to near eight hundred. Several reputable perſons from the city corroborate this, particularly with reſpect to general Agnew's death: ſome ſay upwards of two hundred waggons with wounded were carried in after the action, and before they came out: and that it was the common belief there, the enemy had been ſeverely handled.</p>
                     <p>It is with much chagrin and mortification I add that every account confirms the opinion I at firſt entertained, that our troops retreated at the inſtant when victory was declaring herſelf in our favour. The tumult, diſorder, and even deſpair, which, it ſeems, had taken place in the Britiſh army, were ſcarcely to be paralleled: and it is ſaid, ſo ſtrongly did the ideas of a retreat prevail, that Cheſter was fixed on as their rendezvous. I can diſcover no other cauſe for not improving this happy opportunity, than the extreme hazineſs of the weather.</p>
                     <p>My intention is to encamp the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> at ſome ſuitable place to reſt and refreſh the men, and recover them from the ſtill remaining effects of that diſorder naturally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant on a retreat. We ſhall here wait for the rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements coming on, and ſhall then act according to circumſtances. General Varnum, with the detatchment from Peekſkill amounting to about twelve hundred, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluding officers, would be laſt night at Coryel's ferry. About five hundred militia from Virginia, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from Maryland, together with colonel Gibſon's State regiment conſiſting of two hundred and twenty-ſix effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, have already joined the army. Since the action, general Forman's brigade of Jerſey militia has quitted us. The men began to be uneaſy at their ſituation, and deſirous to return home: and as, by ſome intelligence received from general Dickinſon, there was reaſon to imagine there
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:029737_0507_0FE29B69E9379ED8"/>
might be a call for their ſervices in the Jerſies, it was thought expedient to gratify their deſire.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate of our water defence on the Delaware is far from being as flattering as could be wiſhed. After ſome ſlight oppoſition from the Jerſey militia under general Newcomb, a detachment of the enemy took poſſeſſion of Billingſport. This perhaps is an event of no material conſequence: but it is to be lamented that many of the officers and ſeamen on board the gallies have manifeſted a diſpoſition that does them little honour. Looking upon their ſituation as deſperate, or probably from worſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, they have been guilty of the moſt alarming deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: two whole crews, including the officers, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted to the enemy. I learn however by captain Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who is this moment arrived here from the fleet, that the accounts they have received from the city, of our late attack, were ſuch as to have produced a favourable change, and to have inſpired them with more confidence. I would here obſerve that the charge of bad conduct was by no means applicable to the whole:—far from it. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adds that four of the enemy's ſhips made an attempt yeſterday morning to weigh the chevaux-de-friſe oppoſite to Billingſport, but were repulſed by our gallies,—which has alſo contributed to raiſe the ſpirits of the ſeamen. Our garriſon on Fort-Iſland, conſiſting of little more than two hundred continental troops under lieutenant-colonel Smith, appear determined to maintain their poſt to the laſt extremity.</p>
                     <p>I beg leave to mention to Congreſs that there is a great deficiency of general officers in this army. When the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment coming from Peekſkill joins us, we ſhall have thirteen brigades. Theſe require as many brigadiers, and ſix major-generals:—inſtead of theſe, we ſhall have only four major-generals and eleven brigadiers; and the deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will be ſtill increaſed by the death of general Naſh, which, from every appearance, is momently to be expected. General Woodford's abſence, occaſioned by his wound, adds to our embarraſſments, though it will be but for a time. Under theſe circumſtances, Congreſs will be ſenſible that the government of the army cannot go on with that energy which is eſſential to its well-being and ſucceſs. Neither
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:029737_0508_0FE29B0753ABE768"/>
officers nor men will transfer the reſpect and obedience they pay to a general officer, to a colonel who happens to be appointed to the temporary command of a brigade; nor will he, knowing his authority to be only temporary, be as ſolicitous to enforce it, as one who is conſcious he is to continue in the ſtation he fills. Want of leiſure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents my being more particular at this time: but I ſhall take the liberty, in a day or two, to point out the troops that are in want of general officers, with my obſervations on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>I cannot however omit this opportunity of recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing general M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal to their notice. This gentleman, from the time of his appointment as brigadier,—from his abilities, military knowledge, and approved bravery,—has every claim to promotion. If I miſtake not, he was paſſed over in the laſt appointments of major-generals, and young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er officers preferred before him: but his diſintereſted at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the ſervice prevented his acting in the manner that is cuſtomary in like circumſtances. This, I think, gives him a peculiar title to eſteem, and concurs with the opinion I have of his value as an officer, to make me wiſh it may appear adviſeable to Congreſs to promote him to one of the vacancies.</p>
                     <p>It would be well if the intended inquiry into the conduct of general St. Clair could be brought to a ſpeedy iſſue; and, if he is acquitted to the ſatisfaction of Congreſs, that, as his general character as an officer is good, he may be again reſtored to the ſervice.</p>
                     <p>By a letter this evening received from colonel Hawkes Hay of Haverſtraw, dated the fifth at four o'clock, P. M. four ſhips of war, a conſiderable number of armed veſſels, eight tranſports, and forty flat-bottomed boats, arrived that morning in the bay oppoſite that place, and were landing troops at Verplank's-Point. Their number and deſign were not known.</p>

                     <p>AS general Howe's operations are in this quarter, and his object in all probability fixed for this campaign, I am induced to ſubmit it to the conſideration of Congreſs if the whole or a part of the regiment of artillery command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by colonel Harriſon ſhould not be immediately ordered to join this army. In the late actions, the corps under general Knox has ſuffered ſeverely; and it is ſo reduced by the number of killed, wounded, &amp;c. that we are oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make draughts from the other battalions to ſupply their places. The meaſure I have ventured to ſubmit will not, from preſent appearances, be attended with any ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, if carried into execution,—and the leſs ſo, as the State of Virginia, according to my information, is raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another regiment. Should it be thought adviſeable, Congreſs will tranſmit their orders to colonel Harriſon. If the regiment comes, they need not bring their artillery.</p>

                     <p>ON Wedneſday evening I received the honour of your letter of the ſeventh with its ſeveral incloſures. The providing of ſuitable quarters for the troops during the winter demands our attention: but I confeſs it is difficult to ſay where they will be. Sundry circumſtances may occur in the courſe of the campaign, to render any proviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, which might now be thought of, altogether improper.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect to general Putnam's letter, though the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts tranſmitted by colonel Hawkes Hay indicate that the enemy had ſome attack in contemplation, yet I cannot but think the force the general mentions to have been at New-York was greatly exaggerated. The higheſt number of the reinforcements, ſaid to have arrived, is three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; and theſe are mentioned to be half boys. Other reports make it much leſs,—and ſome as low as five or ſix hundred. However, be it what it may, it is not in my power to grant him aid. Had the reinforcement arrived before the troops marched from Peekſkill, ſo many might
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:029737_0510_0FE29B08D6EA5D10"/>
not have been ordered from thence. But the caſe was oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe, or at leaſt I was not appriſed of their arrival; and the detachments from thence were directed by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of my general officers, who had under conſideration the ſtate of the whole force at that poſt and its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies, according to a general return. At the ſame time I urged general Putnam to call in all his out-poſts, and to write in preſſing terms to governor Trumbull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o aſſiſt him with ſome militia.</p>
                     <p>I have not heard a ſingle ſyllable more of the troops or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eet mentioned by colonel Hawkes Hay, except a vague report to-day that a number, ſuppoſed to be about fifteen hundred, had landed on this ſide the river at Haverſtraw. If the fact is ſo, it is probable, they mean to paſs through the Clove and inveſt the forts. I have great confidence in the activity and bravery of governor Clinton; and I truſt, if ſuch is their view, they will meet at leaſt with a ſpirited if not a ſucceſsful oppoſition. I have ſent up lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-colonel Radiere, one of the engineers, with orders to direct ſuch other works as may appear neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>There was a very ſevere cannonade on Wedneſday night: it began about twelve o'clock, and continued till yeſterday morning between ſeven and eight. I have not learned the occaſion; but, from the direction, ſuppoſe it was at Fort-Mifflin, or an engagement between our armed veſſels and the enemy's ſhips, which probably were making a ſecond attempt againſt the chevaux-de-friſe. I have determined to maintain the poſt at Red-Bank, if it can be done, and have detached colonel Greene there with his regiment of Rhode-Iſland troops, conſiſting of about two hundred and twelve effective privates. I have alſo written to general Newcomb of Jerſey, preſſing him to give all the aid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e can from the militia.</p>
                     <p>Since my letter of the ſeventh we have been joined by more of the Virginia militia. The whole number now in camp amounts to about eleven hundred. Many of their arms are indifferent, and almoſt the whole are deſtitute of pouches and other neceſſary accoutrements.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday the enemy evacuated Billingſport. They left all our cannon, but burned the platforms and carriages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="173" facs="unknown:029737_0511_0FE29B735EC2C950"/>
Incloſed you will receive a letter addreſſed to me by colonel Portail. Congreſs will judge of the contents, and decide upon them as they may think they merit.</p>
                     <p>The military cheſt is nearly exhauſted, not having more than ten thouſand dollars in it; and a large part of the army is to pay for the month of Auguſt. Beſides their claims, large ſums are wanted by the quarter-maſter-general, and for other purpoſes. Congreſs, I hope, will order ſuch immediate ſupply to be forwarded to the paymaſter-general, as ſhall be in their power.</p>

                        </gap>d we have, and what expectations of further ſupplies. I am rather uneaſy on this head, as I have not been able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſatisfaction on ſome inquiries within the courſe of a few days.</p>
                     <p>The cannonade mentioned above was between our gallies and a detachment of the enemy who were attempting to throw up a battery at Webb's or the loweſt ferry on Schuyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kill. It has been repeated this morning. Their deſign, in erecting this battery, probably is to cover their paſſage to Province-Iſland, from whence, by occupying the grounds about the peſt-houſes, they may expect to annoy Fort-Mifflin.</p>
                     <p>Our diſtreſs for want of ſhoes and ſtockings is amazing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great, particularly for want of the former. On this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we have a great many men who cannot do duty, and ſeveral detained at the hoſpitals for no other cauſe. I muſt requeſt Congreſs to continue their exertions to relieve us, and to direct every ſupply of theſe and other neceſſaries to be forwarded as ſoon as they poſſibly can after they are collected. It will be proper to ſend them on as faſt as they can be procured, without waiting to make up a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity to be brought at one time.</p>
                     <p>I was this morning honoured with your favours of the ninth, and their ſeveral incloſures. I feel in the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible manner the honourable approbation Congreſs have been pleaſed to give of my conduct, and that of the army under my command, in the action on the fourth inſtant: nor am I leſs indebted to you, Sir, for the polite mode in which you have conveyed their ſentiments. I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the reſolve upon the ſubject to the army, and hope,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:029737_0512_0FE29B1384F2A1D0"/>
if a favourable opportunity offers, under the ſmiles of Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence, they will merit, by more ſubſtantial ſervices, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther applauſe of their country.</p>
                     <p>The reſolution of the eighth, for preventing ſupplies and intelligence being carried to the enemy, appears to me to be a ſalutary one; and I hope it will be attended with the moſt beneficial conſequences. That it may be known among the inhabitants who are in their neighbourhood, and who have been guilty of ſuch practices, I would wiſh to receive ſeveral printed copies, that they may be diſtributed in proper places.</p>

                     <p>SINCE I had the honour of addreſſing you on the eleventh inſtant, nothing material has happened between our army and general Howe's. The incloſed copies of commodore Hazlewood and colonel Bradford's letters will ſhew the ſituation of affairs in the navy and at Fort-Mifflin, on the eleventh,—which are the lateſt accounts I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from thence. But there has been a warm cannonade ſince, which continued, with but little intermiſſion, till be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two and three o'clock yeſterday afternoon, when it ceaſed. The reſult I have not heard; but I hope, from the determined ſpirit of the fleet and the garriſon, matters continue as we could wiſh.</p>
                     <p>I received an expreſs laſt night from general Putnam, informing me of the capture of Fort-Montgomery, and the conſequent evacuation of Peekſkill. I ſhould ſend copies of his letters to me: but as the expreſs who brought them had diſpatches for Congreſs, I conclude he has adviſed them fully on the ſubject. Theſe events may have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy influence on our northern affairs: but as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut militia ſeem to be coming in faſt, and governor Clinton is exerting himſelf to bring out the force of New-York,—if general Putnam can but keep pace with their fleet in their progreſs up the river, I hope he will be able
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:029737_0513_0FE29B77B70AE970"/>
to fruſtrate their deſign of relieving general Burgoyne, and that every thing will ſtill terminate well in that quarter.</p>
                     <p>It gives me pain to repeat ſo often the wants of the army: and nothing would induce me to it but the moſt urgent neceſſity. Every mode hitherto adopted for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them has proved inadequate, notwithſtanding my beſt endeavours to make the moſt of the means which have been in my power. The incloſed return will ſhew how great is our deficiency in the moſt eſſential articles. What new expedient Congreſs can deviſe for more effectually anſwering theſe demands, I know not, perſuaded as I am that their cloſeſt attention has not been wanting to a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo great importance: out, circumſtanced as we are, I am under an abſolute neceſſity of troubling them, that if any new ſource can be opened for alleviating our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, it may be embraced as ſpeedily as poſſible; for it is impoſſible that any army, ſo unprovided, can long ſubſiſt, or act with that vigour which is requiſite to enſure ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>The return now incloſed is for troops preſent in camp; beſides which, there are numbers in the ſeveral hoſpitals, totally deſtitute of the neceſſaries they require to fit them for the field; and, on this account alone, are prevented from joining their corps. The recruits coming in are alſo in the ſame melancholy predicament. I cannot aſcertain with preciſion what quantity of cloathing is at this time in Mr. Meaſe's hands: but, from every account, what he has can adminiſter but a very partial relief. I know he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely bare of ſome of the moſt capital articles we want.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to cartouch-boxes, without which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to act, I cannot find from my inquiries that there are any in ſtore. Several of the continental troops are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in this inſtance; and, what adds to our diſtreſs, there are but very few of the ſouthern militia that are provided. I am trying to make a collection about the country: but, from the information I have received, the meaſure will be attended with but little ſucceſs. This want, though not remedied immediately, may be removed in time; and I would take the liberty to recommend that the earlieſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſhould be had to making a large ſupply. I would alſo adviſe that much care ſhould be uſed in chooſing the
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:029737_0514_0FE29B15086DF198"/>
leather:—none but the beſt and thickeſt is proper for the purpoſe; and each box ſhould have a ſmall inner flap for the greater ſecurity of the cartridges againſt the rain and moiſt weather. The flaps in general are too ſmall, and do not project ſufficiently over the ends or ſides of the boxes. I am convinced of the utility, nay neceſſity, of theſe improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that the adoption of them, though they will incur an additional expenſe at firſt, will prove a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aving, and of the moſt beneficial conſequences: for we know from unhappy experience, in the ſevere rain on the ſixteenth ultimo, the few boxes we had of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction preſerved the ammunition without injury, whilſt it was almoſt wholly deſtroyed in thoſe of the common form with a ſingle flap.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing more which I cannot omit men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning to Congreſs, and which, in my opinion, has a claim to their moſt ſerious attention,—I mean the general defective ſtate of the regiments which compoſe our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Congreſs will find, from a view of the returns tranſmitted from time to time, that they do not amount to half of their juſt complement. What can be done to remedy this, I know not: but it is certain every idea of voluntary enliſtments ſeems to be at an end; and it is equally certain that the mode of draughting has been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with ſuch want of energy in ſome States, and ſo much diſregarded in others, that but a ſmall acceſſion of force has been derived from it. Theſe facts are ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſting of themſelves. But there are others to be added. I am told that Virginia, in her regulations for draughting, extended her plan only to the nine regiments that were firſt raiſed. In what policy this was founded, I cannot determine: but the other ſix are to receive no reinforcements from that ſource. Nor do matters ſtop here. The engagements of the firſt nine regiments, I am informed, were temporary: and, according to the officer's accounts, the longeſt period to which any of the men are bound to ſerve is next April:—many are not obliged ſo long: and there are ſome who claim a diſcharge at this time. I do not mention theſe things through choice, but from a principle of duty, to the end that Congreſs may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe ſome timely and effectual proviſion for the whole, if
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:029737_0515_0FE29B806236CA00"/>
ſuch ſhall be in their power. It is unneceſſary to enlarge upon the ſubject; and I will only obſerve that the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of calling the militia [<hi>into the field in</hi>] the courſe of the war have been ſo ſeverely and ruinouſly felt, that I truſt our views will never be turned to them but in caſes of the greateſt extremity.</p>
                     <p>In purſuance of the reſolution of Congreſs, a court of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry has ſat upon general Sullivan. They met on the tenth, and continued the examination till the twelfth, when they came to the incloſed opinion. The depoſitions and papers which were before the court were many and prolix. They are not tranſmitted: but they may be obtained from the court, if wanted. Beſides the depoſitory proofs which they had of wounded and dead officers, they had many gentlemen before them in perſon.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favours of the twelfth and thirteenth inſtant, with their ſeveral inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. In reſpect to the reſolution directing a flag to be ſent to general Howe, I am inclined to think that the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which it was framed was without foundation. The letters which have come from our officers who have been lately taken generally mention that their treatment has been tolerably good; and ſuch privates as have eſcaped have ſaid nothing in the courſe of their examination, of their having been compelled to work. For theſe reaſons I have taken the liberty to decline <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ending the flag. At the ſame time Congreſs may be aſſured, if our priſoners ſuffer any wrongs, I ſhall take every means in my power to have them redreſſed as ſoon as I am appriſed of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="178" facs="unknown:029737_0516_0FE29B168A54BAC8"/>
It is with the higheſt ſatisfaction I congratulate Congreſs on the ſucceſs of our arms at the northward in the action of the ſeventh,—an event of the moſt intereſting import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at this critical juncture. From the happy train in which things then were, I hope we ſhall ſoon hear of the moſt deciſive advantages.</p>
                     <p>We moved this morning from the encampment at which we had been for ſix or ſeven days paſt, and are juſt arrived at the grounds we occupied before the action of the fourth. One motive for coming here is to divert the enemy's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and force from the forts. Theſe they ſeem to conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as capital objects, and (from their operations) mean to reduce, if poſſible. At preſent their deſigns are directed againſt Fort-Mifflin and the chevaux-de-friſe. I have therefore detached a further reinforcement to the garriſon.</p>
                     <p>I yeſterday, through the hands of Mrs. * * *, received a letter of a very curious and extraordinary nature from Mr. D * * *, which I have thought proper to tranſmit to Congreſs. To this ridiculous, illiberal performance. I made a ſhort reply, by deſiring the bearer of it, if ſhe ſhould hereafter by any accident meet with Mr. D * * *, to tell him I ſhould have returned it unopened, if I had had any idea of the contents;—obſerving at the ſame time, that I highly diſapproved the intercourſe ſhe ſeemed to have been carrying on, and expected it would be diſcontinued. Notwithſtanding the author's aſſertion. I cannot but ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the meaſure did not originate with him; and that he was induced to it by the hope of eſtabliſhing his intereſt and peace more effectually with the enemy.</p>

                     <p>I LAST night had the honour to receive your letter of the ſeventeenth inſtant, with its ſeveral incloſures.</p>
                     <p>I heartily wiſh the States may feel the importance of fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their battalions, and may, in conſequence of the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommendation of Congreſs, adopt ſuch meaſures as will prove effectual for the purpoſe. I cannot but think that heretofore there has been a want of attention in this inſtance,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:029737_0517_0FE29BA0C8FDAE78"/>
and that the ſubject, though intereſting to the laſt degree, has been viewed with too much indifference. The reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpecting deſerters, I hope will alſo have their notice. It is highly neceſſary that they ſhould come into ſome regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations for apprehending them, and puniſhing thoſe who give them countenance. If this is not done, our force will be always diminiſhing, and no exertions in the army will prevent it. I ſhall try the effects of a proclamation on thoſe who are now delinquents, and ſhall be happy if it meets with ſucceſs; but confeſs, from the experiment I have made, that I am not ſanguine in my expectations that it will be the caſe.</p>
                     <p>As to the recruiting officers, I muſt obſerve, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the reſolution of Congreſs of the thirty-firſt of July, and my circular letter on the ſubject of it to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the States, I have not received an account that any officers have been appointed, except in Connecticut and Jerſey.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday the enemy evacuated Germantown, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew themſelves within their lines near the city. They ſeem determined to reduce the forts, if poſſible; and, for this purpoſe, have thrown ſeveral parties over on Province-Iſland. I was informed this afternoon that a detachment alſo paſſed the Delaware at Cooper's ferry in the morning. If the account be true, (and I have no doubt of it) it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable they mean to make an attack upon the garriſon at Red-Bank. I am taking every meaſure in my power to counteract them, and have written to generals Forman and Newcomb of Jerſey to afford every aid they can to relieve the fort, in caſe they do inveſt it.</p>
                     <p>Againſt Fort-Mifflin they have kept up a cannonade, more or leſs, every day, and have thrown ſeveral ſhells, but without doing any conſiderable damage. The exploſion of one killed a private, and wounded three others, who were in a barrack where it fell. They alſo ſet fire to two ammunition-boxes with a hot ball on the nineteenth, which did ſome injury to the barracks. I do not recollect that we have ſuffered lately in any inſtances beſides theſe.</p>

                     <p>I DO myſelf the honour of tranſmitting to Congreſs the incloſed copies of ſundry letters juſt now received, and congratulate them moſt ſincerely on the important intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which they contain. The damage the enemy have ſuſtained in their ſhips, I hope, will prevent their future at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to gain the paſſage of the river; and the repulſe of the troops under count Donnop, and his captivity, I flatter myſelf, will alſo be attended with the moſt happy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. At the time theſe actions happened, a ſupply of ammunition was on the way to the forts; and I have alſo ordered a further quantity to be immediately ſent.</p>
                     <p>By colonel Blaine, one of the iſſuing commiſſaries, who left Red-Bank in the morning before the action, I am hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily informed that he had thrown conſiderable ſupplies of proviſion into both garriſons. He alſo adds that he came from Jerſey this morning, and that the enemy had recro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap> the Delaware and returned to Philadelphia. I have written to colonel Greene that the priſoners muſt be immediately ſent from his poſt: and Mr. Clymer, a deputy under Mr. Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It gives me great concern to inform Congreſs, that, after all my exertions, we are ſtill in a diſtreſſed ſituation for want of blankets and ſhoes. At this time no inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of our force are incapable of acting, through the deficiency of the latter; and I fear, without we can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, it will be the caſe with two-thirds of the army in the courſe of a few days.</p>
                     <p>I am and have been waiting with the moſt anxious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience for a confirmation of general Burgoyne's ſurrender. I have received no further intelligence reſpecting it (except vague report) than the firſt account which came to hand ſo long ago as Saturday morning. If Congreſs have had authentic advices about it, I wiſh to be favoured with them.</p>

                     <p>I WAS duly honoured with Mr. Hancock's letter if the twenty-fifth, with its ſeveral incloſures. I ſhall take the caſe of John More under conſideration, and will tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit colonel Maſon my determination upon the ſame.</p>
                     <p>At this time I cannot inform the commiſſary whether any alterations have or have not been made by general orders in the original ration eſtabliſhment. I have been under the neceſſity, from time to time, to ſend away my orderly books; and they are neceſſary to be examined upon the ſubject. However, I think it probable that a departure from the firſt allowance may have been found expedient, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome authority, or the commiſſary would not have adopted it. In reſpect to the alteration referred to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, it is a matter of conſequence, and I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> deſired the general officers to inform themſelves whether it will be agreeable to the army at large, or what other regulations may be neceſſary in this inſtance. As ſoon as I have their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ments, I will write to Congreſs upon the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>The enemy ſtill conſider the poſſeſſion of our poſts upon the river of great importance; and, from their preparation of faſcines, &amp;c. and the beſt information I have been able to obtain, they will make further efforts to carry them. Viewing them in this light myſelf, and imagining that they would perſevere in their plans to occupy them, I wrote ſome days ago in the moſt preſſing terms to generals Dickinſon, Forman, and * * *, to afford every aid in their power from the militia of Jerſey. As yet we have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but little; and I have no encouragement to expect that it will be much augmented in a ſhort time. This does not proceed from a want of activity and exertion on the part of the two firſt mentioned gentlemen, whoſe conduct and zeal upon every occaſion give them a claim to the public eſteem, but in a conſiderable degree from the peculiar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of their State at this time. The apprehenſions of an invaſion from Staten-Iſland keep a large proportion of the militia from the eaſtern and upper part of the State al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſtantly employed at and in the neighbourhood of Elizabeth-Town: and Mr. Livingſton's powers as gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor being expired, and no proviſion made (it ſeems) for
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:029737_0520_0FE29B25AC4CBA90"/>
ſuch a contingency,—there are none of ſufficient authority to order them out, till a new appointment can be had:—at leaſt there is ground to ſuſpect that the orders and exertions of theſe two gentlemen, unaſſiſted by civil authority, will not be attended with the advantages we wiſh, and which our affairs require. * * *</p>
                     <p>Under theſe circumſtances I have been obliged to detach a further reinforcement of continental troops under general Varnum, to maintain the two garriſons, if poſſible,—beſides ſailors drawn from the line, to man the gallies. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, when it arrives, added to the force now in the forts, will make the whole amount to ſixteen hundred ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective rank and file ſent from this army.</p>
                     <p>After the action of the fourth ultimo at Germantown, I hoped we ſhould have been in a ſituation to attack the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my again on thoſe grounds, and with more ſucceſs than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The diſtreſs of the ſoldiers for want of ſhoes was alſo a powerful obſtacle to the meaſure.</p>
                     <p>I could wiſh that our circumſtances were now ſuch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> authoriſe a general attack for diſlodging them from the city: but I think that they are not. This alſo is the opinion of my general officers, upon a full and comprehenſive view of matters, as Congreſs will perceive by the incloſed copy of the minutes of council on the twenty-ninth ultimo, which
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:029737_0521_0FE29BA8A5DBC1D8"/>
I have taken the liberty to tranſmit and lay before them. The ſuperiority of numbers on the part of the enemy, in reſpect to regular troops,—their ſuperior diſcipline, and the redoubts and lines which they have thrown up between the two rivers and about the city,—the happy ſtate of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs at the northward, and the practicability of drawing ſuccours from thence,—the conſequences of a defeat,—theſe were all motives which led to a deciſion againſt an attack at this time.</p>
                     <p>I have ſent colonel Hamilton, one of my aides, to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Gates, to give him a juſt repreſentation of things, and to explain to him the expediency of our receiving the rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements which have been determined neceſſary, if they will not interfere with and fruſtrate any important plans he may have formed. Indeed I cannot conceive that there is any object now remaining, that demands our attention and moſt vigorous efforts ſo much as the deſtruction of the army in this quarter. Should we be able to effect this, we ſhall have little to fear in future.</p>
                     <p>General Howe's force, according to the ſtate now made, is more conſiderable than it was generally ſuppoſed to be. I did not think it quite ſo great myſelf, but always imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the common eſtimate much too low:—nor can I poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſay what it really is. However, there are ſtrong reaſons to believe that it is not over-rated. After the evac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of Germantown, an almoſt infinite number of ſcraps and bits of paper were found, which, being ſeparated and arranged with great induſtry and care, bear the marks of genuine and authentic returns at different periods. The manner in which they were deſtroyed and diſpoſed of gives no room to ſuſpect that it was the effect of deſign. In ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to this, I am informed by general Putnam that he had heard a reinforcement of four regiments was coming round to Delaware from New-York.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed return will give Congreſs a general view of the ſtrength of this army when it was made, and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular one of the forces of each State which compoſe it. By this they will perceive how greatly deficient the whole are in furniſhing their juſt quotas. The militia from Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Virginia are no longer to be counted on:—all the former, except about two hundred, are already gone? and
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:029737_0522_0FE29B278B763440"/>
a few days, I expect, will produce the departure of the whole or chief part of the latter, from the importunate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications which ſome of them have made. Beſides this diminution, I am apprehenſive we ſhall have ſeveral men added to the ſick liſt by reaſon of the late exceſſive rain and want of clothes.</p>
                     <p>We have not yet come to any determination reſpecting the diſpoſition of our troops for the winter,—ſuppoſing it a matter of great importance, and that for the preſent we ſhould be ſilent upon it. The reaſons will readily occur. By continuing the campaign, perhaps many ſalutary if not deciſive advantages may be derived; but it appears to me that this muſt depend upon the ſupplies of cloathing which the men receive. If they cannot be accommodated in this inſtance, it will be difficult if not impoſſible to do it without effecting their deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>I would take the liberty to mention that I feel myſelf in a delicate ſituation with reſpect to the marquis La Fayette. He is extremely ſolicitous of having a command equal to his rank, and profeſſes very different ideas, as to the purpoſes of his appointment, from thoſe Congreſs have mentioned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> me:—he certainly did not underſtand them. I do not know in what light they will view the matter: but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me, from a conſideration of his illuſtrious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant connexions,—the attachment which he has mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted for our cauſe,—and the conſequences which his return in diſguſt might produce,—that it will be adviſeable to gratify him in his wiſhes; and the more ſo, as ſeveral gentlemen from France, who came over under ſome aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, have gone back diſappointed in their expectations. His conduct with reſpect to them ſtands in a favourable point of view,—having intereſted himſelf to remove their uneaſineſs, and urged the impropriety of their making any unfavourable repreſentations upon their arrival at home: and in all his letters, he has placed our affairs in the beſt ſituation he could. Beſides, he is ſenſible, diſcreet in his manners, has made great proficiency in our language, and, from the diſpoſition he diſcovered at the battle of Brandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, poſſeſſes a large ſhare of bravery and military ardour.</p>
                     <p>There is a French gentleman here,—monſieur Vrigny, in whoſe favour the marquis ſeems much intereſted.
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:029737_0523_0FE1BFB9ADEFEEF8"/>
He aſſures me he is an officer of great merit, and, from that motive and a regard to the ſervice, wiſhes to ſee him promoted. The rank he holds in France, and his preſent expectations, are contained in the incloſed copy of a paper given me by the marquis. Monſieur Vrigny alſo has hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable certificates of his ſervices, nearly correſponding with the marquis's account of them. If Congreſs are pleaſed to honour him with a commiſſion in the army of the States, I muſt try to employ him.</p>
                     <p>I took the liberty ſome ſhort time ago to mention to Congreſs the ſituation of the nine firſt raiſed Virginia regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the term for which they ſtand engaged; and, conſidering that we ſhould ſuffer greatly by the loſs of ſo large a part of our force which have been long inured to ſervice, I thought it adviſeable to conſult the officers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them, upon the mode which ſhould app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>r to them beſt calculated to re-enliſt them. They accordingly met, and reported their ſentiments in writing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> copy of which I have incloſed. I do not know that expedients, more promiſing of ſucceſs than thoſe they have pointed out, can be adopted. Congreſs will be pleaſed to give the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their earlieſt attention, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>our me with their opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion by the firſt opportunity, whether the indulgence and allowance they have propoſed may be granted,—and, if any additional bounty may be given, what it ſhall be. The high ſums paid for ſubſtitutes and draughts, of late, even in the militia ſervice, will make this neceſſary: for the ſoldiers, being well appriſed of that fact, will not be induced to engage again during the war or for three years, for the uſual p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>mium.</p>
                     <p>I would alſo lay before Congreſs a remonſtrance by the ſubaltern officers of the Virginia line, founded on a reform I thought neceſſary to take place in the regiments from that State. Theſe, in their eſtabliſhment, were made to conſiſt of ten companies,—two more than were aſſigned to thoſe of the States in general. This, and the great diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the officers and men, induced me to reduce them to a level with the reſt belonging to the continent, in order to prevent a conſiderable unneceſſary expenſe. To effect this, no new promotions are to be made in the two extra companies, viz. the ninth and tenth, either to vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:029737_0524_0FE29B294B3775C0"/>
exiſting at the time of the regulation, or to any future ones that may happen therein: and the ſubalterns are to remain in their rank and command till they can be promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the other eight companies, and their men incorporat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is what they complain of. I have made a ſhort ſtate of facts, and wiſh Congreſs to determine upon them and the remonſtrance as they ſhall think proper.</p>
                     <p>At the requeſt of governor Clinton, I have tranſmitted a copy of his letter to me, giving an account of general Vaughan's expedition up the North-river after the capture of Fort-Montgomery, and of the deſtruction committed by his troops in burning Kingſton and the houſes and mills on the river. According to the lateſt advices, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again; and it is reported that they have deſtroyed the barracks and forts, and gone to New-York:—but this is not confirmed.</p>
                     <p>A few days ago Mr. Franks of Philadelphia, agent for the Britiſh priſoners, ſent out ſix thouſand continental dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to Mr. Richard Graham of Virginia, for the ſubſiſtence of the Heſſians and other priſoners in that State. The policy of ſuffering the enemy to ſupport their priſoners with money which they refuſe themſelves, and which they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to depreciate in every inſtance they poſſibly can, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me very queſtionable,—and the more ſo, as it may be counterfeited. Beſides, they have laid us under every difficulty they can deviſe, as to our priſoners in their hands:—nothing will do for their ſupport but hard money. If the enemy were obliged to furniſh the ſame, the quantity with us would be greater, and of courſe the means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ours, eaſier. I do not know what conſequences a prohibition againſt receiving continental money or the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of any State from them might involve: I think the ſubject is worthy of the conſideration of Congreſs; and for that reaſon. I have mentioned it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>November</hi> 3.—The report of the enemy's having deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the forts and barracks on the North-river, and of their having returned to New-York, is confirmed. I this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received a letter from general Putnam upon the ſubject, a copy of which is tranſmitted. The information that they mean to reinforce general Howe, I doubt not is true: it has come through ſeveral channels, and nothing is more
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:029737_0525_0FE29BABADF968C0"/>
probable. As to their having a further expedition in view, it ſeems to be queſtionable:—general Burgoyne's defeat, and the eaſtern troops being ready to be employed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way, are circumſtances againſt the meaſure.</p>
                     <p>Agreeable to my expectation, the Virginia militia are gone: ſo that we have none now in aid of the continental troops, but thoſe of the State mentioned in the return, and a few from Maryland. I do not know what can or will be done to obtain further reinforcements of them; but it appears to me, taking matters in any point of light, that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aids ſhould come from Virginia and Maryland: for, ſhould we be able to accommodate the continental forces with clothes ſo as to carry on a winter campaign, their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance will be material, either to maintain a blockade, or in any deciſive ſtroke we may attempt. And if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo provided, and we ſhould be obliged to retire into quarters, their ſervice will be ſtill more neceſſary to aſſiſt in covering the country againſt incurſions for forage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. The militia of this State, themſelves, ſuppoſing they ſhould be tolerably vigorous in their exertions, will not be equal to the taſk: at leaſt it will be difficult, if not impracticable, for them to do it. It is to be wiſhed that ſuch as can be drawn out may be engaged to ſerve three months, or two at leaſt, (if it can be effected) after their arrival in camp; and that a mode could be adopted to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their places with others at the expiration of their term, ſhould the exigency o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

As to the number that ſhould be required, it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to determine: however, it is likely it will fall ſhort of the requiſition, as it ever has upon ſuch occaſions.</p>
                     <p>There is a report prevailing in camp, which has come through ſeveral channels, that a ſucceſsful expedition has been made upon Rhode-Iſland, and eight hundred priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners taken, with ſeveral pieces of artillery, and a large quantity of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I DO myſelf the honour to incloſe you an extract of a letter from major general Dickinſon, of the ſixth inſtant, by which it appears that a reinforcement has ſailed from New-York, either for general Howe or ſome other expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. I have not yet heard whether any of the troops on their march from the northward have yet croſſed the North-river; but I hope they will be with me near as ſoon as general Howe's reinforcement can arrive at Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia.</p>
                     <p>There was a heavy firing of cannon, all the day of the fifth, down the river; and in the evening ſome muſketry was heard; from whence we concluded that an attack had been made upon Fort-Mifflin. But it turned out to be an attack made by general Varnum, with a twelve and an eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen-pounder fixed near Red-Bank, upon the enemy's ſhips. He thinks he damaged the Somerſet of ſixty-four guns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably, as ſhe got on ground, and was for ſome time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to his fire. The ſhips were obliged to quit their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and fall lower down.</p>
                     <p>From a variety of accounts and circumſtances, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to believe that the enemy are meditating a grand blow againſt Fort-Mifflin. I have put the place in as good a ſtate of defence as my preſent numbers will admit, and have directed general Varnum to afford every further aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in his power. I therefore hope they will meet a warm reception whenever they make the attempt.</p>
                     <p>The military cheſt is again empty, and the army is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid for the months of September and October,—beſides the draughts that are requiſite for the commiſſary and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-maſter-general's department. You will therefore be

                     <p>I fear, from a letter which I have lately received from gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Heath, that no proper meaſures are taken to put up a ſupply of ſalt proviſions for next campaign, to the eaſtward. I have incloſed a copy of general Heath's letter to Mr. Buchanan, the commiſſary-general of purchaſes, and have deſired him to have the matter looked into in time: but it is of ſo much importance to the very exiſtence of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that I think it deſerves the attention of Congreſs.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favours of the fourth and fifth inſtant, with their ſeveral incloſures. Among thoſe of the former, I found the reſolution you are pleaſed to allude to, reſpecting your appointment as preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Permit me, Sir, to congratulate you upon this event, and to aſſure you I have the moſt entire confidence that I ſhall experience in you during your preſidency the ſame politeneſs, and attention to the intereſts of the States, that marked the conduct of your worthy predeceſſor.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to the views of the navy-board for ſecuring the frigates, the ſituation of the army would not admit of a compliance with them, ſuppoſing they would anſwer the end. I have therefore written to the board in the moſt preſſing terms, to have the frigates ſcuttled in ſuch way that they may be raiſed when it ſhall be neceſſary, and that in the mean time they may not be liable to injury from float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ice. I ſee no meaſure ſo likely to ſecure them to us, and againſt the enemy's attempts. I have been extremely fearful they would have poſſeſſed and employed them, with the Delaware and their batteries, on the rear of the gallies and the fort, while the ſhips below attacked in front. I need not point out the probable conſequences of ſuch an event: they are too obvious.</p>

                        <pb n="190" facs="unknown:029737_0528_0FE29B37AD8DC228"/>
The reſolves which you requeſt to be communicated to the army ſhall be publiſhed in general orders. The let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for commodore Hazelwood, &amp;c. have been put in a proper channel of conveyance.</p>
                     <p>As to the diſpoſition of part of the northern army, my letter of the firſt, continued to the third, contains my ideas upon the ſubject, and thoſe of my general officers. I ſhall be ſorry if the meaſures I have taken on this head ſhould interfere with or materially vary from any plans Congreſs might have had in view. Their proceedings of the fifth, I preſume were founded on a ſuppoſition that the enemy were ſtill up the North-river, and garriſoning the forts they had taken. This not being the caſe, and all accounts agreeing that reinforcements to general Howe are coming from York, I hope the aids I have required will be conſidered expedient and proper. Independent of the latter conſideration, I think our exertions and force ſhould be directed to effect general Howe's deſtruction, if it is poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Among the various difficulties attending the army, the adjuſtment of rank is not the leaſt. This,—owing to the ſeveral modes, the ſeveral principles, that have prevailed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> granting commiſſions,—is involved in great perplexity. The officers of the Pennſylvania troops are in much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion about it: in many inſtances, thoſe who were junior in rank, from local and other circumſtances, have obtained commiſſions older in date than thoſe which were granted afterwards to officers their ſuperiors before. This with many other irregularities, has been and is the cauſe of great uneaſineſs: and, though precedency of rank ſo claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhould not be ſupported in juſtice or upon any principle,—we find all, having the leaſt pretext for the title, ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſupport it, and willing to hold a ſuperiority. I was therefore induced to order a board of officers to take the matter under conſideration. The reſult, reſpecting the field-officers of this State, I now incloſe, and wiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to adopt the regulation which the board have made, and to tranſmit me, by the earlieſt opportunity, commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions dated according to their arrangement. At the ſame time it may be proper that there ſhould be a reſolve vacat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the commiſſions they now have, and directing them to
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:029737_0529_0FE29BB960922668"/>
be delivered to me. Their attention to this buſineſs, I truſt, will be immediate: the diſputes and jealouſies with the officers require it.</p>
                     <p>I have incloſed the memorial of colonel Portail and the other engineers for their promotion, referred to me by the board of war for my ſentiments. As to the terms theſe gentlemen mentioned to have been propoſed and agreed to when they firſt arrived, I know nothing of them further than the memorial ſtates. In reſpect to their abilities and knowledge in their profeſſion, I muſt obſerve they have had no great opportunity of proving them ſince they were in our ſervice. However, I have reaſon to believe that they have been regularly bred in this important branch of war, and that their talents, which have been hitherto, as it were, dormant, want only a proper occaſion to call them forth; in which caſe, I have no doubt they would do themſelves honour and the States eſſential ſervice. It is of great importance, too, to conſider the practicability of replacing theſe gentlemen with perſons equally qualified, if they ſhould quit the ſervice; and how indiſpenſable men of ſkill in this branch of military ſcience are to every army. While I am on this ſubject, I would take the liberty to mention that I have been well informed that the engineer in the northern army (Corieſki, I think, his name is) is a gentleman of ſcience and merit. From the character I have had of him, he is deſerving of notice too.</p>
                     <p>I would beg leave to mention that we are in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs for want of money. This will be more urgent every day: and it is probable there will be a good deal of pay due to the troops coming to reinforce us. General Putnam writes preſſingly for a ſupply, and ſays, he is in a moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable ſituation for want of it. I muſt requeſt the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Congreſs to this ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Your favour of the ſeventh came to hand this morning. I ſhall pay proper attention to the incloſures. The rank of the officers of cavalry I will attempt to have ſettled as ſoon as circumſtances will admit.</p>
                     <p>I have nothing very intereſting to communicate. The enemy have loſt one of their new floating-batteries: it ſunk in a little time after it was launched. There has been a
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:029737_0530_0FE29B39917B6B08"/>
cannonade to-day:—it ſtill continues:—I do not know the occaſion, but imagine it is between the ſhips and gallies.</p>

                     <p>THE condition of the army for want of clothes and blankets, and the little proſpect we have of obtaining re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, according to the information I have received from the board of war, occaſion me to trouble you at this time. The mode of ſeizing and forcing ſupplies from the inhabitants, I fear, would prove very inadequate to the demands, while it would certainly embitter the minds of the people, and excite perhaps a hurtful jealouſy againſt the army. I have had officers out for the purpoſe of purchaſing and making voluntary collections of neceſſaries: and, in a few inſtances, more coercive meaſures have been exerciſed: but all theſe have proved of little avail: our diſtreſſes ſtill continue, and are becoming greater. I would therefore humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to the conſideration of Congreſs whether it may not be expedient for them to addreſs the ſeveral legiſlative and executive powers of the States on this ſubject as early as poſſible, and in the moſt urgent terms. It appears to me, if they were to appoint, under the authority of Congreſs, proper active agents, that many neceſſaries might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in addition to thoſe [<hi>purchaſed</hi>] on public account. Beſides this, I think the exigency of our affairs requires that they ſhould reſolve on an immediate aſſeſſment to be made on the inhabitants. If theſe modes were adopted, conſiderable aids might be derived, and in a way much leſs exceptionable than that of ſeizing by the army. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies in many States, I believe, are now ſitting; and I have no doubt, upon a requiſition by Congreſs, but they will give attention to the meaſure.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed you will receive a copy of a letter from general Putnam, which came to hand to-day. You will find his and governor Clinton's opinion reſpecting the fortifications neceſſary to be made for the ſecurity of the North-river. As ſoon as I heard that Warner's militia were coming down to reinforce me, I immediately wrote to countermand
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:029737_0531_0FE29BBAE3B3B988"/>
them, and directed that they ſhould be retained to carry on the neceſſary works during the time they are to ſerve. My letter on this ſubject was on the ninth inſtant. As to the other troops, the propriety of bringing them here, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, is not to be queſtioned. We are told through vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous channels that Sir Henry Clinton is coming round with all the force that can be poſſibly ſpared from New-York; and it is ſaid that thoſe on Staten-Iſland are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>. It is added alſo that the inhabitants of the former are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alarmed and diſguſted, and that general Tryon is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the militia of Long-Iſland for the defence of the city. General Putnam's letter will alſo evince the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity there is for a large and immediate ſupply of money being ſent to the pay-maſter-general.</p>
                     <p>I have alſo the honour to tranſmit you a copy of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port by a board of general officers, on the ſubject of rations, which I ſubmit to the conſideration of Congreſs. The eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment and regulations which they propoſe appear to me to be juſt and neceſſary, ſuppoſing the commiſſary's eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate to be right, which I preſume is the caſe, from the exorbitant price which has been and is now paid for every ſpecies of proviſion. The neceſſity of an alteration in the former value has been long urged by many officers; and for want of it, ſeveral, I believe, have left the ſervice.</p>

                     <p>I AM ſorry to inform you that Fort-Mifflin was evacuated the night before laſt, after a defence which does credit to the American arms, and will ever reflect the
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:029737_0532_0FE29B3B174D1298"/>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n of the garriſon. The works were entirely beat down, every piece of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non diſmounted, and one of the enemy's ſhips ſo near that ſhe threw grenades into the fort, and killed men upon the platforms, from her tops, before they quitted the iſland. This ſhip had been cut down for the purpoſe, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed that ſhe made but a ſmall draught of water, and by theſe means warped in between Fort-Mifflin and Province-Iſland. Some complaints are made that the captains of the galleys did not ſufficiently exert themſelves to drive this veſſel from her ſtation: but I ſhall not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any thing upon the matter till a proper inquiry is made.</p>
                     <p>Nothing in the courſe of this campaign has taken up ſo much of the attention and conſideration of myſelf and all the general officers, as the poſſibility of giving a further relief to Fort-Mifflin than what we had already afforded. Such a garriſon was thrown into it as has been found by experience capable of defending it to the laſt extremity: and Red-Bank, which was deemed eſſentially neceſſary, not only for the purpoſe of keeping open the communication, but of annoying the enemy's ſhips and covering our own fleet, has been poſſeſſed by a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble detachment from this army. The only remaining and practicable mode of giving relief to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ort was by diſlodging the enemy from Province-Iſland, from whence they kept up an inceſſant fire. But this, from the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ground, was not to be attempted with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſafety to the attacking party, without the whole or a conſiderable part of the army ſhould be removed to the weſt ſide of Schuylkill to ſupport and cover it.</p>
                     <p>To account for this, you muſt be made acquainted with the nature of the ground. In order to have made the attack upon Province-Iſland, the party deſtined for that ſervice, which ſhould have been at leaſt fifteen hundred, muſt have marched down the Cheſter road as far as the Bell inn near Derby, and thence, turning towards Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aware, muſt have proceeded about four miles further through a neck of land, to the iſland. The enemy have a bridge at the middle ferry upon Schuylkill, which is but four miles from the Bell inn: conſequently, by throwing a body of men over that bridge upon the firſt diſcovery of
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:029737_0533_0FE29BBC66E14EE0"/>
our deſign, and marching down to the Bell, they would have effectually cut off our detachment upon their return. It is true the covering party might have conſiſted of a leſs number than the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e army: but then thoſe remaining upon this ſide of the river would have been too few to have been entruſted with all the artillery and ſtores of the army, within twelve miles of the enemy.</p>
                     <p>There were many and very forcible reaſons againſt a total remove to the weſt ſide of Schuylkill. Leaving all our ſtores at Eaſton, Bethlehem and Allentown uncov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, and abandoning ſeveral of our hoſpitals within reach of the enemy, firſt preſented themſelves. Another, and, in my opinion, a more weighty reaſon than either of the preceding, was the importance of ſupporting the poſt at Red-Bank, upon which that of Fort-Mifflin in a great meaſure depended, as through it we ſent in ſupplies of men, proviſion and ammunition. The enemy, ſenſible of this, endeavoured to diſlodge us from Red-Bank on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſecond of laſt month; which, as Congreſs have been informed, coſt them four hundred men.</p>
                     <p>Now, had our army been on the weſt ſide of Schuylkill, they might, without any danger of an attack upon their lines, have thrown over ſo conſiderable a force into Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, that they might have overpowered the garriſon, and, by making themſelves maſters of it, have reduced Fort-Mifflin by famine or want of ammunition. Thus we ſhould in all probability have loſt both poſts by one ſtroke. They might alſo, by taking poſſeſſion of the fords upon Schuylkill, have rendered the junction of our northern reinforcements with us a very difficult, if not an imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable matter: and, ſhould any accident have happened to them, we ſhould have ſtood a very poor chance of looking general Howe in the face through the winter with an inferior army. We ſhould finally have thrown the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into ſuch a ſituation, that we muſt inevitably have drawn on a general engagement before our reinforcements arrived; which, conſidering our diſparity of numbers, would probably have ended with the moſt diſagreeable conſequences.</p>
                     <p>It was therefore determined a few days ago to wait the arrival of the reinforcement from the northward before
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:029737_0534_0FE29B3C9A4985D0"/>
any alteration could ſafely be made in the diſpoſition of the army: and I was not without hopes that the fort would have held out till that time. That we might then have moved without endangering the ſtores, I had given orders for the removal of them, from the places before mentioned, to Lebanon and other places in Lancaſter county, which is at any rate more ſafe and convenient than where they were.</p>
                     <p>As the keeping poſſeſſion of Red-Bank, and thereby ſtill preventing the enemy from weighing the chevaux-de-friſe before the froſt obliges their ſhips to quit the river, has become a matter of the greateſt importance, I have determined to ſend down general St. Clair, general Knox, and baron Kalb, to take a view of the ground, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to form a judgment of the moſt probable means of ſecuring it. They will at the ſame time ſee how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I am informed that it is matter of amazement, and that reflections have been thrown out againſt this army, for not being more active and enterpriſing than, in the opinion of ſome, they ought to have been. If the charge is juſt, the beſt way to account for it will be to refer you to the returns of our ſtrength, and thoſe which I can produce of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and to the incloſed abſtract of the clothing now actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanting for the army: and then I think the wonder will be, how they keep the field at all in tents at this ſeaſon of the year. What ſtock the clothier-general has to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this demand, or what are his proſpects, he himſelf will inform you, as I have directed him to go to York-town to lay theſe matters before Congreſs. There are, beſides, moſt of thoſe in the hoſpitals more bare than thoſe in the field: many remain there for want of clothes only.</p>
                     <p>Several general officers, unable to procure clothing in the common line, have employed agents to purchaſe up what could be found in different parts of the country. General Wayne, among others, has employed Mr. Zantzinger of Lancaſter, who has purchaſed to the amount
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:029737_0535_0FE29BC7952957D8"/>
of four thouſand five hundred pounds, for which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires a draught upon the treaſury-board. Incloſed you have a copy of his letter. I am not clear whether this application ſhould properly be made to the treaſury, or the clothier-general, who ſhould charge the money to the regiments for whom the clothes are, as ſo much advanced to them. If the latter ſhould appear the moſt proper mode, I will order it to be done.</p>
                     <p>I am anxiouſly waiting the arrival of the troops from the northward, who ought, from the time they have had my orders, to have been here before this. Colonel Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, one of my aides, is up the North-river, doing all he can to puſh them forward: but he writes me word that he finds many unaccountable delays thrown in his way. However, I am in hopes that many days will not elapſe before a brigade or two, at leaſt, arrive. The want of theſe troops has embarraſſed all my meaſures exceedingly.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favours of the thirteenth and nineteenth inſtant with their incloſures. I am well aſſured Congreſs have not been inattentive to the neceſſities of the army; and that the deficiency in our ſupplies, particularly in the article of clothing, has ariſen from the difficulty of importing, on account of the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fleet that line our coaſt. However, I am perſuaded that conſiderable relief might be drawn from the different States, were they to exert themſelves properly. This I hope will be the caſe as ſoon as they receive the preſſing recommendations of Congreſs upon the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>It has been the unvaried cuſtom of the enemy, from the commencement of the preſent conteſt, to try every artifice and device to delude the people. The meſſage through John Brown was calculated for this end. I am ſurpriſed Mr. Willing ſhould ſuffer himſelf to be impoſed on by

He knows that there is a plain, obvious way for general and lord Howe to communicate any propoſals they wiſh to make, to Congreſs, without the intervention of a ſecond and third hand. But this would not ſuit their views. I am ſorry that Mr. Brown ſhould be the bearer of the meſſage; as, from the character I have had of him, he is a worthy, well-diſpoſed man. It has been frequently mentioned that he had intereſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much in behalf of our priſoners, and had afforded them every relief and comfort his circumſtances would allow him to give.</p>
                     <p>I have been endeavouring to effect an exchange of priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, from principles of juſtice, and from motives of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity: but at preſent I have no proſpect of it. Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> general Howe has aſſured our officers it was his wiſh, and, if it could not be done, that he ſhould readily agree to their releaſe on parole. The incloſed copies of my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and his anſwer will ſhew Congreſs what has paſſed between us upon that ſubject; and at the ſame time, that I had remonſtrated againſt the ſevere and cruel treatment of the priſoners, and propoſed the plan of ſending in a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſon to inquire into the facts, before the receipt of their reſolution. Their ſufferings, I am perſuaded, have been great, and ſhocking to humanity. I have called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on general Howe for redreſs, and an explicit anſwer to my letter of the fourteenth. If I do not receive one by to-morrow night, with the moſt poſitive and ſatisfactory aſſurances that a proper conduct ſhall be obſerved towards them in future, we muſt retaliate, however much we wiſh to avoid ſeverity, and meaſures that bear the ſmalleſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of rigour or inhumanity.</p>

                        </gap>ll and minute inveſtigation of the charges againſt him, he was honourably acquitted, and in terms of high reſpect.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorry to inform Congreſs that the enemy are now in poſſeſſion of all the water defences. Fort-Mifflin and that at Red-Bank mutually depended on each other for ſupport: and the reduction of the former made the tenure of the latter extremely precarious, if not impracticable. After the loſs of Fort-Mifflin, it was found Red-Bank could derive no advantages from the galleys and armed veſſels—(they could not maintain their ſtation)—and, in caſe of inveſtiture, the garriſon could have no ſupplies, no retreat, nor any hope of relief, but ſuch as might ariſe from a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior force acting without on the rear of the enemy, and diſlodging them. Under theſe circumſtances, the garriſon was obliged to evacuate it on the night of the twentieth inſtant, on the approach of lord Cornwallis, who had croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the river from Cheſter with a detachment, ſuppoſed to be about two thouſand men, and formed a junction with the troops lately arrived from New-York, and thoſe that had been landed before at Billingſport.</p>
                     <p>From general Varnum's account, I have reaſon to hope that we ſaved moſt of the ſtores, except a few heavy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non: however, I cannot be particular in this inſtance. I am alſo to add, from the intelligence I have received, that moſt if not all the armed veſſels have been burned by our own people, except the galleys, one brig, and two ſloops, which are ſaid to have run by the city. How far this might be founded in neceſſity, I am not able to determine; but I ſuppoſe it was done under that idea, and an apprehenſion of their falling into the enemy's hands if they attempted to paſs up the river.</p>
                     <p>Upon the firſt information I had of lord Cornwallis's movement, I detached general Huntington's brigade to join general Varnum, and, as ſoon as poſſible, general Greene with his diviſion; hoping that theſe,—with Glover's brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade which was on the march through Jerſey, and which I directed to file off to the left for the ſame purpoſe,—and with ſuch militia as could be collected,—would be able to
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:029737_0538_0FE29D180C9B8DE8"/>
defeat the enemy's deſign, and to preſerve the fort. But they were ſo rapid in their advances, that our troops could not form a junction and arrive in time to ſuccour the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon; which obliged them to withdraw.</p>
                     <p>General Greene is ſtill in Jerſey; and when Glover's brigade joins him, if an attack can be made on lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis with a proſpect of ſucceſs, I am perſuaded it will be done. About a hundred and ſeventy of Morgan's corps are alſo gone to reinforce him.</p>
                     <p>Generals Poor and Patterſon with their brigades, and colonel Bailey with Learned's, are now in camp. The laſt arrived on Friday evening, the other two in the courſe of yeſterday. I have not yet obtained returns of their ſtrength; but, from the accounts of the officers, they will amount in the whole to twenty-three or twenty-four hundred rank and file. But I find many of them are very deficient in the articles of ſhoes, ſtockings, breeches, and blankets. Beſides theſe, about three hundred and fifty men,—detachments from Lee's, Jackſon's, and Henley's regiments,—have joined me.</p>
                     <p>Yeſterday evening the enemy burned ſeveral houſes in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, and they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the moſt wanton ſpoil in many others.</p>

                     <p>I WAS yeſterday morning honoured with your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the twenty-ſecond inſtant. I wiſh the meaſures Congreſs have adopted may effectually ſuppreſs the diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances in the weſtern department. Should they prove ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, and the ſavages and wicked deluded inhabitants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a ſevere check, it is probable they will not be induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again to take part againſt us, or at leaſt for ſome conſiderable time. Colonel Crawford ſet out yeſterday evening, and will be with Congreſs, I expect, in the courſe of two or three days to take their commands.</p>
                     <p>I was much obliged by the foreign intelligence you were pleaſed to tranſmit me: it is agreeable and intereſting; and I heartily wiſh there may be an early declaration of hoſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:029737_0539_0FE29C22A7820F38"/>
between France and Britain. From theſe advices, things ſeem to be getting into a proper train for it: and it is not eaſily to be conceived that it can be much longer delayed. However, our expectations have not been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in this inſtance, and they may yet be held in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe. The political reaſons, that lead to delay on the part of France, I do not perfectly underſtand. As to Britain, her honour is loſt in the conteſt with us, and the moſt indignant inſults will ſcarcely be able to draw her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from her preſent purſuits. The account of Mr. Lee having effected the purpoſes of his embaſſy at the court of Berlin is of great importance. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I muſt take the liberty to requeſt the deciſion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs on the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e of the nine firſt-raiſed Virginia regiments as early as circumſtances will permit. If the plan propoſed for re-enliſting them is judged expedient, one capital in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to that end, ſuggeſted by the officers, will ceaſe if it is longer delayed. It is a matter of conſiderable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and of which I wiſh to be ſatisfied as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. I ſhould alſo be happy in their determination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the marquis De la Fayette. He is more and more ſolicitous to be in actual ſervice, and is preſſing in his appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for a command. I ventured before to ſubmit my ſentiments upon the meaſure; and I ſtill fear a refuſal will not only induce him to return in diſguſt, but may involve ſome unfavourable conſequences. There are now ſome vacant diviſions in the army, to one of which he may be appointed, if it ſhould be the pleaſure of Congreſs. I am convinced he poſſeſſes a large ſhare of that military ardour which generally characterizes the nobility of his country. He went to Jerſey with general Greene, and I find he has not been inactive there. This you will perceive by the following extract from a letter juſt received from general Greene.</p>
                     <p>"The marquis, with about four hundred militia and the rifle corps, attacked the enemy's piquet laſt evening, killed about twenty, wounded many more, and took about twenty priſoners. The marquis is charmed with the ſpirited
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:029737_0540_0FE1BFC7D0E7E950"/>
behaviour of the militia and rifle corps: they drove the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy about half a mile, and kept the ground until dark. The enemy's piquet conſiſted of about three hundred, and were reinforced during the ſkirmiſh. The marquis is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be in the way of danger."</p>
                     <p>* * * I muſt requeſt you to tranſmit me a number of blank commiſſions as ſoon as you have an opportunity to do it. There are ſeveral vacancies yet to fill; and the officers entitled to them are anxious to be appointed. The commiſſions I want ſhould be under your ſignature, and not Mr. Hancock's. I mention this, leſt you ſhould ſend any of the latter that might remain. Thoſe ſigned by you will be competent to all caſes: thoſe by Mr. Hancock, only to ſuch as happened during his preſidency; and of theſe I have now ſome.</p>

                        <hi>November</hi> 27. Incloſed you will receive a copy of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Howe's letter in anſwer to mine of the fourteenth and twenty-third, which only came to hand laſt night, and at an inſtant when I was giving the commiſſary of priſoners inſtructions forthwith to confine a number of the officers in our hands, and to put the privates under very different reſtrictions from thoſe they have been uſed to. I am in hopes the treatment of ours will be much better in future. Mr. Boudinot will immediately take meaſures for releaſing the officers on parole, that we may relieve an equal number of ours. I ſhould have been happy to have effected a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral exchange, or a partial one: but general Howe will not upon any terms but thoſe he has ever inſiſted on.</p>
                     <p>The enemy have got up ſeveral of their ſhips to the city. It is likely they have found a paſſage through the chevaux-de-friſe, or they may have removed them.</p>

                     <p>ON Saturday I had the honour to receive your favour of the twenty-ſixth ultimo, with its incloſures. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve of the twenty-fifth I have publiſhed in orders, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to direction, and ſhall be happy if Congreſs can fall upon meaſures to render the ſituation of the officers and
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:029737_0541_0FE29C242C9ED230"/>
ſoldiery more eligible than what it now is. At preſent it is truly diſtreſſing: and, unleſs ſome means can be deviſed to ſupport them more comfortably, we ſhall have to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the moſt alarming conſequences. The officers, or at leaſt a large proportion of them, as well as the men, are in a moſt diſagreeable condition as to clothing, and without any certain proſpect of relief: and, what is ſtill more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,—if perchance they have an opportunity of purchaſing, (which is ſeldom the caſe) they have the mortification to find themſelves totally incompetent to it, from the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of our money, and the exorbitant prices demanded for all articles in this way. This is the ſource of great uneaſineſs, of indifference to the ſervice, and of repeated (I may ſay, daily) applications to leave it, and theſe too by as good officers as are in the American line.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect to promotions for merit and intrepidity, I would beg leave to obſerve, that, though theſe are proper conſiderations to found them upon, yet they ſhould be made with the greateſt caution and attention, and only in caſes of the moſt eminent and diſtinguiſhed ſervices. Every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion or riſe out of common courſe cannot fail to excite uneaſineſs in a greater or leſſer degree: and nothing will reconcile them to the army at large, and particularly the officers more immediately affected by them, but where the cauſes are known and acknowledged. This I mention from my wiſhes to promote the public intereſt, from my knowing that harmony is eſſential to this end, and from no other motives whatever.</p>
                     <p>Before the receipt of your favour, I do not recollect to have heard of John Simper's caſe. His brother has not been with me. As ſoon as he arrives, I ſhall give direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for him to be releaſed from his preſent confinement, and to be forwarded to Cecil county.</p>
                     <p>I have nothing material to inform you of. Lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis and the detachment under his command (mentioned in my laſt) returned from Jerſey on Thurſday. We had reaſon to expect an attack ſince, from our advices from the city, but have been diſappointed. General Greene has alſo joined me with all the troops that were with him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Huntington's brigade, which will be in to-day.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE the honour to inform you, that, in the courſe of laſt week, from a variety of intelligence, I had reaſon to expect that general Howe was preparing to give us a general action. Accordingly, on Thurſday night he moved from the city with all his force, except a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable part left in his lines and redoubts,—and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the next morning on Cheſnut-hill, in front of, and about three miles diſtant from, our right wing. As ſoon as their poſition was diſcovered, the Pennſylvania militia were ordered from our right, to ſkirmiſh with their light advanced parties; and I am ſorry to mention that briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier-general Irvine who led them on had the misfortune to be wounded and to be made priſoner. Nothing more oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured on that day.</p>
                     <p>On Friday night the enemy changed their ground, and moved to our left, within a mile of our line, where they remained quiet and advantageouſly poſted the whole of the next day. On Sunday they inclined ſtill further to our left; and, from every appearance, there was reaſon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend they were determined on an action. In this movement, their advanced and flanking parties were warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attacked by colonel Morgan and his corps, and alſo by the Maryland militia under colonel Giſt. Their loſs I cannot aſcertain: but I am informed it was conſiderable, having regard to the number of the corps who engaged them. About ſunſet, after various marches and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marches, they halted; and I ſtill ſuppoſed, from their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and preceding manoeuvres, that they would attack us in the night or early the next morning: but in this I was miſtaken.</p>
                     <p>On Monday afternoon they began to move again, and, inſtead of advancing, filed off from their right: and the firſt certain account that I could obtain of their intentions was, that they were in full march towards Philadelphia by two or three routes. I immediately detached light parties after them to fall upon their rear: but they were not able to come up with them.</p>
                     <p>The enemy's loſs, as I have obſerved, I cannot aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. One account from the city is that five hundred
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:029737_0543_0FE29C25AEF83B20"/>
wounded had been ſent in: another is that eighty-two waggons had gone in with men in this ſituation. Theſe, I fear, are both exaggerated, and not to be depended upon. We loſt twenty-ſeven men in Morgan's corps, killed and wounded, beſides major Morris, a brave and gallant officer, who is among the latter. Of the Maryland militia there were alſo ſixteen or ſeventeen wounded. I have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived further returns yet.</p>
                     <p>I ſincerely wiſh that they had made an attack, as the iſſue, in all probability, from the diſpoſition of our troops, and the ſtrong ſituation of our camp, would have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and happy. At the ſame time I muſt add, that reaſon, prudence, and every principle of policy, forbad us quitting our poſt to attack them. Nothing but ſucceſs would have juſtified the meaſure: and this could not be expected from their poſition.</p>
                     <p>The conſtant attention and watching I was obliged to give the enemy's movements would not allow me to write before: and this I believe was the leſs material, as I have reaſon to think your committee who were in camp moſt of the time, and who are now here, tranſmitted an account of ſuch occurrences as they deemed important in any degree. The firſt cauſe too, Sir, and my engagements with the committee previous to the coming out of the enemy, will, I truſt, ſufficiently apologize for my not acknowledging be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the honour of your favours of the thirtieth ultimo and the firſt inſtant, which came to hand in due order and time.</p>

He entered the ſervice at the commencement of the war, and has for ſome time paſt acted as aide-de-camp to major-general Greene. He is active, ſenſible, and enterpriſing, and has rendered me very great aſſiſtance ſince the army has been in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, by procuring me conſtant and certain intelligence of the motions and intentions of the enemy.

                     <p>I YESTERDAY evening had the honour of your favour of the firſt inſtant, with its ſeveral incloſures.—The letter you allude to, from the committee of Congreſs and board of war, came to hand on Saturday morning: but it does not mention the regulations adopted for removing the difficulties and failures in the commiſſary line. I truſt they will be vigorous, or the army cannot exiſt. It will never anſwer, to procure ſupplies of clothing or proviſion by coercive meaſures:—the ſmall ſeizures made of the former a few days ago in conſequence of the moſt preſſing and abſolute neceſſity,—when that, or to diſſolve, was the alternative,—excited the greateſt alarm and uneaſineſs even among our beſt and warmeſt friends. Such procedures may give a momentary relief; but, if repeated, will prove of the moſt pernicious conſequence. Beſides ſpreading diſaffection, jealouſy, and fear in the people, they never fail, even in the moſt veteran troops under the moſt rigid and exact diſcipline, to raiſe in the ſolidery a diſpoſition to licentiouſneſs, to plunder and robbery,—difficult to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs afterwards, and which has proved not only ruinous to the inhabitants, but, in many inſtances, to armies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I regret the occaſion that compelled us to the meaſure the other day; and ſhall conſider it among the greateſt of our misfortunes, if we ſhould be under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of practiſing it again.</p>

Any future appointments that may be material will be made out of the line of the army, if circumſtances will allow it. In gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral this has been the caſe.</p>
                     <p>The proceedings of Congreſs for the detention of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Burgoyne and army, or rather ſuſpending their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation, till the convention of Saratoga is explicitly ratified and notified by the court of Britain, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſecret here till they are duly announced by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. This procedure, when known to the general, will chagrin him much: for I learn by a letter from general Heath, that the refuſal to let his troops embark at Rhode-Iſland or in the Sound had given him ſome uneaſineſs. I have nothing of importance to communicate; and have only to add that</p>

                        <p>If ſuch officers and men as were in camp when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves were paſſed, and who continue the whole winter, are the only objects to be benefited, it is urged that many who have diſcharged their duty with fidelity,—who have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced a ſevere campaign to that time or till a few days before,—who may be now out of camp, and yet be here in the courſe of the winter,—will be excluded. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, all officers and men on furlough, though they ſhould have been long from their homes before,—perhaps much longer, in many inſtances, than many who remain,—and whoſe private and family neceſſities oblige them to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,—thoſe who have fallen ſick from their ſervices, and who are in hoſpitals or the country,—detachments on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,—theſe would be excluded. Such diſcriminations, I believe, will give great diſguſt and uneaſineſs. It is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, in caſes of this nature, to draw a proper line of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, and impoſſible to do it in ſuch a way as to give ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>I do not mean to enlarge upon the ſubject: my only wiſh is to have it preciſely aſcertained who are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and paid, and who are not, under the reſolves, that I may not on the one hand act contrary to public inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and on the other give cauſe of complaint, and perhaps do wrong to individuals.</p>
                        <p>Knowing the difficulty of drawing a proper line, and the diſguſt and murmurings that ever attend diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,—were I to adviſe upon the ſubject, only ſuch officers and men ſhould be excluded (ſince extra pay has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined on) as are abſent from camp without regular authority, or ſuch as may abuſe indulgencies regularly obtained.</p>
                        <p>It has been obſerved by ſome, and perhaps with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, that there are officers and men now in camp, or who may be ſhortly in, who have no ſuperior claim to merit,—whoſe affairs are not ſo preſſing, or who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had indulgencies,—or who, from their being nearer their friends and connexions, have had opportunities of ſeeing them frequently, of ordering their concerns, and
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:029737_0547_0FE29C3217412BB8"/>
viſiting their homes once, twice, or perhaps oftener in the campaign, whilſt they who were more remote were precluded from any of theſe advantages, and were conſtantly on duty. Theſe conſiderations will have their weight in the ſcale of diſguſt with the parties intereſted. For my part, though the reſolves were founded in principles of generoſity,—were intended to reward merit, and promote the ſervice,—from the difficulties attending the execution, I wiſh they had never been made, eſpecially as I believe officers and men would in a little time have become tolerably well rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onciled to their quarters.</p>

                     <p>AS I do not recollect with preciſion whether any, or what reſolutions have been made by Congreſs reſpecting captures by the army or detachments of it, and not having all their proceedings with me, with which I have been hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured from time to time, to aſſiſt my inquiries upon the ſubject,—I muſt take the liberty to requeſt that they will determine, and favour me with their deciſions upon, the following points:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. What articles captured are to be conſidered as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic property?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whether articles captured by parties or detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not determined public property, are to be diſtrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uted or ſold for the benefit of the army at large, or are to be conſidered as the ſole and excluſive right of the captors?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If, in general inſtances, ſuch articles as are taken, and which are not conſidered public property, are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be the ſole and excluſive right of the captors,—are ſtationary detachments, who, from their ſituation, have much more than a common chance of making prizes, to be conſidered upon the ſame footing?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If there is to be a diſtinction between ſtationary and other detachments,—and the former are denied an excluſive right to the captures they make,—what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the articles are they to have?</p>
                     <p>

I have been induced to ſtate the above queſtions on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome difficulties that have ariſen reſpecting the prize taken by the detachment at Wilmington under gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Smallwood, that the ſame may be determined, and certain principles eſtabliſhed, to govern in like and future caſes. In the inſtance of this prize, as the baggage taken (from general Smallwood's and the officers' repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) will be but inconſiderable when divided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I have conſented that they ſhall have it at a juſt appraiſement and diſtribution, and have directed him to have the whole, and the value, properly inventoried, that ſuch order may be made reſpecting the latter as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of Congreſs may juſtify and point out. I have alſo directed the ſale of the brig, as I underſtand ſome offers have been made for her, and as her ſituation may be conſidered hazardous and precarious.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the brig taken at Wilmington, a veſſel has ſtranded at Reedy-Iſland with goods on board. It is ſaid a quantity of rum, ſome bales of cloth, a number of hats, and ſome other articles (all wanted by the army) have been taken out of her by the militia, particularly thoſe of Kent county. Theſe general Smallwood is endeavouring to find, that they may be of public benefit.</p>

                     <p>THIS will be delivered to you by the chevalier De Mauduit du Pleſſis, who was among the firſt French officers that joined the army of the United States. The gallant conduct of this young gentleman at Brandywine, German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, and his diſtinguiſhed ſervices at Fort-Mercer where he united the offices of engineer and commandant of artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, entitle him to the particular notice of Congreſs. He made ſeveral judicious alterations in the works at Red-Bank, ſhewed great good conduct during the action in which the Heſſians were repulſed, and was ſpoken of, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in terms of the higheſt applauſe, by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officer of the poſt. After the evacuation was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon, he became the means of ſaving ſome valuable
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:029737_0549_0FE29C339AE377F8"/>
artillery and ſtores, and cheerfully undertook, as volunteer, the hazardous operation of blowing up the magazine, &amp;c. without the apparatus uſually provided upon ſuch occaſions. I muſt further add in monſieur Du Pleſſis' favour, that he poſſeſſes a degree of modeſty not always found in men who have performed brilliant actions. It is with pleaſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I recommend it to Congreſs to grant him a brevet of lieutenant-colonel,—a reward due to his merit, and which will not have the inconvenience of occaſioning any diſſatisfaction in the corps to which he belongs.</p>
                     <p>As ſome particular circumſtances have prevented mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Du Pleſſis waiting upon Congreſs ſooner, I hope there will be no difficulty in antedating the brevet, ſo that the recompenſe may more immediately follow the ſervices which he has done. At the ſame time, that there may not be any uneaſineſs on the part of monſieur Fleury, whom Congreſs have been pleaſed to reward in the ſame way and as their times of ſervice are nearly equal in France, I would propoſe that monſieur Du Pleſſis' bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet ſhould bear the ſame date, viz. the twenty-ſixth of November.</p>

As the proceedings of Congreſs in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſeem to imply that our unfortunate people in the hands of the enemy are to be victualled by us, I have only to wiſh that the ſupplies may be conſtant and plentiful. I have tranſmitted your letter to Mr. Boudinot who is out of camp, and have requeſted his moſt pointed attention to the buſineſs. I have alſo written to general Howe upon the occaſion, and incloſed him one of the copies. In my next I ſhall take the liberty of tranſmitting you a copy of my letter to him on this head, and of ſome others which have lately paſſed between us.</p>

                     <p>The ſituation of the affairs of the army has not till lately made it convenient to go into the inquiry directed by the reſolve of the twenty-eighth of November, of the loſſes of the Forts Montgomery and Clinton in the State of New-York, and of Fort-Mifflin on Delaware. With reſpect to the two former, it happens that almoſt all the principal officers acting in that quarter were in ſome way or other ſo far concerned in the affair, as to make them improper for proſecuting the inquiry. I therefore propoſe to ſend officers from this army. If his health will permit, I ſhould wiſh general M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal to preſide.

                     <p>With reſpect to Fort-Mifflin, the inquiry involves very extenſive conſiderations, and, more or leſs, affects almoſt all the general officers in this army, whoſe advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in the meaſures taken make them in ſome degree

                     <p>I AM now to acknowledge the honour of your ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral favours of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-firſt inſtant, which, with their reſpective incloſures, have been duly received.</p>
                     <p>In compliance with the reſolution of Congreſs of the fifth inſtant, tranſmitted in your letter of the ſeventh, I was about to take meaſures for appointing a court-martial and bringing on the trials which they direct. But on recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the papers you were pleaſed to ſend me, I do not find that the committee have made any particular charges againſt the officers who are to be the objects of trial. It was probably the intention of Congreſs that theſe charges ſhould be laid by me. But as I might err in doing it, and not fully correſpond with their views in the matter, eſpecially as it would require conſiderable time and thought to make myſelf ſufficiently acquainted with it from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers collected, I ſhould think it would be moſt adviſeable for Congreſs to ſtate explicitly the charges they wiſh to have exhibited againſt the officers reſpectively; and then the buſineſs may be proceeded on with propriety.</p>

                        <pb n="215" facs="unknown:029737_0553_0FE29C406DBD4E08"/>
Beſides the above reaſons which operate generally againſt my exhibiting the charges, in the particular inſtance of general Schuyler, it is impoſſible for me to do it, as I do not know what inſtructions he had received from Congreſs from time to time as to the objects of his command, nor preciſely what theſe were. Theſe appear to me neceſſary to be known, and eſſential to carry on a proſecution againſt him.</p>
                     <p>When Congreſs ſhall have arranged theſe points, and are pleaſed to honour me with them, I will purſue the ſpeedieſt meaſures to bring on the trials. The ſooner this can be done, the better, as ſome of the parties are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anxious, and ſtrongly importune it.</p>
                     <p>Baron Steuben has arrived at camp. He appears to be much of a gentleman, and, as far as I have had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of judging, a man of military knowledge, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the world.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed extract of a letter from general Putnam will ſhew how great the diſtreſſes are in that quarter for want of money. He has deſcribed their neceſſities ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is unneceſſary for me to add upon the ſubject: I ſhall only obſerve that his account is more than juſtified by many other letters, and that I am perſuaded the earlieſt poſſible ſupply will be forwarded, that the very important and intereſting works carrying on there may not be the leaſt retarded.</p>
                     <p>I am under ſome embarraſſments reſpecting the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Virginia regiment. It was raiſed on the weſt ſide of the Allegany and towards Pittſburg, with aſſurances from the officers, it is ſaid, that the men ſhould not be drawn from that quarter. This circumſtance, added to the diſturbances by the Indians, and the expoſed ſituation of their families, has been the cauſe of great deſertions, and is at preſent the ſource of much uneaſineſs, and the more ſo, as part of the regiment was never marched from thence. I think the whole ſhould be united either here or there, and wiſh Congreſs to direct me upon the ſubject. At the ſame time that their caſe, if truly repreſented, ſeems to be hard, and to merit the indulgence they claim, I would obſerve that the twelfth regiment from the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of the ſame State, and the eighth and twelfth

                     <p>I TAKE the liberty of tranſmitting you copies of three letters from general Howe, of the fourteenth and twenty-firſt ultimo, and of the ſecond inſtant, with their incloſures. The unhappy violation of the flag of truce has laid us under no ſmall embarraſſments, and has afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the enemy good grounds for complaint and triumph at the ſame time. This however is the natural conſequence, and muſt ever be the caſe, where different powers counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act each other in matters of the moſt delicate importance. There are ſome circumſtances attending this affair, which it may poſſibly be in the power of Congreſs to throw light upon. If they can, I ſhall be obliged by their aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>March</hi> 8. In conſequence of the letters which have lately paſſed between general Howe and myſelf, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe of the fifth and tenth ultimo, copies of which I had the honour to tranſmit you in mine of the eighth, continued to the fourteenth, I was about to ſend com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to meet thoſe appointed by general Howe for adjuſting the diſputed points between us, carrying into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution an exchange of priſoners, and improving the old
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:029737_0555_0FE29C41F02D6B78"/>
cartel, as far as it might be practicable, for their better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation in future. This meeting was to be on the tenth inſtant: but, yeſterday morning, Dunlap's paper of the fourth being put into my hands, I found that a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution had been made the twenty-ſixth of February, calling for all accounts againſt priſoners in our hands, and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that no exchange ſhould take place, till the balance due thereon to the United States is diſcharged. Some of the States are not required to exhibit their claims till the firſt of June. The time that would be taken to adjuſt them, and make a delivery of the priſoners, would more than exhauſt all the enſuing ſummer.</p>
                     <p>This reſolution I cannot conſider as an intended infrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my engagements with general Howe: yet its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration is diametrically oppoſite both to the ſpirit and letter of the propoſitions made on my part, and acceded to on his. I ſuppoſed myſelf fully authoriſed "by the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and intentions" of Congreſs to act as I did: and I now conceive that the public as well as my own perſonal honour and faith are pledged for the performance.</p>
                     <p>By the direction of Congreſs, I in the firſt inſtance ſtipulated with general Howe an exchange of priſoners,—officer for officer, of equal rank,—ſoldier for ſoldier,—and citizen for citizen. This agreement they have ever approved, and repeatedly declared their willingneſs to carry into execution. Their reſolution of the twenty-fourth of March laſt empowered me (on condition of general Lee being declared exchangeable) not only <hi>"to proceed"</hi> to the exchange of priſoners according to the principles and regulations of the cartel before agreed on, but alſo to enter, into ſuch further principles and regulations as ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me moſt proper and advantageous. A ſubſequent reſolution of the ſixth of June holds forth the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, ſanctions my conduct and reaſonings in the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations about that time on the ſubject, and directs an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to them. No event has occurred ſince that period, by which I could conclude there was any alteration in the views of Congreſs:—ſo far from it, that all my late let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters breathing the ſame ſpirit with the former, and pointedly ſignifying my wiſh to bring about a general exchange, if not with an expreſs, at leaſt met with a tacit approbation.
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:029737_0556_0FE29BE577307AA0"/>
General Howe at length, by profeſſion, if not in reality, is willing to perform the agreement on the conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by me, and confirmed by them.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſaid, that, with whatever powers I was orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inally veſted to negociate an exchange, the reſolution of the nineteenth of December laſt was an abridgment of them, ſo far as to annex a new condition,—the ſettlement and payment of accounts previous to its taking place. I had no conception of this being the caſe in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, however the letter may warrant the conſtruction. Beſides the common principle of preventing the inconven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iences neceſſarily reſulting from allowing the enemy to make their payments in paper currency, I had reaſon to imagine that general Burgoyne's army was more particularly the object of the concluding clauſe. This interpretation I the more readily adopted; for, excluſive of the affairs of that army, I verily believed, that, from the confuſed defective ſtate of our accounts relating to priſoners, there would be a conſiderable balance in favour of Mr. Howe. Nor was the ſituation of our accounts the only reaſon for this belief: the priſoners in our hands, eſpecially thoſe weſtward of the Delaware, as I am informed, have been in a great meaſure ſupported by their own labour, and at the expenſe of the enemy, who have had agents conſtantly among us. If this is the caſe, the reaſon of the reſolve not applying, the effect ought not of courſe.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps it may be thought contrary to our intereſt to go into an exchange, as the enemy would derive more immediate advantage from it than we ſhould. This I ſhall not deny: but it appeared to me, that, on principles of genuine, extenſive policy, independent of the conſiderations of compaſſion and juſtice, we were under an obligation not to elude it. I have the beſt evidence that an event of this kind is the general wiſh of the country: I know it to be the wiſh of the army; and no one can doubt that it is the ardent wiſh of the unhappy ſufferers themſelves. We need only conſult the tide of humanity, and the ſympathies natural to thoſe connected by the cements of blood, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and a common dread of evil, to be convinced that the prevailing current of ſentiment demands an exchange. If the country, the army, and even the priſoners themſelves,
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:029737_0557_0FE29C4372166340"/>
had a preciſe idea of our circumſtances, and could be fully ſenſible of the diſadvantages that might attend the giving our enemy a conſiderable reinforcement without having an equivalent, they might perhaps be willing to make a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of their feelings to the motives of policy. But they have not this knowledge, and cannot be entruſted with it; and their reaſonings, of neceſſity, will be governed by what they feel.</p>
                     <p>Were an opinion once to be eſtabliſhed (and the enemy and their emiſſaries know very well how to inculcate it, if they are furniſhed with a plauſible pretext) that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly avoided an exchange, it would be a cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction and diſguſt to the country and to the army,—of reſentment and deſperation to our captive officers and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: to ſay nothing of the importance of not hazarding our national character but upon the moſt ſolid grounds, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in our embryo ſtate, from the influence it may have on our affairs abroad; it may not be a little dangerous to beget in the minds of our own countrymen a ſuſpicion that we do not pay the ſtricteſt obſervance to the maxims of honour and good faith.</p>
                     <p>It is prudent to uſe the greateſt caution not to ſhock the notions of general juſtice and humanity, univerſal among mankind, as well in a public as a private view. In a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the ſide of which the paſſions are ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned as in the preſent, men would be readily diſpoſed to believe the worſt, and cheriſh the moſt unfavourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions. Were the letters that have paſſed between gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Howe and myſelf from firſt to laſt, and the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Congreſs on the ſame ſubject, to be publiſhed with proper comments, it is much to be feared, if the exchange ſhould be deferred till the terms of the laſt reſolve were fulfilled, that it would be difficult to prevent our being generally accuſed with a breach of good faith. Perhaps it might be ſaid, that, while the enemy refuſed us juſtice, we fondly embraced the opportunity to be loud, perſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ering, inceſſant in our claims; but the moment they were willing to render it, we receded from ourſelves, and ſtarted new difficulties. This, I ſay, might be the reaſoning of ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulative minds; and they might conſider all our profeſſions
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:029737_0558_0FE29BE6F8F417E8"/>
as <hi>mere</hi> profeſſions; or, at beſt, that intereſt and policy were to be the only arbiters of their validity.</p>
                     <p>Imputations of this nature would have a tendency to unnerve our operations, by diminiſhing that reſpect and confidence which are eſſential to be placed in thoſe who are at the head of affairs either in the civil or military line. This, added to the proſpect of hopeleſs captivity, would be a great diſcouragement to the ſervice. The ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of both would be immenſe,—by increaſing the cauſes of diſcontent in the army, which are already too numerous, and many of which are in a great meaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable,—by fortifying that unwillingneſs which already appears too great, towards entering into the ſervice, and of courſe impeding the progreſs both of draughting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting,—by dejecting the courage of the ſoldiery, from an apprehenſion of the horrors of captivity,—and finally by reducing thoſe, whoſe lot it is to drink the bitter cup, to a deſpair which can only find relief by renouncing their attachments and engaging with their captors. Theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects have already been experienced in part from the obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that have lain in the way of exchanges: but if theſe obſtacles were once to ſeem the reſult of ſyſtem, they would become ten-fold. Nothing has operated more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeably upon the minds of the militia than the fear of captivity, on the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ting it has hitherto ſtood. What would be their reaſonings, if it ſhould be thought to ſtand-upon a worſe?</p>
                     <p>If a preſent temporary intereſt is to be a ruling principle, it is eaſy to prove that an exchange can never take place. The conſtitution of our army in reſpect to the term of ſervice for which our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> engage, and the dependence we are obliged to place on the militia, muſt forever operate againſt us in exchanges, and forbid an equality of advantages. Should it be ſaid that there are times when it might be more peculiarly unequal and injurious, and that the preſent is ſuch on account of the week condition of our army,—I anſwer that the delay neceſſarily involved in the previous negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ſubject, in delivering the priſoners from time to time in ſmall numbers and receiving others in their ſtead, and the mode of delivery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

leiſure to reinforce this army, (if it is to be done at all) ſo as to obviate in a great meaſure the ill conſequences apprehended.</p>
                     <p>But if the argument of intereſt on a partial ſcale be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued as far as it will go, not only the general conſideration thrown out above, but ſpecial ones appoſite to every ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will preſent themſelves, that we ought not to exchange: now we ought not, becauſe our army is weak!—when the ſeaſon is more advanced, and it is time for the campaign to open, we ought not, becauſe our army may be ſtrong, and it will be our buſineſs to avail ourſelves of our own ſtrength and the enemy's weakneſs, to ſtrike ſome deciſive blow!—if they, by the protection of their ſhipping and impregnable works, ſhould be able to baffle our attempts till the period of reinforcements from Europe arrive, it will ſurely then not be our intereſt to add numbers and ſtrength to an enemy already ſufficiently numerous and ſtrong!—Thus, by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of reaſoning, the golden era will never come, which is to relieve the miſeries of captivity. Our ſervice muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come odious: thoſe who are out of it will endeavour to keep ſo; and thoſe who are in it will wiſh to get out of it: every priſoner the enemy makes will be his ſoldier rather than ſubmit to a rigorous and deſpairing confinement.</p>
                     <p>If we do not ſeize the preſent propitious moment when the neceſſities of the enemy preſs them to reaſonable terms, to form and eſtabliſh a liberal cartel, it is not impoſſible, in the viciſſitudes and reverſes of war, that a time may come when we ſhould wiſh we had embraced it, and intereſt may ſtrongly impel the enemy to decline it, except on the moſt unequal conditions. True policy, as well as good faith, in my opinion, binds us to improve the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>There are however ſome ambiguities in general Howe's conduct, which require explanation, and ought to put us upon our guard. I determined to make the affair of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,—viz. to procure an exemption from captivity for them, if poſſible,—or, if not, (ſince it cannot now be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as a matter of right) to fix their exchangeability upon the eaſieſt and moſt unequivocal foundation,—an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable preliminary to any further procedure; and at the ſame time to ſecure the exchange of general Lee and all
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:029737_0560_0FE29BE87AE871C0"/>
other officers who have been the particular objects of exception.</p>
                     <p>The interview intended between general Howe's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners and thoſe on our part on the tenth inſtant is now poſtponed. I cannot doubt that Congreſs, in preſervation of the public faith and my perſonal honour, will remove all impediments that now oppoſe themſelves to my engagements, and that they will authoriſe me, through commiſſioners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the purpoſe, to negociate a more extenſive and competent cartel, upon ſuch principles as may appear ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous and founded in neceſſity,—any reſolutions here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore to the contrary notwithſtanding; and I muſt requeſt that they will favour me with their anſwer by the earlieſt opportunity.</p>
                     <p>The work, from its nature, will be difficult. Two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are concerned, whoſe intereſts are more than oppoſite in a common view. We ſhall endeavour to act for the beſt, and to promote the public ſervice as far as poſſible, though we may not be able to anſwer the expectations of all. But it ſhould be remembered, that, although general Howe's want of men affords a proſpect of favourable terms, yet he will not be diſpoſed to ſacrifice to it all conſiderations of general advantage in a contract of ſuch a nature; and it is not even to be hoped that it can take place except on princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of mutual benefit.</p>
                     <p>I perſuade myſelf that the freedom I have taken in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering my ſentiments ſo fully upon this occaſion will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be excuſed, as it proceeds from a deſire to place the motives of my conduct in a juſt point of view, and from an opinion of duty that led me to a free diſcuſſion of a ſubject, which, conſidered in all its lights, will appear to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend conſequences of the firſt delicacy and magnitude.</p>

The removal of ſo valuable a train of field artillery from. Albany to Farmington, as to a place of greater ſecurity, was certainly a meaſure highly proper; and you may be aſſured that every precaution ſhall be taken to eſcort them ſafely through Jerſey to this camp, when it is thought ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable to bring them hither.</p>
                     <p>You miſtook the intent of mine of the eighteenth of February.

                        </gap> and other foreign officers, as that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had been allowed to the Britiſh. I did not chooſe to give him any anſwer until I had applied to you, that I might know whether you had any reaſon for making ſuch diſtinction: and as you miſapprehended me, I ſhall ſtill be obliged to defer anſwering him till I hear from you. I think, conſidering the great number of officers of ours who are in captivity, it is our intereſt to exchange as many of their officers, priſoners under the convention, as we can.</p>
                     <p>Commiſſioners from me are to meet others from general Howe on the thirty-firſt of this month, to endeavour to ſettle a general exchange of priſoners. Until we know the iſſue of the negociation, it will be hardly worth while to alter the ſituation of the priſoners in Lancaſter county.</p>
                     <p>On the twenty-ſeventh of February I had occaſion to write to Congreſs, on the ſubject of yours of the third. It was occaſioned by a repreſentation from the colonel of the thirteenth Virginia regiment which was raiſed (as colonel M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Kay's and Cooke's were) to remain upon the frontier. Were this the caſe with only one regiment, I ſhould not heſitate, conſidering the face of affairs to the weſtward, to order it immediately to Fort-Pitt or the neighbourhood. But the eighth and twelfth Pennſylvania, and the twelfth and thirteenth Virginia, all claim the ſame right; and if the indulgence is granted to one, the others will be diſſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfied: and to ſpare them all at this time is impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>To regain the deſerters from thoſe regiments is certainly a very deſirable thing: and the mode you point out is the moſt probable. But I fear, if thoſe men who are now here find that the deſerters are not to be brought down to join
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:029737_0562_0FE29BF2EA577658"/>
their regiments in camp, that they may be induced to go off, in hopes of obtaining the ſame terms. I confeſs I am much embarraſſed by this matter, and ſhall be exceedingly glad to have the advice and aſſiſtance of Congreſs and the board upon the ſubject, before I come to any determination. It is an evil that will ever reſult from enliſtments for local purpoſes, when it is not convenient to abide by the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <p>ON Sunday night I had the honour to receive your favours of the firſt and fifth inſtant, with their incloſures.</p>
                     <p>I am happy to find that my paſt conduct reſpecting citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, in the correſpondence between general Howe and myſelf, is approved by Congreſs. They may reſt aſſured that their rights are ſtrongly impreſſed on my mind; and that, in all my tranſactions, every ſupport in my power ſhall be given them. I know their importance; and, in my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected negociations with general Howe, if poſſible, I will exempt citizens from captivity. However, I cannot hope to effect it, as I cannot demand it as a matter of right, ſince Congreſs themſelves, in their original reſolve directing a propoſition to be made for the exchange of priſoners, mentioned that of citizens,—which implied a right of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing them.</p>
                     <p>They may alſo be aſſured that general Lee will not be forgotten. He has all along been a principal object in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute: and, ſo far from doing any thing injurious to him, his
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:029737_0563_0FE29C50E9915B80"/>
right to be exchanged, and his releaſement, are intended to be placed upon the moſt explicit, unambiguous footing. Indeed, from the ſpirit of general Howe's letters collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, ſince his agreement to enlarge the officers on pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role in the firſt inſtance, and his extenſion of it in the laſt to an exchange,—though they are not free from ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,—it may be inferred, that, on ſending in lieutenant-col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Campbell and the Heſſian field-officers captured at Trenton, an exchange of all officers will immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence. It ſeems to be a point with him that it ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with them, as they have been longeſt in captivity. I have taken the liberty to incloſe you copies of three letters which have juſt paſſed between general Howe and myſelf, more particularly concerning general Lee, in which I have puſhed matters reſpecting him as far as I thought it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at this time. Every precaution will certainly be uſed to prevent the enemy gaining any advantage in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of priſoners.</p>
                     <p>With great deference, I would take the liberty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Congreſs ſeem to have carried the preamble of their reſolve of the twenty-ſixth ultimo, prohibiting the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſting, &amp;c. priſoners and deſerters, too far; and, through accident, to have recited a fact that has never happened (at leaſt to my knowledge) and which is injurious to us,—viz. that priſoners had been enliſted by us. If any have, it is what I never knew. However, be this as it may, if the reſolution has not been publiſhed, I could wiſh the preamble to be altered, and only to recite, <hi>"that experience,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>deſerters"</hi> only. The reſolution itſelf may ſtand as it does, comprehending a prohibition againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtment of both.</p>
                     <p>My reaſon for troubling Congreſs upon this occaſion is, we have always complained againſt general Howe, and ſtill do, for obliging or permitting the priſoners in his hands to enliſt, as an unwarrantable procedure, and wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the ſpirit at leaſt of the cartel. This preamble ſeems to admit the practice on our part, which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly juſtify it in him, and is ſuch evidence as muſt ſilence us in future, (ſhould it ſtand) and afford him an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for recrimination,—though, as I have ſuggeſted, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:029737_0564_0FE29BF4A596C998"/>
no priſoners have ever been enliſted by us,—I am ſure none have through compulſion.</p>
                     <p>I have the pleaſure to tranſmit you an extract of a letter from captain Barry, which will inform you of his ſucceſſes. The two ſhips he burned after ſtripping them; and he was obliged, it ſeems, two days after the capture, to ground and abandon the ſchooner, after a long and ſevere engagement with ſome of the enemy's frigates and ſmaller armed veſſels. It is ſaid he ſaved her guns and moſt of her tackle.</p>
                     <p>I alſo take the liberty to lay before Congreſs copies of letters from meſſieurs Champion, W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dſworth, and Reed. From the uniformity of ſentiment held forth by theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, it is much to be feared the meaſures lately adopted by the commiſſioners at New-Haven, for regulating the prices of proviſion, will have a diſagreeable effect upon our ſupplies of meat. How far it may be practicable to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend their operation for a time, I cannot determine: but, if it can be done, it appears we ſhould experience many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from it. It is a matter of great importance; and, as ſuch, is ſubmitted to Congreſs for their conſideration. If any thing can be done to procure ſupplies of proviſion, particularly of the ſalt kind, I ſhould ſuppoſe, and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, it will not be omitted.</p>

                     <p>THIS will be preſented to you by count Pulaſki, who, from a conviction that his remaining at the head of the cavalry was a conſtant ſubject of uneaſineſs to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal officers of that corps, has been induced to reſign his command. Waving a minute inquiry into the cauſes of diſſatisfaction,—which may be reduced perhaps to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages under which he laboured, as a ſtranger not well acquainted with the language, genius and manners of this country,—it may be ſufficient to obſerve, that the degree of harmony which is inſeparable from the well-being and conſequent utility of a corps, has not ſubſiſted in the cavalry ſince his appointment, and that the moſt effectual as well
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:029737_0565_0FE29C526C6A4CE0"/>
as the eaſieſt remedy is that which he has generouſly applied.</p>
                     <p>The count, however, far from being diſguſted with the ſervice, is led by his thirſt of glory, and zeal for the cauſe of liberty, to ſolicit farther employment, and waits upon Congreſs to make his propoſals. They are briefly that he be allowed to raiſe an independent corps compoſed of ſixty-eight horſe and two hundred foot,—the horſe to be armed wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h lances, and the foot equipped in the manner of light infantry. The former he thinks he can readily fill with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ives of good character and worthy the truſt repoſed in them. With reſpect to the other, he is deſirous of more latitude, ſo as to have liberty of engaging priſoners and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters from the enemy.</p>
                     <p>The original plan for the lance-men was to have draught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from the regiments of horſe. But as this method <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> produce a claſhing of intereſts and perhaps occaſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> diſturbances, the count prefers having a corps totally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>nnected with any other. My advice to him, therefore, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> enliſt his number of cavalry with the continental boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, if it ſhould be found conſonant to the views of Congreſs to allow his raiſing the number propoſed over and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> on the footing of an independent corps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if not, he might at all events have them as draughts; and in this caſe there would be no ground for complaint.</p>
                     <p>with regard to the infantry, which the count eſteems eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ſucceſs of the cavalry, I have informed him that the enliſting deſerters and priſoners is prohibited by a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I have only to add that the count's valour and active zeal on all occaſions have done him great honour; and from a perſuaſion, that, by being leſs expoſed to the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which he has hitherto experienced, he will render <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>P. S. It is to' be underſtood that the count expects to retain his rank as brigadier, and, I think, is entitled to it from his general character and particular diſintereſtedneſs on the preſent occaſion.</p>

If this were not to be the caſe, but the command were to be divided, there might want that co-operation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the garriſons and the troops without, which might be eſſential to their preſervation and to the common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> the co-operation would ſtill be neceſſary. But if it were otherwiſe, I ſhould not think the meaſure adviſeable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not know what number of men we may have in the field next campaign; and the number for the defence of the Highlands muſt be proportioned to the general ſtrength; and the force of the garriſons, to that number.</p>
                     <p>On theſe conſiderations, having ordered general M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal to repair to the Highlands to aſſume the chief command there, I have comprehended the forts among the other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his truſt; in the diſcharge of which, I am perſuaded he will manifeſt adequate zeal and ability. But as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:029737_0567_0FE29C53F02921D0"/>
in queſtion affords room for doubt, it will be proper to have it explained, ſo as more explicitly to aſcertain the intention of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>I am perfectly in ſentiment with governor Clinton on the propriety of drawing the troops from the northward to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce and carry on the works in the Highlands. From every thing I can learn, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ere ſeems to be no proſpect of proſecuting the intended expedition into Canada. If ſo, I apprehend it can anſwer no valuable end to keep a body of troops in and about Albany. In the preſent circumſtances of Canada, little is to be dreaded thence: the enemy, in all probability, will be well ſatisfied to act on the defenſive, without riſking the conſequences of an attempt againſt us. A proper garriſon at Fort-Schuyler, and a ſmall party by way of guard at Albany, with the militia of the country that may be occaſionally drawn together, will be a ſufficient ſecurity againſt the inroads of the enemy from Canada, or the depredations of the neighbouring Indians, ſuppoſing there were any of the tribes whoſe diſpoſitions were ſtill actively hoſtile notwithſtanding our late northern ſucceſſes, which is by no means a natural ſuppoſition. All the men, more than are wanted for theſe purpoſes, would be of the moſt important utility in the Highlands.</p>

Beſides, as they would be in moſt danger from an incurſion up the North-river, the beſt way to counteract that danger is to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the paſſes in the Highlands, and obſtruct the navigation; in order to which, the reinforcing them with the troops from the northward would be no inconſiderable ſtep.</p>

his rank in the line of the Maſſachuſetts officers. He is one of the gentlemen, who, in going with major Sherburne to relieve the poſt we had at the Cedars in 1776, after a brave and gallant conduct, fell into the enemy's hands. In a few days after, on the treaty which general Arnold made, he generouſly offered himſelf, as I have been informed, and went one of the hoſtages to Quebec, for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it.</p>
                     <p>By ſome means the State of Maſſachuſetts-Bay has not continued him in their line, nor has he any appointment in the army. He is now on parole through the indulgence of general Carleton, and has applied to me for pay and rations from the time of his return: and conſidering alſo the depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his rank as hard and injurious, he hopes he will be provided for in a ſuitable manner, and according to that ſtanding which he formerly held in the army.</p>
                     <p>Captain Sullivan's wiſhes in either inſtance cannot be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by me. As to the firſt, the reſolution of the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of January, regulating the pay of priſoners (which is the only rule for my government) ſeems to have drawn the line between officers on parole who are continued in ſervice, and thoſe who are not; and, making that the only criterion to fix pay, to have precluded every other diſcrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination; and the powers, which were veſted in the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive States to appoint officers, prohibit any interference by me in his favour, as to the latter.</p>
                     <p>I have ſtated the nature of the captain's claims, and the reaſons which are oppoſed to his obtaining relief in either inſtance from me. I ſhall only add that the neglect by the States (in their appointments) of the officers who were in captivity, where there was no other objection to them, was at leaſt ungenerous, if not impolitic and unjuſt. It has been the caſe in many inſtances: and as to the gentlemen who is particularly the ſubject of this letter, the teſtimonials that have been given of his character as an officer were much in his favour, and greatly to his honour.</p>
                     <p>By accident, the reſolution of the nineteenth of January, alluded to above, has been miſlaid. I muſt trouble you with a requeſt for another copy of it.</p>
                     <p>I tranſmit Congreſs colonel * * *'s application to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. As general Huntington, in whoſe brigade he is, and

                     <p>ON Saturday I had the honour to receive your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the tenth, with the reſolutions alluded to.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed I take the liberty to tranſmit an extract of a letter juſt received from general Parſons. This, as well as the letter which I incloſed you yeſterday from governor Clinton, will ſhew the confuſion in the management of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs on the North-river. I informed Congreſs then that I had ſent general M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal to take the chief command there, comprehending the forts,—which appeared to me the only effectual means for curing all diſorders, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the public ſervice. To remove all impediments, it were to be wiſhed that Congreſs would inveſt him with every neceſſary power for carrying into execution the objects of his command: and it might be well if they were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any future commanding officer, as it would prevent thoſe difficulties which have heretofore ariſen from their having been conſidered as merely perſonal.</p>
                     <p>I am more and more in ſentiment with governor Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton on the propriety and abſolute neceſſity of drawing the troops from the northward, to reinforce and carry on the works in the Highlands. From the information I have from colonel Radiere who has juſt come from thence, I find that the intended defences are far leſs advanced than I had any idea of. According to him, little or nothing is yet done, though I have repeatedly and conſtantly urged the proſecution of them with all poſſible induſtry. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed copies of my letters to general Putnam will ſhew
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:029737_0570_0FE29C015CDC0FC0"/>
that I have uniformly preſſed the cloſeſt attention to the buſineſs, though it might be inferred from general Parſons's letter that there had been ſome inconſiſtency in my orders. There remains but a little time to do a great deal in; and I fear that no exertions now will be ſufficient to place things in that quarter on the ſecure and reſpectacle footing we could wiſh. However, we ſhould do the moſt we can: and if the works cannot be as complete as they ought, the troops will be there; and a reliance muſt be had in their bravery, to repel any attempt that may be formed againſt them.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE the honour of tranſmitting you the incloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed letter from general Smallwood, giving intelligence of the enemy's motions on the Delaware, and his conjectures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting their object. The account he has heard of troops being on board the veſſels is confirmed by the relations of deſerters and others, who agree that a conſiderable number of men have been embarked, and add that they took ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen day's proviſion with them. From this circumſtance it is ſcarcely to be imagined that they are ordered on a ſea voyage. The proportion of ſmall veſſels in the fleet makes it probable that they have in view to collect forage, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the deſtruction of the ſalt-works; and both theſe ideas are favoured by accounts from the city. As ſoon as their intentions are certainly known, they ſhall be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated. In the mean time I have the honour to be, with the greateſt reſpect, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>HEREWITH I do myſelf the honour to incloſe cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies of a letter from an officer of militia at Elizabethtown, to me, and an extract of a letter from one of Mr. Boudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not's deputies at Boſton, to him,—both tending to induce a belief that the enemy have ſome enterpriſe in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What this is, time muſt diſcover. I have this whole winter been clearly of opinion that general Howe's movements would be very early this ſpring, to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the weak ſtate of our army,—or late, if he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected conſiderable reinforcements from England, and meant to avail himſelf of his full ſtrength. If the firſt takes place, as appearances indicate, it may, I think, be conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as a proof of one or both of theſe two things, that he is either well informed (he cannot indeed be otherwiſe) of the ſituation, and more than probably, of the ſtrength of our army, or that he expects no inconſiderable reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments this year from Europe. In either caſe it is our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable duty to reinforce and arrange our army, as ſpeedily as poſſible, that we may in the firſt inſtance be prepared for defence,—in the ſecond, take advantage of any favourable circumſtance which may happen, to injure the enemy.</p>
                     <p>Whatever may be the deſigns of Congreſs with reſpect to the eſtabliſhment of the army, I know not: but I do moſt earneſtly and devoutly recommend a ſpeedy adoption of them, and the appointment of officers, as our preſent ſituation at this advanced ſeaſon is truly alarming, and to me highly diſtreſſing, as I am convinced that we ſhall be plunged into the campaign before our arrangements are made, and the army properly organized.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="234" facs="unknown:029737_0572_0FE29C04DA381110"/>
The numberleſs diſadvantages, reſulting from the late appointment of general officers laſt year, make me look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with infinite anxiety, this:—for, after all the wiſdom that Congreſs or their committee can uſe in the choice of officers, many will be diſguſted: reſignations of ſome and perhaps non-acceptance of others will follow. Before matters then can be brought to a proper tone, much time will be loſt, and a great deal of trouble and vexation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered,—to overcome which, is not the work of a day; and, till they are overcome, confuſion, diſorder, and loſs, muſt prevail. In the meanwhile, order, regularity, and diſcipline,—which require the vigilance of every officer to eſtabliſh, and muſt flow from the general officers in every army,—are neglected, or not entered upon in time to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Thus it happened laſt year; and brigades and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions became vacant, to the great injury of the ſervice.</p>
                     <p>As it is not improper for Congreſs to have ſome idea of the preſent temper of the army, it may not be amiſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark in this place, that, ſince the month of Auguſt laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two and three hundred officers have reſigned their commiſſions, and many others were with difficulty diſſuaded from it. In the Virginia line only, not leſs than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ix colonels, as good as any in the ſervice, have left it lately; and more, I am told, are in the humour to do ſo.</p>
                     <p>Highly advantageous alſo would it be, if the recruits and draughts from North-Carolina and Virginia were not ſuffered to halt on their way to camp under pretence of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting equipped, but ſent forward and incorporated into the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent regiments of their reſpective States as ſoon as it could be done. Out of the number of men ſaid to be draughted in Virginia laſt fall, and others from North-Carolina, very few have joined the army; but owing to deſertion and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cauſes, they have dwindled to nothing: and this will always be the caſe with new recruits, eſpecially thoſe who are unwillingly drawn forth, if much time is ſpent in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to their regiments under the care of proper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. This ſhews the neceſſity (if the ſeaſon and other powerful reaſons did not loudly call for it) of haſtening them to the army.</p>
                     <p>My ſolicitude for the preſervation of the communication of the North-river gives me very uneaſy ſenſations on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:029737_0573_0FE29C60CBB928E0"/>
of our poſts there, and will excuſe my again aſking if the troops to the northward, except ſuch as are neceſſary for the defence of Fort-Schuyler, can be ſo advantageouſly employed as at the works on that river. A reſpectable force at thoſe poſts would awe New-York, and divide general Howe's force or expoſe the city. To depend too much upon militia, is, in my opinion, putting every thing to hazard.</p>
                     <p>If I ſhould appear uncommonly anxious reſpecting the ſeveral matters contained in this letter, by repeating them, Congreſs will do me the juſtice, I hope, to believe that I am actuated by no views but ſuch as are prompted by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and the advanced ſeaſon.

                     <p>Since mine of the twenty-fourth, Mr. Boudinot has communicated the following intelligence, being part of a letter to him:—"I have lately received ſome intelligence from New-York, that we may make ourſelves eaſy in Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, as all the force that can be ſpared is to be ſent to join

general Howe. Two thouſand five hundred are actually on board tranſports, and lying at the watering-place."</p>
                     <p>I have this day received a letter from general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, dated yeſterday at Wilmington, in which he ſays—"The enemy, about four days ago, had a fleet of near fifty ſail ſtanding up the river, which I fancy was from New-York; and yeſterday their foraging fleet went up without touching upon this ſide the Delaware, except three or four ſmall parties about Port-Penn, who have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly drove off by a party of about a hundred of our men, who have been guarding and aiding the removal of the forage, which is at length happily effected."</p>

                     <p>SINCE I had the honour of addreſſing you upon the twenty-ninth ultimo, I have not been able to learn with any preciſion whether the tranſports that arrived brought any conſiderable number of troops. A Heſſian deſerter ſays there were only a few German convaleſcents on board. If ſo, the fleet with two thouſand five hundred, mentioned in my laſt, is not arrived, ſuppoſing they were bound to Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>General St. Clair arrived yeſterday from Boſton: and, as he ſeems very anxious to have his matter determined one way or the other, I beg leave to recall the attention of Congreſs to my letter of the twenty-ſeventh of February upon that ſubject. Having received no information ſince that time which ſerves to direct my judgment as to the charges which it will be proper to exhibit againſt general

<pb n="238" facs="unknown:029737_0576_0FE29C09387AF048"/>
agreeable to him, of any ſtation in which he could be placed.</p>
                     <p>I beg leave to recommend this meaſure to Congreſs, and ſhall be obliged by their deciſion as ſpeedily as may be convenient. The campaign is faſt approaching, and there will probably be very little time to raiſe and prepare the corps for it. It is a part of the plan to give Mr. Lindſay the command of the ſecond troop, and to make Mr. Pey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton captain-lieutenant of the firſt.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I HAVE now the honour to acknowledge your ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral letters of the twenty-firſt, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth ultimo, with their incloſures, which have been duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. It gives me pain to obſerve they appear to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeveral implications by which my ſenſibility is not a little wounded. I find myſelf extremely embarraſſed by the ſteps I had taken towards an exchange of priſoners and the formation of a general cartel making more ample proviſion for their future accommodation and relief. The views of Congreſs ſeem to be very different from what I ſuppoſed them when I entered into my late engagements with general Howe: their reſolution of the thirtieth ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, pointedly requiring a ſtrict adherence to all former ones upon the ſubject, will in all probability render them impracticable. I conſidered ſome of their reſolutions as dictated on the principle of retaliation, and did not imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine the terms they contained would be inſiſted upon in negociating an agreement calculated to remedy the evils which occaſioned them. In moſt reſpects they might be ſubſtantially complied with: but there are ſome points to which an exact conformity muſt of neceſſity deſtroy the idea of a cartel. One is the obliging the enemy to pay gold and ſilver on equal terms for continental currency, eſtimating the articles ſupplied them at their actual prices with us, as ſeems to be the deſign of the reſolve of the nineteenth of December: another is the ſubjecting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:029737_0577_0FE29C6D4CA57128"/>
of theſe States, taken in arms againſt them, to trial and puniſhment, agreeable to the reſolve of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of the ſame month.</p>
                     <p>I am well aware that appearances ought to be upheld, and that we ſhould avoid as much as poſſible recognizing by any public act the depreciation of our currency: but I conceive this end would be anſwered as far as might be neceſſary, by ſtipulating that all money payments ſhould be made in gold and ſilver, being the common medium of commerce among nations, at the rate of four ſhillings and ſix pence for a Spaniſh milled dollar, &amp;c.—by fixing the price of rations on an equitable ſcale relatively to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective circumſtances,—and providing for the payment of what we may owe, by ſending in proviſion, and ſelling it at their market. The rates of money, and the prices of proviſions and other commodities, differ every where: and, in treaties of a ſimilar nature between any two States, it is requiſite, for mutual convenience, to aſcertain ſome common ratio both for the value of money in payments, and for the rates of thoſe articles on which they may ariſe.</p>
                     <p>It was determined on mature conſideration not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any thing expreſsly that ſhould contradict the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the thirtieth of December: but at the ſame time, if it is deſigned to be the rule of practice, it is eaſy to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it would at once overturn any cartel that could be formed. General Howe would never conſent to obſerve it on his part, if ſuch a practice were to exiſt on ours. Though the law ought not to be contravened by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs article admitting the exchangeability of ſuch perſons, yet, if it is not ſuffered o ſleep, it is in vain to expect the operation of it will be acquieſced in by the enemy.</p>
                     <p>The meaſures I have taken muſt evince that it is my determination to pay the fulleſt attention to the intereſts of citizens, and to the rights of generel Lee, in the treaty: and I think it but juſtice to the gentlemen appointed to negociate it, to declare that I know them to be ſo fully impreſſed with the importance of both thoſe objects, as to make them cheerfully obſervant of the injunctions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, ſo far as not to conclude any agreement of which the exchange of general Lee and the alternative reſpecting
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:029737_0578_0FE29C0FF9C2D1C8"/>
citizens are not eſſential parts. Theſe points had been early determined on.</p>
                     <p>It is with no ſmall concern that I have been obliged to trouble Congreſs upon the ſubjects of this letter: and, ſhould they appear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> them in the ſame light they do to me, and they ſhould think proper to remove the obſtacles which now oppoſe the buſineſs in hand, I muſt requeſt they will be pleaſed to communicate their determination as expeditiouſly as poſſible, that the commiſſioners may govern themſelves accordingly, and either proceed to form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cartel, or put an end to the negociation. Before the reſolves of the thirtieth came to hand, they had m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t, and been in treaty two days, with a proſpect of a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accommodation.</p>
                     <p>I am happy to inform Congreſs that general Lee will be out on parole to-morrow in place of general Preſcot: and I have every reaſon to expect, if the negociation can be continued upon admiſſible terms, that his exchange will immediately follow the releaſement of colonel Campbell and the Heſſian field-officers. It is agreed that lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant-colonel Allen ſhall be exchanged for lieutenant-colonel Campbell.</p>
                     <p>The importunate applications of colonel Lee and major Swazey to leave the ſervice oblige me to lay the matter before Congreſs. Colonel Lee's letter upon the ſubject was tranſmitted me the twenty-fifth of January: but, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he might change his mind, I deferred writing to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs upon his requeſt. He has renewed it again in urgent terms, through general Heath; and I have only to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that it is a painful circumſtance to ſee officers of their merit leaving the ſervice. It is the caſe every day. I ſhall be obliged by Congreſs informing me of the dates of the reſignations of the colonels in the Virginia line: I have only received the date of colonel Lewis's.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed is a letter from captain Cotteneau of the ſhip Ferdinand, with an invoice of her cargo. The letter only came to hand yeſterday; and, as it is of an old date, it is highly probable that the goods are ſold. If they are not,—from the captain's deſire to give the public a pref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence in the ſale, Congreſs will have an opportunity of
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:029737_0579_0FE29C7118E48348"/>
directing them to be purchaſed. Moſt of them would be proper for the army.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE had the honour of receiving your favour of the fourth inſtant, incloſing a reſolve of Congreſs, of the ſame date, empowering me to call forth five thouſand mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia from the States of Maryland, Pennſylvania, and New-Jerſey. I thank Congreſs for the power: at the ſame time it is incumbent on me to aſſure them, that,—granting the practicability of collecting ſuch a number,—it would prove a work of time, difficulty and expenſe; to evince which, I need only recur to the experience of laſt cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign on ſimilar occaſions, and to remind you that it was not poſſible to obtain a thouſand men, nor ſometimes even one hundred, from this State, although the former number was required and promiſed for the purpoſe of covering during the winter the country between Schuylkill and Delaware.</p>
                     <p>As this reſolve appears to have been made in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of my letters of the twenty-fourth and twe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> ultimo, which were founded on conjecture, and, in ſome degree, miſinformation,—and as the execution of it would,
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:029737_0580_0FE29C807861FD90"/>
excluſive of the inconveniences abovementioned, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, have a tendency to injure the completion of the continental regiments,—I ſhall call for a ſmall part only of the number allowed; but could wiſh that Hartley's regiment were ordered immediately to camp, and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it performed by militia. In like manner I would propoſe that all remote guards ſhould be compoſed of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, and that the ſeveral purpoſes for which men are drawn from the continental troops ſhould be anſwered by them. This would be a means of drawing together a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of men who are in a manner loſt to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and of employing the militia to the beſt advantage poſſible.</p>
                     <p>The great end of my letter to Congreſs, of the twenty-fourth ultimo, ſeems to have been miſtaken. My views were not turned to reinforcements of militia. To know whether the old eſtabliſhment of the army, or the new as agreed upon by the committee, is the choice of Congreſs,—and in what manner the regiments of this State and the additionals are to be reduced,—officers for the whole ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, &amp;c.—were my objects. Theſe are objects of the greateſt moment, as they may, in their conſequences, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the fate of America; for I will undertake to ſay that it is next to impoſſible, when the ſeaſon is ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, properly to accompliſh thoſe changes, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the dependent arrangements for the enſuing campaign. Should any convulſion happen, or movement take place, they will be altogether impracticable. Juſtice to my own character, as well as duty to the public, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain me to repeat theſe things: their conſequences are more eaſily conceived than deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſaid by ſome, Sir, that my wiſh to ſee the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of this army upon a more reſpectable eſtabliſhment is the cauſe of my ſolicitude, and carries me too far. To ſuch I can declare that my anxiety proceeds from the cauſes abovementioned. If my opinion is aſked with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the neceſſity of making this proviſion for the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, I am ready to declare that I do moſt religiouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſalvation of the cauſe depends upon it,—and, without it, your officers will moulder to nothing, or be compoſed of low and illiterate men, void of capacity for
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:029737_0581_0FE29C12D1EE1680"/>
this or any other buſineſs. To prove this, I can with truth aver, that ſcarce a day paſſes without the offer of two or three commiſſions; and my advices from the eaſtward and ſouthward are that numbers who had gone home on furlough mean not to return, but are eſtabliſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in more lucrative employments. Let Congreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what will be the conſequence of this ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Perſonally, as an officer, I have no intereſt in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, becauſe I have declared, and I now repeat it, that I never will receive the ſmalleſt benefit from the half-pay eſtabliſhment: but, as a man who fights under the weight of a proſcription, and as a citizen who wiſhes to ſee the liberty of his country eſtabliſhed upon a permanent foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and whoſe property depends upon the ſucceſs of our arms, I am deeply intereſted. But,—all this apart, and juſtice out of the queſtion,—upon the ſingle ground of economy and public ſaving, I will maintain the utility of it: for I have not the leaſt doubt, that, until officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their commiſſions in an honourable and intereſted point of view, and are afraid to endanger them by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and inattention, no order, regularity or care, either of the men or public property, will prevail. * * *</p>
                     <p>By officers who are juſt returned from Maſſachuſetts-Bay, I learn that there is not the leaſt proſpect of getting men from thence before the month of June,—if then; and indeed that there is no reaſon to expect any number that will deſerve the name of reinforcement for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental regiments this campaign,—the towns being only called upon to furniſh the deficiency of their laſt year's quota, ſo that all ſubſequent caſualties are diſregarded, and the fifteen regiments of that State, which may now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps want four thouſand men to complete them, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive only five hundred if the towns came within that number of their complement laſt year. What change the requiſition of Congreſs, of the [<hi>twenty-ſixth</hi>] of February, may effect, I ſhall not undertake to ſay: if it has not a ſpeedy and powerful operation, our proſpects in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will be exceedingly unpromiſing.</p>
                     <p>A gentleman from New-Hampſhire ſome little time ſince informed me that matters were nearly in the ſame train there, notwithſtanding a reſolve for the completion of
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:029737_0582_0FE29C145A0FF770"/>
their battalions; and the incloſed copy of a letter (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1) from general Putnam, whom I have deſired to remain in Connecticut for ſome time in order to forward the recruits from that State, conveys his ideas of what may be expected from thence. What New-York, New-Jerſey, and North-Carolina have done or are about to do, I know not. Pennſylvania and Maryland have tried the effect of vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untary enliſtments to little purpoſe; and the firſt, in direct contradiction to the moſt pointed injunctions laid on the officers, have their recruits compoſed chiefly of deſerters who will embrace the firſt opportunity of eſcaping with our arms. Virginia, it is true, has proceeded to a draught: but the number, beſides being in itſelf inadequate, has been leſſened by deſertion; and the deficiency of the regiments, on the other hand, being increaſed by death and deſertion, their ſtrength will probably fall very far ſhort of the new eſtabliſhment.</p>
                     <p>This, Sir, is not a flattering picture of our affairs: but the repreſentation is juſt; and it is incumbent on me to exhibit it in my own defence, as, notwithſtanding all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> proſpect of being plunged into the campaign before the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements are made, officers, appointed, &amp;c.—great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I perceive, are expected from our activity this ſpring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in proportion therefore will the diſappointment be felt by thoſe who are ſanguine. For want of the ratification of Congreſs, the horſe eſtabliſhment, companies of ſappers, provoſt-marſhalſey, &amp;c. &amp;c. (as agreed to by the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, and recommended for their conſideration) are entirely at a ſtand, at a time when we ought to be deriving benefits from their execution. In a word, at no period ſince the commencement of the war have I felt more painful ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on account of delay, than at the preſent: and, urged by them, I have expreſſed myſelf without reſerve.</p>
                     <p>By a letter juſt received from general Weedon, I am informed of his intention to reſign, if general Woodford ſhould be reſtored to his former rank, which he had not then heard. General Muhlenberg is now balancing on the ſame point. One, therefore, if not two brigadiers, will be wanted for that State. The diſadvantages reſulting from the frequent reſignations in the Virginia line, the
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:029737_0583_0FE29C73F5E05008"/>
changes of commanding officers to the regiments, and other cauſes equally diſtreſſing, have injured that corps beyond conception, and have been the means of reducing very reſpectable regiments in ſome inſtances to a mere handful of men: and this will ever be the caſe till officers can be fixed by ſomething equivalent to the ſacrifice they make. To reaſon otherwiſe, and ſuppoſe that public virtue alone will enable men to forego the eaſe and comforts of life, to encounter the hardſhips and dangers of war for a bare ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, when their companions and friends are amaſſing large fortunes,—is viewing human nature rather as it ſhould be, than as it really is.</p>
                     <p>The clothier-general of the army, as well as the heads of every other department, ſhould be in camp near the commander in chief: otherwiſe it is impoſſible that the operations of war can be conducted with energy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. I wiſh moſt ſincerely that this,—as not the leaſt eſſential part of the buſineſs ſettled with the committee,—were decided, and a thorough inveſtigation were had into the conduct of this department; as it is a matter of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal aſtoniſhment that we ſhould be deficient in any arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of clothing, when it is commonly aſſerted that the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern States alone can furniſh materials enough to clothe a hundred thouſand men. If this be fact, there is a fatal error ſomewhere, to which may be attributed the death and deſertion of thouſands.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall make no apology for the freedom of this letter. To inform Congreſs of ſuch facts as materially affect the ſervice, I conceive to be one great and eſſential part of my duty to them and myſelf. My agreement with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee entitled me to expect upwards of forty thouſand continental troops, excluſive of artillery and horſe, for the ſervice of the enſuing campaign, including thoſe to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the defence of the North-river. Inſtead of theſe, what are my proſpects?</p>
                     <p>Major-general the marquis De la Fayette is arrived at camp, and will reſume the command of his diviſion. The baron De Kalb is expected in a few days. The incloſure, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2, is the copy of a letter from colonel Shrieve of the ſecond Jerſey battalion, containing an account of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the ſalt and ſalt-works at Squan,—and N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 3,

                     <p>The negociation between the commiſſioners is ended without effecting a cartel: nor do I ſuppoſe, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation I have received on the ſubject, that there is any good proſpect that one will ever be formed, or at leaſt for a great while, on a liberal and extenſive plan. A report of the proceedings of the commiſſioners on our part, at their ſeveral meetings, I take the liberty to incloſe. The papers, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1, contain the letters between general Howe and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſtipulating the neutrality of Germantown,—our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective powers,—and the reſult of the meeting there;—N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2, the ſubſequent proceedings at Newtown. The old agreement, I preſume, continues; and under it we muſt carry on exchanges.</p>
                     <p>General Muhlenberg has communicated his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to reſign, but has promiſed not to leave his brigade till Congreſs ſhall appoint another general in his room, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it is done in any reaſonable time.</p>
                     <p>By poſtponing my call upon the militia, as mentioned in my laſt of the tenth, I did not mean to decline it altogeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. I did not ſee the neceſſity of calling out five thouſand for the ſole purpoſe of defence: and, in the preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things, I cannot perceive my way ſufficiently clear for offenſive meaſures, as I do not know when to expect the recruits from the different States, nor what proſpect the
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:029737_0585_0FE29C7D3629FF50"/>
commiſſary has of proviſion:—as we only get it yet from hand to mouth, aſſembling the militia, unleſs for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of defence, ſhould be the laſt thing done, as they ſoon become impatient, and are very expenſive in the articles of ſtores, camp utenſils, proviſions, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed draught of a bill was brought to Head-Quarters yeſterday afternoon, by a gentleman who informed me that a large cargo of them had been juſt ſent out of Philadelphia. Whether this inſidious proceeding is genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and imported in the packet which arrived a few days ago, or contrived in Philadelphia, is a point undetermined and immaterial; but it is certainly founded in principles of the moſt * * *—meant to poiſon the minds of the people, and detach the wavering at leaſt from our cauſe. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it will obtain a place in the papers, and am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anxiety that it will have a malignant influence. I would ſubmit it whether it will not be highly expedient for Congreſs to inveſtigate it in all its parts, and to expoſe in the moſt ſtriking manner the injuſtice, deluſion, and fraud, it contains. I truſt it will be attacked, in every ſhape, in every part of the continent.</p>

                     <p>WITH your letter of the ſeventeenth inſtant, and its incloſures, I was duly honoured on Saturday afternoon. When I addreſſed you on the eighteenth, I was doubtful whether the draught of the bill then tranſmitted was not ſpurious and contrived in Philadelphia: but its authentici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I am almoſt certain, is not to be queſtioned. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from Philadelphia ſeems clear and concluſive that it came over in the packet, with lord North's ſpeech on the introduction of it into parliament. I incloſe a paper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his ſpeech, which juſt came to hand. This bill, I am perſuaded, will paſs into a law. Congreſs will perceive by the miniſter's ſpeech, that it aims at objects of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt extent and importance, and will, no doubt, in one way

                     <p>I TAKE the liberty to tranſmit you a letter which I received yeſterday from governor Tryon, incloſing the draughts of the two bills I forwarded before, with his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate of the manner in which they came to his hands, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by his more extraordinary and impertinent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that, through my means, the contents ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the officers and men of this army. This engine of miniſtry, from governor Livingſton's account, is very induſtriouſly circulating copies of theſe draughts, in obedience to their and his royal maſter's mandates. The letter which I incloſe, and a triplicate, came to hand at one time: ſome future conveyance, it is probable, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent me the duplicate.</p>
                     <p>I would alſo take the liberty to incloſe you the Evening Poſt, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 475, which governor Livingſton was ſo obliging as to ſend me yeſterday. Were we not fully ſatisfied from our experience, that there are no artifices, no meaſures too * * * for the enemy or their adherents to attempt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to promote their views, we might be aſtoniſhed at the daring confidence, in defiance of the opinion of the world, manifeſted in a publication in this paper, purporting to be a reſolution of Congreſs, of the twentieth of February. This proceeding is infamous to the laſt degree, and calculated to produce the moſt baneful conſequences by exciting an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the people to our draughting ſyſtem, and embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſing at leaſt the only pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

If it is, and with a few ſtrictures, I ſhould hope that it will excite in the breaſts of all our countrymen, a juſt and generous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the enemy, for ſuch a dirty, wicked proceeding.</p>

I was laſt night honoured with your favour of the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth inſtant, with the proceedings alluded to. A gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al plan of operations for the campaign is indiſpenſably eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to be ſettled. I have thought much upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and ſome propoſitions reſpecting it were put into the hands of all the general officers here on Tueſday evening, for their conſideration. I alſo intended to ſend a meſſenger this day to meet general Gates, ſuppoſing him to be on his way to Hudſon's-river, and to requeſt his call at this camp, that we might enter into a full and free diſcuſſion of the point. There is not a moment to be delayed in forming ſome general ſyſtem, in my opinion; and I only wait the arrival of generals Gates and Mifflin, to ſummon a council for the purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>I BEG leave to inform Congreſs that the report of the commiſſioners coming, according to intelligence received yeſterday by a perſon of Philadelphia, is confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; and it is there thought that they will very ſoon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive. I think it almoſt certain that the matter will not be delayed, as the conduct of miniſtry, in not ſending them immediately after their former propoſitions, has been much reprobated, and as it may be of much importance to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the firſt impreſſions of the people upon the occaſion. Lord Amherſt, admiral Keppel, and general Murray, are ſaid to be the perſons appointed; and it is likely they are veſted with both civil and military powers. The informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was through the channel of a ſenſible intelligent man, well known, and of eſteemed credit. He is connected with the Britiſh army, having two or three brothers in it.

                     <p>I HAD the honour yeſterday afternoon to receive your letter of the twenty fourth, continued to the twenty-fifth, with its important incloſures. Congreſs will be pleaſed to accept my ſincere thanks for the freſh inſtance of confidence manifeſted in their reſolution of the twenty-third, and other proceedings; and they may reſt aſſured that whatever pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are entruſted to me ſhall be invariably directed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the intereſt of theſe States. If in any caſe there ſhould be a miſapplication or a failure in the execution, it will be the effect of miſtake and not of deſign.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall take meaſures for diſtributing the report of the committee on lord North's bills, and the reſolution of the twenty-third inviting delinquents to return to their allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and to the protection of theſe States. This proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appears to me founded in great good policy; and I ſhould hope that it will be attended with many valuable conſequences:—but this can only be proved by the event.</p>
                     <p>Though I wiſh moſt heartily for the aid of general Lee in council and upon every other occaſion,—yet, as the time of his return is uncertain, or at leaſt it will be ſeveral days before it takes place,—and as it ſeems to me that there is not a moment to loſe in forming ſome general ſyſtem for our operations,—I ſhould think it inexpedient for general Gates to delay coming to camp till his arrival. After a plan is digeſted, there will be a great deal of time expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before things will be in a proper train for execution. The ſeaſon is faſt advancing; and the period which may be moſt favourable for any deſigns we may form will preſently arrive.</p>
                     <p>I take the liberty to tranſmit an extract of a letter from general Heath, which will ſhew Congreſs that he is preſſed on all ſides for money. Governor Livingſton too is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive he will be under embarraſſments on account of the purchaſe of horſes in conſequence of the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:029737_0589_0FE29CDF9CDE84A8"/>
of the committee. Their letter to him by ſome means has been miſlaid in the aſſembly, and he does not know ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the mode preſcribed for the payment. I cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him myſelf, or do what perhaps is more neceſſary,—furniſh him with money; and therefore hope that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs or the committee will.</p>
                     <p>I have written major-general Tryon a few lines in anſwer to his letter, a copy of which is incloſed.</p>

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>mity in diſcipline and manoeuvres throughout the army, have long occaſioned me to wiſh for the eſtabliſhment of a well organized inſpectorſhip; and the concurrence of Congreſs in the ſame views has induced me to ſet on foot a temporary inſtitution, which, from the ſucceſs that has hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto attended it, gives me the moſt flattering expectations, and will, I hope, obtain their approbation.</p>
                     <p>Baron De Steuben's length of ſervice in the firſt military ſchool in Europe, and his former rank, pointed him out as a perſon peculiarly qualified to be at the head of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. This appeared the leaſt exceptionable way of introducing him into the army, and one that would give him the moſt ready opportunity of diſplaying his talents. I therefore propoſed to him to undertake the office of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector-general, which he agreed to with the greateſt cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and has performed the duties of it with a zeal and intelligence equal to our wiſhes. He has two ranks of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectors under him: the loweſt are officers charged with the inſpection of brigades, with the title of brigade-inſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors: the others ſuperintend ſeveral of theſe: they have written inſtructions relative to their ſeveral functions; and the manoeuvres which they are to practiſe are illuſtrated by a company which the baron has taken the pains to train himſelf.</p>
                     <p>The brigade-inſpectors were choſen by the brigadier and commanding officers of regiments in each brigade. The inſpectors are lieutenant-colonels Barber of Jerſey, Brooks
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:029737_0590_0FE1BFBF70F45558"/>
of Maſſachuſetts, Davis of Virginia, and monſieur Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, a French gentleman:—the reaſon for employing him (apart his intrinſic merit and abilities) was his poſſeſſing the French and Engliſh languages equally, which made him a neceſſary aſſiſtant to the baron De-Steuben. He is content to ſerve without rank, until, after an experiment of his abilities, Congreſs ſhall determine what he is enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to.</p>
                     <p>Upon the arrival of lieutenant-colonel Fleury in camp, as he was unemployed, and had exerciſed the office of aide-major in France, the baron propoſed to have him employed as an inſpector; in which I readily acquieſced, as Congreſs had given him the rank and pay of lieutenant-colonel. There may be other foreign officers in continental pay, idle for want of being attached to ſome corps, of whoſe ſervices we might avail ourſelves in this way, which is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> method of diſpoſing of them, unleſs they could be formed into a diſtinct corps.</p>
                     <p>From the extraordinary fatigue and cloſe attention re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the officers employed in the inſpectorſhip, I did not think it amiſs to let them entertain hopes that Congreſs would allow ſome addition to the pay which they derive from their rank; and I take the the liberty of recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meaſure. I would propoſe twenty dollars per month for the brigade-inſpectors, and thirty for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he inſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, in addition to their pay in the line.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould do injuſtice if I were to be longer ſilent with regard to the merits of the baron De Steuben. His knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of his prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ion, added to the zeal which he has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſince be began upon the functions of his office, lead me to conſider him as an acquiſition to the ſervice, and to recommend him to the attention of Congreſs. His expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with regard to rank extend to that of major-general. His finances, he ingenuouſly confeſſes, will not admit of his ſerving without the incident emoluments; and Congreſs, I preſume, from his character and their own knowledge of him, will without difficulty gratify him in theſe particulars.</p>
                     <p>The baron is ſenſible that our ſituation requires a few variations in the duties of his office from the general prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in Europe, and particularly that they muſt neceſſarily be more comprehenſive; in which, as well as in his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:029737_0591_0FE29CE12BE09310"/>
he has ſkilfully yielded to circumſtances. The ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which has hitherto attended the plan enables me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt with confidence the ratification of Congreſs, and is, I think, a pledge of the eſtabliſhment of a well-combined gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſyſtem, which inſurmountable obſtacles have hitherto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In compliance with the requeſt of Congreſs, I ſhall immediately call upon the officers in the army to take the oath of allegiance and abjuration.

                     <p>IN a late letter from general Schuyier, I received the proceedings of a board of commiſſioners for Indian affairs, held at Albany the fifteenth of laſt month. It appears by them and ſome other accounts I have ſeen, that there is but little proſpect of ſucceeding in the plan for engaging a body of Indians from that quarter to ſerve with this army. The advantage which the enemy poſſeſs over us, in having the means of making preſents much more liberally than we can, has made a ſtrong impreſſion upon their minds, and ſeems to be more than a counterbalance for any arguments we can offer to conciliate their attachment. They alſo appear to be apprehenſive for their own ſafety, and rather to wiſh for aid and protection from us, than willing to leave their habitations and come to our aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>The meaſure propoſed was by way of experiment, as one which might poſſibly be attended with valuable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and, if it, could have been effected without much difficulty, might have been worth a trial. But, as the ſcheme does not well correſpond with their preſent diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and may ſerve to increaſe our embarraſſments in
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:029737_0593_0FE29CEA57C57AD0"/>
keeping them even in tolerable good humour, I am inclined to think it would be moſt adviſeable to relinquiſh the attempt. They may be told of what has happened in Europe, with proper embelliſhments, and that our affairs are now upon ſuch a footing as to render their aid in the field unneceſſary, and that all we require of them is their friendſhip and good wiſhes. This and promiſes of protection may have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and happy effect.</p>
                     <p>It is of great importance to counteract the temptation held out by the enemy, and to ſecure the good will of the Indians, who appear to be at leaſt in a ſtate of heſitancy and indeciſion, if nothing worſe. Congreſs, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, will do every thing in their power to promote theſe deſirable ends.</p>

A much more moderate one was nearly agreed to between them and the gentlemen deputed by me, when they were in treaty. This mode of relief, at this inſtant, may not be ſo neceſſary to adopt.

                     <p>I HAD the honour to receive in due time your ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral favours of the third, ſixth, and ninth inſtant, with the papers to which they reſpectively alluded. After much conſideration upon the ſubject, I have appointed general M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Intoſh to command at Fort-Pitt and in the weſtern country, for which he will ſet out as ſoon as he can accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate his affairs. I part with this gentleman with much reluctance, as I eſteem him an officer of great worth and merit, and as I know his ſervices here are and will be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially wanted. His firm diſpoſition and equal juſtice, his aſſiduity and good underſtanding,—added to his being a ſtranger to all parties in that quarter,—pointed him out as a proper perſon; and I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> extenſive advantages will be derived from his command, which I could wiſh was more agreeable. He will wait on Congreſs for their inſtructions.</p>
                     <p>As lieutenant-colonel Sutherland, major Agnew, and lieutenant Poe, have only requeſted to go to Europe on
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:029737_0595_0FE29CED98ED5518"/>
parole, it does not appear to me that I can with propriety apply to general Howe for their exchange:—this would imply that they were priſoners of war. Though their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is certainly the moſt deſirable mode of releaſe, as it would relieve an equal number of our officers from captiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, yet I ſhould be happy if a negociation for the purpoſe ſhould commence on their part. Knowing that it would be our intereſt to exchange all the officers of general Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne's army if it could be done, I wrote general Heath not long ſince, to take occaſion to mention to them that we ſhould always be willing to accede to any equal propoſitions for that purpoſe, and would carefully convey their applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Sir William Howe or the general who might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Britiſh army. I take the liberty to return their letters, preſuming that Congreſs may incline to give them ſome anſwer, either directly, or through general Heath.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect to lieutenant-colonel * * *, I do not find that there is any neceſſity for granting the prayer of his petition: we have already too many officers: and I do not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the intereſt of the States would be much promoted in his appointment. If he could make up two or three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, they would be of priſoners and deſerters, who would moſt aſſuredly embrace an early opportunity to go off with their arms and clothing. I am diſpoſed to conſider him as a man of ſome addreſs and policy, as he is aiming at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in the line of the army (by obtaining an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a new corps) of the rank which he had as a diviſion quarter-maſter. Beſides the impolicy of augmenting the number of our officers where it is not really eſſential, ſuch a promotion would give diſſatisfaction; and I ſuppoſe there are few officers, if any, who formerly commanded Mr. * * * in the line of the army, that would ſubmit to his orders.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed copy of a letter from general Dickinſon to me will inform Congreſs of the fate of the continental frig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates in Delaware,—a fate (in the ſituation they were left) I had long predicted, and which I had taken much pains to avert, by uſing every argument in my power to have them ſunk. In that caſe, their deſtruction would have been at leaſt a work of time, difficulty and expenſe, and might have been perhaps prevented. About one o'clock on Thurſday
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:029737_0596_0FE29C8E097B98D8"/>
I got notice of an intended move of the enemy by water; and, conjecturing the deſtination of it, had a detachment under general Maxwell (whoſe tour of duty it was) ready to march towards the Delaware by four o'clock: but a heavy rain prevented their moving till next morning.</p>
                     <p>I have been happy in the exchange, and a viſit from lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-colonel Allen. His fortitude and firmneſs ſeem to have placed him out of the reach of misfortune. There is an original ſomething in him that commands admiration; and his long captivity and ſufferings have only ſerved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe if poſſible his enthuſiaſtic zeal. He appears very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of rendering his ſervices to the States, and of being employed, and at the ſame time does not diſcover any am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition for high rank. Congreſs will herewith receive a letter from him; and I doubt not they will make ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for him as they may think proper and ſuitable.</p>
                     <p>I take pleaſure in tranſmitting a Philadelphia paper of the ninth, which came to hand yeſterday evening, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a meſſage from his moſt chriſtian majeſty to the court of London in conſequence of the treaty between him and theſe States,—and his Britannic majeſty's addreſs to the lords and commons, &amp;c. The meſſage is conceived in terms of irony and deriſion, more degrading to the pride and dignity of Britain than any thing ſhe has ever expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced ſince ſhe has been a nation.

Colonel Johnſon ſet out on Saturday afternoon to wait on Congreſs upon the ſubject of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and, I preſume, will be at York to-day.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall announce the reſolution of the fifteenth to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and would flatter myſelf it will quiet in a great meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:029737_0597_0FE29CEF1CD4AD20"/>
the uneaſineſſes which have been ſo extremely diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and prevent reſignations, which had proceeded, and were likely to be at ſuch a height, as to deſtroy our whole military ſyſtem. It has experienced no inconſiderable ſhock, particularly in the line of ſome States, from the loſs of ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral very valuable officers.</p>
                     <p>The letter and brevet for colonel Allen I will tranſmit by the firſt opportunity. He left camp eight days ago.</p>
                     <p>From a variety of concurring circumſtances, and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form report of perſons who have left Philadelphia within four days paſt, it would appear that the enemy mean to evac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate the city. It is ſaid they have already embarked a part of their heavy cannon and baggage,—that tranſports are fitted and fitting for their horſe, and taking in hay. The accounts further add that there has been a preſs for ſome nights in the city, and ſeveral men obtained in this way, and carried aboard ſhip; alſo that there had been an increaſed number of vendues. Theſe circumſtances all indicate an evacuation: but I have not been able to learn the objects of their future operations. I wrote to general Gates yeſterday upon the ſubject, that he may be prepared in the beſt manner the ſituation of things will admit, in caſe they ſhould be deſtined for the North-river,—and deſired him to retain for the preſent all the eaſtern recruits intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this army.</p>
                     <p>The quarter-maſter-general and commiſſary of proviſions are directed to uſe every poſſible exertion for putting the affairs of their departments in a train to facilitate a move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in caſe it ſhould be neceſſary. But ſuch have been the derangements and diſorders in them, that we muſt be greatly embarraſſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>or a conſiderable time yet.</p>
                     <p>A valuable detachment, under the command of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis Fayette, marched this morning, which is intended to move between the Delaware and Schuylkill, for reſtraining the enemy's parties, procuring intelligence, and to act as circumſtances may require.</p>
                     <p>I cannot help feeling for the priſoners in poſſeſſion of the enemy. If they evacuate Philadelphia, thoſe unhappy men will be dragged away with them, and perhaps to a more miſerable confinement. But, ſuppoſing that their future treatment ſhould not be worſe, or even that it ſhould be
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:029737_0598_0FE29C8F8C78A080"/>
more comfortable than their paſt,—the idea of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved farther from their friends, and farther from relief, muſt diſtreſs them to the laſt degree.</p>

The impolicy of ſuffering them ever to remain in places acceſſible to ſhipping, out of the queſtion,—our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs for both is amazingly great: we have many men now without firelocks, and many coming in, in the ſame predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament; and half the army are without ſhirts. Our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for want of the latter, and blankets, is quite painful,—of the former, very diſtreſſing. The doctors attribute in a great degree the loſs of hundreds of lives to the ſcarcity of clothing; and I am certain hundreds have deſerted from the ſame cauſe.</p>

He is now on his way to take the command at Pittſburg and in the weſtern frontiers, and waits on Congreſs for their inſtructions. I would take the liberty of ſubmitting to Congreſs the incloſed account of expenſes incurred by the general in his journey from Georgia to join this army, and which he preſented to me and to the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for payment. I did not know how far I might be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to comply with his requeſt, and therefore lay the matter before Congreſs. At the ſame time I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that nothing appears to me more equitable than that claims of this ſort, where they are not immoderate, ſhould be ſatisfied by the public. If this were not the caſe, the expenſes of an officer when ordered from one poſt to anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, eſpecially where they are diſtant, would ſink the whole or a very large part of his pay. The charges attending the general's journey from hence to Pittſburg will require equal attention; and the whole, I am perſuaded, will meet with a juſt and ſuitable proviſion.</p>

                        </gap> inſtant, nothing material has happened. The enemy are ſtill in Philadelphia: but the intelligence from thence is ſo clear and ſo ſtrong, that it is certain, or nearly as much ſo as any event can be that is contingent, that they mean to abandon it. Againſt the various meaſures they are purſuing, which point to an evacuation, there is but one ſingle circumſtance oppoſed that I can learn, which is, that they are working at their redoubts with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. But this fact, though certainly true, cannot be of ſufficient weight to raiſe a doubt upon the ſubject, and muſt be conſidered as merely calculated to deceive us, and to maſk their deſign.</p>
                     <p>We cannot find out, notwithſtanding the moſt diligent pains, whether their movement will be by land or ſea; nor are the inhabitants of the town ſatisfied on the point. Appearances favour either. They have a great many ſhips, and very large: yet, from a preparation of boats at Prince's-Bay on the ſouth ſide of Staten-Iſland which I am juſt adviſed of, and for ſome other reaſons, a land route is not improbable.</p>
                     <p>I have detached to Jerſey the whole of the troops of that State under general Maxwell, which, I flatter myſelf, with the militia general Dickinſon will be able to collect, will give them ſome annoyance in caſe they attempt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat by land.</p>

                     <p>I HAD the honour to receive your favour of the twenty-fifth inſtant by doctor Scudder, and that of the twenty-ninth, yeſterday afternoon, with the incloſures and packet to which they referred.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall inform major Lee of the new arrangement of his corps, and will appoint the officers required. Major Beatty is not in camp. The letter addreſſed to him ſhall be ſent by the firſt opportunity to Princeton, where I preſume he will be found. That for captain Smith is already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to him.</p>
                     <p>The enemy are yet in Philadelphia, though the whole chain of information for ſeveral days paſt afforded grounds to believe that they would have evacuated it before now. I ſhould ſuppoſe they are nearly prepared to do it, though the removal of the ſtores and baggage of ſo large an army requires conſiderable time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>June</hi> 1. I ſhould be glad to know, in caſe Philadelphia is evacuated, whether any and what line of conduct is to be purſued reſpecting the goods that may be left. Such articles as come under the denomination of public ſtores will of courſe be taken by the proper officers for the uſe of the States. The point on which I wiſh direction is with reſpect to goods and merchandiſe, private property.
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:029737_0601_0FE29CFBB1794498"/>
I do not know whether any conſiderable quantity may be left: but, it has been ſuggeſted, that, from an expectation of the ſort, there are ſome bringing into light their gold and ſilver for the purpoſe of buying up. If there ſhould be clothing ſuitable for the army, perhaps there might be nothing unjuſt in the public's taking the preference, and Congreſs appointing one or two intelligent active perſons of addreſs, acquainted with the city and with thoſe who have the goods, with proper powers to purchaſe them.</p>
                     <p>Whatever meaſure may be thought expedient, it will be neceſſary to adopt it as early as poſſible, as the evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will probably take place in a ſhort time. Robert Morris, eſquire, I ſhould imagine, if the purchaſing ſcheme is determined on, will be able to point out proper perſons. Some gentlemen have mentioned meſſieurs Samuel Howell and Thomas Franklyn as well qualified both an account of their integrity and attachment to our cauſe, and from their knowledge of the city and reſidence in it ever ſince the enemy had the poſſeſſion.</p>

                     <p>I ſincerely wiſh the legiſlatures of the ſeveral States had paſſed laws adopting the generous policy recommended by Congreſs in their reſolution of the twenty-third of April. I am aſſured by authority not to be queſtioned, that, for want of this, hundreds, nay, thouſands of people, and among them many valuable artizans with large quantities of goods, will be forced from Philadelphia, who otherwiſe would willingly remain. From report, their reluctance and diſtreſs upon this occaſion are ſcarcely to be paralleled. There are a few whoſe conduct has been ſuch, that no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of ſecurity, I preſume, could induce them to ſtay:
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:029737_0602_0FE29C9B4F9040C0"/>
and their departure, compelled and founded as it were in the approbation of their own conſciences, would anſwer all the purpoſes of example, eſpecially if followed by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation of property. A proſcribing ſyſtem, or laws hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame effect, when carried to a great extent, ever appeared to me to be impolitic: and their operation ſhould always ceaſe with the cauſes which produced them. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in terrorem are neceſſary: but to exile many of its inhabitants cannot be the intereſt of any State.</p>

The reſolution for ſettling the value of rations which have become due ſince the firſt of Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and fixing the mode of payment, I ſhall announce in this day's orders, and hope it will be highly ſatisfactory to all who are intereſted in it.</p>
                     <p>I have notified general Mifflin of the inquiry directed by Congreſs on the eleventh inſtant, by tranſmitting him a copy of their proceedings; and he has obtained leave, on his ſolicitation, to repair to York, &amp;c. to prepare for his defence. This I thought myſelf under a neceſſity of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however inconvenient and injurious it may be to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the abſence of officers at this period.</p>
                     <p>Our expectations that Philadelphia will be evacuated in the courſe of a few days are again up. The information received yeſterday through various channels, and in a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty direct way, would ſeem to place the matter almoſt on the footing of certainty.</p>
                     <p>We had about forty privates and twenty ſeamen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed on Sunday.

                     <p>I HAVE the pleaſure to inform Congreſs that I was this minute adviſed by Mr. Roberts that the enemy evacuated the city early this morning. He was down at the middle ferry on this ſide, where he received the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence from a number of citizens who were on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſhore. They told him that about three thouſand of the troops had embarked on board tranſports. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the bridge prevented him croſſing. I expect every moment official accounts on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>I have put ſix brigades in motion; and the reſt of the army are preparing to follow with all poſſible diſpatch. We ſhall proceed towards Jerſey, and govern ourſelves according to circumſtances. As yet I am not fully aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the enemy's deſtination; nor are there wanting a variety of opinions as to the route they will purſue, whether it will be by land or ſea, admitting it to be to New-York.

                     <p>I ſhall take every meaſure in my power to prevent an intercourſe between the army and the enemy, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the inhabitants and the latter.

                     <p>The letter for the commiſſioners I ſhall tranſmit by the earlieſt opportunity: however, their departure from Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia will prevent their getting it as ſoon as they other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would have done. I cannot ſay that I regret the delay: for there is no knowing to what acts of depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ruin their diſappointed ambition might have led. And permit me to add that I think there was no other criterion for Congreſs to go by, than the one they have adopted. The proceedings of the twenty-ſecond of April, it is probable, have reached Britain by this time, and will ſhew that the preſent powers of the commiſſioners,—or at leaſt thoſe we are obliged to ſuppoſe them to poſſeſs,—are wholly incompetent to any valuable end.</p>
                     <p>I have appointed general Arnold to command in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, as the ſtate of his wound will not permit his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in a more active line. Colonel Jackſon, with a detachment of troops, is to attend him: and I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that order will be preſerved, and the ſeveral purpoſes anſwered, expreſſed by Congreſs in their reſolution of the fourth inſtant.

                     <p>THE baron Steuben will have the honour to deliver you this. I do not know particularly the extent of his buſineſs at York: but, from what he has communicated, it is in part to get the duties and powers of his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment minutely defined and ſettled. I incloſe a copy of orders on the fifteenth inſtant, which were iſſued to quiet the minds of the general officers, and to remove a ſpirit of jealouſy which but too apparently was riſing among them. Theſe contain my ideas of the principal duties of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector's office, and, I have reaſon to think, are generally agreeable to the army. While I am on this ſubject, I muſt do juſtice to the baron's intelligence, zeal, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable induſtry, from which we have experienced very happy effects.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed letter I tranſmit at the requeſt of captain Gibbs; and I wiſh to recommend him to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Congreſs. He has been in the army from the commencement of the war, and in the capacities which he mentions. When Congreſs were pleaſed to honour me with the appointment of officers for the ſixteen additional battalions, I offered to make ſome proviſion for him: but this he declined, preferring to remain in my family. The guard he commanded originally conſiſted of fifty men: but, ſince the arrival of baron S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He adviſed that there ſhould be a ſelect corps of this number to receive the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeuvres in the firſt inſtance, and to act as a model to the army; and propoſed that it ſhould be formed of the old guard company and draughts from the line. I preſume,—if it ſhould be Congreſs's pleaſure,—that a majority would be highly agreeable to the captain, and is as much as he expects.</p>

General Dickinſon adds that there had been a briſk firing for ſome minutes between the enemy and Maxwell's brigade, or a part of it, in their advance,—in which the former, according to the report of a deſerter, had ſeveral killed. He further ſays the militia had been [<hi>appriſed</hi>] of their approach, were in good ſpirits, and that he expected to-day to be tolerably ſtrong.

                     <p>THIS will be delivered you by major Wemp who has the care of ſome warriors from the Seneca nation. The incloſed copy of a letter from our commiſſioners will ſhew that they are come to obtain the releaſe of Aſtiarix, anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er warrior, who was taken on the frontiers of Virginia. I never heard of the circumſtance till I was informed of it a few days ago by a letter from general Schuyler. As the commiſſioners have conſented to his exchange, and adviſed it, I have aſſured them it was agreeable to me; and I muſt take the liberty to requeſt that Congreſs will order it to be accompliſhed as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>I have treated them with civility, but declared at the ſame time, in anſwer to their ſpeeches both in council and as warriors,—if they do not immediately ceaſe hoſtilities, and become our friends, or at leaſt neutral,—that, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we are clear of the Britiſh army, I will turn our whole

force againſt them and the other nations at war with us, and cut them off to a man. They ſaw the main body of our army to-day; which circumſtance, added to the evac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of Philadelphia, and the preſents I wrote general Arnold to make them, with other inſtances of kindneſs, I truſt, will have a happy influence on the actions and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of their nation when they return.</p>

                     <p>I WAS duly honoured with your favour of the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth inſtant, with the report to which it referred, and truſt my ſituation will apologize for my not anſwering it before.</p>
                     <p>I am now here with the main body of the army, and preſſing hard to come up with the enemy. They encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yeſterday at Monmouth court-houſe, having almoſt the whole of their front, particularly their left wing, ſecured by a marſh and thick wood, and their rear by a difficult defile, from whence they moved very early this morning. Our advance, from the rainy weather, and the intenſe heat when it was fair, (though theſe may have been equally diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to them) has been greatly delayed. Several of our men have fallen ſick from theſe cauſes; and a few unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately have fainted, and died in a little time after.</p>
                     <p>We have a ſelect and ſtrong detachment more forward, under the command of major-general Lee, with orders to attack their rear if poſſible. Whether the detachment will be able to come up with it, is a matter of queſtion, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before they get into ſtrong grounds. Beſides this, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, with his corps, and ſome bodies of militia, are on their flanks.</p>
                     <p>I cannot determine yet at what place they intend to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark. Some think they will puſh for Sandy-Hook, whilſt others ſuppoſe they mean to go to Shoal-harbour. The latter opinion ſeems to be founded in the greater probabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, as, from intelligence, ſeveral veſſels and craft are lying off that place.</p>
                     <p>We have made a few priſoners; and they have loſt a good many men by deſertion. I cannot aſcertain their number, as they came in to our advanced parties, and puſhed immediately into the country. I think five or ſix hundred is the leaſt number that have come in, in the whole.

                     <p>I EMBRACE this firſt moment of leiſure to give Congreſs a more full and particular account of the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the army under my command ſince its paſſing the Delaware, than the ſituation of our affairs would heretofore permit.</p>
                     <p>I had the honour to adviſe them, that, on the appearances of the enemy's intention to march through Jerſey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſerious, I had detached general Maxwell's brigade in conjunction with the militia of that State to interrupt and impede their progreſs by every obſtruction in their power, ſo as to give time to the army under my command to come up with them, and take advantage of any favourable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that might preſent themſelves. The army hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proceeded to Coryel's ferry and croſſed the Delaware at that place, I immediately detached colonel Morgan with a ſelect corps of ſix hundred men to reinforce general Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and marched with the main body towards Princeton.</p>
                     <p>The ſlow advance of the enemy had greatly the air of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and led me, with others, to ſuſpect that general Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, deſirous of a general action, was endeavouring to draw us down into the lower country, in order, by a rapid move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:029737_0612_0FE29CAC8E8C49F8"/>
to gain our right, and take poſſeſſion of the ſtrong grounds above us. This conſideration, and to give the troops time to repoſe and refreſh themſelves from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues they had experienced from rainy and exceſſive hot weather, determined me to halt at Hopewell townſhip about five miles from Princeton, where we remained till the morning of the twenty-fifth.</p>
                     <p>On the preceding day I made a ſecond detachment of fifteen hundred choſen troops under brigadier-general Scott, to reinforce thoſe already in the vicinity of the enemy, the more effectually to annoy and delay their march. The next day the army moved to Kingſton; and having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed intelligence that the enemy were proſecuting their route towards Monmouth court-houſe, I diſpatched a thouſand ſelect men under brigadier-general Wayne, and ſent the marquis De la Fayette to take the command of the whole advanced corps, including Maxwell's brigade and Morgan's light infantry, with orders to take the firſt fair opportunity of attacking the enemy's rear.</p>
                     <p>In the evening of the ſame day, the whole army march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Kingſton, where our baggage was left, with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to preſerve a proper diſtance for ſupporting the advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed corps, and arrived at Cranberry early the next morning. The intenſe heat of the weather, and a heavy ſtorm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily coming on, made it impoſſible to reſume our march that day without great inconvenience and injury to the troops. Our advanced corps, being differently circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced, moved from the poſition it had held the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and took poſt in the evening on the Monmouth road about five miles from the enemy's rear, in expectation of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking them next morning on their march. The main body having remained at Cranberry, the advanced corps was found to be too remote, and too far upon the right, to be ſupported, in caſe of an attack either upon or from the enemy; which induced me to ſend orders to the marquis to file off by his left towards Engliſhtown, which he accordingly executed early in the morning of the twenty-ſeventh.</p>
                     <p>The enemy, in marching from Allentown, had changed their diſpoſition, and placed their beſt troops in the rear, conſiſting of all the grenadiers, light infantry, and chaſſeurs
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:029737_0613_0FE29D0E0398BEF0"/>
of the line. This alteration made it neceſſary to increaſe the number of our advanced corps; in conſequence of which, I detached major-general Lee with two brigades to join the marquis at Engliſhtown, on whom of courſe the command of the whole devolved, amounting to about five thouſand men. The main body marched the ſame day, and encamped within three miles of that place. Morgan's corps was left hovering on the enemy's right flank; and the Jerſey militia, amounting at this time to about ſeven or eight hundred men, under general Dickinſon, on their left.</p>
                     <p>The enemy were now encamped in a ſtrong poſition, with their right extending about a mile and a half beyond the court-houſe in the parting of the roads leading to Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury and Middletown, and their left along the road from Allentown to Monmouth, about three miles on this ſide the court-houſe. Their right flank lay on the ſkirt of a ſmall wood, while their left was ſecured by a very thick one,—a moraſs running towards their rear, and their whole front covered by a wood, and, for a conſiderable extent towards the left, with a moraſs. In this ſituation they halted till the morning of the twenty-eighth.</p>
                     <p>Matters being thus ſituated,—and having had the beſt information, that, if the enemy were once arrived at the heights of Middletown, ten or twelve miles from where they were, it would be impoſſible to attempt any thing againſt them with a proſpect of ſucceſs,—I determined to attack their rear the moment they ſhould get in motion from their preſent ground. I communicated my intention to general Lee, and ordered him to make his diſpoſition for the attack, and to keep his troops conſtantly lying upon their arms, to be in readineſs at the ſhorteſt notice. This was done with reſpect to the troops under my immediate command.</p>

                        </gap>ive in the morning, general Dickinſon ſent an expreſs informing that the front of the enemy had begun their march. I inſtantly put the army in motion, and ſent orders by one of my aides to general Lee to move on and attack them unleſs there ſhould be very powerful reaſons to the contrary—acquainting him at the ſame time, that I was marching to ſupport him, and, for doing it
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:029737_0614_0FE29CAE12E3B180"/>
with the greater expedition and convenience, ſhould make the men diſencumber themſelves of their packs and blankets.</p>
                     <p>After marching about five miles, to my great ſurpriſe and mortification, I met the whole advanced corps retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,—and, as I was told, by general Lee's orders,—with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having made any oppoſition, except one fire, given by a party under the command of colonel Butler, on their being charged by the enemy's cavalry, who were repulſed. I proceeded immediately to the rear of the corps, which I found cloſely preſſed by the enemy, and gave directions for forming part of the retreating troops, who, by the brave and ſpirited conduct of the officers, aided by ſome pieces of well ſerved artillery, checked the enemy's advance, and gave time to make a diſpoſition of the left wing and ſecond line of the army upon an eminence, and in a wood a little in the rear, covered by a moraſs in front. On this were placed ſome batteries of cannon by lord Stirling who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the left wing, which played upon the enemy with great effect, and, ſeconded by parties of infantry detached to oppoſe them, effectually put a ſtop to their advance.</p>
                     <p>General Lee being detached with the advanced corps, the command of the right wing, for the occaſion, was given to general Greene. For the expedition of the march, and to counteract any attempt to turn our right, I had ordered him to file off by the new church, two miles from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhtown, and fall into the Monmouth road, a ſmall diſtance in the rear of the court-houſe, while the reſt of the column moved directly on towards the court-houſe. On intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the retreat, he marched up and took a very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous poſition on the right.</p>
                     <p>The enemy, by this time, finding themſelves warmly oppoſed in front, made an attempt to turn our left flank: but they were bravely repulſed and driven back by detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parties of infantry. They alſo made a movement to our right with as little ſucceſs, general Greene having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced a body of troops with artillery to a commanding piece of ground; which not only diſappointed their deſign of turning our right, but ſeverely enfiladed thoſe in front of the left wing. In addition to this, general Wayne advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with a body of troops, and kept up ſo ſevere and well-directed
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:029737_0615_0FE29D10F01F7540"/>
a fire, that the enemy were ſoon compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire behind the defile where the firſt ſtand in the beginning of the action had been made.</p>
                     <p>In this ſituation the enemy had both their flanks ſecured by thick woods and moraſſes, while their front could only be approached through a narrow paſs. I reſolved never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs to attack them; and, for that purpoſe, ordered general Poor, with his own and the Carolina brigade, to move round upon their right, and general Woodford upon their left, and the artillery to gall them in front. But the impediments in their way prevented their getting within reach before it was dark. They remained upon the ground they had been directed to occupy during the night, with intention to begin the attack early the next morning; and the army continued lying upon their arms in the field of action to be in readineſs to ſupport them.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the enemy were employed in remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wounded, and about twelve o'clock at night marched away in ſuch ſilence, that, though general Poor lay extremely near them, they effected their retreat without his knowledge. They carried off all their wounded, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept four officers and about forty privates whoſe wounds were too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>angerous to permit their removal.</p>
                     <p>The extreme heat of the weather, the fatigue of the men from their march through a deep ſandy country al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely deſtitute of water, and the diſtance the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had gained by marching in the night, made a purſuit impracticable and fruitleſs: it would have anſwered no valuable purpoſe, and would have been fatal to numbers of our men, ſeveral of whom died the preceding day with heat.</p>
                     <p>Were I to conclude my account of this day's tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without expreſſing my obligations to the officers of the army in general, I ſhould do injuſtice to their merit, and violence to my own feelings. They ſeemed to vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> with each other in manifeſting their zeal and bravery. The catalogue of thoſe who diſtinguiſhed themſelves is too long to admit of particularizing individuals. I cannot, however, forbear mentioning brigadier-general Wayne, whoſe good conduct and bravery through the whole action deſerves particular commendation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="278" facs="unknown:029737_0616_0FE29CB0E7F468A8"/>
The behaviour of the troops in general, after they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from the firſt ſurpriſe occaſioned by the retreat of the advanced corps, was ſuch as could not be ſurpaſſed. All the artillery, both officers and men, that were engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, diſtinguiſhed themſelves in a remarkable manner.</p>
                     <p>Incloſed, Congreſs will be pleaſed to receive a return of our killed, wounded, and miſſing. Among the first were lieutenant-colonel Bunner of Pennſylvania, and major Dickinſon of Virginia, both officers of diſtinguiſhed merit, and much to be regretted. The enemy's ſlain, left on the field, and buried by us, according to the return of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aſſigned to that duty, were four officers and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty-five privates. In the former number was the honourable colonel Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>kton. Excluſive of theſe, they buried ſome themſelves, as there were ſeveral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> graves near the field of battle. How many men they may have had wounded, cannot be determined: but, from the uſual proportion, the number muſt have been conſiderable. There were a few priſoners taken.</p>
                     <p>The peculiar ſituation of general Lee at this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that I ſhould ſay nothing of his conduct. He is now in arreſt. The charges againſt him, with ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence as the court-martial may decree in his caſe, ſhall be tranſmitted for the approbation or diſapprobation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, as ſoon as it ſhall be paſſed.</p>
                     <p>Being fully convinced by the gentlemen of this country that the enemy cannot be hurt or injured in their embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation at Sandy-Hook, the place to which they are going,—and unwilling to get too far removed from the North-river,—I put the troops in motion early this morning, and ſhall proceed that way, leaving the Jerſey brigade, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan's corps, and other light parties (the militia being all diſmiſſed) to hover about them, to countenance deſertion, and to prevent their depredations as far as poſſible. After they embark, the former will take poſt in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Elizabethtown, the latter rejoin the corps from which they were detached.</p>

                     <p>SINCE I had the honour of addreſſing you on the fourteenth, I have been favoured with your letters of the eleventh and ſeventeenth, with their reſpective incloſures. The next morning after the receipt of the former which came to hand on the ſeventeenth, I diſpatched lieutenant-colonel Hamilton, another of my aides, with the beſt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots and the moſt ſkilful maſters of ſhips I could procure, to admiral count D'Eſtaing, to converſe with him more f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lly on the ſubject of his operations, than I was able to direct lieutenant-colonel Laurens to do for want of the information which I afterwards obtained from major Chouin, and a knowledge in ſeveral other points beſides.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday night Mr. Laurens returned; and I found by him that it was the count's firſt wiſh to enter at Sandy-Hook, in order to poſſeſs himſelf of, or to deſtroy, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the whole of the Britiſh fleet lying in the bay of New-York; and that, for this purpoſe, he had been much engaged in his inquiries about the depth of water, and in ſounding the channel to aſcertain it; the reſult of which was, that the water, from the experiments made, was too ſhallow at the entrance to admit his large ſhips,—or, if they could be got in, it appeared that it would not be without a great deal of difficulty and riſk. After this diſappointment, the next important object which ſeemed to preſent itſelf was an attempt againſt Rhode-Iſland, which the count in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to make (unleſs I ſhould adviſe the contrary) as ſoon as the Chimere frigate, which had carried his excellency monſieur Girard into the Delaware, ſhould rejoin him.</p>
                     <p>Lieutenant-colonel Hamilton, who was well informed of our ſituation and of my ſentiments on every point, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to give the admiral a full and accurate ſtate of facts, and to acquaint him what aid and how far we could
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:029737_0620_0FE29CBB9F194208"/>
co-operate with him in caſe of an attempt either againſt New-York or Rhode-Iſland; and alſo to obtain his ideas of the plan and ſyſtem which he might think ought to be purſued, and to agree with him on certain ſignals.</p>
                     <p>Previous to my diſpatching Mr. Hamilton, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation I received on my inquiries reſpecting the navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation at the Hook, I was led to ſuſpect (however inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting and deſirable the deſtruction or capture of the Britiſh fleet might be) that it was not ſufficient to introduce the count's ſhips. Under this apprehenſion, I wrote general Sullivan on the ſeventeenth by expreſs, that an expedition might take place in a ſhort time againſt Rhode-Iſland, and urged him at the ſame time to apply to the States of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts, Rhode-Iſland and Connecticut, for as many men as would augment his force to five thouſand, and alſo to make every poſſible preparation of boats, proviſion, pilots, &amp;c. as if the event was fixed and certain.</p>
                     <p>From this time till about twelve o'clock on Sunday, the troops continued paſſing the river, when I croſſed with the laſt diviſion. On Monday afternoon I arrived at this place, in the neighbourhood of which, the right and left wing encamped that night, with the ſecond line a few miles in their rear. And here I am happy to add that their paſſage acroſs the river was effected without any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, or without any more delay than neceſſarily attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the work.</p>
                     <p>Being perſuaded now, from the converſation which I have had with ſeveral pilots and maſters of veſſels, of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, as well as from the accounts of other gentlemen, and colonel Laurens's report on his return, that the paſſing of the count's ſhips by the Hook would be extremely preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, if not impracticable,—I determined yeſterday (which was as ſoon as it could be done) without waiting for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intelligence upon the ſubject, to put two brigades un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der marching orders. They accordingly marched this morning at two o'clock, for Rhode Iſland, under the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular command of generals Varnum and Glover reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ively, and both under the direction, for the preſent, of the marquis De la Fayette. A water conveyance was thought of and wiſhed for the eaſe of the troops: but, on conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration of all circumſtances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch as the difficulty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:029737_0621_0FE29D1CB5C49660"/>
veſſels, the change and precariouſneſs of the winds, the riſk from the enemy's ſhips, &amp;c. their route by land was deemed by far the more eligible. The force with general Sullivan, from the beſt and lateſt advice I have been able to obtain, is about three thouſand. A detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under colonel Jackſon will follow Varnum's and Glover's brigades.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed papers, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1, reſpecting eight perſons ſent from Bennington, and ordered into the enemy's lines, came to hand yeſterday. About the ſame time I received a letter from governor Clinton, containing a petition by the priſoners, and a letter from the committee of Albany, all r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>monſtrating againſt the proceeding. As this is a matter in which I have no authority to act, nor in which I would wiſh to intermeddle, I take the liberty of referring it to Congreſs, that they may decide upon it. The priſoners are at Weſt-Point, and ordered to be detained there for the preſent.</p>
                     <p>I would alſo take the liberty of tranſmitting to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> from captain Gibbs, and of recommending him to their conſideration. His letter was to have been ſent by the baron Steuben before we marched from Valley-Forge: but his declining to go to Yorktown at that time, and our move through the Jerſeys, delayed its being done. The captain has been in the army from the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the war, and in the capacities which he mentions. When Congreſs were pleaſed to honour me with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of officers for the ſixteen additional battalions, I offered to make ſome proviſion for him: but this he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, preferring to remain in my family. The guard he originally commanded conſiſted of fifty men; but, ſince the arrival of baron Steuben, it has been augmented to a hundred and fifty. The baron adviſed that there ſhould be a ſelect corps of this number to receive the manoeuvres in the firſt inſtance, and to act as a model to the army; and propoſed that it ſhould be formed of the old guard company, and draughts from the line. I preſume, if it ſhould be Congreſs's pleaſure, a majority would be highly acceptable to the captain, and that it is as much as he expects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eleven o'clock, P. M.</hi> I this moment received a letter from colonel Hamilton who is on his return to the army,
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:029737_0622_0FE29CBD256A27D0"/>
dated the twentieth at Black-Point. He informs that the count D'Eſtaing would ſail the next evening for Rhode-Iſland, being convinced from actual ſoundings that he could not enter his ſhips. He was anxiouſly waiting the arrival of the Chimere, but, at all events, meant to ſail at the time he mentions. The admiral has agreed on ſignals with Mr. Hamilton. Immediately after this letter came to hand, my aide, Mr. Laurens, ſet out for Providence, having many things to communicate to general Sullivan upon the ſubject of his co-operation, which neither time nor propriety would ſuffer me to commit to paper. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Sullivan is directed not to confine the number of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>oops to five thouſand, but to augment it, if he ſhall judge it neceſſary to inſure his ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>I was informed by Mr. Laurens, that the count D'Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taing's magazine of bread is not ſo large as we could wiſh, and that in the courſe of a few weeks he will be in want. This circumſtance I thought it right to mention: and I ſhould ſuppoſe that any quantity of biſcuit may be provided in a little time at Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>The incloſures, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2, are copies of three letters from myſelf to the admiral. I flatter myſelf the preſent of ſtock, which I directed for him, on his firſt arrival, in behalf of the States, will be approved by Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>The accounts from the weſtern frontiers of Tryon coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are diſtreſſing. The ſpirit of the ſavages ſeems to be rouſed, and they appear determined on miſchief and havoc in every quarter. By a letter from governor Clinton, of the twenty-firſt, they have deſtroyed Springfield and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas town, and are marching towards the ſettlements on the weſt branch of the Delaware. Theſe incurſions are extremely embarraſſing to our other affairs, and I think will juſtify a concluſion that Sir Henry Clinton's intention was to operate up the North-river. Whether it may have changed with circumſtances, cannot be determined.</p>
                     <p>I have detached the fourth Pennſylvania regiment and the remains of Morgan's corps, under lieutenant-colonel Butler, and alſo colonel Graham with a York State regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to co-operate with the militia, and to check the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians if poſſible. Colonel Butler is an enterpriſing good officer, and well acquainted with the ſavage mode of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:029737_0623_0FE29D1E399E0FA0"/>

                     <p>THE baron De Steuben will have the honour of delivering you this. I am extremely ſorry that this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's ſituation and views ſeem to have determined him to quit the ſervice, in which he has been heretofore and is capable ſtill of being extenſively uſeful. Some diſcontents, which aroſe among the officers on account of the powers with which the office was at firſt veſted, induced me to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range the duties of it upon a plan different from that on which it began. The moving ſtate of the army has for ſome time paſt, in a great degree, ſuſpended the exerciſe of the inſpectorate. When the troops marched from Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wic, the ſcarcity of general officers,—moſt of them being engaged with the court-martial either as members or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,—occaſioned my giving the baron a temporary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a diviſion during the march. On our arrival near our preſent encampment, I intended he ſhould relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh this charge, and reſume his former office, for which purpoſe a general order was accordingly iſſued. But I find that he is entirely diſinclined to the meaſure, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves not to continue in the ſervice unleſs he can hold an actual command in the line.</p>
                     <p>Juſtice concurring with inclination conſtrains me to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, that the baron has in every inſtance diſcharged the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral truſts repoſed in him with great zeal and ability, ſo as to give him the fulleſt title to my eſteem, as a brave, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable, judicious and experienced officer. I regret there ſhould be a neceſſity that his ſervices ſhould be loſt to the army: at the ſame time I think it my duty explicitly to obſerve to Congreſs, that his deſire of having an actual and permanent command in the line cannot be complied with, without wounding the feelings of a number of officers whoſe rank and merits give them every claim to attention; and that the doing it would be productive of much diſſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:029737_0624_0FE29CBEAD097EC8"/>
and extenſive ill conſequences. This does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any perſonal objections on the part of thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers againſt the baron:—on the contrary, moſt of them, whom I have heard ſpeak of him, expreſs a high ſenſe of his military worth. It proceeds from motives of another nature which are too obvious to need particular explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or may be ſummed up in this, that they conceive ſuch a ſtep would be injurious to their eſſential rights and juſt expectations. That this would be their way of thinking upon the ſubject, I am fully convinced, from the effect which the temporary command given him, even under cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſo peculiar as thoſe I have mentioned, produced: the ſtrongeſt ſymptoms of diſcontent appeared upon the occaſion.</p>

                     <p>I DO myſelf the honour of tranſmitting to Congreſs a copy of a letter from general Knox, and of ſundry obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and remarks on the ordnance eſtabliſhment of the eleventh of February, which I received about the time we marched from Valley-Forge. Theſe would have been tranſmitted before, had it not been for the moving ſtate of the army, and a variety of other objects which engroſſed my attention. We have found by experience that ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:029737_0625_0FE29D2A44A57018"/>
have reſulted from the eſtabliſhment, which I conceive have proceeded principally from the total independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the commiſſary-general of military ſtores on the commanding officer of artillery. It ſeems ſome alterations are neceſſary: and what they ſhall be, Congreſs will be pleaſed to determine.</p>
                     <p>It is not without reluctance that I am conſtrained to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The preſent unſettled ſtate of the army is productive of ſo much diſſatisfaction and confuſion, and of ſuch a variety of diſputes, that almoſt the whole of my time is now employed in finding temporary and inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate expedients to quiet the minds of the officers, and keep buſineſs on a tolerable ſort of footing. Not an hour paſſes without new applications and new complaints about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed to decline duty, to prevent diſputes, and their being commanded by oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er who upon every principle are their inferiors, unleſs their having obtained commiſſions before them (from the opportunities they had of making earlier applications, from local circumſtances) ſhould be conſidered ſufficient to give them a ſuperior claim. There are many other cauſes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction on this head: but I will not enter into a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute relation of them. I ſincerely wiſh that the gentlemen appointed, or ſuch others as Congreſs may think proper to nominate for the occaſion, would immediately repair to camp:—the preſent opportunity is favourable for reducing matters to ſyſtem and order; and, from painful experience, I know there is an abſolute neceſſity for it.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould alſo hope that Congreſs will excuſe me for mentioning again the neceſſity there is for appointing ſome brigadiers. The Maſſachuſetts, by the reſignation of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Learned, wants one: Pennſylvania, as general Hand is not here, has but one with the army: Maryland, which has two large brigades in the field, has only general Small-wood; and the North-Carolina troops, ſince the departure
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:029737_0626_0FE29CCA9F281AD0"/>
of general M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Intoſh, have been without any. As I had taken the liberty upon a former occaſion to offer my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Congreſs and their committee upon this ſubject, I ſhould not trouble them now, if I was not more and more convinced that the ſervice required promotions in this line. The frequent changes which take place among the officers, where there are no brigadiers, are attended with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience and detriment; and they are an effectual bar to the introduction of diſcipline. In ſuch caſes, the officers know that their command is but temporary, always liable to ceaſe; and therefore they do not find themſelves ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently intereſted to promote order and ſubordination; nor will the reſt look up to them with that reſpect and defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which are eſſential. Every day's experience proves this, and ſhews beyond queſtion that the affairs of a brigade can never be in a right train without a brigadier or ſome general officer to direct them. It is certain theſe appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at the firſt view, will add a little to the liſt of expenſe: but in the end they will be a great ſaving, and produce many important advantages. We are alſo a good deal diſtreſſed at this time for major-generals. However, as this ariſes more from the peculiar circumſtances and ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of many which prevent them from duty in the line, than from a deficiency in the number appointed, I ſhall not add upon the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>There is another branch of the army, which, in my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, calls loudly for the appointment of a general officer,—and this is the cavalry. For want of a proper regulating head in this corps, the whole has been in confuſion, and of but very little ſervice; whereas, under a right management, it might be moſt uſeful. The principal officers in it do not harmonize; which circumſtance, with their diſputes about rank, would (were there no other objections) effectually prevent the corps from rendering the public the ſervices they have a right to expect, and of which it ſhould be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. To promote any gentlemen now in it to a general command, would not be acquieſced in by the reſt—nor do I know that any of them wiſh it; and it would increaſe their miſunderſtanding, and, of courſe, diſorder.</p>
                     <p>I mean to draw all the horſe immediately together, when I truſt they will be under the direction of a general officer
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:029737_0627_0FE29D2BC8304870"/>
appointed by Congreſs for the purpoſe. Who he ſhall be, will remain ſolely with them to determine. However, I will take the liberty to add that he ſhould be intelligent, active, attentive; and, as far as I can judge, general Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallader or general Reed would fill the poſt with great honour and advantage; though it would ſeem, from the ſeat the latter has taken in Congreſs, and from his late appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the council of Pennſylvania, as if he had declined every military view. The abilities of theſe gentlemen, as well as their attachment, are generally known; and I am led to believe that either would be as acceptable to the corps as any perſon that can be found. Indeed I have learned as much from two of the colonels.</p>
                     <p>I have been waiting with the moſt impatient anxiety to hear of count D'Eſtaing's arrival at Rhode-Iſland; but as yet I have not been ſo happy. My laſt intelligence from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hence is a letter from general Sullivan, dated at ten o'clock in the forenoon of the twenty-ſeventh, when he had no advice of the fleet. He was in high ſpirits; and, from the preparation in which matters were, he entertained the moſt flattering hopes of ſucceſs in the intended enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. The brigades of Varnum and Glover, with Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's detachment, would arrive, I expect, on the ſecond inſtant.</p>
                     <p>As the army was encamped, and there was no great proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a ſudden removal, I judged it adviſeable to ſend general Greene to the eaſtward on Wedneſday laſt, being fully perſuaded his ſervices, as well in the quarter-maſter line as in the field, would be of material importance in the expedition againſt the enemy in that quarter. He is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with the whole of that country, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he has an extenſive intereſt and influence in it. And, in juſtice to general Greene, I take occaſion to obſerve that the public is much indebted to him for his judicious management and active exertions in his preſent department. When he entered upon it, he found it in a moſt confuſed, diſtracted and deſtitute ſtate. This, by his conduct and induſtry, has undergone a very happy change, and ſuch as enabled us with great facility to make a ſudden move with the whole army and baggage from Valley-Forge in purſuit of the enemy, and to perform a march to this place. In
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:029737_0628_0FE29CCC58E52370"/>
a word, he has given the moſt general ſatisfaction, and his affairs carry much the face of method and ſyſtem. I alſo conſider it as an act of juſtice to ſpeak of the conduct of colonel Wadſworth, commiſſary-general. He has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable in his exertions to provide for the army; and, ſince his appointment, our ſupplies of proviſion have been good and ample.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Auguſt</hi> 4. At ſeven o'clock in the evening yeſterday, I received the incloſed letter from general Sullivan, with one addreſſed to myſelf, a copy of which I do myſelf the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of forwarding. I am exceedingly happy in the count's arrival, and that things wear ſo pleaſing an aſpect.</p>
                     <p>There is another ſubject on which I muſt take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of addreſſing Congreſs, which is that of the clothier's department. I am perfectly ſatisfied, that unleſs this very important and intereſting office is put under better regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the army will never be clothed. * * * I believe both officers and men, particularly the latter, have ſuffered greater inconveniences and diſtreſſes than ſoldiers ever did before, for want of clothing; and that this has not flowed more from a real ſcarcity of articles, than a want of proper exertions and provident management to procure them. It is eſſential that ſomething ſhould be done, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to place the department on a better footing. We have now a great many men entirely deſtitute of ſhirts and breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and I ſuppoſe not leſs than a fourth or fifth of the whole here who are without ſhoes. From the deficiencies in this line, numbers of deſertions have proceeded,—not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deaths: and what is ſtill worſe, the troops which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and ſee themſelves in rags, want that ſpirit and pride neceſſary to conſtitute the ſoldier.</p>
                     <p>I have been informed by ſeveral officers, and by ſuch as I can depend on, that many of the late draughts are willing and deſirous of enliſting during the war. I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive myſelf at liberty to give direction on the point, and therefore ſubmit it to Congreſs to decide. However, if they can be engaged for the uſual bounties allowed by the contin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>, after proper precautions are taken to prevent fraud, I think the meaſure will be expedient. It is true, our affairs have an agreeable aſpect at preſent: but the war may continue, and we—want men. A third of the
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:029737_0629_0FE29D2D4D94BAF8"/>
time of ſome of them, and a half in the caſe of others, is already expired; and as they will riſe in their views, and become more difficult in proportion as their ſervice draws to a concluſion,—if the ſtep is conſidered adviſeable, the ſooner we attempt to enliſt, the better in all probability will the work ſucceed.</p>

                     <p>MR. Fuhrer and Mr. Kleinſmit have lately left the Britiſh lines, and come in to us. The account they give of themſelves is this, that they had been firſt-lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants in the Heſſian corps, were taken priſoners at Trenton, reſided during their captivity at Dumfries in Virginia, were lately exchanged, and have ſince reſigned their commiſſions; that having ſolicited permiſſion to come out from the enemy, and being refuſed, they determined to leave them at all hazards, and have now put their deſign in execution. The circumſtances of their captivity are known to ſeveral of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in our army.</p>
                     <p>They are deſirous of entering into our ſervice, obſerving that there are a number of German officers in the ſame diſpoſition with themſelves, who will reſign and join us, if they find that theſe meet with proper countenance. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me that important advantages may attend the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging a diſpoſition of this nature (if it really exiſts,—which is far from being impoſſible) from the influence it will neceſſarily have upon the ſoldiery by increaſing that ſpirit of deſertion and diſcontent which already prevails among them.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs will beſt judge of the propriety of employing theſe gentlemen. I have been thinking in what manner it might be done: and the mode leaſt exceptionable, which at preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent occurs to me, is to authoriſe them to raiſe a corps for themſelves by enliſting ſuch German inhabitants, and ſuch deſerters from the foreign troops, as may be willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage. The corps at firſt, as it is only by way of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, need not be large, but may be afterwards increaſed
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:029737_0632_0FE29CCF64936358"/>
as circumſtances ſhall point out. This meaſure, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, cannot be attended with any material inconvenience, and may be productive of utility. If the gentlemen are employed at all, it muſt be in a new corps, as they could not be introduced into any of thoſe already formed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuring the officers in them, and producing diſſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, murmurs, and reſignations.</p>

They expect ſome augmentation in rank; and indeed it ſeems neceſſary, in order the more effectually to intereſt others to follow their example: but caution ſhould be uſed not to carry the idea too far, becauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other weighty conſiderations, the higher the rank con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on them, the more difficult it will be to provide for thoſe who may hereafter come to us, and who will of courſe frame their expectations by compariſon.</p>

                     <p>YOUR favour of the ſixteenth, with the ſeveral pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to which it referred, came duly to hand on Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day afternoon.</p>
                     <p>I this minute received from general Sullivan the letter I have now the honour of forwarding you, with one addreſſed to myſelf. A copy of the latter is alſo incloſed. The general ſeems to have been very near the enemy's lines, and on the point of opening all his batteries. Things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be in a promiſing train.</p>
                     <p>By advices from an officer of rank and intelligence who is ſtationed with a party in Monmouth county, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that ſixteen ſhips entered the Hook on the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,—one having a flag; and that, on that and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding day a heavy cannonade was heard at ſea.</p>

                     <p>I DO myſelf the honour of tranſmitting to Congreſs the incloſed memorial of colonel Rawlings, preſented in behalf of himſelf and the Maryland officers who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his command in the year 1776. The facts which are ſtated in it are generally true: and I cannot but feel myſelf exceedingly intereſted in favour of theſe gentlemen. The conduct of this whole corps, when Fort-Waſhington was attacked, is ſo generally known and approved, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unneceſſary to add upon the ſubject. However, I think it but juſtice to obſerve that every repreſentation of that day's tranſaction gave them the higheſt credit. They fought with a degree of veteran bravery; and, though but a handful, they maintained their ground a conſiderable time, notwithſtanding the moſt vigorous efforts to force them. All who were ſpectators upon the occaſion have declared this; and the enemy themſelves have not refuſed them applauſe.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems hard that officers of their merit ſhould be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked,—and a loſs to the ſervice that they ſhould remain unemployed: but the conſequences that would attend their
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:029737_0635_0FE29D3A46971688"/>
incorporation with any of the corps now exiſting appear too diſagreeable to try the experiment. Colonel Rawlings himſelf, from the information I have had, does not incline to give any uneaſineſs to the line of the army, and would rather make a diſtant part of it againſt the Indians, in caſe he could be provided for in that way. Captain Beall, who is charged with this, will be able to inform Congreſs more fully than I can of the wiſhes of the colonel and the reſt of his officers; and his account may lead perhaps to ſome ſuitable and practicable proviſion for them. As I have obſerved before, they are men who deſerve well of their country. I only mention the Maryland officers upon this occaſion, becauſe that part of the corps which came from Virginia was provided for by the State in their preſent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, as I have been credibly adviſed.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Rawlings was never in the complete and actual command of the regiment under his direction as colonel, becauſe he never obtained a commiſſion: but he became entitled to it according to the then common rule of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the death of colonel Stephenſon, and the non-accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of colonel Morgan who was appointed to it. Of the latter circumſtance, Mr. Rawlings, I am perſuaded, was never appriſed, as it was kept a ſecret from an apprehenſion that the enemy might claim an officer of the rank of colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel in exchange for Morgan who was then a priſoner on parole, if his promotion came to their knowledge. Major Williams, of the Maryland part of the corps, was appointed by the State to one of her regiments now in the field, and is the only officer in his predicament I know of, that they arranged.</p>

                     <p>I WOULD take the liberty to inform Congreſs that colonel Armand is come to camp with his corps, and has applied to me for commiſſions for his officers. By the reſolution for eſtabliſhing the corps, it was to be officered out of the foreigners then commiſſioned in our ſervice, who were not nor could be provided for in any of the regiments. Inſtead of this, there are only three officers in this corps who before held any commiſſions in our ſervice, viz. lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-colonel Vrigney, and captains Mercley and Shafner. The two laſt were only lieutenants, and are now appointed to captaincies, contrary (it ſeems to me) to the ſpirit and intention of the reſolution.</p>
                     <p>As colonel Armand has departed from his inſtructions which muſt govern me, I am not authoriſed to grant the commiſſions he requires, and am therefore under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of troubling Congreſs with the arrangement of the corps, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

                        </gap>, as it now actually ſtands for their conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deciſion. The colonel founds his deviation from the reſolve upon ſome verbal intimation given him that the part in queſtion would not be inſiſted on.</p>
                     <p>I would alſo take the liberty to mention that general Du Portail lately delivered me a memorial, in which, among other things, he repreſents that he had made an agreement with Congreſs at his firſt appointment, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelf nor the other gentlemen with him ſhould ever be commanded by any of the engineers who had preceded them in our army. I could not but anſwer that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of officers were the only rule of precedency and command I had to judge by; and, while others held ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior appointments, I muſt conſider them accordingly in the courſe of ſervice. He gave me the incloſed letter to you upon the ſubject, and is extremely anxious to leave the matter placed upon a certain footing; and, no doubt, it will be for the good and tranquillity of the ſervice that the claim be determined as ſpeedily as poſſible one way or the other. At the ſame time I think it right to obſerve, that it cannot be expected that colonel Coſciu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

and ſatisfaction, will conſent to act in a ſubordinate capacity to any of the French gentlemen except general Du Portail. * * *</p>
                     <p>Since I had the honour of writing you on the twenty-fifth inſtant, I have not received a ſingle line from general Sullivan. The only intelligence I have from the eaſtward is from monſieur Pontjobeau. This gentleman left Rhode-Iſland the twenty-ſeventh, and arrived about two hours ago in camp. From him I learn that our people were ſtill on the iſland;—that it was generally thought they had made effectual proviſion for a retreat in caſe of exigency;—that in the evening of that day he met monſieur Preville, an officer belonging to the Languedoc, at Providence, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with diſpatches to general Sullivan,—who informed him that the French fleet had got into Boſton. He further adds, that monſieur Calonne who was in company with him at Providence, and who had more converſation with mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Preville than he himſelf had, told him that monſieur Preville ſaid count D'Eſtaing had ſailed or was on the point of ſailing again for Rhode-Iſland with ten ſhips of the line and his frigates.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favour of the twenty-eighth and that of the thirtieth ultimo, with the ſeveral incloſures to which they refer.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs may rely that I will uſe every poſſible means in my power to conciliate any differences that may have ariſen in conſequence of the count D'Eſtaing's going to Boſton, and to prevent a publication of the proteſt upon the occaſion. Several days before the receipt of the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, I had written to the eaſtward, urging the neceſſity of harmony, and the expediency of affording the admiral every aſſiſtance to refit his ſhips. This I repeated after the reſolution came to hand; and I have alſo taken op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to requeſt all the general officers here to place the matter in the moſt favourable point of view whenever they hear it mentioned.</p>
                     <p>The five hundred guineas, which Congreſs were pleaſed to order, came ſafe to hand, and ſhall be appropriated to the purpoſes they intended, and as the exigency of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice may require. For want of ſupplies of this ſort, we have been very deficient in intelligence in many important and intereſting points. In ſome caſes, no conſideration in paper money has been found ſufficient to effect even an engagement to procure it: and, where it has been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the terms of ſervice, on account of the depreciation, have been high, if not exorbitant.</p>
                     <p>The deſigns of the enemy, as to their future movements, remain yet entirely [<hi>in the dark:</hi>] but the expectation of their leaving the continent is daily decreaſing. The hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane ſeaſon ſeems oppoſed to their going to the Weſt-Indies; and the paſſage to Europe in a little time will become more and more dangerous. Beſides theſe, there is another circumſtance, of ſome weight, if true, to induce a belief that they mean to ſtay. It appears by the papers that part of the regiments lately raiſed in Britain are order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Halifax. If the troops here were intended to be recalled, it would ſeem that ſome of them would be ſent to reinforce that garriſon ſooner than troops from England or Scotland; and hence I think it may be preſumed that another campaign will take place in America, eſpecially if
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:029737_0640_0FE29D3D4EDC6D98"/>
adminiſtration are diſappointed in their expectations from the commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>Where the theatre of war may be, muſt be a matter of conjecture. But, as it is an acknowledged fact that an army acting in the eaſtern States muſt derive flour for its ſupport from thoſe more weſtern, I ſubmit to Congreſs the expediency, and, in my opinion, the neceſſity of eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without loſs of time, magazines of this article at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient places (removed from the Sound) in Connecticut and Maſſachuſetts. I am the more induced to wiſh an early conſideration of this point, as, by a ſudden move of the army (ſhould events make it neceſſary) the departments of commiſſary and quarter-maſter would be greatly diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nor would ſuch magazines, I ſhould imagine, be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any conſiderable loſs, though the army ſhould not operate in that quarter, as the flour would anſwer oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally for our ſhipping, and the ſurplus might in all probability be otherwiſe readily diſpoſed of.</p>
                     <p>I take the liberty of tranſmitting to Congreſs a memorial I received from the reverend Mr. Tetard. From the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates annexed to it, he appears to be a man of great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it: and, from every account, he has ſuffered in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme in the preſent conteſt. His attachment, ſervices, and misfortunes, ſeem to give him a claim to a generous notice: but, according to the new eſtabliſhment of the army, it is not in my power to make any proviſion for him. I therefore recommend his caſe to the attention and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Six o'clock, P. M.</hi> I this minute received a letter from general Sullivan, of which the incloſure, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2, is a copy. I ſhall be exceedingly happy if a perfect reconciliation has taken place between him and the count and all the officers. His letter will ſhew ſome of the reaſons that led to the proteſt, and that it was the hope of our officers that it would have operated as a juſtification to the admir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        <hi>September</hi> 5. I was duly honoured yeſterday evening wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="303" facs="unknown:029737_0641_0FE29DA7AEBF2DA8"/>
not expreſſed in the reſolution of that date that any other bounty is to be given to the men who engage for three years or during the war, than twenty dollars, I ſhall take it for granted they are to receive the uſual allowances of clothing and land. There are ſeveral continental troops whoſe time of ſervice will expire at the end of the fall or during the winter. I ſhall conſider theſe within the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and operation of the reſolve, though they are not mentioned; and ſhall direct every neceſſary meaſure to be taken to re-enliſt them.</p>
                     <p>From the exorbitant ſtate, town, and ſubſtitute boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I am very doubtful whether twenty dollars will be found ſufficient to engage ſo great a proportion either of the draughts or continentals, as was at firſt apprehended. Our failure in the enterpriſe againſt Rhode-Iſland will have its weight; and every day, from the approach of the fall and winter, will add new difficulties. As it is a work of the moſt eſſential importance, I will order it to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the inſtant the money arrives: and leſt, on experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſum ſhould prove too ſmall, I would ſubmit it to Congreſs whether it will not be expedient to paſs another reſolve, authoriſing a further bounty of ten dollars, to be uſed as circumſtances may make it neceſſary.

                     <p>I HAD the pleaſure to hear this morning, by a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from general Sullivan, of the thirty-firſt ultimo, that he had effected a retreat to the main, the preceding night, without any loſs either of men or ſtores. As he has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to Congreſs fully upon the ſubject, and I feel their anxiety to hear it, I ſhall not detain major Morris longer than to obſerve that I think the retreat a moſt fortunate, lucky, and well-timed event.</p>
                     <p>Major Morris informs me he has heard that lord Howe was off Boſton with his fleet: and it appears by a New-York paper of the ſecond, that rear-admiral Parker arrived at Sandy-Hook on this day week with ſix ſhips of the line, of ſeventy-four guns each,—which is corroborated by other accounts. I tranſmitted the intelligence to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency count D'Eſtaing yeſterday and the day before, as it acquired more and more the appearance of certainty,—as I have regularly done every occurrence intereſting to his fleet and our operations.</p>

                     <p>I TAKE the liberty of laying before Congreſs the incloſed copies of a paragraph and ſchedule contained in a letter from general Heath, which I lately received. Theſe will appriſe Congreſs, if they are not already informed, of the ſupplies of proviſion and wood wanted by the count D'Eſtaing, and will naturally lead to a conſideration of the ways and means to be purſued for furniſhing them as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Since I had the honour of addreſſing you on the fourth and fifth inſtant, I have obtained a return of the blankets which are now deficient. This, and the faſt approach of the fall, will ſuggeſt the neceſſity of the moſt vigorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions being uſed to procure them. Not a night will paſs from this time without the ſoldiers feeling the want.</p>

                     <p>I DO myſelf the honour of returning to Congreſs the report of their committee on the ſubject of an inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip (tranſmitted in your letter of the twentieth ultimo, which was not received till the thirty-firſt) with ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations as have occurred to me in conſidering the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and which I have made with a freedom that I truſt will be agreeable to Congreſs. I wiſh it had been in my power to have returned it before: but the intervention of a variety of other important buſineſs from time to time obliged me to poſtpone a concluſion upon the points till yeſterday.</p>
                     <p>I have already, in a letter of the twenty-ſixth of July, delivered my ſentiments upon the conſequences that would attend the baron Steuben's being appointed to an actual and permanent command in the line; and therefore I will not trouble Congreſs with a repetition of them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I will take the liberty to add that I am more and more convinced that what I then ſaid upon the occaſion was well founded; and that I am certain ſuch a meaſure will produce at leaſt infinite diſcontents and diſquietudes among the general officers.</p>
                     <p>I have alſo had the honour to receive your favour of the fifth inſtant, with the ſeveral papers to which it refers. Theſe ſhall have my attention as far as practicable. I hope all the confederate troops are on the march from Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, and, if they are not, that immediate orders will be given for their joining the army.</p>
                     <p>The incloſed copy of a letter from general Sullivan, of the tenth inſtant, will inform Congreſs that the enemy have not relinquiſhed their burning plans, and that in this way they have deſtroyed ſeveral houſes, ſtores, and veſſels, at and near Bedford.</p>
                     <p>I was adviſed on Wedneſday night that a body of them, conſiſting of four or five thouſand, under general Grey, had made a landing in that quarter, and were intrenching. In conſequence of this, and from an apprehenſion that general Clinton might poſſibly mean to operate to the eaſtward and form ſome project in concert with lord Howe againſt the count D'Eſtaing's ſquadron, I determined to move the
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:029737_0644_0FE29D4B48EC2A18"/>
troops from this ground to a rear poſition, better calculated to afford ſupport to the works on the North-river in caſe an attempt ſhould be made againſt them, and at the ſame time more convenient for forwarding detachments to the eaſtward, if the enemy point their operations that way.</p>
                     <p>I was the more induced to come to this determination as moſt of the accounts from New-York ſeemed to lead to a belief, as they ſtill do, that a conſiderable movement was and is in contemplation, if not an entire evacuation of the city, and this by water. Beſides theſe reaſons, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal objects for taking poſt here do not now exiſt. One was to create every poſſible jealouſy in favour of the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition againſt Rhode-Iſland; another, the conſuming the forage within its vicinity and towards Kingſbridge. The former is now over, and the latter in a great degree ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</p>

                     <p>SINCE I had the honour of addreſſing you on the twelfth inſtant, I have received your ſeveral favours of the tenth, twelfth and ſixteenth, with the reſolutions to which they allude. I tranſmitted the Britiſh commiſſioners the reſolve of the fourth inſtant reſpecting the convention troops the morning after it came to hand, and alſo wrote to Sir Henry Clinton upon the ſubject of paſſports. I have not received his anſwer.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to the magazines, I have directed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary to form them on the inland communication from hence to Boſton, at proper intervals. The twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand barrels of flour that Congreſs have ordered to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed will be a valuable addition, if they can be tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by water: but it ſeems to me there will be great riſk of its being loſt, if it is ſent by ſea while the enemy have a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior fleet on our coaſt.</p>
                     <p>As the campaign is not cloſed yet, all our cavalry are of uſe. They lie in the neighbourhood of the enemy's poſts, for the purpoſe of reſtraining their parties, and for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and giving intelligence of their movements; and they
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:029737_0645_0FE29DAAB70FBBD0"/>
are ſubſiſted upon the forage which would otherwiſe be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them. I am ſenſible that theſe corps are attended with great expenſe; and the moment I think the ſervice will admit of it, they or a part of them ſhall be quartered in different places diſtant from the army, where they may be provided for on better terms. The price of forage, and the difficulty of getting it, are really objects of great magnitude, and ſuch as ſhould undergo ſome regulation, if there is any that can be adopted. I received letters a few days ago from the commiſſary and quarter-maſter upon this ſubject, copies of which, and of my letter in conſequence to the ſeveral States from Maſſachuſetts-Bay to Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia incluſive, I take the liberty to incloſe.</p>
                     <p>The reſolution prohibiting officers, except ſuch as are ſpecially authoriſed, to keep horſes in the army or within forty miles of it, has been publiſhed in orders, and I will take every ſtep in my power to give it effect.</p>
                     <p>I have conſidered the practicability of reducing the teams employed in the army, and find, however deſirable the object may be, that it cannot be done. We have not at this time more than are abſolutely and indiſpenſably nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary, nor ſo many as would be neceſſary in caſe of a rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id movement: neither does it appear to me that there can be a ſubſtitution of ox for horſe teams, at leaſt to any great extent; nor that any material advantages would ariſe from ſuch a meaſure. There might perhaps be a ſmall ſaving in the article of provender: but this, I fear, would be greatly over-balanced in the loſs of cattle that would be appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the uſe of the commiſſary's department. After a full inveſtigation of the ſubject, I believe we ſhall be obliged to adhere to the kind of teams we now employ, and that the only relief we ſhall have in point of expenſe will ariſe from ſending a part of the horſes to places where they may be more eaſily foraged, when we have fixed our camp and quarters for the winter.</p>
                     <p>I beg leave to mention to Congreſs that there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſome mode's being eſtabliſhed, by which claims on the old quarter-maſterſhip, that remain unſatisfied, may be diſcharged. There are many of this nature; and theſe, however well authenticated they may be, the gentlemen now in office do not conceive themſelves at liberty to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:029737_0646_0FE29D4CCCAAB0E8"/>
without obtaining ſome ſpecial direction for the purpoſe. I am every day applied to for payment of ſuch accounts, and, in many inſtances, have been obliged, as well for the ſake of juſtice to individuals as for the public good, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them to be taken up. It appears to me that Congreſs cannot be too early in their reſolution upon this occaſion, and that either the preſent department ſhould be authoriſed to ſettle and pay ſuch claims, or that ſome perſons ſhould be appointed and ſupplied with money for the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The army marched from White-Plains on the ſixteenth inſtant, and is now encamped in different places. Three brigades, compoſing the Virginia troops, part of the right wing, under the command of general Putnam, are at Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon's near Weſt-Point: and two brigades more, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the remainder, are with baron De Kalb at Fiſhkill plains, about ten miles from the town, on the road leading to Sharon. The ſecond line, with lord Stirling, is in the vicinity of Fredericſburg; and the whole of the left wing at Danbury under the command of general Gates. Theſe ſeveral poſts appear to be the beſt we can occupy in the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent doubtful ſtate of things, as they have relation to the ſupport of Weſt-Point in caſe of an attack in that quarter, and are alſo on the communication to the eaſtward, if the enemy point their operations that way. Beſides theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, general Scott with a light corps remains below in the country about King's-Street.</p>
                     <p>The letter from Sir Henry Clinton which I have the honour of tranſmitting was ſent to me to-day by colonel Baylor who is poſted at Hackinſac. He ſays he received one for me by the ſame flag; and, from his note, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he had charged the horſeman with it who juſt arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Head-Quarters. Through accident he forwarded yours to me; and I think it probable that you will be troubled with mine. If this ſhould be the caſe, you will be ſo obliging as to return it to me by the firſt conveyance. I was alſo informed by colonel Baylor, that a conſiderable body of the enemy landed at Paulus' Hook in the evening of the twenty-ſecond, and were encamped that night in the woods between four and five miles from the town of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen. He had not learned their object: but it is likely they are after forage.</p>

                     <p>THE following is an extract of a letter of the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteenth inſtant, which I had the honour to receive from the count D'Eſtaing.</p>
                     <p>"I entreat you to promote the exchange of priſoners already planned by monſieur Girard. The unhappy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons taken before the commencement of hoſtilities cannot be fully regarded as priſoners: their lot is dreadful. The mode adopted for exchanging them by means of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary, without introducing the king's name or mine into the tranſaction, removes a great part of the political diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which before ſubſiſted."</p>
                     <p>I am an entire ſtranger to the plan above referred to, or to the mode that has been adopted for exchanging by means of our commiſſary. He is abſent from the army: and I muſt therefore beg the favour of you to obtain from monſieur Girard ſuch information as will enable me to give directions for carrying the count's deſires into execution, if practicable.</p>
                     <p>The marquis De Vienne, at preſent at Boſton, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted a furlough of eighteen months to enable him to return to France, whither he is called by ſome domeſtic concerns. I do not conceive myſelf at liberty to grant his requeſt without the permiſſion of Congreſs, to whom I would beg leave to obſerve, that, if agreeable to them, he may be indulged without prejudice to the ſervice, as he is not attached to any particular command.</p>
                     <p>I have juſt received an account from Jerſey, which I fear is too true, that colonel Baylor's regiment of dragoons were ſurpriſed in their quarters the night before laſt, and moſt of them killed or taken. A few of the ſtragglers have come in, who can give but a very imperfect account of the matter. They think the colonel and moſt of the officers were made priſoners, and that the privates were put to the ſword. There were, I imagine, about one hundred men of the regiment together when this unlucky accident happened.</p>
                     <p>The ſtay of the enemy in Jerſey being longer than I apprehended, and not knowing what their real intentions
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:029737_0648_0FE29D4E5154A158"/>
may be, I have ordered general Maxwell to advance from Elizabethtown to the neighbourhood of Acquakenunk bridge, and have ſent over general Woodford's brigade from this ſide of the river. I have alſo ordered general Pulaſki to advance with as much expedition as poſſible, and join the brigades. Lord Stirling has this day gone over to take the command of the continental forces and militia who are aſſembling in conſiderable numbers. If the enemy mean only to forage, they will be kept from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending themſelves by theſe troops: and if they have any deſigns upon the poſts in the Highlands, they will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from ſeizing the paſſes leading to the forts, by lord Stirling, who will be between them and the enemy, and always ready to poſſes them.</p>
                     <p>I have made proper diſpoſitions on this ſide the river for the ſecurity of the Highlands, in caſe that body of the enemy, who are on this ſide Kingſbridge employed in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting forage, ſhould advance.</p>
                     <p>The ſketch of Rhode-Iſland, forwarded by this expreſs, was received from general Sullivan, and left behind by accident when the laſt diſpatches were ſent off.</p>
                     <p>I have had the honour of receiving yours of the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth, incloſing an order for count Pulaſki's legion to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to Trenton.</p>

                     <p>I AM honoured with your favour of the twenty-ſeventh of September, with the incloſed reſolves of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, a copy of which has been tranſmitted to major-general Lincoln for his information and direction.</p>
                     <p>Being ſeparated from my papers, I am uncertain whether I mentioned in my laſt, that, the enemy in the Jerſeys hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received a reinforcement and made ſome forward movements, I had thought it expedient to detach another brigade thither to act in conjunction with the one already there together with Pulaſki's corps and the militia, and had ſent major-general lord Stirling to take the command of the whole;—that I had alſo ordered major-general
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:029737_0649_0FE29DB7CC28EE28"/>
Putnam acroſs the river for the immediate ſecurity of Weſt-Point, and moved a diviſion of troops to this place, to be nearer that poſt. I have ſince come here myſelf, and propoſe to remain till the views of the enemy on the Jerſeys are decided: though I have had no reaſon to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my opinion that nothing more than a forage is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. By the laſt accounts, they had drawn in their out-parties, and reſumed their firſt bounds behind Hackin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac river, at the liberty-pole and Newbridge.</p>
                     <p>That part of Baylor's regiment which eſcaped came off in the firſt inſtance, and were afterwards brought off in ſo diſperſed a manner that the number has not been aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: but, from what I have learned, I ſhould eſtimate the loſs at about fifty men and ſeventy horſes. Major Clough is dead of his wounds. This affair ſeems to have been attended with every circumſtance of cruelty.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſmall compenſation for this accident, that colonel Butler three or four days ago, with a party of infantry and horſe comprehending major Lee's corps, ſurpriſed about a hundred Yagers below Tarrytown, killed ten on the ſpot, and took a lieutenant and eighteen men priſoners.

                     <p>THIS will be delivered to you by major general the marquis De la Fayette. The generous motives, which firſt induced him to croſs the Atlantic and enter the army of the United States, are well known to Congreſs. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons equally laudable now engage his return to France, which in her preſent circumſtances claims his ſervices. His eagerneſs to offer his duty to his prince and country, however great, could not influence him to quit the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in any ſtage of an unfiniſhed campaign. He reſolved
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:029737_0650_0FE29D595411E4C8"/>
to remain at leaſt till the cloſe of the preſent, and embraces this moment of ſuſpenſe to communicate his wiſhes to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, with a view of having the neceſſary arrangements made in time, and of being ſtill within reach, ſhould any occaſion offer of diſtinguiſhing himſelf in the field.</p>
                     <p>The marquis at the ſame time, from a deſire of preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a relation with us, and a hope of having it yet in his power to be uſeful as an American officer, ſolicits only a furlough ſufficient for the purpoſes above-mentioned. A reluctance to part with an officer, who unites to all the military fire of youth an uncommon maturity of judgment, would lead me to prefer his being abſent on this footing, if it depended on me. I ſhall always be happy to give ſuch a teſtimony of his ſervices as his bravery and conduct on all occaſions entitle him to; and I have no doubt that Congreſs will add ſuitable expreſſions of their ſenſe of his merit, and their regret on account of his departure.</p>

                     <p>THE inceſſant and preſſing applications of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and their real diſtreſs for clothing, oblige me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat my wiſhes to the board, to obtain the earlieſt direction of Congreſs for relieving their wants. They are in a very diſagreeable ſituation in this reſpect; and, unleſs ſome mode can be adopted for ſpeedily ſupplying them, many will be obliged involuntarily to quit the ſervice; or, if this ſhould not be the caſe, we ſhall be involved in perpetual complaints, and the moſt painful applications.</p>
                     <p>I do not recollect, when the army was firſt appointed, that there was any engagement on the part of the public that the officers ſhould be provided with clothing through their means; nor has there been any explicit declaration
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:029737_0651_0FE29DB95269F958"/>
ſince, that I remember, for the purpoſe: but the meaſure has become indiſpenſably neceſſary; and, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of public aid, they never can be ſupplied: for their pay, if the articles proper could be found in a private way, (from the enormous and exorbitant prices now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted for every thing) would prove wholly incompetent to the end.</p>
                     <p>There is however a reſolution of Congreſs, of the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſecond of November laſt, which points to a proviſion through the public means and thoſe of the States individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually taken. This has encouraged the officers to look for ſupplies in the manner there profeſſed; and their not being able to obtain them makes them more uneaſy perhaps than if the reſolution had never paſſed.</p>
                     <p>I have written to meſſieurs Otis and Andrews to make a return of the cloth, &amp;c. in their hands, proper for offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and alſo to adviſe me what quantities might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in caſe the board ſhould direct a purchaſe. This appears to be the only practicable expedient at this time, from which relief can be drawn: and, if it is to be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the agents cannot be too ſoon ordered to carry it into execution. I really wiſh to be informed by the board by the firſt opportunity whether the officers may expect ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies through the public ſtores, that I may be able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them deciſively upon the point when they apply. As matters now ſtand, I am in a very awkward and irkſome ſituation.</p>
                     <p>Since it is evident that the officers cannot provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with clothing, and that there is a neceſſity for the intervention of the public aid, I would ſubmit it to the board whether it may not be proper for them to form an eſtimate of clothing, proportioned to the number of officers in the army, for the conſideration of Congreſs, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their ſanction for importing the ſame, if they approve the plan. This meaſure, it ſeems to me, is the only one that can inſure relief in future; and it appears the more eligible as the loſs to the public will be infinitely leſs than if they procure the articles in the country, ſuppoſing that it could be done. Beſides this conſideration, the officers then might be properly uniformed and all placed on a juſt and equal footing.</p>

                        <pb n="314" facs="unknown:029737_0652_0FE29D5AF69AE990"/>
If the board ſhould be authoriſed to direct an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate purchaſe of clothing for the officers, I will take the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

The officers ſay that hitherto it has not had the neceſſary and generous operation intended by Congreſs; but, on the contrary, in the few inſtances in which they have been able to furniſh themſelves with articles from the public ſtores, that they have done it at the current exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant prices. Indeed, there are many matters in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment which require a more perfect and explicit arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than has ever been made: and at preſent there is ſuch a claſhing of offices and officers that it is difficult to determine how or with whom buſineſs is to be tranſacted.</p>

                     <p>SINCE I had the honour of addreſſing you on the ſixth inſtant by favour of the marquis De la Fayette, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your letter of the ſecond with its incloſure.</p>
                     <p>I do myſelf the honour of tranſmitting you an account of the engagement between the French and Britiſh fleets on the twenty-ſeventh of July, as publiſhed by the Britiſh admiralty-board. I received a printed copy of it laſt night from New-York, which I have forwarded to his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy count D'Eſtaing. It is evident from admiral Keppel's own relation of the affair, that he was pretty ſeverely han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, notwithanding he affects in the concluſion to mention that he wiſhed extremely for an opportunity to renew the combat the next day.</p>
                     <p>We are ſtill in great ſuſpenſe as to the operations and deſigns of the enemy, though every practicable meaſure has been uſed and is purſuing, to come at them. By late and direct accounts it would ſeem that ſome troops at leaſt are going from New-York. A few days, I think, muſt open their conduct deciſively.</p>

I have had the misfortune to hear that the Raleigh frigate has become a prize to two Britiſh ſhips of war after a long and very gallant reſiſtance. Captain Barry, finding that the frigate would fall into the enemy's hands, ran her aſhore on Seal-Iſland, to which he eſcaped in boats with about eighty of his hands, and from thence to the main. It is ſaid he took meaſures for blowing her up, but was defeated in his purpoſe by the perfidy of an under officer who concealed himſelf and remained on board.</p>

                     <p>I AM honoured with yours of the ninth, incloſing the reſolves to extend the embargo, and to prevent fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalling proviſions.

                     <p>Incloſed you have the copy of a petition from the ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugees in New-York to the commiſſioners.

It ſhould ſeem by this that they are extremely ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous and anxious to know whether New-York is to be garriſoned, which implies a ſuſpicion on their part that it is to be evacuated. All accounts, ſince mine of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, confirm the report of a very conſiderable embarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is ſaid to conſiſt of ten Britiſh regiments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted to their full eſtabliſhment, and their grenadier and light companies added to them. This will make them amount to upwards of five thouſand men. They have not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THE letter which I had the honour of addreſſing to you the day before yeſterday would inform Congreſs of the embarkation and ſailing of a conſiderable detachment of the enemy from New-York, and of the meaſures I had taken in expectation of and upon the happening of the event. Whether this will be ſucceeded by a further em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation, or by a total evacuation of the poſts which they hold within the States, in the courſe of this year or the enſuing one, I cannot pretend to determine. But, as it will be right and prudent in us to provide for every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency, I would with the greateſt deference ſubmit it to Congreſs whether it may not be proper for them to call upon the States to provide men in time for filling their reſpective battalions, before or at any rate againſt the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſpring, and in the ſame manner as if there was a moral certainty that the war would be proſecuted with all poſſible vigour on the part of Britain. Should this not be the caſe, or ſhould any events caſt up in the mean time to render troops unneceſſary, it will be eaſy to diſband the levies and to keep them from the field,—while, on the other hand, our relaxation in not providing them may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject us at leaſt to many diſagreeable conſequences.</p>
                     <p>The general return of the infantry in the month of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, tranſmitted to the board of war by the adjutant-general, and to which I beg leave to refer, will ſhew Congreſs the whole amount of our reputed force at that time. But I am to obſerve, that large, very large deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be made from it on account of the columns of ſick, and the men ſaid to be on command. Many under the former deſcription, particularly that of ſick abſent, are actually dead; others, unfit for ſervice; and ſeveral, who have recovered, have deſerted: nor will the latter afford more than one half of its number in time of action, as various duties, ſuch as waggoning, diſtant guards, eſcorts, &amp;c. em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy a great proportion of thoſe under this denomination.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the above deductions, Congreſs will perceive from the returns which I now take the liberty of tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that there are four thouſand three hundred and eighty draughts and others, whoſe terms of ſervice will expire
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:029737_0655_0FE29DBC589C1838"/>
during and by the cloſe of winter: for I am ſorry to add that our exertions to re-engage the draughts and old ſold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iers in this predicament, for the uſual bounty, have proved ſo far ineffectual and without ſucceſs. I have not tried what effect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> additional grant of ten dollars might have: but I fear, and it ſeems to be the opinion of all I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted upon the occaſion, that it would have but little if any influence. I know, in the caſe of the draughts and troops of one State, that the offer of twenty dollars on the part of the continent, with a like allowance and an actual depoſit of it by the State, has been no temptation.</p>
                     <p>This general reluctance and refuſal is founded in the unhappy depreciated light in which the ſoldiery view the money, and their expectation of receiving immenſe State, diſtrict, and ſubſtitute bounties. Whether grants or boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by Congreſs, bearing ſome proportion to theſe, to ſuch as ſhould enliſt for the war, would be attended with better ſucceſs, I cannot undertake to decide. The experiment may be made if they judge it proper: and if it proves an inducement of any extent, it will be an infinite ſaving in the end. I believe however our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ureſt and only certain aids will be derived from draughting, which I truſt may and will be done by the States on the recommendation of Congreſs, agreeable to the mode mentioned in my letter to their committee when they firſt honoured me with a viſit at Valley-Forge. The exertions to recruit by voluntary enliſtments may ſtill go on, as both modes in all probabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity will not produce near as many men as may be found neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>In the caſe of the Carolina troops whoſe ſervice is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every day, the officers ſay that nothing will induce them to enliſt, unleſs they can be permitted to go home on furlough till the ſpring. On this indulgence they ſeem to think ſeveral might be engaged. The diſtance is great, and there will be ſome uncertainty as to their returning: beſides, it will be fixing a precedent for others. If Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs approve the plan, they will be pleaſed to inform me by the earlieſt opportunity.</p>
                     <p>I am under ſome difficulty about clothing the draughts, and the old ſoldiers whoſe ſervice is expiring and will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine every day. As Congreſs have never expreſſed
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:029737_0656_0FE29D5E080A70F0"/>
their ſenſe upon the ſubject, and this is increaſed by a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which I received ſome time ago from the board of war, which reſpects particularly the draughts, I muſt earneſtly requeſt that Congreſs will favour me with the ſpeedieſt direction in the caſe, whether they are to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> furniſhed out of the ſupplies coming on, equally with the other troops. At the ſame time I will take the liberty to offer it as my opinion, that, however inconvenient or expenſive it may appear at the firſt view to clothe them, the meaſure will be neceſſary, and founded not only in humanity but ſound policy. We have no proſpect now of levying men in any other way: and if they are not clothed, they will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by ſickneſs and by death; and not doing it may prove an inſurmountable bar or at leaſt a great obſtacle to our obtaining future aids, though the exigencies of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs ſhould be never ſo preſſing. Yet the clothes may be withheld as long as circumſtances will permit, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement for them to enliſt. In the inſtance of the old ſoldiers who have not received the annual allowance of Congreſs, the point ſeems clearly in their favour. The board ſuggeſted that the draughts might be ſupplied out of the beſt of the old clothes which might be given in by the troops on receiving new ones: but unfortunately there will be few of any worth.</p>

expected,—left me no room to doubt that the fleet which went out of the Hook on the nineteenth and early the twentieth inſtant contained the embarkation of which I had been adviſed. In the perſuaſion of this, my letter of the twenty-ſecond to your excellency was written: but, from more recent advices, and through various channels, bearing every mark of authenticity, I am to conclude the ſuppoſition has been ill founded. The above-mentioned fleet appears to have carried away no other troops than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valids, the officers of the corps lately reduced, with ſome refugees. The twenty-third inſtant the troops which had embarked ſtill remained in the harbour. They are fixed at ten or twelve Britiſh regiments, and ſix of the new levies. This fleet was probably compoſed of homeward-bound victuallers, with ſome merchantmen and other veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which choſe to take the protection of a convoy. The accounts ſtill ſay that they were accompanied by fourteen or fifteen ſail of the line and ſome frigates.</p>

I cannot help concurring with theſe gentlemen in opinion, and am perſuaded from a number of conſiderations, that we muſt lay aſide all thoughts of an expedition againſt that place for the preſent. Beſides other neceſſary preparations, we have not yet been able to get forward the clothing for the army. The Congreſs will alſo perceive in lieutenant-colonel Butler's journal, tranſmitted to your excellency in my letter of the twenty-ſecond inſtant, the great difficulties he had to encounter in croſſing the rivers at a much earlier ſeaſon of the year.</p>

I will direct the beſt and cheapeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I can to be made of the cavalry for their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation in quarters, and will inſtruct the forage-maſter on the occaſion. The remittance to the paymaſter, which you mention, I preſume has come to hand, having been applied to by him to iſſue an order for the payment of the troops for Auguſt and September. I have tranſmitted the letter from Nicholas Dupui and others, with the affidavits, to his excellency governor Clinton, and have ordered col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Cortlandt to march with his regiment towards the Miniſinks, and to take ſuch poſt as the governor may point out.

                     <p>By a letter from lord Stirling, of the third inſtant, he informed me that the fleet at the Hook the preceding day increaſed to a hundred and eight ſail; and, that morning at ſeven, weighed anchor and ſtood out to ſea.

                     <p>I HAVE been honoured with yours of the nineteenth, twenty-ſeventh, twenty-eighth, and twenty-ninth ultimo.</p>
                     <p>A tolerable ſupply of ſhoes has lately arrived to the iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clothier's ſtore from the eaſtward, Pennſylvania, and Jerſey: and, if the different perſons employed in procuring that article will exert themſelves to keep up the ſupply, I hope we ſhall not be much diſtreſſed during the winter, provided we remain quietly in quarters.</p>
                     <p>It is much to be wiſhed that Congreſs would come to a ſpeedy reſolution concerning the procuring clothing for the officers at a price in proportion to their pay, more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they were led to expect this from a reſolve which paſſed in November, 1777. If the clothing itſelf cannot be conveniently procured, I imagine the alternative of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing an adequate ſum of money in lieu thereof would be the next beſt expedient.</p>
                     <p>As the board muſt undoubtedly have experienced the many difficulties ariſing from the want of a proper arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the clothier's department, I hope they will preſs the committee who have that buſineſs in charge, to bring in their report, that the new ſyſtem may be carried into execution without loſs of time. Whether it has been ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to want of conduct in the late officer, or his want of proper powers and directions, I will not undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine: but the irregularity in that department has been
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:029737_0660_0FE29D6A53E17A40"/>
an endleſs ſource of trouble to me, and a great cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content in the army.</p>
                     <p>I have given the iſſuing clothier directions to keep an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the marks and numbers of the bales of blankets, and of the quality of their contents, from whence you will be able to trace from whom thoſe ſmall ones were purchaſed. When the iſſues are completed, you ſhall have the account. The directions to Mr. Meaſe were very proper. If any corps want completing in any particular article which is not to be procured here, I will ſign the order myſelf.</p>
                     <p>In the preſent ſcarcity of hats, the caps of which you have forwarded a pattern muſt be uſed by way of ſubſtitute. But an officer very attentive to the health of his men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms me that he found an inconvenience from the uſe of woollen caps laſt winter inſtead of hats: when the men put them off in the ſpring, they many of them took violent colds from the ſudden tranſition. They alſo contribute to keep the head dirty, than which nothing is more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>healthy.</p>
                     <p>I find it impracticable to carry the recommendation of the board, reſpecting calling in the old clothes upon deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of the new, into execution. The ſoldiers were not to be convinced of the good policy and economy intended by the application of the old clothes to hoſpitals and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the army, but looked upon it as an unjuſtifiable attempt to deprive them of what they had earned by their year's ſervice, and what (conſidering the ſcanty ſupply of ſome kinds of covering, blankets in particular) would help to make them more comfortable during the winter. Theſe diſcontents were communicated to me, the moment they aroſe, by ſome of the beſt officers in the line: which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined me to let the matter drop, more eſpecially as another argument was made uſe of, which was unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: this was, that, upon a fair ſettlement, there would be found a conſiderable deficiency of the bounty-clothing for a year or two paſt, and that therefore it would be more equitable to make up the deficiency than to draw in the remains.</p>

                     <p>ON Wedneſday afternoon I received a letter from the honourable Mr. Lee and Mr. Lovell of the committee for foreign affairs, incloſing a plan and ſundry reſolutions of Congreſs for attacking Canada the next campaign in conjunction with the forces of his moſt Chriſtian majeſty, and requeſting my obſervations upon the ſame to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Congreſs, and a copy to be delivered to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis De la Fayette. Theſe diſpatches, through the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the marquis (who unfortunately was ſeized with a fever in his journey from Philadelphia, which ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains him at Fiſhkill) were prevented coming to hand till that time: and the great importance and extent of the ſubject they comprehend would not permit me the honour of an earlier communication of my ſentiments. I hope Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will excuſe my not complying with that part of the reſolution which requires me to deliver a copy of my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations to the marquis, as the manner in which I am obliged to treat the ſubject opens ſuch a proſpect of our wants and our weakneſſes, as, in point of policy, ought on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be known to ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>I am always happy to concur in ſentiment with Congreſs; and I view the emancipation of Canada as an object very intereſting to the future proſperity and tranquillity of theſe States: but I am ſorry to ſay the plan propoſed for the purpoſe does not appear to me to be eligible under our preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent circumſtances. I conſider it as my duty, and what Congreſs expects from me, to give my reaſons for this opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with that frankneſs and candour which the importance of the ſubject demands; and, in doing this, I am perſuaded I ſhall nor fail to meet with their approbation.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems to me impolitic to enter into engagements with the court of France for carrying on a combined operation of any kind without a moral certainty of being able to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil our parts, particularly if the firſt propoſal came from us. If we ſhould not be able to perform them, it would argue either a want of conſideration, a defective knowledge of our reſources, or ſomething worſe than either, which could not fail to produce a degree of diſtruſt and diſcontent that might be very injurious to the Union. In the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:029737_0662_0FE29D6BD79A6B60"/>
ſhould the ſcheme propoſed be adopted, a failure on our part would certainly occaſion in them a miſapplication of a conſiderable land and naval force which might be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully employed elſewhere, and probably their total loſs. It is true, if we were at this time to enter into the engagement, we ſhould be every day better able to judge whether it will be in our power to accompliſh what may be expected from us: and, if we ſhould find hereafter that our reſources will be unequal to the undertaking, we may give notice to the court of France in ſeaſon to prevent the ſailing of the troops and the ill effects which might attend it. But beſides that a project of this kind could not be embraced by France without its having an influence on the whole ſyſtem of oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations for the next campaign, which of courſe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome derangement from its being abandoned, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of this could not fail to give a very unfavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble impreſſion of our foreſight and providence, and would ſerve to weaken the confidence of that court in our public councils.</p>
                     <p>So far from there being a moral certainty of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with our engagements, it may in my opinion be very ſafely pronounced, that, if the enemy keep poſſeſſion of their preſent poſts at New-York and Rhode-Iſland, it will be impracticable either to furniſh the men or the other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſupplies for proſecuting the plan. They will not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to keep thoſe poſts with leſs than ten thouſand men and a conſiderable navy. If it ſhould be thought beſt for the advantage of carrying on the expeditions intended, to forego any offenſive operations againſt theſe garriſons, and to leave them in quiet poſſeſſion of ſuch important places, we ſhall at leaſt be obliged to provide for the ſecurity of the country againſt their incurſions and depredations, by keeping up a force ſufficient to confine them within their own limits. It is natural too to ſuppoſe, that the people's expectations of being protected will grow ſtronger in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the diminution of the enemy's force, and the greater facility with which it can be afforded. They will hardly be content to continue in a ſtate of alarm and inſecurity from a force ſo inconſiderable, while the principal ſtrength of the States is drawn out in the proſecution of remote objects. If this reaſoning is juſt, we ſhall be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:029737_0663_0FE29DCD6BAB2F18"/>
to have a larger force than the enemy, poſted in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent places to prevent ſudden inroads which they would oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe be able to make at different points: and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber required cannot be eſtimated at leſs than twelve or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand men. This will be two-thirds as large a force as we have been able to raiſe and maintain during the progreſs of the war, as theſe calculations both of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's ſtrength and of our own are meant to deſignate the number of effective rank and file.</p>
                     <p>If I rightly underſtand the plan in conſideration, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires for its execution twelve thouſand ſix hundred men rank and file. Beſides theſe, to open paſſages through a wilderneſs, for the march of the ſeveral bodies of troops, to provide the means of long and difficult tranſportations by land and water, to eſtabliſh poſts of communication for the ſecurity of our conveys, to build and man veſſels of force neceſſary for acquiring a ſuperiority on the lakes,—theſe and many other purpoſes peculiar to theſe enterpriſes, which would be tedious in detail, will demand a much larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of artificers and perſons to be employed in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual and laborious offices, than are uſual in the ordinary courſe of military operations. When we add the whole together, the aggregate number of men requiſite for the ſervice of the enſuing campaign will be little leſs than dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the number heretofore in the field: but, to be more certain in the calculation, it may be placed at only one half more.</p>
                     <p>Experience is the only rule to judge by in the preſent caſe. Every expedient has been exhauſted in the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing campaigns to raiſe men; and it was found impoſſible to get together a greater force than we had, though the ſafety and ſucceſs of the cauſe ſeemed abſolutely to require it. The natural and direct inference therefore is, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of the country were inadequate to a larger ſupply. I cannot then ſee that we can hope upon any principle to be equal to ſo much greater exertions next year, when the people and the army appear to grow daily more tired of the war, and the depreciation of our money continually increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of conſequence proving a ſmaller temptation to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to engage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="326" facs="unknown:029737_0664_0FE29D6D5D365520"/>
The ſtate of our ſupplies for tranſporting and ſubſiſting the troops will ſtand upon a footing equally bad. We have encountered extreme difficulties in theſe reſpects, and have found that it was full as much as we were competent to, to feed the army we have already had, and enable it to keep the field and perform the movements required by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies of the ſervice. It is not likely that theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties will diminiſh; but on the contrary they will rather multiply as the value of our currency leſſens: and the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous prices to which proviſions have riſen, and the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſcarcity created by monopolies, with what we have to fear from the effect of the ſame ſpirit, give us no reaſon to flatter ourſelves that our future proſpects can be much better.</p>
                     <p>In this ſituation of things we are hardly warranted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that we ſhall have it in our power to ſatisfy the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of numbers ſo much greater than we have yet had to ſupply, eſpecially if we conſider that the ſcene of our operations has hitherto been in the heart of the country furniſhing our reſources, which of courſe facilitated the drawing them out,—and that we ſhall then be carrying on the war at an immenſe diſtance, in a country wild and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated, incapable of affording any aid, and great part of it hoſtile. We cannot in this caſe depend on temporary or occaſional ſupplies as we have been accuſtomed, but muſt have ample magazines laid up beforehand. The labour and expenſe in forming theſe, and tranſporting the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtores of every kind for the uſe of the troops, will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to a degree that can be more eaſily conceived than deſcribed. The tranſportation muſt be, a great part of the way, through deſerts affording no other forage than herb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: and, from this circumſtance, our principal ſubſiſtence of the fleſh kind muſt be ſalted, which would not only be an additional expenſe in the additional conſumption of ſo ſcarce and dear an article as ſalt, but would greatly increaſe the difficulty both of providing and tranſporting. My let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the twenty-ninth ultimo (tranſmitting a copy of one from the quarter-maſter-general) which I had the honour of addreſſing to Congreſs, and to which I wiſh to refer, will point out the difficulties and daily expenſe attending our ſupplies of the article of flour only, in our preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:029737_0665_0FE29DD6838C8220"/>
excluſive of its coſt,—and lay the foundation for a ſort of comparative eſtimate to be formed of thoſe that would attend the ſupport of the troops when employed at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o great a diſtance.</p>
                     <p>If, in addition to all this, we ſhould have the French fleet to ſupply during the winter,—the likelihood of which I have no ſufficient information to ground a judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,—it will appear ſtill more impracticable to furniſh the ſupplies requiſite for the extenſive operations propoſed. But, independent of this, the improbability of doing it is, in my apprehenſion, infinitely too great to juſtify the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
                     <p>This reaſoning is founded on a ſuppoſition that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my do not evacuate their preſent poſts at New-York and Rhode-Iſland: nor can we preſume upon any paſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances ſo far as to determine the contrary, and enter into a national contract, the fulfilment of which at any rate, in my judgment, will depend on this event. Opinions on the ſubject are various, and the arguments on both ſides cogent. Circumſtances have hitherto been very indeciſive: at Rhode-Iſland there is nothing that looks like an evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I have heard of:—at New-York, the length of time elapſed ſince the event has been expected, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſatisfactorily accounted for, makes it not a little doubtful and problematical.</p>
                     <p>But if it were even certain that the enemy would ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave theſe States, I ſhould think our ability to carry on the expeditions meditated (from the nature of the country, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>We have been informed that a ſtrong garriſon has been lately ſent to Halifax, amounting, by report, to about four thouſand men:—a part of the detachments which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my are now making from New-York are currently ſaid to be, and in all probability are, deſtined for that place:—if they evacuate entirely, a very conſiderable part of their force will no doubt go there; and in any caſe we may expect that reinforcements will be thrown from thence into Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da early in the ſpring. The Engliſh are now greatly ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the French by ſea in America, and will from every appearance continue ſo unleſs Spain interpoſe,—an event which I do not know we are authorized to count upon. However, as I am deſtitute of information with reſpect to the preſent ſtate of European politics, this is a point upon which I can form but an imperfect judgment: but if it ſhould not take place, I think it infinitely probable, from the maritime ſituation and advantages of Halifax which is repreſented as the fineſt port and beſt naval arſenal in America,—from the ſecurity it is calculated to give to the general trade and poſſeſſions of Britain, both on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and in the Weſt-Indies,—that it will be a ſtation for a larger naval force than the one intended to convoy me French troops:—it will naturally be the principal rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous of the Britiſh ſhips of war in America. If this poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be admitted,—ſhould the Engliſh have any knowledge or even ſuſpicion of the deſign of the French court to ſend a fleet up the river St. Laurence, nothing will be eaſier than to intercept this fleet on its way, or to take or deſtroy it after it has got in. Nor can we flatter ourſelves with keeping this buſineſs a ſecret. Congreſs perhaps will be ſurpriſed to be told that it is already in more hands than they ſuſpect: and, in the progreſs of the negociation in France, it will get into many more. The preparations will announce the intention. It is indeed a part of the plan to avow the deſtination of the French troops, though this is to be contradicted by the manner of their clothing, &amp;c. The ſtationing of troops this winter, as is propoſed, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly on the Mohawk and Connecticut river, would be une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal

proofs of the deſign: it muſt at leaſt excite the ſtrongeſt ſuſpicion, ſo as to put the Engliſh nation upon their guard, and make them take precautions to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act it.</p>
                     <p>But if the French troops ſhould arrive before Quebec, I think their ſucceſs againſt that ſtrong place, fortified by every advantage of nature and of art, would be extremely doubtful. It is ſuppoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Montréal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and the poſts eſſential to it, muſt be defended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the poſſeſſion of them would throw too large a part of the country into our hands. But if reinforcements are ſent to Canada early in the ſpring,—a circumſtance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely likely,—theſe may be attended to without too far weakening the garriſon of Quebec; and, as before obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we cannot build upon their conduct's being regulated by an ignorance of our plans. The French troops, inſtead of a coup-de-main, would in this caſe be reduced to the neceſſity of carrying on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I will now take the liberty to turn my attention towards the operations of our own troops. The one againſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troit I ſhall at preſent ſay nothing about: if well conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I ſhould hope that place would fall without very great difficulty. The caſe is very different with reſpect to Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara. This, I am informed, is one of the ſtrongeſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes in America, and can only be reduced by regular approaches or by famine. In accompliſhing this, laſt war, and a conqueſt as far as Montrèal, I believe general Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſt exhauſted two campaigns, with all the advantages which he derived from the united efforts of Britain and America, with every convenience for water-tranſportation, including plenty of ſeamen, and with money that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded every thing which either country could furniſh. The former mode would require great perſeverance, time, and labour, and an apparatus which it would be almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable

to tranſport. The latter is practicable, but very difficult. To effect it, we muſt gain a ſuperiority on the lakes. The enemy have already a reſpectable force there:—if they ſuſpect our deſign, which they cannot fail to do from the meaſures to be taken, they may improve the interval in adding to it; and, by providing materials and artificers upon the ſpot, they may be able to increaſe it ſo as to keep pace with us. It is therefore eaſy to ſee that we ought not to be too ſanguine in the ſucceſs of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and that, if a moderate force be employed in the defence of Niagara without degarniſhing Quebec and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> muſt meet with great obſtacles: they will have a march of about a hundred and fifty miles from Cohoſs, which is about a hundred and ſixty miles beyond Hartford, a great part of which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> through a hitherto-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited and trackleſs country, with an immenſe train of waggons: all the ſtores and proviſions for the whole march, and the future ſupply of the troops, at leaſt till they ſhould get footing in Canada, muſt accompany them from the beginning. The impediments and delays in ſuch a march almoſt exceed conception.</p>
                     <p>When arrived at the St. Laurence, freſh obſtacles probably would preſent themſelves. The preſumption is, that, if the enemy could not make head there, they would deſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e the country through which they were to paſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the proviſion and forage, remove every kind of water craft, and demoliſh the materials for building others. Theſe precautions being taken on the Sorelle and St. Laurence would pretty effectually obſtruct our progreſs both to Montréal and Cadoroqui,—to ſay nothing of the rapidity of the current and the numerous rifts between Montreal and Legalette.</p>
                     <p>When we deliberately conſider all the obſtacles in the execution, and the difficulties we ſhall find in preparing the vaſt magazines required, which have been already enumerated, if within the compaſs of our reſources, we ſhall be led to think it not very improbable that this body may be unable to penetrate Canada, at leaſt in time to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:029737_0669_0FE29DDB0B02B5D8"/>
operate with the French troops, if a co-operation ſhould be neceſſary. The ſituation of theſe troops then would be delicate and dangerous:—expoſed to a defeat from the united force of the enemy, in great danger of having their retreat cut off by a ſuperior naval force in the river, they would have every thing to fear. On the other hand, if our operations ſhould be as ſucceſsful as we may flatter ourſelves, a tempeſt or a Britiſh fleet may deprive us of the expected aid; and at a critical moment we may find ourſelves in the boſom of an enemy's country, obliged to combat their whole force with one inferior and reduced by a tedious and waſting march. The five thouſand men, when they arrived in Canada, would probably little exceed four capable of ſervice; and would be ſtill leſs, if out of them we ſhould eſtabliſh poſts as we advanced, to inſure a retreat and protect eſcorts of proviſion which muſt follow for future ſupport. Thus an accident in either caſe would involve the defeat of the whole project; and the cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe might be attended with the moſt unhappy conſequences to America.</p>
                     <p>The plan propoſed appears to me not only too extenſive and beyond our abilities, but too complex. To ſucceed, it requires ſuch a fortunate coincidence of circumſtances as could hardly be hoped, and cannot be relied on;—the departure of the enemy from theſe States, without which we cannot furniſh the ſtipulated force, or ſupplies to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them,—ſuch a want of power or want of foreſight in the enemy as will oblige them to neglect the reinforcement of Halifax and of Canada, and prevent them, however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently ſituated, from diſputing the paſſage of the four ſhips of the line and four frigates up the river St. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or attempting their deſtruction afterwards,—ſuch a combination of favourable incidents as will enable ſeveral bodies acting ſeparately and independently by ſea and land, and from different countries, to conform to times and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods ſo as to inſure a co-operation;—theſe and many other circumſtances muſt conſpire, to give ſucceſs to the enterpriſe.</p>
                     <p>Congreſs, I am perſuaded, had powerful reaſons for fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the convoy at the number they have: and their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior information reſpecting the affairs of Europe at this
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:029737_0670_0FE29D7B9C27EA90"/>
juncture enables them to judge much better than I can pretend to do, of its ſufficiency. But, from the imperfect view I have of the matter, I have been led, in conſidering the ſubject, to look upon it as inſufficient. From the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral tenor of intelligence, the Engliſh out-number the French in the channel: in America, both on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and in the iſlands, they are greatly ſuperior. If the the laſt Toulon fleet is employed in the Mediterranean, the French may have the ſuperiority there: but, upon the whole, the balance of naval force ſeems hitherto to be on the ſide of the Engliſh. If we add to this that the number of ſhips of war in the French ports, built or building, bears no compariſon to the number in the Engliſh ports, and that Britain, notwithſtanding the diminution ſhe has ſuffered, is ſtill a kingdom of great maritime reſources,—we ſhall be diſpoſed to conclude that the preponderance is too like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to continue where it is. The interpoſition of Spain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed would make a very intereſting change: but her back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs heretofore ſeems to be an argument that ſhe is withheld from interfering by ſome weighty political mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: and how long theſe may continue to reſtrain her, is a queſtion I am unqualified to determine.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe general objections to the plan which have been ſtated, there appear to me to be ſome particular ones which I ſhall take the liberty to point out.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place I obſerve there are to be five thouſand militia employed in the two expeditions againſt Detroit and Niagara. The drawing into ſervice ſo large a number compoſed chiefly of huſbandmen, in addition to what may be found neceſſary for other exigencies on the coaſt at ſo intereſting a ſeaſon of the year, will certainly be very inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the culture of our lands, and muſt tend to add to the deficiency of ſupplies. But this, though not to be overlooked, is not the principal objection. In the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition againſt Detroit, militia perhaps may anſwer, as it is not a poſt of very great ſtrength, and may poſſibly be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, on or in a little time after the approach of a force that cannot be oppoſed in the field, and the garriſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to reinforce that of Niagara. But even here troops of another kind would be far preferable. However, the caſe will be very different with reſpect to this laſt:—it is,
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:029737_0671_0FE29DDC8EAAAF38"/>
as I have before mentioned, one of the ſtrongeſt fortreſſes of America, and demands for its reduction the very beſt of troops. Militia have neither patience nor perſeverance for a ſiege. This has been demonſtrated by all the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience we have had. An attempt to carry on one which ſhould materially depend on them would be liable to be fruſtrated by their inconſtancy in the moſt critical moments. Agreeable to the plan under conſideration, three thouſand five hundred out of five thouſand ſix hundred are to be militia.</p>
                     <p>It is a part of the plan that the troops ſent againſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troit, whether ſucceſsful or not, are to form a junction with thoſe at Niagara. It appears to me on the contrary, that the expedition againſt Detroit, under the preſent arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt ſtand on its own bottom, and have no other object than the reducing that place and deſtroying the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Indian ſettlements. Lake Erie is certainly occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by two armed veſſels of ſixteen and eighteen guns, and, it is ſaid, by five or ſix others of ſmaller ſize, having two, three, or four guns each, which, while the enemy hold Niagara, will prevent the communication of our troops by way of the lake,—to ſay nothing of the want of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaux for tranſportation. A communication by land muſt be performed through an extent of more than four hundred miles, and a great part of this at leaſt under many diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of route, and through tribes of hoſtile Indians.</p>
                     <p>My knowledge of the country is not ſufficiently accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to enable me to diſcover the reaſons which determined Congreſs to divide the force deſtined againſt Niagara, and to appoint the march of one body from Ononguaga to that place. It ſeems to me however that this diſpoſition might be ſubject to one great inconvenience, which is, that, if each column be not ſuperior to the whole collective force of the enemy, they riſk being beaten ſeparately and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, beſides the trouble and expenſe of preparing as it were for two expeditions inſtead of one,—of opening two roads inſtead of one,—and the uncertainty of a co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (if no diſaſter ſhould happen to either) at the moment when it might be neceſſary. The inquiries I have as yet had it in my power to make are oppoſed to the practicabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of conveying cannon in the route from Ononguaga to
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:029737_0672_0FE29D7D1F475AD0"/>
Niagara, or at leaſt place it as a point infinitely doubtful: and, without cannon, nothing can be effected againſt that poſt. Upon the whole, the great matter eſſential to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs againſt Niagara is to ſubdue the enemy's force on lakes Erie and Ontario, particularly the latter. This once done, and the garriſon by that means cut off from its ſupplies, the fort will be likely to fall an eaſy prey. Here our ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts ſhould be directed: nor do I at preſent perceive the purpoſes to be anſwered by the body going from Onon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guaga, unleſs the devaſtation of the intermediate Indian villages be the object,—which perhaps may not be equal to the riſk, labour and expenſe, and the more ſo as they would fall of courſe if we ſhould ſucceed in the general operation.</p>
                     <p>The cantoning five thouſand troops this winter or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut-river, under our preſent proſpects, will in my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion be impracticable, and, in any caſe, unadviſeable. When I had the honour of writing to Congreſs in September laſt on the ſubject of a winter campaign into Canada, I had been led by [<hi>colonel</hi>] Bailey, and other gentlemen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the country, to expect that very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble magazines of proviſions might be laid up on the upper parts of that river. But it appears on experiment that their zeal for the expedition made them too ſanguine in the matter. The purchaſes fall far, very far ſhort of what was expected. The difficulties of tranſportation, as rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſented by the quarter-maſters and commiſſaries, ſupported by facts that ſpeak for themſelves, are ſo great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated that I ſhould have no hope of being able, from remote parts of the continent, to throw in the quantity requiſite for ſubſiſting theſe troops during the winter, and at the ſame time of forming the magazines which would be neceſſary to proſecute the expedition in ſpring. We may be endeavouring to form the magazines: but the troops cannot be on the ſpot this winter; otherwiſe they will exhauſt the proviſion as faſt as it can be collected. The ſame objection applies to the ſtationing of troops on the Mohawk-river.</p>
                     <p>In eſtimating our force for the next campaign, it is to be conſidered that upwards of four thouſand of the preſent army will have completed their term of ſervice by the laſt
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:029737_0673_0FE29DE49C006D30"/>
of May next, and that a great proportion of the remainder will have done the ſame about the cloſe of the enſuing fall, unleſs they can be induced to re-engage,—of which the ill ſucceſs of our preſent exertions to enliſt thoſe whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements are about to expire affords but an unfavourable proſpect. This and the general temper of the officers, diſſatisfied much with their ſituation, will ſuggeſt a ſtrong argument againſt the extenſive projects in contemplation.</p>
                     <p>In whatever point of light the ſubject is placed, our abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to perform our part of the contract appears to me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely too doubtful and precarious to juſtify the undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A failure, as I have already obſerved, would involve conſequences too delicate and diſagreeable to be hazarded. But, at the ſame time that my judgment is againſt this, I am clearly of opinion that we ſhould attempt every thing that our circumſtances will permit: but, as the extent of our power muſt be regulated by many poſſible events, I would wiſh to hold ourſelves free to act according to either poſſibility, and as a clearer view of our future reſources may authorize. If the enemy entirely leave theſe States, it will produce a vaſt change in our affairs; and new proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects may open, of which we can at preſent have but a very imperfect idea. It would be a great ſtep towards raiſing the value of our money, which would give a new ſpring to our military operations. We may be able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake much more than we can now foreſee.</p>
                     <p>If the enemy attempt to keep poſts in theſe States, a primary object will be to expel them, if in our power: If not, we muſt make proper proviſion to bar their depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and muſt turn our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>tention to the ſecurity of our frontiers, by purſuing ſuch meaſures as ſhall be within the reach of our abilities. Though we may not be able to launch into ſo wide a field as we could wiſh, ſomething upon a more partial ſcale may be enterpriſed. Detroit and Niagara may perhaps be reduced, though Canada may not be an acceſſion to the confederacy. With a view to what is poſſible, preparations may be going on, and we can make ſuch an application of them as we ſhall find practicable.</p>
                     <p>As there is no time to be loſt in doing this, I ſhall give the neceſſary orders ſo far as relates to the article of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,

which indeed has been already done in part. Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azines of forage, materials for boat and ſhip building, and other articles, muſt alſo be provided,—which will depend on the final arrangements and more definitive inſtructions of Congreſs. Theſe meaſures will be neceſſary to be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, whether the preſent plan is carried on, or whether ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs extenſive, depending wholly on ourſelves, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in its place.

The ſucceſs the baron had in the beginning, and the benefits derived from it, make me regret the obſtacles that have ſo long ſuſpended his exertions; and I ſhould wiſh he may have it in his power to reſume them on principles moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancive of the ſervice. On theſe I have already fully communicated my ideas, and it is unneceſſary I ſhould add.</p>

                     <p>I DO myſelf the honour to tranſmit you the copy of a letter of the tenth inſtant, which I received yeſterday from Sir Henry Clinton, on the ſubject of exchanging the priſoners of the convention. Should the propoſition be agreeable to Congreſs, I ſhall be glad to receive powers to enter into a negociation as ſoon as poſſible, as it may probably relieve our officers upon parole from the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neceſſity of returning to New-York. I will juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that, ſhould an exchange take place upon the terms propoſed by Sir Henry, I ſhould ſuppoſe we ſhall not be obliged to give up any conſiderable number of privates by way of compoſition, as the officers of the convention (ſhould the whole be ſuffered to be exchanged) would go a great way towards liberating ours at preſent in the hands of the enemy. But it cannot be expected that they will leave their troops entirely deſtitute of officers. Mr. commiſſary Clark, mentioned by Sir Henry Clinton, was permitted by general Heath to go from Boſton to New-York to ſettle

                     <p>I HAD the honour to receive your favour of the ſixth yeſterday, with the incloſed copy of a letter from the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ident of the council of New-Jerſey, relative to an expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed attack upon the weſtern frontier of that State. I have juſt received a letter from general Hand giving intelligence of an attack upon colonel Alden's regiment at Cherry-Valley, effected by ſurpriſe, in conſequence of which, there is too much reaſon to apprehend that regiment may fall a ſacrifice. I tranſmit a copy of the diſpatches announcing this diſagreeable affair.</p>
                     <p>Theſe depredations of the enemy give me the moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous concern. I lament that we have not yet had it in our power to give them an effectual check. I am perfectly convinced that the only certain way of preventing Indian ravages is to carry the war vigorouſly into their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But as this is thought impracticable at this late ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year from the ſtate of the water, and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, I fear we muſt content ourſelves with defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive precautions for the preſent. I have already informed Congreſs that colonel Cortlandt's regiment had marched towards the Miniſinks: but, having ſince directed count Pulaſki to proceed with his corps to Colesfort in that neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, colonel Cortlandt will take poſt ſomewhere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that place and Rocheſter. Orders are now given to colonel Spencer's regiment and colonel Armand's corps to join general Pulaſki. This diſpoſition is agreeable to the opinion of governor Clinton and other gentlemen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the country whom I have conſulted, and is calculated to cover the eaſtern frontier of Pennſylvania, New-Jerſey, and the weſtern part of New-York. I ſhall alſo immediately ſend the remainder of general Clinton's brigade to Albany. When arrived there, if any thing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive can poſſibly be undertaken, it ſhall be done: if not, they will be diſpoſed of in a manner that ſhall ſeem beſt adapted for protection and defence.

Wheelock who is the lieutenant colonel, to which I beg leave to refer Congreſs, and according to other information I have received, was at firſt aſſembled under the direction of major-general Gates about this time twelvemonth for the purpoſe of a ſudden enterpriſe againſt St. John's, and the enemy's armed veſſels lying there, and was engaged till the laſt of March.</p>
                     <p>I cannot undertake to ſay in what manner or how uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully this regiment has been employed, or to what extent in point of men. But Mr. Wheelock ſays it has been of great ſervice: and the object of his preſent journey is to obtain the direction of Congreſs for their being paid when proper rolls are produced, and their determination whether it is to be diſbanded now, or continued till April next, the period for which the men are ſaid to have engaged, though the marquis's recommendation extended only to the end of the preſent campaign.</p>
                     <p>The regiment may or may not be neceſſary in future. Much will depend on the ſyſtem of conduct the enemy purſue the next campaign, and on our own operations.

                     <p>In my letter of the ſixteenth I communicated to your excellency the attempt on Fort Alden by the ſavages. I have ſince received the incloſed diſpatches confirming that
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:029737_0680_0FE29D8CA51B2158"/>
diſagreeable account. I alſo informed Congreſs at the ſame time of the ſteps which were taken for the ſecurity of the frontier of Pennſylvania, New-Jerſey, and the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern part of New-York,—and that the two remaining reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iments of general Clinton's brigade were ordered to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany.</p>
                     <p>I have to regret that the condition of affairs is ſuch as does not admit of a compliance with repeated detachments from this army. However, that every thing poſſible might be done under our preſent circumſtances, general Hand was further inſtructed on the ſixteenth inſtant to confer with general Schuyler at Albany, and with thoſe perſons in that part of the country who could in any manner aſſiſt in forming his judgment on the beſt meaſures to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with the troops which were employed in the ſeveral quarters: and yeſterday I changed his command to that of the Miniſinks, and forwarded him an extract from colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Hartley's letter of the ninth, that he might accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date his diſpoſitions to recent events. I have only to add on this ſubject, that, on the twentieth, brigadier-general Clinton ſet out to take the command at Albany, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to conſult with general Hand, and to form with him ſuch combined arrangements as may appear moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their united ſtrength.</p>

                     <p>YOUR excellency's letter of the eighteenth, with the incloſure referred to, came to hand yeſterday. I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore received the intelligence contained in Mr. Deane's letter, and in conſequence made part of the detachments which have been mentioned in my late letters. It is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable that the late incurſions and outrages were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the parties comprehended in Mr. Deane's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence; and I ſhould hope that the force already gone from the army, together with the ſeaſon, will prevent them at leaſt from making further great depredations.</p>
                     <p>Since I had the honour of addreſſing your excellency on the twenty-firſt, I received a letter from general Hand, of the eighteenth, an extract from which you will find incloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with copies of a letter from major Whiting and one from a Mr. Clyde. Theſe will inform Congreſs, that though the ravages at the Cherry-Valley ſettlement were great in the late attack by the ſavages, yet our loſs was much leſs than we had reaſon to apprehend it from our former advices. The account of the enemy's having ſtormed the fort, and cut off Alden's regiment, happily turns out premature. The incloſure, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2, which is a copy of a letter from lord Stirling, of the ſeventeenth, will adviſe Congreſs that the fleet of tranſports, which had lain at the Hook for ſome days before, came up the preceding night to the watering-place, and alſo that ſome of the ſhips of wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Your excellency will alſo ſee by the incloſure, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 3, (which contains an extract, from a letter from general Sullivan, of the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth inſtant) the lateſt advices I have reſpecting admiral Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>November</hi> 24. I juſt received from general Hand the incloſed petition from major Whitcomb, addreſſed to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and his letter to general Hand, of the ſame date.
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:029737_0682_0FE29D966ED8F738"/>
My information reſpecting the corps under major Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb's command has hitherto been very imperfect; and even now I do not know the terms on which it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged: nor had I, till theſe letters came to hand, any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think that the troops above had not all been equally paid,—having ſent up a ſupply of money for the purpoſe ſoon after I came to this camp, and authorized the pay-maſter-general a few days ago to forward a further quantity. I ſhall immediately write to general Clinton, now on his way to Albany, to ſend a proper officer to muſter the corps, and alſo three companies (which he calls provincials) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his direction, ſaid to be engaged to the firſt of next month;—after which, both will be paid on his preſenting proper rolls. With reſpect to clothing, the only applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I recollect to have had from major Whitcomb was anſwered with ſuch ſupplies, both in quantity and quality, as our ſtores at the time would admit of. It may perhaps be practicable hereafter to put his corps on a better footing in this inſtance.</p>
                     <p>The alarm which major Whitcomb ſpeaks of in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his letter to general Hand was occaſioned (as Congreſs will perceive by a copy of another letter from him to general Hand) by a deſcent made by a body of the enemy in the country about the ſouth end of Lake Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and who, according to his report, have done conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable damage.</p>
                     <p>I directed general Du Portail ſome time ago to take a view of the works carrying on in the Highlands for the defence of the North-river, and to make an eſtimate of the cannon neceſſary for the purpoſe. This he did; and, as he is now at Philadelphia, I have written to him by this conveyance, and requeſted him to preſent the eſtimate to Congreſs. I am ſorry the number wanted is ſo great, and the more ſo as I find upon inquiry that the Saliſbury fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace in Connecticut, which uſed to caſt ſo many, is much out of repair, and could not poſſibly be put in order, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We muſt in the courſe of things have occaſion for a great deal of artillery: and, in any enterpriſe we may undertake againſt Canada, whether on a large or a ſmall ſcale, ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al pieces of various calibers will be abſolutely eſſential.

                     <p>A detachment of continental troops will conduct thoſe of the convention from the North-river to the Delaware. The German battalion is to compoſe part of the eſcort: and, after the convention troops croſs to Pennſylvania, I have directed it, in conſequence of the intelligence tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of late by Congreſs reſpecting the frontiers, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Eaſton with all its baggage, where it is to wait till general Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At the ſame time, if theſe frequent detachments from the army could be avoided, it were much to be wiſhed. The troops will be by this means in a very diſperſed ſtate; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides loſing perhaps ſome advantages which might preſent themſelves if they were more collected, their diſcipline will be greatly injured, and it will be extremely difficult, from a variety of cauſes, to draw them together again: and, if it ſhould be practicable, it is highly probable we ſhall find their number much impaired by deſertion and otherwiſe.</p>

                     <p>MR. John Dodge will have the honour of delivering this letter to your excellency. His hiſtory is that he is a native of Connecticut, and about eight years ago, as he informs me, ſettled in the country between Detroit and Pittſburg as an Indian trader;—that he carried on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce till January 1776, when, for his attachment to our cauſe and the meaſures he had taken to promote it, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obnoxious to the enemy, was ſeized by order of the governor of Detroit, was thrown into priſon, and there continued till the beginning of May laſt, when he was ſent to Quebec;—that on the ninth of October he eſcaped
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:029737_0684_0FE29D99880C1EA0"/>
from thence and got into our ſettlements, through the aid of a French Caghnewaga who came with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here on Friday laſt.</p>
                     <p>I find Mr. Dodge an intelligent young man, intimately acquainted with all the tract of country between Pittſburg and Detroit, and with that lying on Lake Erie, alſo with moſt of the ſavage tribes in thoſe parts, and with their languages. He is likewiſe well acquainted with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication from Fort Stanwix to Oſwego and Niagara.</p>
                     <p>I believe Mr. Dodge's hiſtory to be true; and, from a variety of circumſtances, I am perſuaded of his firm at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to us: and I would take the liberty to ſuggeſt to Congreſs that I think he may be of very important ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to us in any enterpriſe we may undertake in the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern quarter, or againſt the force on Lake Erie or Lake Ontario. This conſideration, with that of his loſſes and ſuffering<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> which I am inclined to believe have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, ſeem to make him worthy of notice and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His information is good and clear in ſeveral points which I know myſelf, and in many others, (from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which he delivered it) far ſuperior and much more ſatisfactory than what I have been able to derive from any other perſon. As I have obſerved before, Mr. Dodge ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me a valuable intelligencer; and, if Congreſs are pleaſed to honour him with an opportunity, he will give them an account of the poſts of Detroit and Niagara when he left them, and of that at Michilimachinac,—of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's naval force on lakes Erie and Ontario, and of ſuch other matters in Canada as he was able to inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of, either by his own obſervation or the relation of others.</p>
                     <p>General Gates ſupplied Mr. Dodge with ſome money to defray his expenſes from Boſton to this place, and I have advanced him to-day a hundred and fifty dollars more to carry him to Philadelphia.</p>

<pb n="347" facs="unknown:029737_0685_0FE29DFBB5A04580"/>

                     <p>I WAS yeſterday honoured with your favour of the twentieth, with its ſeveral incloſures. Congreſs will be pleaſed to accept my acknowledgments for the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the treaties between his moſt Chriſtian majeſty and the United States. The reſolve reſpecting the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of priſoners has been tranſmitted to Sir Henry Clinton, and I have appointed commiſſioners (if he thinks proper) to meet his at Amboy the ſeventh of next month.</p>
                     <p>I have the pleaſure to inform Congreſs that the whole army (one brigade and the light corps excepted) is now in motion to the places of their reſpective cantonments for winter-quarters. I have thought it prudent to delay this event a while, to give time for the convention troops to make ſome progreſs in croſſing the North-river, to prevent a poſſibility of accident. The third diviſion paſſes this day; and, if no unexpected interruption happens, the whole will be over, the thirtieth inſtant. When their paſſage is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, the remaining troops kept in the field will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately retire to quarters.</p>
                     <p>The diſpoſition for winter-quarters is as follows.—Nine brigades will be ſtationed on the weſt ſide of Hudſon's river, excluſive of the garriſon at Weſt-Point,—one of which (the North-Carolina brigade) will be near Smith's Clove for the ſecurity of that paſs, and as a reinforcement to Weſt-Point in caſe of neceſſity; another (the Jerſey brigade) will be at Elizabethtown, to cover the lower part of Jerſey; and the other ſeven, conſiſting of the Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennſylvania troops, will be at Middlebrook. Six brigades will be left on the eaſt ſide of the river and at Weſt-Point;—three of which (of the Maſſachuſetts troops) will be ſtationed for the immediate defence of the Highlands; one at Weſt-Point in addition to the garriſon already there; and the other two at Fiſh-kill and the Continental Village. The remaining three brigades, compoſed of the New-Hampſhire and Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut troops, and Hazen's regiment, will be poſted in the
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:029737_0686_0FE29D9B134C6248"/>
vicinity of Danbury, for the protection of the country ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the Sound, to cover our magazines lying on Connecticut-river, and to aid the Highlands on any ſerious movement of the enemy that way. The park of artillery will be at Pluckemin. The cavalry will be diſpoſed of thus:—Bland's regiment at Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cheſter in Virginia, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor's at Frederic or Hagarſtown in Maryland, Moylan's at Lancaſter in Pennſylvania, and Sheldon's at Durham in Connecticut. Lee's corps will be with that part of the army which is in the Jerſeys acting on the advanced poſts. This comprehends the general diſtribution of the army, except Clinton's brigade of New-York troops, Pulaſki's corps, and ſome detached regiments and corps ſtationed at Albany and at different parts of the frontier, of which Congreſs have already been particularly adviſed. General Putnam will command at Danbury, General M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dougal in the Highlands, and my own quarters will be in the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys, in the neighbourhood of Middlebrook.</p>
                     <p>This diſpoſition appeared to me beſt calculated to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate as far as poſſible theſe ſeveral objects,—the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the country, the ſecurity of the important poſts in the Highlands, the ſafety, diſcipline, and eaſy ſubſiſtence of the army. To have kept the troops in a collected ſtate would have increaſed infinitely the expenſe and difficulty of ſubſiſting them, both with reſpect to forage and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: to have divided them into ſmaller cantonments would have made it far leſs practicable to maintain order and diſcipline among them, and would have put them leſs in a condition to control and prevent offenſive operations on the ſide of the enemy, or to aſſemble to take advantage of any favourable opening which their future ſituation may offer, ſhould they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> weaken themſelves by further detachments ſo far as to invite an enterpriſe againſt them.</p>
                     <p>By the eſtimate of the quarter-maſter and commiſſary-general, it appears indiſpenſable to have the principal part of the army on the other ſide of the North-river. It was thought impracticable to furniſh the neceſſary ſupplies of flour for the whole, on this ſide the river, from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe difficulty and expenſe of tranſportation in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeaſon, and from the exhauſted ſtate of the country with reſpect to forage. As this ſubject has been already
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:029737_0687_0FE29DFD39593A88"/>
fully before Congreſs, I ſhall not trouble them with a rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ition of the detail. In order as much as poſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the demand of forage and facilitate the ſupplies, I have given directions, when the ſeveral diviſions arrive at their cantonments, to ſend away to convenient places at a diſtance from them all the horſes not abſolutely requiſite to carry on the ordinary buſineſs of the army.</p>
                     <p>It is unneceſſary to add that the troops muſt again have recourſe to the expedient of hutting as they did laſt year. But, as they are now well clad, and we have had more leiſure to make ſome little preparations for winter-quarters, I hope they will be in a more comfortable ſituation than they were in the preceding winter. With the higheſt reſpect and eſteem, I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>BETWEEN Fredericſburg and this place where I arrived yeſterday afternoon, I had the honour to receive your excellency's ſeveral favours of the twenty-ſixth, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeventh, and twenty-eighth, in due order, with their ſeveral incloſures, which ſhall have my attention. My being on the road from the time of their coming to hand till yeſterday prevented me from acknowledging them before.</p>
                     <p>As many inconveniences would attend the removing of the ſick officers and men of the convention troops by land, and the officers having families, I have written to general Gates to permit them to proceed to the falls of James's-river by water, on the officers' giving their paroles that they and the men will perform the voyage. I have alſo acquainted him of the meeting in contemplation for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of priſoners, that the officers may not leave Boſton till the reſult is known.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to major De Paſſern of the regiment of Heſſe-Hanau, I hope he may be releaſed by an exchange; after which, it will remain with him to obtain liberty from Sir Henry Clinton to return to Europe. But if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change in agitation ſhould not take place, I ſhould be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py if Congreſs themſelves would decide whether he is to be allowed his requeſt. If on my permiſſion he ſhould go to Europe without application to and the conſent of the

                     <p>I HAVE the honour to addreſs you by command of his excellency, who went from this place at four o'clock this morning, in conſequence of advice received laſt night that fifty-two veſſels great and ſmall, including a bomb-ketch, with troops on board, had, the day before yeſterday, moved up the North-river as far as Cloyſter-landing, and yeſterday morning got under way and were proceeding far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up. He propoſed to make his firſt ſtage at Acquake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunk, and to proceed as his future intelligence might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. He is much at a loſs to determine the deſign of the enemy, but thinks it may either have reſpect to the forts in the Highlands or to the convention troops.</p>
                     <p>When he left Peekſkill, the two Maſſachuſetts brigades, on their march thither from Hartford, were not arrived, ſo that the troops on the ſpot were only the original garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Weſt-Point, and Nixon's brigade which lay near the Continental Village: but, without the moſt inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble delay, thoſe muſt have reached their deſtination ſome days ſince. If ſo, and the enemy ſhould meditate a ſtroke againſt Weſt-Point, they will probably fail in it unleſs there ſhould be ſomething like a ſurpriſe. The general alſo thinks it probable that the Maryland diviſion were yeſterday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Clove. Their inſtructions were, to communicate with Weſt-Point and reinforce it on any emergency. They were, in addition to them, directed laſt night by expreſs to move immediately towards the forts, diveſted of baggage and artillery, for the more ſpeedy communication. The Carolina brigade has been ſome time ſtationed at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Clove.</p>
                     <p>One brigade of the Virginia troops is at Pompton, and the other two were expected to reach Springfield yeſterday. The Pennſylvania troops, it is ſuppoſed, would be at Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakenunk or in the neighbourhood of Paramus. Theſe troops, immediately on receiving the preſent intelligence,
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:029737_0689_0FE29E17EC297738"/>
were ordered to halt; and his excellency is gone forward to regulate their movements according to circumſtances. The brigade in this town is ordered to hold itſelf in readineſs.</p>
                     <p>If the convention troops ſhould be their object, it is prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the attempt will be too late to anſwer any purpoſe: the rear diviſion was to croſs the North-river on Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt, but muſt certainly have done it on Thurſday; the front muſt be not far from the Delaware; and the whole too far advanced to be ſubject to a reſcue. Added to this, there is a pretty ſtrong guard with each diviſion. His excellency however has ſent on the intelligence to colonel Bland who directs their march, urging him to haſten them forward with all poſſible diſpatch.</p>
                     <p>One brigade of Connecticut troops was at Danbury, the other at Fredericſburg, when we came away; and general Poor's was in full march for the former, and muſt long ſince have arrived.</p>

                     <p>I HAD the honour of receiving yours of the ſecond at this place. I have forwarded the brevet to captain Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monet; and ſhall take ſuch meaſures in regard to colonel Fleury's letter as ſhall ſeem proper, upon my arrival at Middlebrook for which I ſet out again to-morrow.</p>
                     <p>Upon leaving Elizabethtown I directed colonel Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to inform you of the intelligence I had received, and which I thought demanded my perſonal attention, as the enemy appeared to be going up the river in conſiderable force. Having put the troops deſtined for the Middlebrook cantonment upon their march back towards the North-riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I was proceeding that way myſelf when an expreſs met me a few miles beyond this, informing me that the enemy's ſhipping, which had been as high as King's ferry, had fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en down again. They landed a party at the ferry, and ſet fire to a few ſmall buildings near the water; but, upon a party of ours advancing, they immediately [<hi>re-embarked</hi>] without attempting any thing further. The boats and ſtores of every kind had been previouſly ſecured. I cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:029737_0690_0FE29E0A200BBC40"/>
for this manoeuvre but by ſuppoſing that they had been miſ-informed as to the quantity of ſtores at the ferry, or that they expected to find the poſts in a defenceleſs ſituation; or it may perhaps have been to favour a forage below.</p>
                     <p>Finding that the troops deſtined for the defence of the Highlands had arrived at their reſpective poſts agreeably to my orders and expectations, I have again put thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for Middlebrook into motion; and I hope they will arrive there while the roads and weather are both fine.</p>
                     <p>Accounts from New-York through a good channel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me that thirty thouſand tons of ſhipping had been ſuddenly taken up for government ſervice, and that a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral embargo is laid. The occaſion has not yet tranſpired; at leaſt it has not yet reached me.</p>

                     <p>IT has not been in my power to return an anſwer to your favour of the ſixth inſtant till now. The letter met me on the road, ſeparated from my papers; and I did not reach this place till late on the eleventh, ſince which I have been much employed in attending to the diſpoſitions for hutting the army; but in the mean time the objects of the diſpatch have engaged my utmoſt attention.</p>

The earneſt deſire I have to pay the ſtricteſt compliance in every inſtance with the views and inſtructions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs cannot but make me feel the greateſt uneaſineſs when I find myſelf in circumſtances of heſitation or doubt with reſpect to their directions. But the perfect confidence I have in the juſtice and candour of that honourable body emboldens me to communicate without reſerve the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which occur in the execution of their preſent order; and the indulgence I have experienced on every former occaſion induces me to imagine that the liberty I now take will not meet with their diſapprobation.</p>
                     <p>I have attentively taken up the report of the committee of the fifth (approved by Congreſs) on the ſubject of my letter of the eleventh ultimo on the propoſed expedition into Canada: I have conſidered it in ſeveral lights, and ſincerely regret that I ſhould feel myſelf under any embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment in carrying it into execution: Still I remain of opinion, from a general review of things and the ſtate of our reſources, that no extenſive ſyſtem of co-operation with the French, for the complete emancipation of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, can be poſitively decided on for the enſuing year. To propoſe a plan of perfect co-operation with a foreign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without a moral certainty in our ſupplies, and to have that plan actually ratified with the court of Verſailles, might be attended, in caſe of failure in the conditions on our part, with very fatal effects.</p>
                     <p>If I ſhould ſeem unwilling to tranſmit the plan as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by Congreſs, with my obſervations, it is becauſe I find myſelf under a neceſſity (in order to give our miniſter ſufficient ground to found an application on) to propoſe ſomething more than a vague and indeciſive plan, which, even in the event of a total evacuation of theſe States by the enemy, may be rendered impracticable in the execution by a variety of inſurmountable obſtacles: or if I retain my preſent ſentiments and act conſiſtently, I muſt point out the difficulties as they appear to me; which muſt embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs his negociations, and may diſappoint the views of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
                     <p>But, proceeding on the idea of the enemy's leaving theſe States before the active part of the enſuing campaign, I ſhould fear to hazard a miſtake as to the preciſe aim and extent of the views of Congreſs. The line of conduct

                        </gap> of France does not appear ſufficiently delineated:—were I to undertake it, I ſhould be much afraid of erring through miſconception. In this dilemma I would eſteem it a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular favour to be excuſed from writing at all on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, eſpecially as it is the part of candour in me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that I do not ſee my way clear enough to point out ſuch a plan for co-operation as I conceive to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the ideas of Congreſs, and that will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently explanatory with reſpect to time and circumſtances, to give efficacy to the meaſure. But if Congreſs ſtill think it neceſſary for me to proceed in the buſineſs, I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt their more definitive and explicit inſtructions, and that they will permit me, previous to tranſmitting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended diſpatches, to ſubmit them to their determination.</p>
                     <p>I could wiſh to lay before Congreſs more minutely the ſtate of the army, the condition of our ſupplies, and the requiſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>s neceſſary for carrying into execution an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking that may involve the moſt ſerious events. If Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs think this can be done more ſatisfactorily in a perſonal conference, I hope to have the army in ſuch a ſituation before I can receive their anſwer, as to afford me an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of giving my attendance. I would only add that I ſhall cheerfully comply with the directions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs relative to making every preparation in our power for an expedition againſt Niagara, and for ſuch further opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the northward as time and circumſtances ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to carry on. Meaſures for the purpoſe have been taken in part for ſome time paſt; and I ſhall purſue them vigorouſly. The ſubject has long engaged my contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I am thoroughly convinced of the expediency and policy of doing every thing practicable on our part, for giving ſecurity to our frontiers by the reduction of thoſe places which facilitate annoying them, and even for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing the annexation of Canada to the Union.</p>

But if Congreſs ſhould differ from me in opinion on this point, I ſhall be happy to be informed, that meaſures may be purſued for his recal.</p>

                     <p>I HAD the honour of addreſſing Congreſs ſome time ſince on the ſubject of general Du Portail and the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with him. He informs me that his affair has not yet been decided, and is extremely anxious that it ſhould be in ſome way or other. He aſſigns many powerful reaſons to ſhew that it is very intereſting to him (if he is not to continue in our ſervice) to return to France as ſpeedily as poſſible. He alſo informs me that he has reaſon to think, in the conſideration of his affair, the retaining him in ſervice and the adopting the plan propoſed in his memoir are unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the deciſion of the one ſuſpended on that of the other; and has therefore requeſted me to repreſent to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs that he ſhould be happy if they could be conſidered ſeparately; and if his ſervices, abſtractedly from the project propoſed by him, are deemed neceſſary, it will be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him to remain in the country.</p>
                     <p>I have already taken the liberty to offer my ſentiments on the propriety of engaging theſe gentlemen to continue in the ſervice. It really appears to me that they will be eſſentially neceſſary to our future operations, whether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive or offenſive; and it cannot therefore but give me pleaſure if it ſhall be conſiſtent with the views of Congreſs to retain them, and to give every encouragement which they may reaſonably expect.</p>
