            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Honoured SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have not taken Notice of ſome Paragraphs, as if I affected Contention; but am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſet things in a true light, that you may know where we differ in Judgment.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>One great thing urged againſt this Practice is, that it is not lawful</hi> Sir, it is the great Scruple with me; and ſolve this with a <hi>Thus faith the Lord,</hi> and all other Objections will fall; which till you do, ſuffer me to diſſent from you in Judgment, tho' not in Affection.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>To make my ſelf ſick in ſuch a way as may probably ſerve my Health, and ſave my Life, and with ſuch a deſign, is certainly fitting and reaſonable, and therefore lawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> I deny it to be fitting or reaſonable, becauſe 'tis a going out of God's Way, inaſmuch as 'tis not contained in the Law of Phyſick, either natural or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore unlawful.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſay, <hi>There is the Fuel of this Distemper in my Body, and it only wants the Spark to ſet this Fuel a burning; Why may I not let it in by Inciſion, when it may be eaſier, and of leſs Danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Becauſe its not God's way, but its a mixing of humane Inventions with the Rules of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002407_0005_0FDB3C0DC07E6378"/>
Lev. 10. 1. <hi>And Nadab and Abihu took either of them their Cenſers, and put Fire therein, and put In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe thereon, and offered ſtrange Fire before the Lord, which be commanded them not.</hi> Now an Action muſt be right with reſpect to the Method of doing it, as well as with reſpect to the end or event, or it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds not with the Sixth Commandment, but is a breaking of all the Law and Commandments. Now to propoſe to do ſomething in Obedience to one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, which does Violence unto the reſt, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be allowed to be the keeping of that.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſay, <hi>In this way we receive it in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way;</hi> (which I deny, for it is Anti-natural,) <hi>and if we receive it in either way, it is ſtill the Work of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> I diſtinguiſh between the Works of God, as they are good or evil. Now the Work of God may be conſider'd good, as he wills it, and by his Power effects it; but as Actions may be conſider'd evil, ſo he willingly permits it.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſay, <hi>What is there of the Hand or Power of Man in this Work after the Inciſion is made, and the Matter applyed. Anſwer.</hi> There is the dreſſing of the Inciſion Seven or Eight Days. And Sir, if you think the Patient is under the Hand of God after the Inciſion is made, why cannot you as well let him ſtay till God ſees meet to bring the Diſtemper upon him. You allow that the cutting the Inciſion, and putting the Matter in, is the Hand and Power of Man; which is as much as to ſay, (what I ſhould be loth to ſay) That you ſet your Maker to work, by making the Inciſion for Him; and ſo you make Inoculation part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Hand and Power of Man, and partly in the Hand and Power of God: But I tell you, Sir, the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is entirely humane, as not agreeing with the Law of Phyſick, either natural or divine, and an Intruſion upon the incommunicable Attributes of God, who
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002407_0006_0FDB3C0EF99FFBD0"/>
hath ſaid, <hi>I kill, and I make alive, I wound, and I heal..</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, you ſay, <hi>Should this Town be to ſuffer an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation, from a Righteous God for the Puniſhment of their Sins, would any think it to be a Criminal Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſave their Lives by a Boat or a Plank?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, the Simile I conceive reaches not the Caſe. I diſtinguiſh between a doing what is lawful to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> any Sickneſs that is ſent as a Judgment upon a People, and a voluntary Act of our own in putting forth our Hands to reach the Judgment to our ſelves, that ſo by this Means we may avert the Stroke of Heaven, by turning of it out of the ordinary way of Providence. But now I ſhall ſtate the Caſe of this Similitude, and I think more adapted to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand. Suppoſe the Water ſhould be kept out of this Town by Floodgates, and upon the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of ſome very high Tide, which would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow or break down the Gates, a Man ſhould open the Gates a little ſo as that the Water might come in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to prevent its breaking down the Gates, if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Flood ſhould be greater than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected (as ſometimes in the Caſe of Inoculation) and overflow the Town, if he can have neither Boat nor Plank to ſave his Life, will it not be juſt upon him for his preſumptuous Action? Now God hath as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways to puniſh a People, ſave one (to wit, by the Small Pox, which you ſay is a Bleſſing when receiv'd by Inoculation) as he had before: Therefore prepare to meet thy God, O Zion, (in a way of Duty) and do not go into the Inventions of the Heathen, whom the Lord caſt our before thee.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Is it unlawful to uſe Means for our Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from a deſolating Judgment, eſpecially if at that time God ſhows us a way to eſcape the Severity of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, I ſhall keep evermore the Diſtinction (which is laudable and good) between God's ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002407_0007_0FDB3C1378153D20"/>
us the way of Self-preſervation, and his permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Man to go into his own by-ways, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entered into God's Heart.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſay, <hi>Some object and ſay, Tis originaly from the Devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> (which is too true to make a Jeſt of.) You anſwer, <hi>If it is a Method of Safety, and a Benefit to Mankind, as hitherto it appears to be, how came the Devil to be the Author of it, who is a Murderer from the beginning.</hi> I anſwer, the Devil hath many ways to advance his own Ends, for he is an old Sophiſter, we know. And now, Sir, if I may be ſuffered to ſpeak my own digeſted Thoughts; with grief of Heart I do ſeriouſly believe its a Deluſion of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and that there was never the like Deluſion in New-England, ſince the Time of the Witchcraft at Salem, when ſo many innocent Perſons loſt their Lives, and afterwards ſome of them that were inſtrumental in taking their Lives away, made a Recantation. And that this People may ſee their Error and recant, is the ſole Reaſon of my putting of Pen to Paper and Prayer to the God of Truth, that this People may ſee their Error. Now I will ſhow you how Satan may advance his Intereſt and that in his own old Way, Gen. 3. 1. <hi>And he ſaid unto the Woman. Yea, hath God ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of every Tree in the Garden?</hi> Verſe 4, 5. <hi>And the Serpent ſaid, ye ſhall not ſurely die,</hi> (in this new way.) <hi>For God doth know, that in the Day ye eat thereof, then your Eyes ſhall be opened.</hi> Now Satan had a double end in this; as firſt, The breaking of God's righteous Law; and ſecondly, the eternal Ruin of Mankind; but the Temptation was the Fruit of the Garden, which no queſtion was alluring unto the Senſes, when the Exerciſe of Grace was ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now, Sir, as I humbly conceive, <hi>Inoculation</hi> is the thing propoſed, the brave alluring yellow Apple, which is ſo ſucceſsful in the Event, even Life, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of your Order have ſet forth. But Satan may
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002407_0008_0FDB3C14B55C6298"/>
have another end in it, to wit, the making the Means of Grace unſucceſsful, in bringing the firſt Venders and Abettors, and Promoters of Inoculation, which every Body knows were certain Miniſters of this Town) into Contempt; tho' now ſome of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Miniſters have imbib'd this Doctrine too; one of them, laſt Sabbath Day was Two Weeks, in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er uſed this Phraſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Some of our People are gone out to meet the Rod, and to kiſs it.</hi> Out! Whether are they gone out! Out ſure enough! Not out of God's Bleſſing into a warm Sun; No, no: They are gone out of God's way of waiting upon him all the Days of their appointed Time, until their Change ſhall come. But as for Five of them (within this Three Weeks) they are gone out indeed; out of the World! And now the Devil and-all the Promoters and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of of Inoculation cannot deceive us; for we have followed them to their Graves, and they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, until the Heavens be no more. 2<hi>dly,</hi> You ſay, <hi>to meet the Rod.</hi> Sir, where did you meet with this indigeſted Phraſe for your People that have put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a way to have the Small Pox, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe both the Diſeaſe and the Time when. I wiſh you would make your Bible more the Rule of Prayer as well as of Practice. 3<hi>dly,</hi> You ſay, <hi>and to kiſs it.</hi> Ay, ſo you might, had not God lately made you to know, that it is dangerous medling with Ege Tools, and ſhow'd you that you are Fools that will be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. May you ſport it with the Holy one of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el? May you not ſee your ſelves pourtrayed in Hoſ. 5. 5. <hi>The Pride of Iſrael doth teſtify unto his face; therefore ſhall Iſrael and Ephraim fall in their Iniquity; Judah alſo ſhall fall with them.</hi> Hath not God ſpit in your Faces? and will you not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?

Verſe 7. <hi>For the Priests Lips ſhould keep Knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his Mouth; for he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Verſe 8. <hi>But ye are departed out of the way: ye have cauſed many to ſtumble at the Law: ye have corrupted the Covenant of Levi, faith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Verſe 9. <hi>Therefore have I made you contemptible and baſe before all the People, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return and ſhow how Satan may be carrying on his old Work by this new way. The Town daily reſents your Abuſes, and many blacken your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which you ought to preſerve as ſacred; and they ſay, If you are ſo defective in your Morals, how ſhall we believe you, when you ſpeak of divine Things? And ſo you have accrued unto your ſelves an odious Character in the Minds and Mouths of too many, ay very many, of your Hearers and Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. They are prejudiced againſt your Perſons, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently againſt whatever you teach. I have many times to my Grief heard People ſay, that if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand your own Trade no better than you do Morals, we are in a bad Condition. And they allude unto Gal. 3. 4. <hi>Have ye ſuffered ſo many things in vain,</hi> (to withdraw from the Principles and Practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and now to bring in the Practice of the Heathen?) And Verſe 3. <hi>Are ye ſo fooliſh, having begun in the Spirit, are ye made perfect in the Fleſh?</hi> They ſay, as in Verſe 1. <hi>O fooliſh</hi> Miniſters, <hi>who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the Truth?</hi> And with Jer. 5. 26. <hi>For among my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are found wicked Men: They lay in wait, as he that ſetteth Snares to catch Men,</hi> (that is, by Inoculation, with which they infect their Neighbours.) <hi>They ſet a Trap; they catch men.</hi> I ſhall conclude with Job. 5. 20. <hi>They were confounded becauſe they had hoped; they came together and were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

And now, Sir, with a real deſire that Satan may not take any Advantage againſt you, to hinder the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of your Miniſtry, by raiſing Prejudices againſt your Perſon, and alſo againſt your Doctrine. (which I have reaſon to fear, ſince you have imbib'd this new Doctrine, as ſome call it,) I reſt with real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,</p>

            <p>OUR Town ſeems to be chaſed in their Minds, againſt ſome of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, for their intermedling with things which do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their Function; and do ſay, that there is not that Care taken to keep them in their proper Sphere, that they may be uſeful to the People.</p>
            <p>And now I muſt go back, and call over old things. You may remember when this Governour came firſt, he propoſed to make Money, 100000 <hi>l.</hi> upon Loan, and 50000 <hi>l.</hi> was made before, which was let out to Men upon Mortgages at 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> ſo that it muſt pay 6300 <hi>l.</hi> Uſe. The next Year the Governour mov'd to put a ſtop to the Run of it, and said. That there ſhould be no more made, for it would not be good Times till Silver was the Medium of Trade. Many ignorant Men, that could not ſee with the ſame Eyes as ſome Gentlemen did, thought we were in a bad Condition; for they ſaid, Here is not enough Money in the Country of that Species to pay Uſe and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal too: (It may be they did not underſtand Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick.) This put a ſtop to Trade; and many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were drove to Hardſhips, and fear'd it would be worſe, even that their Eſtates which were mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged would be forfeited; for nothing elſe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem

them but Silver at 6 <hi>s</hi> an Ounce, Seventeen Peny Half-peny Weight; which was the Occaſion of great murmering among the People. About this time there came into the Pulpit a great Orator, and his Text was, <hi>Two Brethren mending their Nets.</hi> He went on, and told the People of the Hardſhips their Forefathers underwent for the Goſpel; they went to the <hi>Clam-banks</hi> for a Livelyhood And, ſays he, <q>Are your Nets broke; I hope they will mend, I am told things begin to mend already.</q> Now I take Notice, that had we went to the Clam-Banks for Food, there was no Mony to pay our Taxes, nor to buy a Bottom of Twine to mend our Nets withal. But by and by he ſays, <q>I charge you that you do not mutiny; and God have bid me charge you, that you do not mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Digreſſion cauſed ſeveral Thoughts to ariſe; as firſt, That he lacked to ſee the Time when Silver ſhould be forced in upon upon us by Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and perhaps he might deſire to hear the Silver to gingle in the Box. Again, 2<hi>dly,</hi> The Tranſport that he was in, in charging the People <hi>not to muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> to ſee how he had left his Text: Or whether he ſpake from an Impulſe on his Mind, for we had heard nothing of Mutiny, nor like it before. And this ſort of Diſcourſe put me in mind of a young Scholar I knew in England, who told my Brother, that he had ſtudied an excellent Diſcourſe but could not tell what Text to put to it. Says my Brother to him, Pray leave it with us in the Country; for we have more Texts here than excellent Diſcourſes. Now, whether this was a Diſcourſe put to a Text, or a Text applyed to this Diſcourſe, I will not pretend to determine: But I have obſerved more ſuch Doings and laid them up in my Budget.</p>
            <p>The next thing I obſerved was, Supplications by the Miniſters, <hi>That God would teach this People to</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:002407_0012_0FDB3C1A46FC1DD0"/>
               <hi>lead quiet and peaceable Lives.</hi> This put me farther into a Conſternatian; and I could not tell what they meant by repeating it twice a Day ſo long together, as tho' it was an Article in our Creed that muſt not be omitted. I conſidered whether they were not ſet to work by ſome Perſons, and whether this was not an Implicit Charge upon us, that we were not a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quiet People. Now the Miniſter's could not leave off this Form of Words in their Prayer, until the honourable Aſſembly had declared us a loyal and peaceable People, by rejecting the Bill againſt Riots and that againſt the Liberty of the Preſs, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in their Anſwer to the Governour's Speech. It apear'd plainly to me, that there was no need at all for the Law againſt Riots, except it was to oblige Mr. <hi>D—y</hi> the High Sheriff, and Mr. <hi>Y—s</hi> the Governour's Kinſman to keep the Peace; for we know they both broke the Peace ſoon after that Bill was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Aſſembly, and we know alſo that they were for having the Bill paſs: Nor was there any need of the Law againſt Libels, unleſs it was to puniſh a certain Clergyman for writing News from <hi>Robinſon Cruſo's Iſland:</hi> But I will tell you what came into my mina, Theſe Men want to make their Neighbour's live <hi>quiet and peaceable Lives,</hi> that they may live <hi>quarrelſome and turbulent Lives;</hi> juſt as ſome Folks would make other Men honeſt, that they themſelves may be Knaves.</p>
            <p>Again, It is obſerv'd, that the Miniſters are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a contrary Party to the Bulk of the People, with reſpect to the publick Affairs here in this Town; and ſo there is an ill Underſtanding between the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and the People, as ſome have complained. I do not think all do oppoſe them becauſe they would be of a Party againſt them; yet it may be ſome may do it for as little Reaſon as the Counteſs of <hi>Pembrook</hi> gave to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> when ſhe came
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002407_0013_0FDB3C1C080B0D30"/>
to her and ſaid, <hi>Madam, What is the reaſon that you indeavour to hinder your Son from marrying my Siſter?</hi> The Anſwer was, <hi>The only Reaſon is, Madam, becauſe ſhe is your Siſter,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the Miniſters complain, that this People in the midſt of Judgment are not bettered thereby, but wax worſe and worſe: Here is great Diviſions among us. Now we ſay, that ſeveral Miniſters have ſet up the Doctrine of Inoculation in Publick, and think we do not do well that we do not believe it and practice it, but on the contrary, ſet light by their Advice: And indeed, we have reaſon ſo to do; for they prove it not from the Word of God to be our Duty; and till they do, let them reſent it how they will, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comply with them; and ſo we differ in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they did in <hi>Ahab's</hi> Time. And now the Diſpute is no longer, whether there is Animoſities and Contentions between the Miniſters and the People but it lies here, to know where the Fault is. The Miniſters ſay, it is becauſe they are oppoſed and ſet light by. The People ſay, they oppoſe and ſet light by them, becauſe they teach that which is not good but evil unto them. And we read in Prov. 19-27. <hi>Ceaſe my ſon to hear the Inſtruction that cauſeth to err from the Words of Knowledge,</hi> And the Caſe ſeems pour rayed in I Kings 18. 17, 18. <hi>And it came to paſs when Ahab ſaw Elijah, that Ahab ſaid unto him, Art thou be that troubleth Iſrael: And he anſwered, I have not troubled Iſrael, but thou and thy Father's Houſe, in that ye have forſaken the Commandments of the Lord, and thou haſt followed <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> Now we do believe, that you are the People that broached and carryed on by perſwaſion, even that which is the breaking of the Commandments of the Lord, and have taught us the Tradition of Men to our own hurt, even ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. Now theſe things (together with many more which are in the People's Minds, and in my
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002407_0014_0FDB3C20C454BBF0"/>
Budget alſo,) have diſturb'd the People to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that it makes them inquire after your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: And they find in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18. your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is, <hi>Teach all Nations.</hi> Mark. 16. 15. <hi>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Goſpel.</hi> And we can't find, by comparing it with our Annotations, any allowance for Miniſters to make Parliament Men and the like. Your work is divine, your Maſter is the God of Peace, your Lord the Son of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Peace, and the Spirit of Peace to lead in the way of Peace: And the Promiſe in Pſalms 84. 11. is to ſuch as <hi>walk uprightly.</hi> And in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20. we find, that the Words of RECONCILIATION are committed unto you, and you are to <hi>pray us to be reconciled unto God.</hi> Now if Miniſters will be Party-<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and undertake to lead the Van in other things, which are not in their Commiſſion, they may expect no Bleſſing on their Endeavours, nor indeed but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Succeſs; for 'tis in God's way that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his Bleſſing. <hi>Teach them to obſerve all things</hi> which I command you; <hi>and to, I am with you to the end of the World. Amen.</hi> Math. 28. 19. And the Pſalmiſt annexes a Bleſſing unto them that walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Rule; <hi>Mercy and Peace be upon them.</hi> Now, had not the Miniſters went out of their Sphere, both in <hi>England</hi> and here too, People would not have opened their Mouths againſt them for being the Starters and Promoters of Diviſion. We have not forgotten the Confuſion that aroſe in <hi>Sacheverill's</hi> Day, when he went out of his Sphere, tho' he was as learned a Man as any of you, as I have heard; yet the Land will not clear him from being a deſigning Man: But be his deſign what it would, he was the Fomenter of much Diviſion, as well as you. Now the People are afraid, the Miniſters do affect a Rule over them in Temporals, as the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> does temporally as well as ſpiritually, rule and determine
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002407_0015_0FDB3C21BB21E4C8"/>
things. Jer. 5. 31. <hi>The Prophets propheſie folly, and the Prieſts bear Rule by their means; and what will ye do in the end thereof.</hi> And ſome ſay we are Prieſt-ridden; others ſay that they will not be Prieſt-ridden; others ſay we are not <hi>Spaniards</hi> to bear this Prieſt-riding; others ſay they are <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and are not us'd to be Prieſt-ridden. And we will not mind what they ſay, but when they are in the Diſcharge of their Maſter's Commiſſion; (and I wiſh the People would do that, ſeeing there is ſuch Heart-burnings,) And that was it we call'd them to, and for that we will pay them; and for thoſe ſuperfluous things which their Maſter nor we never ſet them about, we will not thank them for: For ſuppoſe a Prince ſhould ſend an Ambaſſador to a foreign Court, and give him his Inſtructions what he ſhall do, and what he ſhall negociate; if he ſhould thro' a great Opinion of his own Parts, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from a Willingneſs to pleaſe the Court, negociate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or abort any thing that was not in his Credentials, ſhall not his Maſter blame him for his Conduct. Now Gentlemen, if you take a View of your Actions, you will be of the ſame Opinion with us, That you have breached almoſt all the Things that have ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up Strife; and being broached, have blown them, tip unto that Heigth that they now are in. I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that there was a certain Gentleman in our Town, tied his Horſe at the Door of one of my Neighbours, and went into his Houſe, and tarryed ſome time: In the mean time ſome Body put a good quantity of Tar on the Saddle; and the Gentleman came forth and rode home without perceiving the Tar, and ſo ſpoil'd his Breeches. Now by good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it is infer'd, that it was a miſtake, and that the Man thought it was Dr. <hi>B—u's</hi> Horſe. Now the ſpoiling of the Gentleman's Breeches is laid unto ſome of our Miniſters Charge: Not that it's ſuppoſed any of them did lay the Tar upon the Saddle; (for I
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002407_0016_0FDB129EDD9C8930"/>
would put the Saddle upon the right Horſe,) but in a remote Senſe they were; as thus, They found out the Practice of Inoculation in Hiſtory; (tho' it would have been well for this poor Town, if at that time they had been ſtudying Divinity.) 2<hi>dly,</hi> They put the Doctor upon it, and incourag'd him in it, and perſwaded People to come into the Practice. 3<hi>dly,</hi> By this means the Man was incenſed againſt the Doctor, and (as he thought) acted a Piece of Revenge upon him, which was to ſoil the Saddle and ſpoil his Breeches. Now it is thought, that the Miniſters that have ſo highly promoted Inoculation, ſhould make a gathering for this Gentleman; if not four-fold, yet at leaſt enough to ſatisfy him for the Loſs of his Breeches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But this was a riotous Action, and you ſay we are a quiet and peaceable People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> So we are a quiet and peaceable People, genarally ſpeaking, notwithſtanding this Inſtance and one or two more to the contrary. Yea, our Miniſters did ſay in their Addreſs to the King, (if I am not miſtaken,) that we were a loyal and peaceable People, even to a Man. And now I would ask the Miniſters the following Queſtions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Whether we may not diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween complaining under Oppreſſion, and being a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous People?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt,</hi> 2. Whether this People have not learned to live quiet and peaceable Lives; and whether your keeping up this Prayer, <hi>That God would teach us to live quiet and peaceable Lives,</hi> be not an implicit bearing falſe Witneſs againſt thy Neighbour?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Whether by your Credentials you ought not every Sabbath Day to have made Supplications for our Brethren at the Eaſtward, who are in jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy of their Lives in the High Places?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. Whether the Buſineſs that our Brethren
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002407_0017_0FDB3C269AA55D88"/>
are gone upon is not of Importance, ſince they are to apprehend thoſe that are Enemies to the King, and to the King of Kings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 5. Whether by your Silence you do not give People reaſon to think, that you are much in Alliance with thoſe that are for a Peacable War?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 6. Whether the ſecret Miſteries of State be in your Credentials?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 7. Whether your Credentials have not Matter enough for all your Strength and Parts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out running into other Men's Bounds? Pſal. 139.6. <hi>Such Knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 8. Whether your Prayer ſo long kept up, was not the Motive of the Governour's complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the beſt of Kings, againſt as good Subjects as ever a King rul'd?</p>
            <p>A certain Gentleman of the learned Seminary of Cambridge, ſays, <hi>He wonders that</hi> John Williams's <hi>Book do ſell ſo well; for all the Arguments he brings againſt Inoculation might be turned againſt Tobacco.</hi>

And as for Phyſick, my teaching you will ſignify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for unleſs I could inſtall you with the Title of <hi>Doctor of Phyſick,</hi> you muſt expect to follow my Steps, and give Advice <hi>gratis,</hi> which I ſuppoſe you will not admire. And then with reſpect to Logick, a ſmall quantity of that will do, provided you always remember to ſupply the want of it with good Store of Sophiſtry. However, I will give my Pupil the following Maxims that I have received in Logick, and let him take them or leave them, as they will beſt befit the Imployment he goes upon.</p>
