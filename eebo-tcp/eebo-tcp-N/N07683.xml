         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REMARKS &amp;c.</head>
            <p>SUCH is the preſent afflicting Situation of Affairs, and ſuch the univerſal Prevalence of Animoſity, that each Man ſeems to have obtained his SUMMUM BONUM, when by all the Arts of a <hi>Sophiſt,</hi> he can lay hold of any Means, (no Matter how baſe) to wound his Neighbour's Reputation. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and glaring Inſtance of this detracting Spirit, we have had in a late ſcandalous Phamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, entituled <q>The Author of QUAKER UNMASK'D ſtrip'd ſtark naked, or the DELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NEATED PRESBYTERIAN play'd Hob with;</q> where a Gentleman of unblemiſh'd Morals is openly and audaciouſly inſulted and proclaimed to the World to be an unjuſt and deceiving Man.</p>
            <p>This grovling Performance is written with neither Spirit nor Judgment; and contains nothing to recommend it to the Peruſal of any candid, unbigotted Perſon, ſave that it tends
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009814_0003_0F7A545D68670098"/>
to ſhew the malevolent Author of it in his proper Colours; <hi>to wit,</hi> a Diſturber of the public Tranquility and a Peſt of Society, But to proceed;—my Deſign, at preſent, is neither to defend the Conduct of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> nor the <hi>Quakers;</hi> but ſolely to vindicate that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, from the villainous Aſperſions of his deſigning Enemies; and in this Undertaking, I ſhall appear juſtifiable in the Eyes of all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſs'd by Prejudice.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Our ingenious Pamphleteer, when he ſat down to compoſe his elaborate and learned Treatiſe, ſeems to have intended to do all the Miſchief in his Power; and being regardleſs of the ſacred Laws of Speech, (for he deals in the marvellous) and having no other Method to give Vent to his Malice, he without Reaſon or Provocation charges a Perſon entirely inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the Fact, with being the Author of a late Piece, entituled "QUAKER UNMASK'D,"
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009814_0004_0F7A545E274F9D28"/>and taking it for granted that he was the Man, thence draws this <hi>ſagacious</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that therefore he is a Lyer. The Gentleman ſo groſly abus'd, was no Doubt ſuppos'd by our Author, to have wrote the Pamphlet he pretends to animadvert upon; and now nicely does he do it! Firſt with uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Lampoon by deriding another Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, whoſe prudent Behaviour in the late unhappy Diſturbances, I leave to cooler Times to determine. But that I may detain your At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions no longer, ſhall with all the Brevity poſſible, convince you, by a few Remaks on that libellous Lampoon, which I juſt now ſpoke of, that the Author of it hath acted an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly and ungenerous Part. If any Man among you (ſave <hi>St. James</hi>) ſeem to be religious and bridleth not his Tongue, but deceiveth his two Heart; this Man's Religion is vain.</p>
            <p>What favourable Sentiments can you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of him, who, upon a bare, groundleſs Suppoſition, would endeavour to blaſt the Reputation of a fellow Creature? Do not your Hearts tell you, ſuch a Man as this is and muſt of Neceſſity be a Villain? ſurely they do. Why then Mr. <hi>Pamphleteer</hi> labours under this
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009814_0005_0F7A545F311189E8"/>
Diſadvantage; for his whole Performance is one continued Piece of Detraction. The Faults he lays to the Charge of that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of whom he hath had the Impudence to ſpeak ſo freely, are all invented by Malice, with a Deſign to rob him of his honeſt Fame; but his Character is too well eſtabliſh'd to be ſullied by the invidious Repreſentations of every vagabond Quill-Driver. Our Author accuſes him of being a Promoter of Diſcord, and a bad Member of Society; but theſe are Faults which cannot, with the leaſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Juſtice, be attributed to him; that he has his Failings as a Man I allow: for Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is the grand Characteriſtic of ſubluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Beings; and as the Poet ſays,</p>
            <q>
               <l>The ruling Paſſion, be it what it will,</l>
               <l>The ruling Paſſion governs Nature ſtill.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Let us now conſider what he ſays next. <q>I ſincerely hope that the Sentiments of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horence of your infamous Piece, which I ſhall expreſs, will be of ſo much Service to you, that you will never hereafter proſtitute your Pen to any ſuch baſe Purpoſes for the ſake of any Party whatever at the Expence of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009814_0006_0F7A545FDB0EE528"/>
Truth; nor to vindicate the Actions of a Set of Murderers and Rioters, deſtitute of the Principles of Humanity.</q> Now ſuppoſing this Gentleman to have wrote that <hi>infamous Piece,</hi> (the contrary of which I affirm) in what Part of it does he countenance Murderers and Rioters? Is it when he tells us he would, by no means attempt to juſtify the killing of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> while under the Protection of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? Or was it when we were in ſuch Confuſion, upon the firſt Alarm, of the <hi>Paxton</hi> People being on the Road arm'd, whoſe Intentions were not ſuppos'd to be the beſt; at which Time he chearfully offer'd himſelf to go meet them, and ſtop their Progreſs if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Or was it at <hi>Germantown,</hi> when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated, advis'd, threatned and us'd his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Intereſt to prevail with them to return to their reſpective Habitations?—Thus you ſee, we have fairly convicted Mr. <hi>Delineator</hi> of a notorious Falſhood.</p>
            <p>Page the ſeventh he tell us <q>it is impoſſible you can recover your uſual Credit but by a ſincere and public Acknowledgment, that you were prompted thereto by Envy, Hatred and Malice, and that the Father of Lyes was
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009814_0007_0F7A5461FAC10400"/>
your Dictator.</q>—I can hardly keep my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to hear him talk at ſo ridiculous a Rate; ſurely our Author hath not wrote himſelf to ſuch a Pitch of Vanity, as to imagine that his ungrammatical Scribling will deſtroy the leaſt Part of that Gentleman's unſpotted Fame; his Life and Manners will refute all he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd; and with Confidence I ſay it, his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are full Proof againſt all his malicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions; and for him to undertake to cenſure and condemn the conduct of one ſo much his ſuperior, only expoſes his own Weakneſs and renders him liable to be compar'd to the Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py who bark'd at the Moon.</p>
            <p>Page the 9th. <q>I know, from your Youth, that you were capable to excogitate Lyes with a better Grace, than any of your School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, who have often employed you to ſave their Poſteriors from the Ceremony of the Birch.</q> Concerning this Aſſertion, I ſhall not pretend to ſay a great deal; ſave, that our Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteer hath paid a greatful Acknowledgement for paſt Favours; for how he comes to be ſo particularly acquainted with that Gentleman's Benevolence, in ſaving his School-fellows from a Whipping, unleſs Experience hath taught him, I ſhall not venture to decide.</p>
            <p>
