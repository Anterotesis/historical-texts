            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>Brethren, I count not my ſelf to have apprehended; but this one Thing I do; forgetting thoſe Things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe Things which are before, I preſs toward the Mark for the Prize of the high-Calling of GOD in CHRIST JESUS.</p>

            <p>THIS, my Brethren, and Friends, is a Day which many Years paſt I did not expect to have ſeen. It brings me within a Month of finiſhing the ſeventy-ſecond Year of my Life; and this Day will finiſh the fiftieth Year of my Miniſtry among you: a Length of Time unfrequently employed in this Work; which it has pleaſed GOD, the ſovereign Arbiter of Life and Death, of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and good Pleaſure, to continue to me; to Him be the Glory and Praiſe for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:013083_0004_0F8EBDC214A43DA0"/>HAVING been deſired to entertain you with a Diſcourſe on this Occaſion, I would willingly endeavor to ſtir up your Minds, and my own, to ſuitable Reflections on ſome paſſed Events of divine Providence towards us, and a ſuitable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of them, and endeavor to animate us to more earneſt and vehement Aſpirations after Chriſtian Improvements and Perfections; to which Purpoſe I judged the Words of my Text not to be improper: They are Words written by the Apoſtle Paul, when he was advanced in Years, and had the Proſpect of a not far diſtant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from this World. The Epiſtle is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have been written in the eighth Year of Nero, the 62d of our Lord, when the Apoſtle was in Bonds at Rome the firſt Time: From which he intimates his Expectation of Deliverance; and it ſeems he was delivered from that Chain, but was again committed to Bands, and put to Death at Rome. It ſeems the Church of the Philippians, though a flouriſhing Church, was diſturbed by judaizing Teachers, who endeavored to keep up the Law of Moſes, and mix the Obſervances of it with the Doctrine of Chriſt, and his Inſtitutions. And the Apoſtle begins this Chapter with Warnings againſt theſe Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.—He propoſes himſelf as an Example of truſting in Chriſt only, and not in his Privileges, nor any outward Advantage as conducive to Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013083_0005_0F8EBDC227662A98"/>
nor to be regarded in Compariſon with CHRIST, to whom he is reſolved to cleave: and rejecting all other Things, he would count himſelf an unſpeakable Gainer, if he had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in CHRIST and his Righteouſneſs, and might be found in him; if he might feel the Efficacy of his Death, and Reſurrection, killing Sin in him, and raiſing him up to Newneſs of Life. He lets them know that his Heart was upon Heaven as his Happineſs, which in the 11th Verſe, is called the Reſurrection of the Dead. For though the Souls of the Saints, when they depart, are immediately with CHRIST; yet their Happineſs is not compleat 'till the general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; and he was willing to do and ſuffer any Thing, that he might attain it. Viewing himſelf in a State of Trial, and Imperfection, he made this Judgment of his Caſe, he preſſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and followed after Chriſt, endeavoring to get more Grace, and do more Good; not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had done enough. In theſe Verſes he makes continual Alluſion to the Races run in the Olympian Games, where he that run was ever on the Stretch, preſſing forward, without looking back to what he had left behind, keeping the Goal in his Eye, that coming up firſt to the Mark, he might catch the Prize.—And if ſuch an one as Paul, that great Apoſtle, who had done and ſuffered ſo much for CHRIST,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013083_0006_0F8EBDC345AE9318"/>
had laboured ſo abundantly, and was in Deaths ſo often, was not perfect, nor had obtained the Prize, but muſt ſtill preſs with ſuch Ardor; what are we? What concerns us, who are ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him? What continual Diligence and Labour does this Purſuit require?</p>
            <p>FROM the Words I ſhall obſerve three Things as the Subject I ſhall diſcourſe on.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. THE oldeſt and beſt of the Miniſters, and Servants of CHRIST, ought to be perſuaded they have not yet attained the Meaſures of Grace and Holineſs they ought to have.</item>
               <item>II. THEY ſhould, in certain Reſpects, forget all their paſt Labours and Attainments.</item>
               <item>III. As long as they live, they ſhould be fervently purſuing after better Attainments in the Knowlege and Love of CHRIST, and preſſing towards the Perfection to be had in him.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I. THE oldeſt and beſt of the Miniſters, and Servants of CHRIST, ought to be perſuaded they have not yet attained the Meaſures of Grace and Holineſs they ought to have.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:013083_0007_0F8EBDC3C9F81408"/>THE Apoſtle Paul, one of the holieſt meer Men that ever lived, makes this Judgment of himſelf, <hi>I count not myſelf to have apprehended.</hi> Was it only a local Heaven that he judged he had not attained? No ſurely; for not only him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but every Body elſe whom he was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with, certainly knew that he was then on Earth. But he counted he had not yet attained theſe Meaſures of Grace, Holineſs, and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to CHRIST, that Fitneſs for Heaven, or ſo much of Heaven as was attainable in this World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THEY ſhould count their Knowlege, and Love of Chriſt is comparatively ſmall.—The doctrinal Knowlege we have of CHRIST, his Perſon, Offices and Work, is communicated by the holy Scriptures. With theſe the Miniſters and People of GOD may be well acquainted, and underſtand the main, yea all Things eſſential to Salvation: Yet they may be in many Things miſtaken, and not well underſtand them. But the Knowlege of Chriſt I am ſpeaking of, does eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially intend, the experimental Knowlege of him. Faith in Chriſt, a Belief in him, upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Credit and Veracity of GOD in his Word. A Confidence and Truſt in GOD through him, according to his Promiſe. An experimental Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the Glory and Excellency of his Perſon,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013083_0008_0F8EBDC48D7459E8"/>
and Offices, and Work; his full Sufficiency.— How ſhort do GOD's People come in this, after all their Attainments and Experience? Much Weakneſs and Fearfulneſs of Heart; Abundance of Corruption; Prejudices ariſing from corrupt Diſpoſitions ſtill remaining; Stirrings of inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Deſires after worldly Things; immoderate Attachments to Creature Relations and Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby they are hindered in the Exerciſes of Faith and Holineſs; perplexed with many Jealouſies and Suſpicions concerning the Promiſes of God, his Love and Grace in CHRIST. What Workings of Self-Righteouſneſs—what Pronity to pride themſelves in their own Labours and Services for GOD, to live upon their own Frames and Duties? Even in their Humiliations, how often may they find Pride ſtarting up, and catch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pleaſed with themſelves, inſtead of glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in CHRIST and living upon him? Self-Ends and Deſigns, and Vanity intermix with their Zeal and Duty to CHRIST. Many a Time have the beſt Men before as much Reaſon to groan out as St. Paul did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</hi> They are at preſent in a State of Warfare, the Fleſh <hi>luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, ſo that ye cannot do the Things that ye would.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. <hi>For we now ſee through a Glaſs darkly; now I
<pb n="11"
                      facs="unknown:013083_0009_0F8EBDC52B056D80"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
know in Part.</hi> Though their Faith is ſincere, yet it is weak. Though their Knowlege be right, yet it is ſmall. Little of the incomprehenſible Glories of CHRIST, and the miſterious Wiſdom and Grace of Redemption, is now known by good Men; Things which the Angels deſire to look into. As ſuch as this is the real S<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e of the beſt of CHRIST's Servants in this World, 'tis needful they ſhould be perſuaded of it, and know it is the Truth. 'Tis needful to keep them humble, and abaſe them before GOD; to make them more entirely dependent on CHRIST; to animate their Deſires to receive of his Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Grace for Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT their Labours for CHRIST, and the Fruits of them are comparatively little, and of ſmall Advantage to his Kingdom.—All the ſincere Servants, and faithful Miniſters of CHRIST, have an evangelical Righteouſneſs; and through the Grace of GOD in CHRIST JESUS will be accepted of GOD. But CHRIST has taught us all to ſay, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. <hi>When ye ſhall have done all thoſe Things which are commanded you, ſay, We are unprofitable Servants: We have done that which was our Duty to do.</hi> How little of Life is employed directly in the Service of CHRIST? If we deduct what is loſt in Childhood, and in childiſh Amuſements; in unmeaning Recreations,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013083_0010_0F8EBDC5E8068178"/>
and Converſe with the World, and about the Affairs of it: If we except what is ſpent in ſleeping, and natural Reſt; in the neceſſary Repairs of theſe feeble Bodies; perhaps not more than a ſixth Part will be left for GOD and CHRIST. If through the Grace of GOD we have an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Diſpoſition, whether we eat, or drink, or whatſoever we do, to do all to the Glory of GOD; yet how often do we forget it, and fail of actually doing ſo? When we call our paſt Temper and Conduct to Remembrance, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny imperfections may we find in the beſt that we have done? Many Infirmities, many wrong Ends and Views intermix'd with our honeſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Endeavors. How often do we ſleep when we think our Hearts awake? Friends, Relations, worldly Comforts, clog and hinder the Aſpirations of the Soul to GOD and Heaven; and hang like dead Weights upon us. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do we ſpend our Time in fruitleſs Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and Contentions for what ſeems to us to be Truth, and pertaining to Godlineſs; little conducive to real Religion; and rather divert us from the Practice of the moſt important Things of the Goſpel. Perhaps we are rather contending for the Maſtery of our own Wit and Subtilty, than for the Glory of CHRIST, and to bring Souls to GOD and Heaven. Perhaps have been influenced by Fears of Men, or Hopes from them;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013083_0011_0F8EBDC6A6DE9B78"/>
diſcouraged and ſunk under the Oppoſition of Devils and wicked Men; ready to ſay, Our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are vain.—Si vult decipi decipiatur.— And how ſmall is the Fruit of all our Labour? Suppoſe we have been ſome Way inſtrumental to turn ſome to Righteouſneſs, or hope that a Number through our Endeavors have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and edified; yet alas! how few, compared with the Numbers who remain carnal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted?—How many are hardened, and wax worſe? What Numbers have we to mourn over, who are going the downward Road, with whom is to be found no real ſaving Religion, but are neglecting and dropping the very Form of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and grow weary of the Trouble of what indeed they can have no Pleaſure in. How does the bleſſed Saviour complain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.4. <hi>I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored in vain, and ſpent my Strength for nought and in vain—Iſrael is not gathered.</hi> How little is done by Men, and how much needs to be done? Inſtead of great Revivals of Religion, don't we ſee Religion greatly decay? If we are ſincere, yet the old Man, and the old Serpent, will prove too hard for us.—However, if we have been inſtrumental of ſome Good, we have only been Inſtruments—GOD is the Author of it, we have no Claim to any Thing more than of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had the Honor and Happineſs of being made Uſe of by him. If we have been Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013083_0012_0F8EBDC7841C4AB8"/>
yea and abounding in Labours, yet we ſhould be annihilated before GOD, and feel as nothing in the View, that the divine Power, through JESUS CHRIST his Grace, does all the Good that is done. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the Grace of GOD which was with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. THEY ſhould, in certain Reſpects, forget all their paſt Labours and Attainments.</p>
            <p>THIS one Thing I do, ſays the Apoſtle; q. d. The Subſtance of what I have ſaid before, and my Reſolution now, is to forget the Things that are behind; whatever Services I have done, whatever Attainments I have got; yet I have not attained the Prize. Not that the Apoſtle did, or that the Saints of CHRIST ought never to think of them more, as their Encouragement, and Reaſons of Hope and Thankfulneſs or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Evidences of the Truth and Sincerity of their Faith, and Intereſt in CHRIST. In this View they ought to remember them, and give GOD the Glory of them, and through Faith plead their Title to the Promiſes. So did He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3. <hi>Remember now O LORD, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a perfect Heart, and have done that which is Good in thy Sight.</hi>— But this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting them intends,</p>

To remember paſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of divine Mercy and the good Gifts of GOD, and eſpecially ſpiritual Favors, is pleaſing to GOD. It is a Duty to keep up thankful Memorials of them, and to give GOD the Glory due to his Name for them. This is recorded in Scripture as the Practice of good Men, and accepted of GOD.—The Apoſtle therefore does not intend that he will ſhut, or keep them wholly out of his Mind; but that he will not dwell on them, and fancy he has got Grace enough; ſit down and ſing a Requiem to his Soul, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Salvation is ſecured, and he has no Need to trouble himſelf any further. Since GOD has pardoned his Sins, and is become reconciled to him, he will never recal his Favor, and therefore he has nothing to do but rejoice in his own Security, and need no further Trouble himſelf about Sin or Duty.—Nor may the beſt Saints in the World, with all their Attainments and Labours, ſolace themſelves as having done ſome great Things for CHRIST, and recollecting what eminent Servants they have been to him; as if he was in their Debt, and much obliged to them; and that for the Labours, they may leave for Novices, or new Beginners.

Our own Obedience or Holineſs has no Share in our juſtifying Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: CHRIST and his Righteouſneſs alone muſt be that: A Sinner has nothing elſe to plead. If a Man depends on any Thing elſe, in Whole or in Part, to juſtify him, he muſt ſtand at the Bar of GOD and in the Judgment of the Law a guilty undone Sinner.—The holy Attainments, and ſincere Labours of good Men, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Evidences of their Grace, and they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times need to look back to ſuch Evidences; but 'tis wrong, and a bad Sign, if Perſons make theſe their chief Evidences, ſo as on all Occaſions to go back to their paſt Experiences for Comfort againſt the Accuſations of Conſcience; to have ſuch Evidences chiefly or wholly to go to, to clear up their State: and if they can recollect ſuch Experiences as give them tolerable Ground of Hope, ſit down quiet without ſeeking new and larger Experiences, more clear Exerciſes of Faith, Repentance, and Love of GOD, and other holy Actings, and a more ſpiritual Temper of Heart.

What good Men have already attained, is little to what they would have, if they were compleatly ſanctified; the Services they have done but ſmall, compared with what they might do, if their Hearts were full of GOD, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in him; in Compariſon of that full compleat Holineſs which is to be lived and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, when their Corruptions are all aboliſhed, and they fully conformed to the Image of CHRIST.

The more we love that Character and Glory of GOD which ſhines out—JESUS CHRIST, the more Communion we have with him, the more we are ſanctified, and conformed to the image of GOD. Our higheſt Perfection is to be aſſimilated to CHRIST. All ſpiritual Life, Strength, Vigor and Activity in Holineſs, is communicated from GOD through him, and for his Sake. We have nothing to do with GOD, in any gracious and holy Action, but by him and through him. <hi>No Man cometh to the Father, but by me, Joh.</hi> 14.6. Through him, and by an holy Conformity to his Image, we are made meet for the heavenly Inheritance. For his Sake all the Duties and Obedience of the Saints is rewarded, as well as accepted of GOD; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more any Man loves him, the better he ſerves him, the more Grace he has, the nearer Perfection he comes, and the more glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he will attain in Heaven.</p>

            <p>ETERNITY is but long enough to know, and love, and ſerve CHRIST. The longeſt Life of Man on Earth is but a Span: And when our Lives are almoſt ſpent; when ſo much of them has been loſt; when we have done ſo little, known ſo little of GOD and CHRIST, loved him ſo little, and are come very near the Period of our Days; ſurely we ſhould the more fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly long for GOD, and move with more ſwift and ardent Deſires towards him; as Bodies move more ſwiftly, the nearer they come to the Centre of Attraction.

I have had the Comfort, through moſt of the Time of my Miniſtry among you, to ſee you in Peace; preſerved from many Snares and Deceits which have been laid to ſeduce you, and been favored with your Eſteem and Reſpect. —It has pleaſed GOD to give ſeveral Revivals of Religion among you, and one very general, in which the moſt of the People were under Awakening, and religious Concern; and I hope not a few only, have been made ſavingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with JESUS CHRIST.</p>

            <p>IT concerns you all to conſider ſeriouſly and examine thoroughly if this be the Caſe. And if it be ſo, it is high Time to awake out of Sleep. Such of you as have Families, ſhould reſolve firſt to give your own Selves to CHRIST, and to devote your Families to him, and travel in birth for them 'till CHRIST be formed in them. Let me beſeech, and charge you, by the Help of divine Grace, to keep up Religion in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; to keep your Children under a juſt and proper Government; ſee they have the beſt Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation you can give them, that they may be trained up in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD, kept out of the Company of evil Perſons, and the Way of the Tempter as much as poſſible, that from their Youth they may be taught the holy Scripture, and a great Reverence for GOD, and them.—It concerns you to ſeek earneſtly to GOD for the out-pouring of his Spirit on the preſent and riſing Generation.

Is not this to tempt GOD, while you excuſe yourſelves from diſcharging one of the moſt important Truſts GOD has committed to you? and putting your Children from under one of the moſt ſolemn Inſtitutions which he has ordained, to bring them into the Way of Converſion and Salvation? and to leave their Tuition to the Devil, and their own depraved Hearts?—<hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6, 7. <hi>And theſe Words which I command thee this Day, ſhall be in thine Heart; and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine Houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the Way, when thou ſitteſt down, and when thou riſeſt up, &amp;c.</hi> The ſad Proſpect for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Generation, and the Condition the Church and Society ſeems ſinking into, may make our Eyes run down with Tears, and our Hearts bleed with Anguiſh for the Hurt of the Daughter of our People.

               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:013083_0033_0F8EBDDC67B1B670"/>I AM perſuaded there is not a Perſon here, but wiſhes to be happy; and I ſuppoſe no one thinks he has already attained it. You wiſh the Proſperity of your Children, and their Poſterity. You have generally ſhewn a vehement Deſire to be free, to enjoy the Rights and Privileges of Engliſhmen; and of enjoying the Liberty of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping GOD according to your Conſciences, an uninterrupted Liberty of Goſpel Ordinances: that Liberty in which CHRIST has made his People free. <hi>You deſire Life, and love many Days, that you may ſee Good.</hi> You wiſh to be happy in another World, when you leave this; but I doubt whether the moſt of you are taking the right Way to this Proſperity and Happineſs.— And as I would now give you the beſt Advice I can, I muſt conſider you all as Believers, or Unbelievers; as in a corrupt unſanctified State, or as regenerate and renewed by the Holy Ghoſt. This Diſtinction divides the World, be their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Condition whatever it may.</p>
            <p>LET me then ſpeak, Firſt, to thoſe who are in a carnal, unregenerate, unconverted State.— As long as you remain ſuch, 'tis impoſſible you ſhould be happy in this World, or the next: In this State you are under the Guilt and Power of Sin, and the Curſe of GOD's Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. If you are grown up, and grown old in this

Condition, your Caſe is diſmal, and extremely dangerous, but not yet hopeleſs. Now the beſt Advice I can give you, is what the Apoſtle gave the Jailor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31. <hi>Believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Every other Hope in the World you muſt renounce. There is not the leaſt Crevice of Hope from the Covenant of Works: That was broke by Adam, and not one of his Poſterity ever was, or will be juſtified by that: It has never ſince been propounded to Man, as a Way of his Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Therefore by the Deeds of the Law, there ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified in his Sight.</hi> 'Tis by Faith in CHRIST only, that you ever can or will be juſtified: Upon him and his Righteouſneſs you muſt entirely depend, upon the Promiſe and Credit of the Goſpel. You muſt be recovered from the Love of the World and of Sin, truly hate and repent of it all: Supremely love GOD and Holineſs, and live a Life of new Obedience. Cry to GOD without ceaſing, to give you this Grace; to tranſlate you out of the Kingdom of Darkneſs, into the Kingdom of his dear Son. If you obtain this Bleſſing, you will have the beſt Foundation for Happineſs; the beſt Proſpect and Hope of Life: But if you do not, you will die in your Sins, and die eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>

               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:013083_0035_0F8EBDE1C1E3BBF0"/>2. TO thoſe who are Believers, and ſanctified by Faith that is in CHRIST JESUS.—I truſt, through the Grace of GOD, there are a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuch here. If that be our happy Caſe, we muſt notwithſtanding ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>We have not yet attained, nor are we already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> We are yet in a corrupt, evil and ſinful World; compaſſed with many Infirmities. Alas, how poorly, how faintly ſtruggling againſt our Enemies? How weak is our Faith, how diſtant from thoſe Attainments we ought to have had, and to which ſome have attained? Our Buſineſs, my Brethren, is to preſs toward the Mark for the Prize of the high-Calling which is of GOD in CHRIST JESUS our LORD. Labour to grow in Grace and abound in Holineſs, to devote the Remainder of our Lives to GOD, in a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided Manner than we have ever done. The Time is ſhort; and as we hope to receive a Reward through Grace according to our Works, we ſhould grow more ſpiritual and heavenly-minded. The Vigor and Activity of our Bodies will more and more decay; but let the inward Man be renewed Day by Day. We ſhould labour that by Grace we may abound in Humility, Meekneſs, Patience, Long-Suffering, Weanedneſs fro<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

to the End of Days, 'tis fit we ſhould be of a more heavenly Temper, that our Hearts be more form'd to the Exerciſes and Buſineſs of the Spirits made perfect.</p>
            <p>LET the Churches, and the World be the better for our Example, Counſels and Prayers; the Fruits of which may be poured upon them after you are gone to join the Church triumphant, and feel the Life and Joys of Heaven diffuſed through all your Souls.</p>
            <p>LET me endeavor once more to perſuade you, the dear People of this Society, and all Perſons here preſent, that the ſureſt, beſt, the only Way to attain the greateſt Happineſs in this Life, and the Peace and Privileges you wiſh for yourſelves, and your Poſterity; the Way to leave them the faireſt Inheritance, and to be forever happy, is <hi>Holineſs, or the true real Religion of the Goſpel.</hi>— This has a natural and powerful Tendency to promote the Happineſs of all Churches, all Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, and particular Perſons, to as great a Degree as can be had in a World of Sin and Trial. It is the Way which GOD, the Author of all Good and Happineſs, has conſtituted to bring ſinful Men to Happineſs in this World and the next. If you try all other Ways you can deviſe to lengthen out your Privileges, and promote your Proſperity, and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013083_0037_0F8EBDE350AF1A58"/>
make you happy; try them as much as you pleaſe and as long as you can, they never will give you Peace and Serenity in your own Minds, they will never give you Satisfaction in their Fruition, they will not lead your Poſterity to Reſt, nor give Reſt to your own Souls. If I had Ten-fold, or Ten Thouſand-fold the Strength, and Powers I have, I would willingly employ and ſpend them all to diſſuade you from thoſe Ways of ſeeking your Happineſs. If I knew this was the laſt Sermon I ſhould ever preach, (and I know not but it may) I would chuſe to employ it to recommend, and to perſuade you to make Choice of GOD for your Portion, CHRIST for your only and all-ſufficient Saviour, and Holineſs and Virtue, or Conformity to the moral Image of GOD, as the only Happineſs of rational Creatures.</p>
            <p>WHETHER you continue together, or be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from one another, as my laſt and moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Wiſh for you, I would wiſh you to be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily perſuaded, that the Religion of the Goſpel, the Holineſs, Virtue, Benevolence, which that teaches and preſcribes, is the Sum of all Duty, the beſt Policy, the ſureſt Means to make you great and honorable in the Eyes of GOD, Angels, and all good Men; to make you proſperous, and truly happy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:013083_0038_0F8EBDE3EA1D95F0"/>I DARE aſſure you in the Name of GOD, and as a Miniſter of CHRIST, that the more religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly you maintain, and attend to the Inſtitutions of the Goſpel, and practice the Virtues of it, the more Ground of Hope there will be, that you and your Poſterity will be as happy as you can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably wiſh in this World, and bleſſed with GOD in that to come.</p>
            <p>BUT the more Religion dies out and dwindles away from among you, the more contemptible, mean, diſtracted, wretched and accurſed People will you be.—And now, Brethren, I commend you to GOD, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance among all them that are ſanctified. AMEN.</p>
