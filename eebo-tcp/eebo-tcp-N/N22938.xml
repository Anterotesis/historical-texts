            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <p>IT is an unhappineſs into which the people of this age are fallen, that luxury is become faſhonable and too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally preferred to frugality. Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality is now-a-days tricked up in the pompous titles of generoſity and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur; whilſt bleſt frugality is too often branded as the badge of an avaricious and ſordid ſpirit.</p>
               <p>THIS error has ſo far ſeduced us, as to prevail on many to renounce a frugal way of living, though taught by nature, and to indulge thoſe exceſſes which ſerve
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:030282_0006_0FE59E5569FD4098"/>
only to abridge the number of our days. We are grown old before we have been able to taſte the pleaſures of being young. And the time which ought to be the ſummer of our lives is often the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their winter.</p>
               <p>OH unhappy Italy! Doeſt thou not ſee, that gluttony and exceſs rob thee, every year, of more inhabitants than peſtilence, war, and famine could have done? Thy true plagues, are thy nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous luxuries in which thy deluded ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens indulge themſelves to an exceſs unworthy of the rational character, and utterly ruinous to their health. Put a ſtop to this fatal abuſe, for God's ſake, for there is not, I am certain of it, a vice more abominable in the eyes of the divine Majeſty, nor any more deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. How many have I ſeen cut off, in the flower of their days by this unhappy cuſtom of high feeding! How many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent friends has gluttony deprived me
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:030282_0007_0FE59E5700D082E8"/>
of, who, but for this accurſed vice, might have been an ornament to the world, an honour to their country, and have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me as much joy in their lives, as I now feel concern at their deaths.</p>
               <p>IN order, therefore, to put a ſtop to ſo great an evil, I have undertaken this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle book, and I attempt it the more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as many young gentlemen have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted it of me, moved thereto by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their fathers drop off in the flower of their youth, and me ſo ſound and hearty at the age of eighty-one. They begged me to let them know by what means I attained to ſuch excellent health and ſpirits at my time of life. I could not but think their curioſity very laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and was willing to gratify them, and at the ſame time do ſome ſervice to my countrymen, by declaring, in the firſt place, what led me to renounce intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and lead a temperate life; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by ſhewing the rules I obſerved;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030282_0008_0FE59E59119F6210"/>
and thirdly, what unſpeakable ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and advantage I derived from it; whence it may be very clearly ſeen how eaſy a thing it is for a wiſe man to eſcape all the curſes of intemperance, and ſecure to himſelf the ineſtimable felicities of vigorous health and chearful age.</p>
               <p>THE firſt thing that led me to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a temperate life, was, the many and ſore evils which I ſuffered from the contrary courſe of living; my conſtitution was naturally weakly and delicate, which ought in reaſon to have made me more regular and prudent, but being like moſt young men, too fond of what is uſually called good eating and drinking, I gave the rein to my appetites. In a little time I began to feel the ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſuch intemperance; for I had ſcarce attained to my thirty-fifth year, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was attacked with a complication of diſorders, ſuch as, head-achs, a ſick ſtomach, cholicky uneaſineſſes, the gout,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:030282_0009_0FE59E5E554FE308"/>
rheumatic pains, lingering fevers, and continual thirſt; and though I was then but in the middle of my days, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſeemed ſo entirely ruined that I could hardly hope for any other termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to my ſufferings but death.</p>
               <p>THE beſt phyſicians in Italy employed all their ſkill in my behalf, but to no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. At laſt they told me, very candidly, that there was but one thing that could afford me a ſingle ray of hope, but one medicine that could give a radical cure, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> the immediate adoption of a temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and regular life. They added more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that, now, I had no time to loſe, that I muſt immediately, either chuſe a regimen or death, and that if I deferred their advice much longer, it would be too late for ever to do it. This was a home thruſt. I could not bear the thoughts of dying ſo ſoon, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their abilities and experience, I thought the wiſeſt courſe I could take,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030282_0010_0FE59E609D10EEE8"/>
would be to follow their advice, how diſagreeable ſoever it might ſeem.</p>
               <p>I THEN requeſted my phyſicians to tell me exactly after what manner I ought to govern myſelf? To this they replied, that I ſhould always conſider myſelf as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm perſon; eat nothing but what agreed with me, and that in ſmall quantity. I then immediately entered on this new courſe of life, and, with ſo determined a reſolution, that nothing has been ſince able to divert me from it. In a few days I perceived that this new way of living agreed very well with me; and in leſs than a twelvemonth I had the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able happineſs to find that all my late a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming ſymptoms were vaniſhed, and that I was perfectly reſtored to health.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had I began to taſte the ſweets of this new reſurrection, but I made many very pleaſing reflections on the great advantage of temperance, and thought within myſelf, <q>if this virtue has
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030282_0011_0FE59E62863FFDA8"/>
had ſo divine an efficacy, as to cure me of ſuch grievous diſorders, ſurely it will help my bad conſtitution and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm my health.</q> I therefore applied myſelf diligently to diſcover what kinds of food were propereſt for me, and made choice of ſuch meats and drinks only as agreed with my conſtitution, obſerving it as an inviolable law with myſelf, <hi>always to riſe with an appetite to eat more if I pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> In a word, I entirely renounced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and made a vow to continue the remainder of my life under the ſame regimen I had obſerved: A happy reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution this! The keeping of which entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured me of all my infirmities. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before lived a year together, without falling once, at leaſt, into ſome violent ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but this never happened to me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; on the contrary, I have always been healthy ever ſince I was temperate.</p>
               <p>I MUST not forget here to mention a circumſtance of conſiderable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030282_0012_0FE59E65259C8658"/>
I have been telling of a great, and to me, a moſt happy change in my way of living. Now all changes, tho' from the <hi>worſt</hi> to the <hi>beſt</hi> habits, are, at firſt, diſagreeable, I found it ſo; for having long accuſtomed myſelf to high feeding, I had contracted ſuch a fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for it, that though I was daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying myſelf, yet did it, at firſt, coſt me ſome ſtruggle to relinquiſh it. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, long uſed to hearty meals, expected them, and was quite diſſatisfied with my moderate repaſts. To divert my mind from theſe little diſſatisfactions, I uſed immediately after dinner, to betake my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſome innocent amuſement or uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful purſuit, ſuch as, my devotions, my book, muſic, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>BUT to return.—Beſides the two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going important rules about eating and drinking, that is, not to take of any thing, but as much as my ſtomach could eaſily digeſt, and to uſe thoſe things only

which agreed with me. I have very carefully avoided all <hi>extremes</hi> of <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold,</hi> exceſſive fatigue, interruption of my uſual time of reſt, <hi>late hours,</hi> and <hi>too cloſe</hi> and <hi>intenſe thinking.</hi> I am likewiſe greatly indebted for the excellent health I enjoy, to that calm and temperate ſtate in which I have been careful to keep my paſſions.</p>
               <p>THE influence of the paſſions on the nerves, and health of our bodies, is ſo great, that none can poſſibly be ignorant of it. He therefore who ſeriouſly wiſhes to enjoy good health, muſt, above all things, learn to conquer his paſſions, and keep them in ſubjection to reaſon. For let a man be never ſo temperate in diet, or regular in exerciſe, yet ſtill ſome unhappy paſſion, if indulged to exceſs, will prevail over all his regularity, and prevent the good effects of his tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; no words, therefore, can ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately expreſs the wiſdom of guarding
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030282_0014_0FE59E6B4E22C640"/>
againſt an influence ſo deſtructive. Fear, anger, grief, envy, hatred, malice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and deſpair, are known by eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal experience, to weaken the nerves, diſorder the circulation, impair digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and often to bring on a long train of hyſterical and hypochondriacal diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and extreme ſudden fright, has often occaſioned immediate death.</p>
               <p>ON the other hand, moderate joy, and all thoſe affections of the mind which partake of its nature, as chearfulneſs, contentment, hope, virtuous and mutual love, and courage in doing good, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorate the nerves, give a healthy motion to the fluids, promote perſpiration, and aſſiſt digeſtion; but violent anger (which differs from madneſs only in duration) throws the whole frame into tempeſt and convulſion, the countenance blackens, the eyes glare, the mouth foams, and in place of the moſt gentle and amiable, it makes a man the moſt frightful and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030282_0015_0FE59E6D54352438"/>
of all animals. The effects of this dreadful paſſion do not ſtop here; it never fails to create bilious, inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, convulſive, and ſometimes apoplec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic diſorders, and ſudden death.</p>
               <p>SOLOMON was thoroughly ſenſible of the deſtructive tendencies of ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paſſions, and has, in many places, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned us againſt them.

                        <p>THE reader will I hope excuſe me for relating the following tragical anecdote, to confirm what the benevolent Cornaro has ſaid on the baneful effects of envy, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>IN the city of York in England, there died ſome time ago, a young lady by the name of D—n. For five years before her death, ſhe appeared to be lingering and melancholy. Her fleſh withered away, her appetite decayed, her ſtrength failed, her feet could no longer ſuſtain her tottering emaciated body, and her diſſolution ſeemed at hand. One day ſhe called her intimate friends to her bed-ſide, and as well as ſhe could, ſpoke to the following effect:</p>
                        <p>"I KNOW you all pity me, but alas! I am not worthy of your pity; for all my miſery is entirely ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the wickedneſs of my own heart. I have two ſiſters; and I have all my life been unhappy, for no other reaſon but becauſe of their proſperity. When we were young, I could neither eat nor ſleep in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, if they had either praiſe or pleaſure. As ſoon as they were grown to be women, they married great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their advantage and ſatisfaction: this galled me to the heart; and though I had ſeveral good offers, yet thinking them rather unequal to my ſiſters, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them, and then was inwardly vexed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed, for fear I ſhould get no better. I never wanted for any thing, and might have been very happy, but for this wretched temper. My ſiſters loved me tenderly, for I concealed from them as much as poſſible this odious paſſion, and yet never did any poor wretch lead ſo miſerable a life as I have done, for every bleſſing they enjoyed was a dagger to my heart. 'Tis this Envy, which, preying on my very vitals, has ruined my health, and is now carrying me down to the grave. Pray for me, that GOD of his infinite mercy may forgive me this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſin; and with my dying breath I conjure you all, to check the firſt riſings of a paſſion that has proved ſo fatal to me."</p>
                     </note>;</q> and, <q>that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall not live out half their days.</q>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:030282_0016_0FE59E6FB45F5558"/>
For as violent gales of wind will ſoon wreck the ſtrongeſt ſhips, ſo violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of hatred, anger, and ſorrow, will ſoon deſtroy the beſt conſtitutions.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, I muſt confeſs to my ſhame, that I have not been at all times
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030282_0017_0FE59E73D5098B38"/>
ſo much of a philoſopher and Chriſtian, as entirely to avoid theſe diſorders: but I have reaped the benefit of knowing by my own repeated experience, that theſe malignant paſſions have in general a far leſs pernicious effect on bodies that are rendered firm and vigorous by tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, than on thoſe that are corrupted and weakened by gluttony and exceſs.</p>
               <p>IT was hard for me to avoid every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme of heat and cold, and to live above all the occaſions of trouble which attend the life of man; but yet theſe things made no great impreſſion on the ſtate of my health, though I met with many inſtances of perſons who ſunk under leſs weight both of body and mind.</p>
               <p>THERE was in our family a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able law-ſuit depending againſt ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe might overcame our right. One of my brothers, and ſome of my relations, were ſo mortified and grieved on account of the loſs of this ſuit, that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030282_0018_0FE59E763695F408"/>
they actually died of broken hearts. I was as ſenſible as they could be, of the great injuſtice done us, but thank GOD, ſo far from breaking my heart, it ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broke my repoſe. And I aſcribe <hi>their</hi> ſufferings and <hi>my</hi> ſafety, to the difference of our living. Intemperance and ſloth had ſo weakened their nerves, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their ſpirits, that they eaſily ſunk under the weight of misfortune. While temperance and active life had ſo invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated my conſtitution, as to make me happily ſuperior to the evils of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary life.</p>
               <p>AT ſeventy years of age, I had another experiment of the uſefulneſs of my regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Some buſineſs of conſequence calling me into the country, my coach-horſes ran away with me; I was overſet and dragged a long way before they could ſtop the horſes. They took me out of the coach with my head batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a leg and an arm out of joint, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030282_0019_0FE59E784B9564A0"/>
truly in a very lamentable condition. As ſoon as they had brought me home, they ſent for the phyſicians, who did not expect I could live three days: however, I was ſoon cured, to the great aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the phyſicians, and of all thoſe who know me.</p>
               <p>I BEG leave to relate one more anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, as an additional proof what an impenetrable ſhield temperance preſents againſt the evils of life.</p>
               <p>ABOUT five years ago, I was over-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to a thing, which had like to have coſt me dear. My relations, whom I love, and who have a real tenderneſs for me; my friends, with whom I was willing to comply in any thing that was reaſonable; laſtly, my phyſicians, who were looked upon as the oracles of health, did all agree that I eat too little; that the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment I took was not ſufficient for one of my years; that I ought not only to ſupport nature, but likewiſe to increaſe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030282_0020_0FE59E7A87424AA8"/>
the vigour of it, by eating a little more than I did. It was in vain for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to them, that nature is content with a little; that with this little I had enjoyed excellent health ſo many years; that to me the habit of it was become a ſecond nature; and that it was more agreeable to reaſon, that as I advanced in years and loſt my ſtrength, I ſhould rather <hi>leſſen</hi> than <hi>increaſe</hi> the quantity of my food, eſpecially as the powers of the ſtomach muſt grow weaker from year to year. To ſtrengthen my arguments, I urged thoſe two natural and true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs; one, that he who would eat a great deal muſt eat but little; that is eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little makes a man live long, he muſt eat a great deal. The other proverb was, that what we leave, after making a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty meal, does us more good than what we have eaten. But neither my proverbs nor arguments could ſilence their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate intreaties. Wherefore to pleaſe
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030282_0021_0FE59E7EEB229270"/>
perſons who where ſo dear to me, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to increaſe the quantity of food, but with too ounces only. So that, as before I had always taken but twelve ounces of ſolid food in the day, I now increaſed it to fourteen, and as before I drank but fourteen ounces of wine in the day, I now increaſed it to ſixteen. This increaſe had in eight days time ſuch an effect on me, that from being remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably chearful and briſk, I began to be peeviſh and melancholy, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſo ſtrangely diſpoſed, that I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew what to ſay to others, nor what to do with myſelf. On the twelfth day I was attacked with a moſt violent pain in my ſide, which held me twenty-two hours, and was followed by a violent fever which continued thirty-five days, without giving me a moment's reſpite. However GOD be praiſed, I recovered, though in my ſeventy-eighth year, and in the coldeſt ſeaſon of a very cold winter,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030282_0022_0FE59E80A95C2280"/>
and reduced to a mere ſkeleton; and I am poſitive, that, next to GOD, I am moſt indebted to temperance, for my recovery. O how great is the evil of intemperance, which could, in a few days bring on me ſo ſevere an illneſs, and how glorious are the virtues of temperance, which could thus bear me up, and ſnatch me from the jaws of death! Would all men but live regularly and temperately, there would not be a tenth of that ſickneſs which now makes ſo many melancholy families, nor any occaſion for a tenth part of thoſe nauſeous medicines, which they are now obliged to ſwallow in order to carry off thoſe bad humours with which they have filled their bodies by over eating and drinking.—To ſay the truth would every one of us but pay a becoming attention to the quantity and quality of what he eats and drinks, and carefully obſerve the effects it has upon him, he would ſoon become his own phyſician; and indeed
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030282_0023_0FE59E82C10300B0"/>
the very beſt he could poſſibly have, for people's conſtitutions are as different as their faces; and it is impoſſible, in many very important inſtances, for the moſt ſkilful phyſicians to tell a man of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, what would agree with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſo well as he knows himſelf. I am willing to allow that a phyſician may be ſometimes neceſſary; and in caſes of danger, the ſooner the better. But for the bare purpoſe of preſerving our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in good health, there needs no better phyſic than a temperate and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar life. It is a ſpecific and natural medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, which preſerves the man, how ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſoever his conſtitution be, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs his life to a above a hundred years, ſpares him the pain of a violent death, ſends him quietly out of the world, when the radical moiſture is quite ſpent, and which, in ſhort, has all the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are fancied to be in potable
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030282_0024_0FE59E84D29E7EA8"/>
gold, which a great many perſons have ſought after in vain.</p>
               <p>BUT alas! moſt men ſuffer themſelves to be ſeduced by the charms of a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous life. They have not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage enough to deny their appetites; and being over-perſuaded by their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ſo far, as to think they cannot give up the gratification of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abridging too much of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, they deviſe arguments to perſuade themſelves, that it is more eligible to live ten years leſs, than to be upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and deprived of whatever may gratify their appetites. Alas! they know not the value of ten years of healthy life, in an age when a man may enjoy the full uſe of his reaſon, and turn all his wiſdom and experience to his own, and the advantage of the world. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only in the ſciences. 'Tis certain that ſome of the moſt valuable books now extant, were written in thoſe laſt
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030282_0025_0FE59E88D7E683D8"/>
ten years of their authors lives, which ſome men pretend to undervalue; let fools and villains undervalue life, the world would loſe nothing by them, die when they will. But it is a loſs indeed, when <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good</hi> men drop into the grave; ten years of life to men of that character, might prove an ineſtimable bleſſing to their families and country. Is ſuch an one a prieſt only, in a little time he might become a biſhop, and by living ten years longer, might render the moſt important ſervices to the world by his active diſſemination of virtue and piety. Is he the aged parent of a family, then though no longer equal to the toils of younger years, yet by his venerable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and matured counſels, he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute more to the harmony and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his children, than all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours put together. And ſo with all others, whether in church or ſtate, army or navy, who are advanced in years,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030282_0026_0FE59E8A8AC27C70"/>
though not equal to the active exerciſes of youth, yet in conſequence of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior wiſdom and experiences, their lives may be of more ſervice to their country, than the lives of thouſands of citizens. Some, I know, are ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable as to ſay that it is impoſſible to lead ſuch a regular life. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Galen, that great phyſician, led ſuch a life, and adviſed others to it as the beſt phyſic. <hi>Plato, Cicero, Iſocrates,</hi> and a great many famous men of paſt and preſent times, have practiſed it, and thereby arrived to an extreme old age.</p>
               <p>YOU will tell me that <hi>Plato,</hi> as ſober a man as he was, yet affirmed, that it is difficult for a man in public life to live ſo temperately, being often in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the ſtate, expoſed to the badneſs of weather, to the fatigues of travelling, and to eat whatever he can meet with. This cannot be denied; but then I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that theſe things will never haſten
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030282_0027_0FE59E8C9ADF8C10"/>
a man's death, provided he accuſtoms himſelf to a frugal way of living. There is no man, in what condition ſoever but may keep from over-eating; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by happily prevent thoſe diſtempers that are cauſed by exceſs. They who have the charge of public affairs committed to their truſt, are more obliged to it than any others: where there is no glory to be got for their country, they ought not to ſacrifice themſelves: they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves to ſerve it; and if they purſue my method, it is certain they would ward off the diſtempers which heat and cold and fatigues might bring upon them; or ſhould they be diſturbed with them it would be but very lightly.</p>
               <p>IT may likewiſe be objected, that if one who is well, is dieted like one that is ſick, he will be at a loſs about the choice of his diet, when any diſtemper comes upon him. To this I ſay, that nature, ever attentive to the preſervation
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030282_0028_0FE59E8EA2F789C0"/>
of her children, teaches us how we ought to govern ourſelves in ſuch a caſe. She begins by depriving us ſo entirely of out appetites, that we can eat little or nothing. At that time, whether the ſick perſon has been ſober or intemperate, no other food ought to be uſed, but ſuch as is proper for his condition; ſuch as broth, jellies, cordials, barley-water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When his recovery will permit him to uſe a more ſolid nouriſhment, he muſt take leſs than he was uſed to before his ſickneſs; and notwithſtanding the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs of his appetite, he muſt take care of his ſtomach, till he is perfectly cured. Should he do otherwiſe, he would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden nature, and infallibly relapſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the danger he had eſcaped. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, I dare aver, that he who leads a ſober and regular life, will hardly ever be ſick; or but ſeldom, and for a ſhort time. This way of living preſerves us from thoſe bad humours
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030282_0029_0FE59E92E15343E8"/>
which occaſion our infirmities, and by conſequence heals us of all thoſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which they occaſion. I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay that every body muſt eat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as little as I do, or abſtain from fruit, fiſh, and other things from which I abſtain, becauſe ſuch diſhes diſagree with me. They who are not diſordered by ſuch diſhes, are under no obligation to abſtain from them. But they are under the greateſt obligations to feed moderately, even on the moſt innocent food, ſince an overloaded ſtomach can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not digeſt.</p>
               <p>IT ſignifies nothing to tell me that there are ſeveral, who, though they live very irregularly, yet enjoy excellent health and ſpirits, and to as advanced an age, as thoſe who live ever ſo ſoberly. For this argument is founded on ſuch uncertainty and hazard, and occurs ſo ſeldom, as to look more like a miracle than the regular work of nature. And
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030282_0030_0FE59E94A072EE38"/>
thoſe, who, on the credit of their youth and <hi>conſtitution,</hi> will pay any regard to ſo idle an objection, may depend on it, that they are the betrayers and ruiners of their own health.</p>
               <p>AND I can confidently and truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that an old man, even of a bad conſtitution, who leads a regular and ſober life, is ſurer of a longer one, than a young man of the beſt conſtitution who lives diſorderly. All therefore who have a mind to live long and healthy, and die without ſickneſs of body or mind, muſt immediately begin to live temperately, for ſuch a regularity keeps the humours of the body mild and ſweet, and ſuffers no groſs fiery vapours to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from the ſtomach to the head; hence the brain of him who lives in that manner enjoys ſuch a conſtant ſerenity, that he is always perfectly maſter of himſelf. Happily freed from the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of bodily appetites and paſſions, he
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030282_0031_0FE59E96318CC8B0"/>
eaſily ſoars above, to the exalted and delightful contemplation of heavenly objects; by this means his mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes gradually enlightened with divine truth, and expands itſelf to the glorious enrapturing view of the Power, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Goodneſs of the Almighty.—He then deſcends to nature, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges her for the fair daughter of GOD, and views her varied charms with ſentiments of admiration, joy, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, becoming the moſt favoured of all ſublunary beings. He then clearly diſcerns, and generouſly laments the wretched fate of thoſe who will not give themſelves the trouble to ſubdue their paſſions; and thoſe three moſt enſnaring luſts, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and the luſt of riches, which all wiſe and good men have firmly oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conquered, when they paſſed through this mortal ſtate; for knowing ſuch paſſions to be inconſiſtent with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030282_0032_0FE59E98B76F3538"/>
and happineſs, they at once nobly broke through their ſnares, and applied themſelves to virtue and good works, and ſo became men of good and ſober lives. And when in proceſs of time, and after a long ſeries of years, they ſee the period of their days drawing nigh, they are neither grieved nor alarmed. Full of acknowledgments for the favours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received from GOD, they throw themſelves into the arms of his future mercy. They are not afraid of thoſe dreadful puniſhments, which they deſerve who have ſhortened their days by guilty intemperance. They die without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, ſenſible that they did not come into this world to ſtay for ever, but are pilgrims and travellers to a far better. Exulting in this faith, and with hopes big with immortality, they go down to the grave in a good old age, enriched with virtues, and laden with honours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:030282_0033_0FE59E9B7646E1D8"/>
AND they have the greater reaſon not to be dejected at the thought of death, as they know it will not be violent, fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh or painful. Their end is calm, and they expire, like a lamp when the oil is ſpent, without convulſion or agony, and ſo they paſs gently away, without pain or ſickneſs, from this earthly and corruptible to that celeſtial and eternal life, whoſe happineſs is the reward of the virtuous.</p>
               <p>O HOLY, happy, and thrice bleſſed temperance! how worthy art thou of our higheſt eſteem! and how infinitely art thou preferable to an irregular and diſorderly life! Nay, would men but conſider the effects and conſequences of both, they would immediately ſee, that there is as wide a difference between them, as there is betwixt light and darkneſs, heaven and hell. Some there are who tell us that old age is no bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that when a man is paſt ſeventy,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030282_0034_0FE59E9E4A60F798"/>
his life is nothing but weakneſs, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and miſery. But I can aſſure theſe gentlemen, they are mightily miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; and that I find myſelf, old as I am, (which is much beyond what they ſpeak of) to be in the moſt pleaſant and delightful ſtage of life.</p>
               <p>TO prove that I have reaſon for what I ſay, they need only enquire how I ſpend my time, what are my uſual em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; and to hear the teſtimony of all thoſe that know me. They una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly teſtify, that the life I lead, is not a dead and languiſhing life, but as happy a one as can be wiſhed for in this world.</p>
               <p>THEY will tell you, that I am ſtill ſo ſtrong at fourſcore and three, as to mount a horſe without any help or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſituation; that I can not only go up a ſingle flight of ſtairs, but climb a hill from bottom to top, a-foot, and with the greateſt eaſe; that I am
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030282_0035_0FE59E9FDDBE9408"/>
always merry, always pleaſed, always in humour; maintaining a happy peace in my own mind, the ſweetneſs and ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whereof appear at all times in my countenance.</p>
               <p>BESIDES, they know that it is in my power to paſs away the time very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly; having nothing to hinder me from taſting all the pleaſures of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ſociety, with ſeveral perſons of parts and worth. When I am will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be alone, I read good books, and ſometimes fall to writing; ſeeking al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways an occaſion of being uſeful to the public, and doing ſervice to private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as far as poſſible. I do all this without the leaſt trouble; and in ſuch times as I ſet apart for theſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>I DWELL in a houſe, which, beſides its being ſituated in the pleaſanteſt part of <hi>Padua,</hi> may be looked on as the moſt convenient and agreeable manſion in
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030282_0036_0FE59EA26C09BE20"/>
that city. I there make me apartments proper for the winter and ſummer, which ſerve as a ſhelter to defend me from the extreme heat of the one, and the rigid coldneſs of the other. I walk out in my gardens, along my canals and walks; where I always meet with ſome little thing or other to do, which, at the ſame time, employs and amuſes me.</p>
               <p>I SPEND the months of <hi>April; May, September,</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> at my country-houſe, which is the fineſt ſituation ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable: the air of it is good, the avenues neat, the gardens magnificent, the waters clear and plentiful; and this ſeat may well paſs for an inchanted palace.</p>
               <p>SOMETIMES I take a walk to my <hi>Villa,</hi> all whoſe ſtreets terminate at a large ſquare; in the midſt of which is a pretty neat church, and large enough for the bigneſs of the pariſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:030282_0037_0FE59EA56C9446F8"/>
THROUGH this <hi>Villa</hi> runs a rivulet; and the country about it is enriched with fruitful and well cultivated fields; having at preſent a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of inhabitants. This was not ſo formerly: It was a marſhy place, and the air ſo unwholſome, that it was more proper for frogs and toads, than for men to dwell in. But on my draining off the waters, the air mended, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reſorted to it ſo faſt, as to render the place very populous; ſo that I may, with truth, ſay, that I have here dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the LORD, a church, altars, and hearts to worſhip him; a circumſtance this, which affords me infinite ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as often as I reflect on it.</p>
               <p>IT is with great ſatisfaction that I ſee the end of a work of ſuch importance to this STATE, I mean that of draining and improving ſo many large tracts of uncultivated ground, a work which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expected to have ſeen completed;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030282_0038_0FE59EA78DC46618"/>
but, thank GOD, I have lived to ſee it, and was even in perſon in theſe marſhy places, along with the commiſſaries, for two months together, during the heats of ſummer, without ever finding myſelf the worſe for the fatigues I underwent. Of ſuch wonderful efficacy is that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate life which I conſtantly obſerve.</p>
               <p>IF in diſcourſing on ſo important a ſubject as this, it be allowable to ſpeak of trifles, I might tell you, that at the age of fourſcore and three, a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate life had preſerved me in that ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of thought, and gaiety of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as to be able to compoſe a very entertaining comedy, highly moral and inſtructive, without ſhocking or diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the audience; an evil too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attending our comedies, and which it is the duty, and will be the eternal honor of the magiſtracy to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ſuppreſs, ſince nothing has a more fatal tendency to corrupt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030282_0039_0FE59EA9CABAD380"/>
of youth, than ſuch plays as abound with wanton alluſions, and wicked ſneers and ſcoffs on religion and matrimony.</p>
               <p>AS an addition to my happineſs, I ſee myſelf immortalized as it were, by the great number of my deſcendants. I meet with, on my return home, not only two or three, but eleven grand-children, all bleſt with high health, ſweet diſpoſitions, bright parts, and of promiſing hopes. I take a delight in playing with the little pratlers; thoſe who are older I often ſet to ſing and play for me on inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of muſic.—Call you this an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm crazy old age, as they pretend, who ſay, that a man is but half alive after he is ſeventy? They may believe me if they pleaſe, but really I would not exchange my ſerene chearful old age, with any one of thoſe young men, even of the beſt conſtitution, who give the looſe to their appetites; knowing as I do, that they are thereby ſubjecting
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030282_0040_0FE59EABEA1D8E20"/>
themſelves every moment to diſeaſe and death.</p>
               <p>I REMEMBER all the follies of which I was guilty in my younger days, and am perfectly ſenſible of the many and great dangers they expoſed me to. I know with what violence young perſons are carried away by the heat of their blood. They preſume on their ſtrength, juſt as if they had taken a ſure leaſe of their lives: and muſt gratify their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites whatever it coſt them, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that they thereby feed thoſe ill humours, which do moſt aſſuredly haſten the approach of <hi>ſickneſs</hi> and <hi>death;</hi> two evils, which of all others are the moſt unwelcome and terrible to the wicked. The firſt of theſe, <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> is highly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome, becauſe it effectually ſtops their career after this world's buſineſs and pleaſures, which being their ſole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and happineſs, muſt be inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſad and mortifying. And the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030282_0041_0FE59EB127E03C98"/>
and gloom of ſickneſs is rendered tenfold more inſupportable to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it finds them utterly deſtitute of thoſe pious affections, which alone can ſoothe the ſeverity of ſickneſs and charm the pangs of pain. They had never cultivated an acquaintance with GOD, nor accuſtomed themſelves to look up to him as to a merciful Father, who ſends affliction to wean us from this ſcene of vanity. They had never, by prayers and good works, endeavoured to ſecure his friendſhip, or cheriſh that love which would make his diſpenſations welcome. So that unbleſt with theſe divine conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, the ſeaſon of ſickneſs muſt be dark and melancholy indeed; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, their hearts often ſink within them at the proſpect of DEATH, that ghaſtly king of terrors, who comes to cut them off from all their dear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in this world, and ſend their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing ſouls to ſuffer the puniſhment
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030282_0042_0FE59EB2B81E3DD0"/>
which their own guilty conſcience tells them is due to their wicked lives.</p>
               <p>BUT from theſe two evils, ſo dreadful to many, bleſſed be GOD, I have but little to fear; for, as for <hi>death,</hi> I have a joyful hope that that change, come when it may, will be gloriouſly for the <hi>better;</hi> and beſides, I truſt, that HE whoſe divine voice I have ſo long obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will graciouſly ſupport and comfort his aged ſervant in that trying hour. And as for <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> I feel but little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion on that account, ſince by my divine medicine TEMPERANCE, I have removed all the cauſes of illneſs; ſo that I am pretty ſure I ſhall never be ſick, except it be from ſome intent of <hi>Divine</hi> mercy, and then I hope I ſhall bear it without a murmur, and find it for my good. Nay I have reaſon to think that my ſoul has ſo agreeable a dwelling in my body, finding nothing in it but peace and harmony between
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030282_0043_0FE59EB4C3C18858"/>
my reaſon and ſenſes, that ſhe is very well pleaſed with her preſent ſituation; ſo that I truſt I have ſtill a great many years to live in health and in ſpirits, and enjoy this beautiful world, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed beautiful to thoſe who know how to make it ſo, as I have done, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expect (with GOD'S aſſiſtance) to be able to do in the next.</p>
               <p>NOW ſince a regular life is ſo happy, and its bleſſings ſo permament and great, all I have ſtill left to do, (ſince I cannot accompliſh my wiſhes by force) is to beſeech every man of ſound under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to embrace, with open arms, this moſt valuable treaſure of a long and healthy life; a treaſure, which, as it far exceeds all the riches of this world, ſo it deſerves above all things to be diligently ſought after, and carefully preſerved. This is that divine ſobriety, ſo agreeable to the Deity, the friend of nature, the daughter of reaſon, and the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030282_0044_0FE59EB65634BCF8"/>
ſiſter of all the virtues. From her, as from their proper root, ſpring life, health, chearfulneſs, induſtry, learning, and all thoſe employments worthy of noble and generous minds. She is the beſt friend and ſafeſt guardian of life; as well of the rich as of the poor; of the old as of the young. She teaches the rich modeſty; the poor frugality; men continence; women chaſtity; the old, how to ward off the attacks of death; and beſtows on youth, firmer and ſecurer hopes of life. She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the ſenſes clear, the body light, the underſtanding lively, the ſoul briſk, the memory tenacious, our motions free, and all our faculties in a pleaſing and agreeable harmony.</p>
               <p>O MOST innocent and divine ſobriety! the ſole refreſhment of nature, the nurſing mother of life, the true phyſic of ſoul as well as of body. How ought men to praiſe thee for thy princely gifts,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030282_0045_0FE59EBD4FF933F0"/>
for thy incomparible bleſſings! But as no man is able to write a ſufficient pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric on this rare and excellent virtue, I ſhall put an end to this diſcourſe, leſt I ſhould be charged with exceſs in dwelling ſo long on ſo pleaſing a ſubject. Yet as numberleſs things may ſtill be ſaid of it, I leave off with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſet forth the reſt of its praiſes at a more convenient opportunity.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. THE METHOD OF CORRECTING A BAD CONSTITUTION.</head>
               <p>I WAS born with a very choleric, haſty diſpoſition; flew into a paſſion for the leaſt trifle, huffed every body about me, and was ſo intolerably diſagreeable, that many perſons of gentle manners abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030282_0046_0FE59EBF711B3E48"/>
ſhunned my company. On diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering how great an injury I was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf, I at once reſolved to make this vile temper give way to reaſon. I conſidered that a man overcome by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, muſt at times, be no better than a madman, and that the only difference between a paſſionate and a madman, is, that the one has loſt his reaſon for ever, and the other is deprived of it by fits only; but that in one of theſe, though never ſo ſhort, he may do ſome deed of cruelty or death, that will ruin his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and deſtroy his peace <hi>for ever.</hi> A ſober life, by cooling the fever of the blood, contributed much to cure me of this frenzy; and I am now become ſo moderate, and ſo much a maſter of my paſſion, that no body could perceive that it was born with me.</p>
               <p>IT is true indeed, the moſt temperate may ſometimes be indiſpoſed, but then they have the pleaſure to think that it
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030282_0047_0FE59EC120563A90"/>
is not the effect of their own vices; that it will be but moderate in its <hi>degree,</hi> and of ſhort continuance.</p>
               <p>MANY have ſaid to me, "<hi>How can you, when at a table covered with a dozen delicious diſhes content yourſelf with one diſh, and that the plaineſt too at the table? It muſt ſurely be a great mortification to you, to ſee ſo many charming things before you, and yet ſcarcely taſte them.</hi>" This queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has frequently been put to me, and with an air of ſurprize. I confeſs it has often made me unhappy; for it proves that ſuch perſons are got to ſuch a paſs, as to look on the gratification of their appetites as the higheſt happineſs, not conſidering that the mind is properly the man, and that it is in the affections of a virtuous and pious mind, a man is to look for his trueſt and higheſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. When I ſit down, with my eleven grand-children, to a table covered with various dainties, of which, for the ſake
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030282_0048_0FE59EC33081F418"/>
of a light eaſy ſtomach, I may not, at times, chuſe to partake, yet this is no mortificaton to me; on the contrary, I often find myſelf moſt happy at theſe times. How can it otherwiſe than give me great delight when I think of that goodneſs of GOD, which bleſſes the earth with ſuch immenſe ſtores of good things for the uſe of mankind; and which, over and above all this goodneſs, has put me into the way of getting ſuch an abundance of them for my dear grand-children; and, beſides muſt it not make me very happy to think that I have gotten ſuch a maſtery over myſelf as never to abuſe any of thoſe good things, but am perfectly contented with ſuch a portion of them as keeps me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in good health. O what a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of joy is this to my heart! What a ſad thing it is that young people will not take inſtruction, nor get benefit from thoſe who are older and wiſer than
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030282_0049_0FE59EC951FF8B40"/>
themſelves! I may uſe, in this matter, the words of the wiſe man, "I have ſeen all things that are done under the ſun." I know the pleaſures of eating, and I know the joys of a virtuous mind, and can ſay from long experience, that the one excelleth the other as far as light excelleth darkneſs; the one are the pleaſures of a mere animal, the other thoſe of an angel.</p>
               <p>SOME are ſo thoughtleſs as to ſay, that they had rather be afflicted twice or thrice a year with the gout, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtempers, than deny themſelves the pleaſure of eating and drinking to the full of ſuch things as they like; that for their part they had rather eat and drink as they like, though it ſhould ſhorten their lives, that is, "give them a ſhort life and a merry one." It is really a ſurpriſing and <hi>ſad</hi> thing, to ſee reaſonable creatures, ſo ready to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the moſt dangerous abſurdities. For
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030282_0050_0FE59ECB350CA488"/>
how, in the name of common ſenſe, can the life of a glutton or a ſot be a merry one? If men could eat to exceſs, drink to ſillineſs, and ruſt in ſloth, and after all, ſuffer no other harm than the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of ten or a dozen years of life, they might have ſome little excuſe for calling it a merry life, though ſurely it could appear ſo to none but perſons of a ſadly vitiated taſte. But ſince an intemperate life will aſſuredly ſow in our bodies the ſeeds of ſuch diſeaſes as will, after a few ſhort years of feveriſh pleaſure, make life a burthen to us, with what face can any reaſonable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing call this a merry life?</p>
               <p>O SACRED and moſt bountiful Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance! how greatly am I indebted to thee for reſcuing me from ſuch fatal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions; and for bringing me, through the divine benediction, to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo many felicities, and which, over and above all theſe favours confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030282_0051_0FE59ECD3A49A950"/>
on thine old man, haſt ſo ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened his ſtomach, that he has now a better reliſh for his dry bread than he had formerly for the moſt exquiſite dainties, ſo that, by eating little, my ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is often craving after the manna, which I ſometimes feaſt on with ſo much pleaſure, that I ſhould think I treſpaſſed on the duty of temperance, did I not know that one muſt eat to ſupport life; and that one cannot uſe a plainer or more natural diet.</p>
               <p>MY ſpirits are not injured by what I eat, they are only revived and ſupported by it. I can, immediately on riſing from table, ſet myſelf to write or ſtudy, and never find that this application, though ſo hurtful to hearty feeders, does me any harm; and, beſides, I never find myſelf drowſey after dinner, as a great many do;—the reaſon is, I feed ſo temperately, as never to load my ſtomach nor oppreſs my nerves, ſo
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030282_0052_0FE59ECF527D2F50"/>
that I am always as light, active, and chearful after meals as before.</p>
               <p>O THOU vile wicked intemperance, my ſworn enemy, who art good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to murder thoſe who follow thee; how many of my deareſt friends haſt thou robbed me of, in conſequence of their not believing me! But thou haſt not been able to deſtroy me accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy wicked intent and purpoſe. I am ſtill alive in ſpite of thee, and have attained to ſuch an age, as to ſee around me eleven dear grand-children, all of fine underſtandings, and amiable diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, all given to learning and virtue; all beautiful in their perſons and lovely in their manners, whom, had I not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned thee thou infamous ſource of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, I ſhould never have had the pleaſure to behold. Nor ſhould I enjoy thoſe beautiful and convenient apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I have built from the ground, with ſuch highly improved gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030282_0053_0FE59ED2F5E4FF40"/>
as required no ſmall time to attain their preſent perfection. No, thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed hag, thy nature is to impoveriſh and deſtroy thoſe who follow thee. How many wretched orphans have I ſeen embracing dunghills; how many miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mothers, with their helpleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, crying for bread, while their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded fathers, ſlaves to thy devouring luſts, were waſting their ſubſtance in rioting and drunkenneſs!</p>
               <p>BUT thou art not content with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the ſubſtance, thou wouldeſt deſtroy the very families of thoſe who are ſo mad as to obey thee. The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate poor man who labours hard all day, can boaſt a numerous family of roſy cheeked children, while thy pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered ſlaves, ſunk in eaſe and luxury, often languiſh without an heir to their ample fortunes. But ſince thou art ſo peſtilential a vice, as to poiſon and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the greateſt part of mankind, I
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030282_0054_0FE59ED48F4D34B0"/>
am determined to uſe my utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to extirpate thee, at leaſt in part. And I promiſe myſelf, that my dear grand-children will declare eternal war againſt thee, and following my example, will let the world ſee the bleſſedneſs of a temperate life, and ſo expoſe thee, O cruel intemperance! for what thou real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly art, a moſt wicked, deſperate, and mortal enemy of the children of men.</p>
               <p>IT is really a very ſurpriſing and ſad thing to ſee perſons grown to men's eſtate, and of fine wit, yet unable to govern their appetites, but tamely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to be dragged by them into ſuch exceſſes of eating and drinking, as not only to ruin the beſt conſtitutions, and ſhorten their lives, but eclipſe the luſtre of the brighteſt parts, and bury them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in utter contempt and uſeleſſneſs. O what promiſſing hopes have been ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecked, what immortal honours have been ſacrificed at the ſhrine of low ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality;
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030282_0055_0FE59ED69AB0EA90"/>
Happy, thrice happy, thoſe who have early been inured to habits of ſelf-denial, and taught to conſider the gratification of their appetites as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing ſource of diſeaſes and death. Ye generous parents who long to ſee your children adorned with virtue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved as the benefactors of their kind; O teach them the unſpeakable worth of ſelf government. Unſupported by this, every advantage of education and opportunity will avail them but little: though the hiſtory of ancient worthies, and the recital of their illuſtrious deeds, may at times kindle up in their boſoms a flame of glorious emulation, yet alas! this glow of coveted virtue, this fluſh of promiſed honor, is tranſient as a gleam of winter ſunſhine; ſoon overſpread and obſcured by the dark clouds of ſenſuality.</p>

               <p>WHAT thanks do we not owe to the divine goodneſs, for this wonderful invention of writing, whereby we can eaſily communicate to our abſent friends, whatever may afford them plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or improvement! By means of this moſt welcome contrivance, I ſhall now endeavour to entertain you with matters of the greateſt moment. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that what I have to tell you is no news,—but I never told it you at the age of <hi>ninety-one.</hi> Is it not a charming thing, that I am able to tell you, that my health and ſtrength are in ſo excellent a
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030282_0057_0FE59EDEA96726D0"/>
ſtate, that, inſtead of diminiſhing with my age, they ſeem to increaſe as I grow old? All my acquaintance are ſurpriſed at it; but I, who know the cauſe of this ſingular happineſs, do every where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it. I endeavour, as much as in me lies, to convince all mankind, that a man may enjoy a paradiſe on earth even after the age of four-ſcore.</p>
               <p>Now my Lord, I muſt tell you, that within theſe few days paſt, ſeveral learned Doctors of this Univerſity came to be informed by me, of the method I take in my diet, having underſtood that I am ſtill healthful and ſtrong; that I have my ſenſes perfect; that my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, my heart, my judgment, the tone of my voice, and my teeth, are all as ſound as in my youth; that I write ſeven or eight hours a day, and ſpend the reſt of the day in walking out a-foot, and in taking all the innocent pleaſures that are
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030282_0058_0FE59EE09F6EF770"/>
allowed to a virtuous man; even mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic itſelf in which I hear my part.</p>
               <p>AH, Sir! how ſweet a voice would you perceive mine to be, were you to hear me, like another <hi>David,</hi> chant forth the praiſes of GOD to the found of my Lyre! You would certainly be ſurpriſed and charmed with the harmony which I make. Thoſe gentlemen particularly admired, with what eaſineſs I write on ſubjects that require both judgment and ſpirit.</p>
               <p>THEY told me, that I ought not to be looked on as an old man, ſince all my employments were ſuch as were proper for a youth, and did by no means reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the works of men advanced in years; who are capable of doing nothing after fourſcore, but loaded with infirmities and diſtempers, are perpetually languiſhing in pain, not half ſo chearful, pleaſant and happy as I am.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:030282_0059_0FE59F3AF7050988"/>
SEVERAL phyſicians were ſo good as to prognoſticate to me, ten years ago, that it was impoſſible for me to hold out three years longer: however, I ſtill find myſelf leſs weak than ever, and am ſtronger this year than any that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This ſort of miracle, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny favours which I received from GOD, obliged them to tell me, that I brought along with me at my birth, an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and ſpecial gift of nature; and for the proof their opinion, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all their rhetoric, and made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral elegant ſpeeches on that head. It muſt be acknowledged, my Lord, that eloquence has a charming force on the mind of man, ſince it often perſuades him to believe that which never was, and never could be. I was very much pleaſed to hear them diſcourſe; and could it be helped, ſince they were men of parts who harangued at that rate? But that which delighted me moſt,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030282_0060_0FE59F4C0D47C7C0"/>
was to reflect, that age and experience may render a man wiſer than all the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges in the world can. And it was in truth by their help, that I knew the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of that notion. To undeceive thoſe gentlemen, and at the ſame time ſet them right, I replied, that their way of arguing was not juſt: that the favour I received was no ſpecial, but a general and univerſal one: that I was but a man as well as others: that we have all judgment and reaſon, which the Creator has beſtowed on us to preſerve our lives: that man, when young, being more ſubject to ſenſe than reaſon, is too apt to give himſelf up to pleaſure; and that when arrived to thirty or forty years of age, he ought to conſider, that, if he has been ſo imprudent as to lead, till that time, a diſorderly life, it is now high time for him to take up and live temperately; for he ought to remember, that though he has hitherto been held up by the vigour of
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030282_0061_0FE59EE2343F9858"/>
youth and a good conſtitution, yet he is now at the noon of life, and muſt bethink himſelf of going down towards the grave, with a heavy weight of years on his back, of which his frequent pains and infirmities are certain forerunners; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if he has not been ſo happy as to do it already, he ought now, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to change his courſe of life</p>
               <p>I MUST confeſs, it was not without great reluctance that I abandoned my luxurious way of living. I began with praying to GOD, that he would grant me the gift of Temperance, well knowing that he always hears our prayers with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Then, conſidering, that when a man is about to undertake any thing of importance, he may greatly ſtrengthen himſelf in it, by often looking forward to the great pleaſures and advantages that he is to derive from it. Juſt as the huſbandman takes comfort under his toils, by reflecting on the ſweets of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030282_0062_0FE59EE4743697A8"/>
and as the good chriſtian glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens in the ſervice of GOD, when he thinks on the glory of that ſervice, and the eternal joys that await him; ſo I, in like manner, by ſeriouſly reflecting on the innumerable pleaſures and bleſſings of health, and beſeeching GOD to ſtrengthen me in my good reſolutions, immediately entered on a courſe of temperance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. And though it was at firſt highly diſagreeable, yet I can truly ſay, that in a very little time, the diſagreeableneſs vaniſhed, and I came to find great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it.</p>
               <p>Now on hearing my arguments, they all agreed that I had ſaid nothing but what was reaſonable; nay, the youngeſt among them told me, that he was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to allow that theſe advantages might be common to all men, but was afraid, they were ſeldom attained; and that I muſt be ſingularly favoured of Heaven to get above the delights of an eaſy life,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030282_0063_0FE59EE99BCF1848"/>
and embrace one quite contrary to it; that he did not look on it to be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſince my practice convinced him of the contrary, but however, it ſeemed to him to be very difficult.</p>
               <p>I REPLIED, that it was a ſhame to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh a good undertaking on account of the difficulties that might attend it, and that the greater the difficulty, the more glory ſhould we acquire: that it is the will of the Creator, that every one ſhould attain to a long life, becauſe in his old age, he might be freed from the bitter fruits that were produced by ſenſe, and might enjoy the good effects of his reaſon; that when he ſhakes hands with his vices, he is no longer a ſlave to the devil, and finds himſelf in a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of providing for the ſalvation of his ſoul: that GOD, whoſe goodneſs is infinite, has ordained that the man who comes to the end of his race, ſhould end his life without any diſtemper, and ſo
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030282_0064_0FE59EEB382EFEE0"/>
paſs, by a ſweet and eaſy death, to a life of immortality and glory, which I expect. I hope (ſaid I to him) to die ſinging the praiſes of my Creator. The ſad reflection, that we muſt one day ceaſe to live, is no diſturbance to me, though I eaſily preceive, that at my age, that day cannot be far off; nor am I afraid of the terrors of hell, becauſe, bleſſed be GOD, I have long ago ſhaken hands with my ſins, and put my truſt in the mercy and merits of the blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this my young antagoniſt had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay, only that he was reſolved to lead a ſober life, that he might live and die as happily as I hoped to do; and that though hitherto he had wiſhed to be young a long time, yet now he deſired to be quickly old, that he might enjoy the pleaſures of ſuch an admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able age.</p>
               <p>

SOME ſenſual perſons give out, that I have troubled myſelf to no purpoſe, in compoſing a treatiſe concerning tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and that I have loſt my time in endeavouring to perſuade men to the practice of that which is impoſſible. Now this ſurpriſes me the more, as theſe gentlemen muſt ſee that I had led a temperate life many years before I compoſed this treatiſe, and that I never ſhould have put myſelf to the trouble of compoſing it, had not long experience convinced me, that it is a life which any man may eaſily lead, who really wiſhes to be healthy and happy. And, beſides the evidence of my own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I have the ſatisfaction to hear, that numbers on ſeeing my treatiſe have embraced ſuch a life, and enjoyed from it the very ſame bleſſings which I enjoy. Hence, I conclude, that no man of good ſenſe will pay any regard to ſo frivolous an objection. The truth is, thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030282_0066_0FE59EEF7121BA70"/>
who make this objection, are ſo unhappily wedded to the poor pleaſure of eating and drinking, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think of moderating it, and as an excuſe for themſelves, they chooſe to talk at this extravagant rate. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I pity theſe gentlemen with all my heart, though they deſerve for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, to be tormented with a complication of diſtempers, and to be the victims of their paſſions a whole eternity.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030282_0067_0FE59EF4EA7195D8"/>
affords; I again take up my pen. What I am going to ſay will be looked on as impoſſible, or incredible; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more certain, nor more worthily to be admired by all poſterity. I am now ninety-five years of age, and find myſelf as healthy and briſk, as if I were but twenty-five.</p>
               <p>WHAT ingratitude ſhould I be guilty of, did I not return thanks to the divine Goodneſs, for all his favors conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me? Moſt of your old men have ſcarce arrived to ſixty, but they find themſelves loaded with infirmities: they are melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, unhealthful; always full of the frightful apprehenſions of dying: they tremble day and night for fear of being within one foot of their graves; and are ſo ſtrongly poſſeſſed with the dread of it, that it is a hard matter to divert them from that doleful thought. Bleſſed be GOD, I am free from their ills and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. It is my opinion, that I ought
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030282_0068_0FE59EF7ABD5AE00"/>
not to abandon myſelf to that vain fear: this I will make appear by the ſequel.</p>
               <p>SOME there are, who bring along with them a ſtrong conſtitution into the world, and live to old age: but it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally (as already obſerved) an old age of ſickneſs and ſorrow; for which they are to thank themſelves; becauſe they moſt unreaſonably preſume on the ſtrength of their conſtitution; and will not on any account, abate of that hearty feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which they indulged in their young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er days. Juſt as if they were to be as vigorous at fourſcore as in the flower of their youth; nay, they go about to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify this their imprudence, pretending that as we loſe our health and vigor by growing old, we ſhould endeavour to repair the loſs, by increaſing the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our food, ſince it is by ſuſtenance that man is preſerved.</p>
               <p>BUT in this they are dangerouſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; for as the natural heat and
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030282_0069_0FE59EF9B2193200"/>
ſtrength of the ſtomach leſſens as a man grows in years, he ſhould diminiſh the quantity of his meat and drink, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prudence requiring that a man ſhould proportion his diet to his digeſtive powers.</p>
               <p>THIS is a certain truth, that ſharp four humours on the ſtomach, proceed from a ſlow imperfect digeſtion; and that but little good chyle can be made, when the ſtomach is filled with freſh food be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it has carried off the former meal.—It cannot therefore be too frequently, nor too earneſtly recommended, that as the natural heat decays by age, a man ought to abate the quantity of what he eats and drinks; nature requiring but very little for the healthy ſupport of the life of man, eſpecially that of an old man. Would my aged friends but attend to this ſingle precept which has been ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſerviceable to me, they would not be troubled with one twentieth of thoſe
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030282_0070_0FE59EFBDECF0DF0"/>
infirmities which now harraſs and make their lives ſo miſerable. They would be light, active, and chearful like me, who am now near my <hi>hundredth year.</hi> And thoſe of them who were born with good conſtitutions, might live to the age of one hundred and twenty. Had I been bleſt with a robuſt conſtitution, I ſhould in all probability, attain the ſame age. But as I was born with feeble ſtamina, I ſhall not perhaps outlive an hundred. And this moral certainty of living to a great age is to be ſure, a moſt pleaſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable attainment, and it is the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of none but the temperate. For all thoſe who (by immoderate eating and drinking) fill their bodies with groſs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, can have no reaſonable aſſurance of living a ſingle day longer: oppreſſed with food and ſwoln with ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, they are in continual danger of violent fits of the cholic, deadly ſtrokes of the apoplexy, fatal attacks of the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030282_0071_0FE59F009F4733C0"/>
cholera morbus, burning fevers, and many ſuch acute and violent diſeaſes, whereby thouſands are carried to their graves, who a few hours before looked very hale and hearty. And this moral certainty of long life is built on ſuch good grounds as ſeldom ever fail. For, generally ſpeaking, Almighty GOD ſeems to have ſettled his works on the ſure grounds of natural cauſes, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is (by divine appointment) the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſe of health and long life. Hence it is next to impoſſible, that he who leads a ſtrictly temperate life, ſhould breed any ſickneſs or die of an unnatural death, before he attains to the years to which the natural ſtrength of his conſtitution was to arrive. I know ſome perſons are ſo weak as to excuſe their wicked intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, by ſaying, that "the race is not always to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong," and that therefore, let them eat and drink as they pleaſe, they ſhall
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030282_0072_0FE59F026F865220"/>
not die till their time comes. How ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly do theſe men miſunderſtand So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon and abuſe truth! How would it ſtartle us to hear our friends ſay, "that let them ſleep and play, as they pleaſe, they ſhall not be beggars till their time comes."</p>
               <p>SOLOMON does indeed ſay, that "the race is not always to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong;" but he muſt be no better than a madman, who thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that it is not <hi>generally</hi> ſo. For the invariable and eternal experience of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind demonſtrates, that ninety-nine times in an hundred, the race is to the ſwift, and the battle to the ſtrong, bread to the induſtrious, and health to the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>BUT it is a matter of fact, and not to be denied, that, though temperance has the divine efficacy to ſecure us from violent diſeaſe and unnatural death, yet it is not to be ſuppoſed to make a man immortal. It
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030282_0073_0FE59F048FABB418"/>
is impoſſible but that time, which effaces all things, ſhould likewiſe deſtroy that moſt curious workmanſhip of GOD, the human body: but it is man's privilege to end his days by a natural death, that is, without pain and agony, as they will ſee me, when the heat and ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is quite exhauſted. But I promiſe myſelf, that day is a pretty comfortable diſtance off yet, and I fancy I am not miſtaken, becauſe I am ſtill healthy and briſk, reliſh all I eat, ſleep quietly, and find no defect in any of my ſenſes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, all the faculties of my mind are in the higheſt perfection; my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear and bright as ever; my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſound; my memory tenacious; my ſpirits good; and my voice, the firſt thing that fails others, ſtill ſo ſtrong and ſonorous, that every morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with my dear grand-children around me, I can addreſs my prayers and chant the praiſes of the Almighty. O, how
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030282_0074_0FE59F06222BA670"/>
glorious this life of mine is like to be, replete with all the felicities which man can enjoy on this ſide of the grave; and exempt from that ſenſual brutality which age has enabled my better reaſon to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and therewith all its bitter fruits, the extravagant paſſions and diſtreſsful perturbations of mind. Nor yet can the fears of death find room in my mind as I have no licenſed ſins, to cheriſh ſuch gloomy thoughts: neither can the death of relations and friends give me any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grief than that of the firſt move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of nature, which cannot be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but is of no long continuance. Still leſs am I liable to be caſt down by the loſs of wordly goods. I look on theſe things as the property of heaven; I can thank him for the loan of ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and when his wiſdom ſees fit to withdraw them, I can look on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture without murmuring.—This is the happineſs of thoſe only, who grow
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030282_0075_0FE59F0B148FA818"/>
old in the ways of temperance and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; a happineſs which ſeldom attends the moſt flouriſhing youth who live in vice. Such are all ſubject to a thouſand diſorders, both of body and mind, from which I am entirely free: on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I enjoy a thouſand pleaſures, which are as pure as they are calm.</p>
               <p>THE firſt of theſe is to do ſervice to my country. O! what a glorious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, in which I find infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, in ſhewing my countrymen how to fortify this our dear city of Venice, in ſo excellent a manner, as to make her a famous republic, a rich and matchleſs city. Another amuſement of mine is, that of ſhewing this maid and queen of cities, in what manner ſhe may always abound with proviſions, by manuring untilled lands, draining marſhes, and laying under water, and thereby fatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fields, which had all along been barren for want of moiſture. My third
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030282_0076_0FE59F0D7388E6D0"/>
amuſement is in ſhewing my native city, how, though already ſtrong, ſhe may be rendered much ſtronger; and, tho' extremely beautiful, may ſtill increaſe in beauty; though rich, may acquire more wealth, and may be made to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy better air, though her air is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Theſe three amuſements, all ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the idea of public utility, I enjoy in the higheſt degree. Another very great comfort I enjoy is, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been defrauded when young, of a conſiderable eſtate, I have made ample amends for that loſs, by dint of thought and induſtry, and without the leaſt wrong done to any perſon, have doubled my income, ſo that I am able not only to provide for my dear grand-children, but to educate and aſſiſt many poor youth to begin the world. And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help ſaying, I reflect with more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on what I lay out in that way, than in any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:030282_0077_0FE59F0FA31CA1D8"/>
ANOTHER very conſiderable addition to my happineſs is, that what I have written from my own experience, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to recommend <hi>temperance,</hi> has been of great uſe to numbers, who loudly proclaim their obligations to me for that work, ſeveral of them having ſent me word from foreign parts, that, under GOD, they are indebted to me for their lives. But that which makes me look on myſelf as one of the happieſt of men, is, that I enjoy as it were, two ſorts of lives; the one terreſtrial, which I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs in fact; the other celeſtial, which I poſſeſs in thought; and this thought is attended with unutterable delight, being founded on ſuch glorious objects, which I am morally ſure of obtaining, through the infinite goodneſs and mercy of GOD. Thus I enjoy this terreſtrial life, partly through the beneficent influences of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and ſobriety, virtues ſo pleaſing to heaven; and I enjoy, through cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030282_0078_0FE59F11353137D0"/>
love of the ſame divine Majeſty, the celeſtial life, by contemplating ſo often on the happineſs thereof, that I can hardly think of any thing elſe. And I hold, that dying in the manner I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, is not really death, but a paſſage of the ſoul from this earthly life, to a celeſtial, immortal, and infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect exiſtence. And I am ſo far charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the glorious elevation to which I think my ſoul is deſigned, that I can no longer ſtoop to thoſe trifles, which, alas! charm and infatuate too great a part of mankind. The proſpect of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my favourite enjoyments of this life, gives me but little concern; on the contrary, I thank GOD, I often think of it with ſecret joy, ſince by that loſs I am to gain a life incomparably more happy.</p>
               <p>O! WHO then would be troubled, were he in my place? what good man, but muſt inſtantly throw off his load of
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030282_0079_0FE59F15010DAB28"/>
worldly ſorrow, and addreſs his grateful homage to the Author of all this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? However, there is not a man on earth, who may not hope for the like happineſs, if he would but live as I do. For indeed I am no angel, but only a man, a ſervant of GOD, to whom a good and temperate life is ſo pleaſing, that even in this world he greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe who practiſe it.</p>
               <p>AND whereas many embrace a holy and contemplative life, teaching and preaching the great truths of religion, which is <hi>highly</hi> commendable, the chief employment of ſuch being to lead men to the knowledge and worſhip of GOD. O that they would likewiſe betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves entirely to a regular and temperate life! They would then be conſidered as ſaints indeed upon earth, as thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive chriſtians were, who obſerved ſo conſtant a temperance, and lived ſo long. By living like them, to the age of one
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030282_0080_0FE59F17FB0DBCA0"/>
hundred and twenty, they might make ſuch a proficiency in holineſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo dear to GOD, as to do the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt honour and ſervice to the world; and they would beſides, enjoy conſtant health and ſpirits, and be always happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves; whereas they are now too often infirm and melancholy. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are melancholy, becauſe they ſee GOD, (after all his goodneſs) ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully requitted; or becauſe they ſee men (notwithſtanding their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable obligations to love) yet hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and grieving each other: ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy is truly amiable and divine.</p>
               <p>BUT to be melancholy on any other account, is, to ſpeak the truth, quite unnatural to good chriſtians; ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being the ſervants of GOD and heirs of immortality; and it is ſtill more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming the miniſters of religion, who ought to conſider themſelves, as of all
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030282_0081_0FE59F1A19BFC048"/>
others, in the moſt important, ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and delightful employment.</p>
               <p>I KNOW, many of theſe gentlemen think that GOD does purpoſely bring theſe occaſions of melancholy on them that they may in this life do penance for their former ſins; but therein, as I think, they are much miſtaken. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive, how GOD, who loves mankind, can be delighted with their ſufferings. He deſires that mankind ſhould be happy, both in this world and the next; he tells us ſo in a thouſand places in his word, and we actually find that there is not a man on earth, who does not feel the good Spirit of GOD, forbidding and condemning thoſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courſes, which would rob him of that happineſs. No; it is the devil and ſin which bring all the evils we ſuffer, on our heads, and not GOD, who is our Creator and Father, and deſires our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: his commands tend to no other
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030282_0082_0FE59F1BAB4A65C0"/>
purpoſe. And temperance would not be a virtue, if the benefit it does us by preſerving us from diſtempers, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the deſigns of GOD in our old age.</p>
               <p>IN ſhort, if all religious people were ſtrictly temperate and holy, how beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, how glorious a ſcene ſhould we then behold! Such numbers of vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able old men as would create ſurpriſe. How many wiſe and holy teachers to edify the people by their wholeſome preaching and good examples! How many ſinners might receive benefit by their fervent interceſſions! How many bleſſings might they ſhower upon the earth! and not as now, eating and drinking ſo intemperately, as to inflame the blood and excite worldly paſſions, pride, ambition, and concupiſcence, ſoiling the purity of their minds, check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their growth in holineſs, and in ſome unguarded moment, betraying
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030282_0083_0FE59F1F6CBA2260"/>
them into ſins diſgraceful to religion, and ruinous to their peace for life.—Would they but feed temperately, and that chiefly on vegetable food, they would as I do, ſoon find it the moſt agreeable, (by the cool temperate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours it affords) the beſt friend to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous improvement, begetting gentle manners, mild affections, purity of thought, heavenly mindedneſs, quick reliſh of virtue, and delight in GOD. This was the life led by the holy fathers of old, who ſubſiſted entirely on vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, drinking nothing but pure water, and yet lived to an extreme old age, in good health and ſpirits, and always happy within themſelves. And ſo may all in our days live, provided they would but mortify the luſts of a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible body, and devote themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the exalted ſervice of GOD; for this is indeed the privilege of every faithful chriſtian as Jeſus Chriſt left it,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030282_0084_0FE59F224D3443A8"/>
when he came down upon earth to ſhed his precious blood, in order to deliver us from the tyrannical ſervitude of the devil; and all through his immenſe goodneſs.</p>
               <p>TO conclude, ſince length of days abounds with ſo many bleſſings, and I am ſo happy as to have arrived at that ſtate, I find myſelf bound (in charity) to give teſtimony in favour of it, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly aſſure all mankind, that I really enjoy a great deal more than what I now mention; and that I have no other motive in writing on this ſubject, than to engage them to practiſe, all their lives, thoſe excellent virtues of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſobriety, which will bring them, like me, to a happy old age. And therefore I never ceaſe to raiſe my voice, crying out to you, my friends, may your days be many, that you may long ſerve GOD, and be fitter for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which he prepares for his children!</p>

meats of the eaſieſt digeſtion, with a glaſs or two of generous wine at each meal, and all taken in ſuch prudent modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as not to load but ſtrengthen the conſtitution. For at this critical junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a ſingle act of intemperance, which would ſcarcely be felt in the wholeſome froſts of winter, often turns the ſcale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature, and brings on obſtinate indigeſtion, load at ſtomach, loſs of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, a furred tongue, yellowneſs of eyes, bitter taſte in the mouth in the morning, bilious vomitings, agues, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, &amp;c. which in ſpite of the beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, often wear a man away to a ghoſt.

               <p>THOSE who, by any accident, have loſt a meal, (ſuppoſe their dinner) ought not to eat a plentiful ſupper; for it will lie heavy on their ſtomach, and they will have a more reſtleſs night than if they had both dined and ſupped heartily. He therefore, who has miſſed his dinner,

"If thou haſt been forced to eat, ariſe, go forth and puke, and thou ſhalt have reſt." And moſt certain it is, (adds an ingenious phyſician) that hundreds and thouſands have brought ſickneſs and death on themſelves, by their ignorance or neglect of this rule.

The only medicine in this caſe, is moderate exerciſe, innocent amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a little abſtinence, this is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's own preſcription, as appears by her taking away his appetite. But having long placed his happineſs in eating and drinking, he cannot think of relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a gratification ſo dear to him, and ſo ſets himſelf to force an appetite by drams, ſlings, elixir of vitriol, wine and bitters, pickles, ſauces, &amp;c. and on the credit of this artificial appetite, feeds again as if he poſſeſſed the moſt vigorous health. He now finds himſelf <hi>entirely</hi> diſordered, general heavineſs and wearineſs of body, flatulent uneaſineſs, frequent eructations, loſs of appetite, diſturbed ſlumbers, frightful dreams, bitter taſte in the mouth, &amp;c. He now complains of a foul ſtomach, or (in his own words) that his ſtomach is full of bile; and immediately
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030282_0091_0FE59F36E8D2CA58"/>
takes a doſe of tartar emetic or a ſtrong purgative, to cleanſe out his ſtomach, and ſo prepare for another courſe of high living. Of all the Apollyons or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of nerves, health and life, this is the greateſt; and I have no ſort of doubt on my own mind but it has broken down more conſtitutions, brought on more diſtempers, and ſent more people to an early grave, than all the vices of this bedlam world put together. How much wiſer would it be in this caſe to follow the advice of the celebrated Boerhaave, i. e. to uſe a little abſtinence, take mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exerciſe, and thereby help nature to carry off her crudities and recover her ſprings.

               <p>IT is really ſurpriſing (ſays Plutarch) what benefit men of letters would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from reading aloud every day; we ought therefore to make that exerciſe familiar to us, but it ſhould not be done immediately after dinner, nor fatigue, for that error has proved hurtful to many.

               <p>NOTHING is more injurous to health than hard ſtudy at night; it is invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the order of nature, and ruining the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>BUT moſt of all, it is improper to lie reading in bed by candle light; for it not only partakes of the uſual inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of night ſtudy, ſuch as ſtraining the eyes, weakening the ſight, fatiguing the mind, and wearing away the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but is oft-times the cauſe of the ſaddeſt calamities; thouſands of elegant houſes, with all their coſtly furniture, have been reduced to aſhes by this very imprudent practice.</p>
               <p>BUT how can giddy youth, hurried on by ſtrong paſſions and appetites, be prevented from running into thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, which may cut them off in the prime of their days, or at leaſt hoard up
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030282_0096_0FE59F4251664110"/>
diſeaſes and remorſe for old age? Why, their paſſions and appetites muſt early be reſtrained by proper diſcipline and example. This important office muſt be done by their parents, whoſe firſt and greateſt care ſhould be "to train up their children in the way they ſhould go, that when they are old they may not depart from it."</p>
               <p>"O THAT parents (ſays the excellent Mr. Locke) would carefully inſtil into their children that great principle of all virtue and worth, <abbr>viz.</abbr> nobly to deny themſelves every wrong deſire, and ſteadily follow what reaſon dictates as beſt, though the appetite ſhould lean the other way. We often ſee parents by humouring them when little, corrupt the principles of virtue in their children; and wonder afterwards to taſte the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waters of their undutifulneſs or wickedneſs, when they themſelves have contributed thereto. Why ſhould we
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:030282_0097_0FE59F447AE42C00"/>
wonder that he who has been accuſtomed to have his will in every thing, when he was in coats, ſhould deſire and contend for it when he is in breeches? Youth is the golden ſeaſon to inure the mind to the practice of virtue, on which their future health and reſpectability depend, and without which it will be impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their conſtitutions, unbroken, to manhood and old age. Vice is utterly inconſiſtent with health, which can never dwell with lewdneſs, luxury, ſloth and violent paſſions. The life of the epicure and rake, is not only ſhort, but miſerable. It would ſhock the modeſt and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, to hear of thoſe exquiſite pains, and dreadful agonies, which profligate young perſons ſuffer from their debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries, before they can even reach the friendly ſhelter of an untimely <hi>grave.</hi> Or if ſome few ſtop ſhort in their career of riot, before they have quite deſtroyed the ſprings of life, yet thoſe ſprings are

                  <hi>THERE is ſcarcely among the evils of life, any ſo generally dreaded as poverty. Many other kinds of miſery a man may eaſily forget, becauſe they do not always force themſelves upon his regards. But it is impoſſible to paſs a day or an hour, in the company of men without ſeeing how much poverty is expoſed to neglect and inſult; and in its</hi> loweſt <hi>ſtate, to hunger and</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="unknown:030282_0101_0FE59866B345CB20"/>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>OF theſe calamities, mankind in general ſeem to be ſenſible. We hear on every ſide the noiſe of trade; and ſee the ſtreets thronged with numberleſs multitudes, whoſe faces are clouded with anxiety, and whoſe ſteps are hurried by precipitation, from no other motive than the hope of gain. The whole world is put in motion by the deſire of that wealth, which is chiefly to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued as it ſecures us from poverty and its miſeries. But there are always ſome whoſe paſſions or follies lead them to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct widely different from the general prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of mankind. I mean the thoughtleſs and the negligent, who, from an exceſs of careleſſneſs, or the ſeductions of company, indulge habits of pleaſure and expence above their fortunes; and thus miſpend their time, or waſte the inheritance of</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="unknown:030282_0102_0FE5986836475708"/>
                  <hi>their fathers, without ever ſeeming to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the great ſacrifice they are making, or the gulph to which they approach, till poverty, like an unexpected winter, comes upon them with all its chilling calamities, and awakens them to a pungent ſenſe of their folly and wretchedneſs. The young, and thoſe of the moſt generous and unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting tempers, often fall into this evil net, out of which they ſeldom eſcape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering injuries, which they painfully feel and ſeriouſly lament through life. No man had a heart more diſpoſed to pity, nor a head more able to counſel theſe</hi> unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, <hi>than the ſage</hi> Dr. FRANKLIN, <hi>the friend of man, and the great economiſt of</hi> AMERICA. <hi>His little work, entitled,</hi> "THE WAY TO WEALTH," <hi>is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally conſidered as a maſter-piece, on the art of making and preſerving a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But before we give the Reader a ſight of this, we will exhibit to his view ſome of the many felicities of wealth, that</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="unknown:030282_0103_0FE59878B003F248"/>
                  <hi>on ſeeing how much happineſs he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from it to himſelf, and how many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he may therewith confer on others, he may apply with vigor and perſeverance to the means conducive to ſo deſireable an end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the firſt place—<hi>WEALTH always commands reſpect, unleſs its owner be an infamous wretch indeed; and even in that deplorable caſe, it has the magic powers of charity, to cover and hide a multitude of fins. It gives a man an air of conſequence, and like true beauty, without any exertion of its own, wins the favour of all behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. When the rich man goes into compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, every body riſe up to ſalute him: no features too hard to aſſume a ſmile; no back ſo ſtiff but can afford him a bow. He is placed in the uppermoſt ſeat at the table, and men covet to direct their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to him.</hi> The poor man ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but no one regardeth: the rich
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030282_0104_0FE59883472A88A0"/>
openeth his mouth, and lo! ſilence is kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WHAT can be more pleaſing to a man than to ſee himſelf thus honoured by his friends? But beſides this ſatisfaction, which to the good, is very exquiſite; it has a very happy moral effect on the mind. In a mind poſſeſſed of common ſenſibility, it muſt kindle the ſoft fire of good humour, and good humour naturally inſpires benevolence and affection. Whence we infer, that a rich man, who is prudent, ſtands a much fairer chance to be good humoured than the poor, whoſe poverty expoſes them to ſuch frequent ſlights and neglects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the ſecond place—<hi>WEALTH places a man in a ſtate which all muſt covet; a ſtate of INDEPENDENCE.</hi> To owe no man any thing; <hi>to be able to go wither-ſoever we pleaſe; and to face any company without dread of dunning, is a luxury too divine, even to be</hi> conceived <hi>by any who have not been haunted and hag ridden by</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="unknown:030282_0105_0FE598E5D3E955F8"/>
                  <hi>creditors. Say, ye debtors, ye pooreſt of mankind, ſay, ye who cannot look at a creditor without confuſion, nor hear the name of juſtice without a pang; who ſtartle at the</hi> ſound of a ſhaken leaf, <hi>as though the feet of the ſheriff were at the door, and fly as the murderer flies from the avenger of blood, whoſe ſorrowful days are waſted in meditating fruitleſs plans of payment, while your midnight ſlumbers are frightened by dreams of bankruptcy, and apparitions of mercileſs creditors, ſales, and houſeleſs children: ſay, wherein is the life of a debtor better than the life of a dog. Are not the proſpects of independence as reviving to your hearts, as the proſpects of paradiſe to ſouls that have long pined in purgatory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BUT, on the other hand, never to go in debt; or, if accident ſhould render a trifl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing debt neceſſary; to have at home more than enough to defray it; to receive a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor with a ſmiling countenance; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>

               </p>
               <p>IN the third place—<hi>WEALTH enables us to enjoy the pureſt and ſublimeſt pleaſures that are to be found on earth—the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of</hi> doing good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To a tender parent, the intereſts of his children are dear, as the blood which feeds the fountain of life.

Happy the parent who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes wealth; he places before his children the lamp of knowledge, and they perceive the ſnares of the artful; be ſurrounds them with the bleſſings of competence, and</hi>

               <p>I HAVE heard, that nothing gives an author ſo great pleaſure, as to find his works reſpectfully quoted by others. Judge, then, how much I muſt have been gratified by an incident I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to relate to you. I ſtopped my horſe, lately, where a great number of people were collected at an auction of merchant's goods. The hour of the ſale not being come, they were converſing on the badneſs of the times; and one of the company called to a plain, clean
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:030282_0110_0FE598F0772802A8"/>
old man, with white locks, "Pray: father, Abraham, what think you of the times? Will not theſe heavy taxes quite ruin the country? How ſhall we be ever able to pay them? What would you adviſe us to?"—Father Abraham, ſtood up, and replied, "If you would have my advice, I will give it you in ſhort; "for a word to the wiſe is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough," as Poor Richard ſays." They joined in deſiring him to ſpeak his mind, and gathering round him, he proceeded as follows:</p>
               <p>"FRIENDS, ſays he, the taxes are, indeed, very heavy; and, if thoſe laid on by the government, were the only ones we had to pay, we might more eaſily diſcharge them; but we have many others, and much more grievous to ſome of us. We are taxed twice as much by our idleneſs, three times as much by our pride, and four times as much by our folly; and from theſe
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:030282_0111_0FE599AFE2B596F0"/>
taxes the commiſſioners cannot eaſe or deliver us, by allowing an abatement. However, let us hearken to good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and ſomething may be done for us; God helps them that help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves," as Poor Richard ſays.</p>
               <p>I. "IT would be thought a hard go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that ſhould tax its people one-tenth part of their time, to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its ſervice: but idleneſs taxes many of us much more; ſloth, by bringing on diſeaſes, abſolutely ſhortens life. "Sloth, like ruſt, conſumes faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than labour wears, while the uſed key is always bright," as Poor Richard ſays. "But doſt thou love life, then do not ſquander time, for that is the ſtuff life is made of," as Poor Richard ſays. How much more than is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry do we ſpend in ſleep? forgetting that "The ſleeping fox catches no poultry, and that there will be ſleeping enough in the grave," as Poor Richard ſays.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:030282_0112_0FE59F4E4867F270"/>
"If time be of all things the moſt precious, waſting time muſt be," as Poor Richard ſays, "the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality;" ſince, as he elſewhere tells us, "Loſt time is never found again; and what we call time enough always proves little enough:" Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; ſo by diligence ſhall we do more with leſs perplexity. "Sloth makes all things difficult, but induſtry all eaſy; and, he that riſeth late, muſt trot all day, and ſhall ſcarce overtake his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs at night; while lazineſs travels ſo ſlowly, that poverty ſoon overtakes him. Drive thy buſineſs, let not that drive thee; and early to bed and early to riſe, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wiſe," as Poor Richard ſays.</p>
               <p>"So what ſignifies wiſhing and hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for better times? We may make theſe times better, if we beſtir ourſelves. "Induſtry need not wiſh, and he that
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:030282_0113_0FE59F50760FA150"/>
lives upon hope will die faſting. There are no gains without pains; then, help hands for I have no lands," or if I have they are ſmartly taxed. "He that hath a trade, hath an eſtate; and he that hath a calling, hath an office of profit and honour," as Poor Richard ſays; but then the trade muſt be work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, and the calling well followed, or neither the eſtate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes. If we are induſtrious, we will never ſtarve; for at the working man's houſe, hunger looks in, but dares not enter." Nor will the bailiff or the conſtable enter, for "Induſtry pays debts, while de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair increaſeth them." What, though you have found no treaſure, nor has any rich relation left you a legacy, "Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence is the mother of good luck, and God gives all things to induſtry. Then plough deep, while ſluggards ſleep, and you ſhall have corn to ſell and to keep."
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:030282_0114_0FE59F5356E7AD90"/>
Work while it is called to-day, for you know not how much you may be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to-morrow. "One to-day is worth two to-morrows," as Poor Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard ſays; and farther, "Never leave that till to-morrow, which you can do to-day." If you were a ſervant, would you not be aſhamed that a good maſter ſhould catch you idle? Are you then your own maſter? be aſhamed to catch yourſelf idle, when there is ſo much to be done for yourſelf, your family, your relations, and your country. Handle your tools without mittens: remember, that "The cat in gloves catches no mice," as Poor Richard ſays. It is true, there is much to be done, and, perhaps, you are weak-handed; but ſtick to it ſteadily, and you will ſee great effects; for "Conſtant dropping wears away ſtones; and by diligence and patience the mouſe ate in two the cable; and little ſtrokes fell great oaks."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="unknown:030282_0115_0FE59F558009F2E0"/>
METHINKS I hear ſome of you ſay, <q>Muſt a man afford himſelf no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?</q> I will tell thee my friend what Poor Richard ſays; "Employ thy time well, if thou meaneſt to gain leiſure; and, ſince thou art not ſure of a minute, throw not away an hour." Leiſure is time for doing ſomething uſeful; this leiſure the diligent man will obtain, but the lazy man never; for, "A life of leiſure and a life of lazineſs are two things. Many, without labour would live by their wits only, but they break for want of ſtock;" whereas induſtry gives comfort, and plenty, and reſpect. "Fly pleaſures, and they will follow you. The diligent ſpinner has a large ſhift; and now I have a ſheep and a cow, every body bids me good-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row."</p>
               <p>II. "BUT with our induſtry, we muſt likewiſe be ſteady, ſettled, and careful, and overſee our own affairs
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030282_0116_0FE59F57C3F828B8"/>
with our own eyes, and not truſt too much to others; for, as Poor Richard ſays,
<q>
                     <l>"I never ſaw an oft-removed tree,</l>
                     <l>Nor yet an oft-removed family,</l>
                     <l>That throve ſo well as thoſe that fettled be."</l>
                  </q>
"And again, "Three removes is as bad as a fire;" and again, "Keep thy ſhop, and thy ſhop will keep thee;" and again, "If you would have your buſineſs done, go; if not, ſend." And again,
<q>
                     <l>"He that by the plough would thrive,</l>
                     <l>Himſelf muſt either hold or drive."</l>
                  </q>
"And again, "The eye of a maſter will do more work than both his hands;" and again, "Want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge;" and again, "Not to overſee workmen, is to leave them your purſe open." Truſting too much to others care is the ruin of many; for, "In the affairs of this world, men are ſaved, not by faith, but by the want of it;" but a man's
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030282_0117_0FE59F5A04F82FB0"/>
own care is profitable; for, "If you would have a faithful ſervant, and one that you like, ſerve yourſelf. A little neglect may breed great miſchief; for want of a nail the ſhoe was loſt; for want of a ſhoe the horſe was loſt; and for want of a horſe the rider was loſt," being overtaken and ſlain by the enemy; all for want of a little care about a horſe-ſhoe nail.</p>
               <p>III. "So much for induſtry my friends, and attention to one's own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; but to theſe we muſt add fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, if we would make our induſtry more certainly ſucceſsful. A man may, if he knows not how to ſave as he gets, "keep his noſe all his life to the grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and die not worth a groat at laſt. A fat kitchen makes a lean will;" and
<q>
                     <l>"Many eſtates are ſpent in the getting,</l>
                     <l>Since women for tea forſook ſpinning &amp; knitting,</l>
                     <l>And men for punch forſook hewing and ſplitting."</l>
                  </q>
"If you would be wealthy, think of ſaving, as well as of getting. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030282_0118_0FE59F5E83901FE8"/>
have not made Spain rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her outgoes are greater than her incomes."</p>
               <p>"AWAY, then, with your expenſive follies, and you will not then have ſo much cauſe to complain of hard times, heavy taxes, and chargeable families; for
<q>
                     <l>"Women and wine, game and deceit,</l>
                     <l>Makes the wealth ſmall, and the want great."</l>
                  </q>
And farther, "What maintains one vice, would bring up two children." You may think, perhaps, that a little tea, or a little punch now and then, diet a little more coſtly, cloaths a little finer, and a little entertainment now and then, can be no great matter; but remember many a little makes a mickle." Beware of little expences; "A ſmall leak will ſink a great ſhip," as Poor Richard ſays; and again, "Who dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties love, ſhall beggars prove?" and moreover, "Fools make feaſts, and wiſe men eat them." Here you are all got together to this ſale of fineries and
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030282_0119_0FE59F601570B948"/>
nick-nacks. You call them goods; but if you do not take care, they will prove evils to ſome of you. You expect they will be ſold cheap, and, perhaps, they may for leſs than they coſt; but, if you have no occaſion for them, they muſt be dear to you. Remember what Poor Richard ſays, "Buy what thou haſt no need of, and ere long thou ſhalt ſell thy neceſſaries." And again, "At a great pennyworth pauſe a while:" he means, that perhaps the cheapneſs is apparent only, and not real; or the bargain, by ſtraitening thee in thy buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may do the more harm than good. For in another place he ſays, "Many have been ruined by buying good pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyworths." Again, "It is fooliſh to lay out money in a purchaſe of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;" and yet this folly is practiſed every day at auctions, for want of mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Almanack. Many a one, for the ſake of finery on the back, have
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030282_0120_0FE59F6245E3BC78"/>
gone with a hungry belly, and half ſtarved their families; "Silks and ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, ſcarlet and velvets, put out the kitchen fire," as Poor Richard ſays. Theſe are not the neceſſaries of life, they can ſcarcely be called the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies: and yet only becauſe they look pretty, how many want to have them? By theſe and other extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the genteel are reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow of thoſe whom they formerly deſpiſed, but who, thro' induſtry and frugality, have maintained their ſtanding; in which caſe it appears plainly, that a ploughman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees," as Poor Richard ſays. Perhaps they have had a ſmall eſtate left them, which they knew not the getting of: they think "It is day, and will never be night:" that a little to be ſpent out of ſo much is not worth minding; but always taking out of the meal-tub, and
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030282_0121_0FE59F63D9FA8EF8"/>
never putting in, ſoon comes to the bottom," as Poor Richard ſays; and then, "When the well is dry, they know the worth of water." But this they might have known before, if they had taken his advice. "If you would know the value of money, go and try to borrow ſome; for he that goes a borrowing goes a ſorrowing," as Poor Richard ſays; and, indeed, ſo does he that lends to ſuch people, when he goes to get in again. Poor Dick farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes, and ſays,
<q>
                     <l>"Fond pride of dreſs is ſure a very curſe;</l>
                     <l>Ere fancy you conſult, conſult your purſe."</l>
                  </q>
And again, "Pride is as loud a beggar as Want, and a great deal more ſaucy." When you have bought one fine thing, you muſt buy ten more, that your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance may be all of a piece; but Poor Dick ſays, "It is eaſier to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the firſt deſire, than to ſatisfy all that follow it:" And it is as truly folly
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030282_0122_0FE59F68761B41E0"/>
for the poor to ape the rich, as for the frog to ſwell, in order to equal the ox.
<q>
                     <l>"Veſſels large may venture more,</l>
                     <l>But little boats ſhould keep near ſhore."</l>
                  </q>
It is, however, a folly ſoon puniſhed; for, as Poor Richard ſays, "Pride that dines on vanity, ſups on contempt; Pride breakfaſted with Plenty, dined with Poverty, and ſupped with Infamy." And, after all, of what uſe is this pride of appearance for which ſo much is riſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo much is ſuffered? It cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote health, nor eaſe pain; it makes no increaſe of merit in the perſon, it creates envy, it haſtens misfortune.</p>
               <p>"But what madneſs muſt it be to run in debt for theſe ſuperfluities? We are offered, by the terms of this ſale, ſix months credit; and that, perhaps, has induced ſome of us to attend it, becauſe we cannot ſpare the ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and hope now to be fine without it. But, ah! think what you do when you run in debt; you give to another
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030282_0123_0FE59F6A0EA4A070"/>
power over your liberty. If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pay at the time, you will be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee your creditor; you will be in fear when you ſpeak to him; you will make poor pitiful ſneaking excuſes, and by degrees, come to loſe your veracity, and ſink into baſe downright lying; for, "The ſecond vice is lying, the firſt is running in debt," as Poor Richard ſays; and again, to the ſame purpoſe, "Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rides upon Debt's back:" whereas a free American ought not to be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor afraid to ſee or ſpeak to any man living. But poverty often deprives a man of all ſpirit and virtue. "It is hard for an empty bag to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right." What would you think of that nation, or of that government, who ſhould iſſue an edict, forbidding you to dreſs like a gentleman or gentlewoman, on pain of impriſonment or ſervitude? Would you not ſay, that you were free, have a right to dreſs as you pleaſe, and
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:030282_0124_0FE59F6C493D3048"/>
that ſuch an edict would be a breach of your privileges, and ſuch a government tyrannical? And yet you are about to put yourſelf under that tyranny when you run in debt for ſuch dreſs! Your creditor has authority, at his pleaſure, to deprive you of your liberty, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining you in gaol for life, or by ſelling you for a ſervant, if you ſhould not be able to pay him: when you have got your bargain, you may perhaps think little of payment; but as Poor Richard ſays, "Creditors have better memories than debtors, creditors are a ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſect, great obſervers of ſet days and times." The day comes round before you are aware, and the demand is made before you are prepared to ſatisfy it; or, if you bear your debt in mind, the term, which at firſt ſeemed ſo long, will, as it leſſens, appear extremely ſhort: Time will ſeem to have added wings to his heels as well as his ſhoulders. "Thoſe
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:030282_0125_0FE59F6E74277890"/>
have a ſhort Lent, who owe money to be paid at Eaſter." At preſent, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, you may think yourſelves in thriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances, and that you can bear a little extravagance without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; but
<q>
                     <l>"For age and want ſave while you may,</l>
                     <l>No morning-ſun laſts a whole day."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>GAIN may be temporary and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but ever, while you live, expence is conſtant and uncertain; and, "It is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to build two chimneys, than to keep one in fuel," as Poor Richard ſays: So, "Rather go to bed ſupperleſs, than riſe in debt.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>" Get what you can, and what you get hold,</l>
                  <l>'Tis the ſtone that will turn all your lead into gold."</l>
               </lg>
               <p>AND when you have got the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's ſtone, ſure you will no longer complain of bad times, or the difficulty of paying taxes.</p>
               <p>IV. "THIS doctrine, my friends, is reaſon and wiſdom: but, after all, do not depend too much upon your own
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:030282_0126_0FE59F7314511490"/>
induſtry and frugality, and prudence, though excellent things; for they may all be blaſted, without the bleſſing of Heaven; and therefore, aſk that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing humbly, and be not uncharitable to thoſe that at preſent ſeem to want it, but comfort and help them. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Job ſuffered, and was afterwards proſperous.</p>
               <p>"AND now to conclude, "Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence keeps a dear ſchool, but fools will learn in no other," as Poor Richard ſays, and ſcarce in that; for, it is true, "We may give advice, but we cannot give conduct:" However remember this, "They that will not be counſelled can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be helped;" and farther, that "If you will not hear Reaſon, ſhe will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rap your knuckles," as Poor Richard ſays.</p>
               <p>THUS the old gentleman ended his harangue. The people heard it, and approved the doctrine, and immediately
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:030282_0127_0FE59F7517067478"/>
practiſed the contrary, juſt as if it had been a common ſermon; for the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion opened, and they began to buy extravagantly. I found the good man had thoroughly ſtudied my Almanacks, and digeſted all I had dropt on thoſe topics during the courſe of twenty-five years. The frequent mention he made of me muſt have tired any one elſe; but my vanity was wonderfully delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, though I was conſcious, that not a tenth part of the wiſdom was my own, which he aſcribed to me; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the gleanings that I had made of the ſenſe of all ages and nations. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I reſolved to be the better for the echo of it; and, though I had at firſt determined to buy ſtuff for a new coat, I went away, reſolved to wear my old one a little longer.

               <p>REMEMBER that <hi>time</hi> is money. He that can earn ten ſhillings a day by his labour, and goes abroad, or ſits idle one half of that day, though he ſpends but ſixpence during his diverſion or idleneſs, ought not to reckon that the only expence; he has really ſpent, or rather thrown away, five ſhillings beſides.</p>
               <p>REMEMBER that credit is money. If a man lets his money lie in my hands after it is due, he gives me the intereſt, or ſo much as I can make of it during
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030282_0129_0FE59F799155C650"/>
that time. This amounts to a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſum when a man has good and large credit, and makes good uſe of it.</p>
               <p>REMEMBER that money is of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lific generating nature. Money can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get money, and its offspring can beget more, and ſo on. Five ſhillings turned is ſix; turned again, it is ſeven and three pence; and ſo on till it becomes an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds. The more there is of it, the more it produces, every turning, ſo that the profits riſe quicker and quicker. He that kills a breeding ſow, deſtroys all her offspring to the thouſandth genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He that murders a crown, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys all that it might have produced, even ſcores of pounds.</p>
               <p>REMEMBER that ſix pounds a year is but a groat a day. For this little ſum, which may be daily waſted either in time or expence, unperceived, a man of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit may, on his own ſecurity, have the conſtant poſſeſſion and uſe of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

               <p>REMEMBER this ſaying, "The good paymaſter is lord of another man's purſe." He that is known to pay punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and exactly to the time he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, may at any time, and on any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, raiſe all the money his friends can ſpare. This is ſometimes of great uſe. After induſtry and frugality, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contributes more to the raiſing of a young man in the world, than punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and juſtice in all his dealings: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never keep borrowed money an hour beyond the time you promiſed, leſt a diſappointment ſhut up your friend's purſe for ever.</p>
               <p>THE moſt trifling actions that affect a man's credit are to be regarded. The ſound of your hammer at five in the morning, or nine at night, heard by a creditor, makes him eaſy ſix months
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030282_0131_0FE59F81870E4A28"/>
longer; but if he ſees you at a billiard table, or hears your voice at a tavern, when you ſhould be at work, he ſends for his money the next day; demands it before he can receive it in a lump.</p>
               <p>IT ſhews, beſides, that you are mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of what you owe; it makes you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a careful, as well as honeſt man, and that ſtill increaſes your credit.</p>
               <p>BEWARE of thinking all your own that you poſſeſs, and of living accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. It is a miſtake that many people who have credit fall into. To prevent this, keep an exact account, for ſome time, both of your expences and your income. If you take the pains at firſt to mention particulars, it will have this good effect; you will diſcover how wonderfully ſmall trifling expences mount up to large ſums, and will diſcern what might have been, and may for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be ſaved, without occaſioning any great inconvenience.</p>

IN ſhort, the way to wealth, if you deſire it, is as plain as the way to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. It depends chiefly on two words, <hi>induſtry</hi> and <hi>frugality;</hi> that is, waſte nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>time</hi> nor <hi>money,</hi> but make the beſt uſe of both. Without induſtry and frugality nothing will do, and with them every thing. He that gets all he can honeſtly, and ſaves all he gets, (neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary expences excepted) will certainly become <hi>rich;</hi> if that Being who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the world, to whom all ſhould look for a bleſſing on their honeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, doth not, in his wiſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, otherwiſe determine.</p>

               <p>IF there be any truth fully aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reaſon and revelation, it is this, That "<hi>Man is not but to be happy.</hi>" Surely the mighty author of our being can have no ſelfiſh view in our creation. His happineſs is too immenſe and too ſecure to receive increaſe, or to ſuffer diminution from any thing that we can do. "<hi>Can a man profit his Maker, or what need hath the Almighty of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices?</hi>"</p>

A MORE important queſtion claims our regard. Wherein <hi>conſiſts</hi> the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Man?</p>
               <p>IN order to anſwer this, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that man is compoſed of two natures, an animal and a rational, each of which is bleſt with capacities of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, and muſt have its correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent objects of gratification before man can be happy. Hitherto we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered him in the firſt of theſe, in his animal capacity: We have placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, <hi>a creature of noble ſhape, erect and fair,</hi> formed of nerves and fibres, and endued with appetites and feelings.</p>
               <p>THOUGH this his animal nature be infinitely inferior to his rational, yet ſince the happineſs of the latter cannot be complete, while the former is deſtitute of its proper goods, we have devoted the two preceding books to the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of his animal nature. We have taken the liberty to ſend him to Old
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030282_0136_0FE59F8C252F93B8"/>
CORNARO and Dr. FRANKLIN, to hear their excellent lectures on health and competence, which all allow to be two very choice ingredients in the cup of happineſs. Nay, ſome entertain ſo high an opinion of theſe, as to declare, that if CORNARO and FRANKLIN could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a <hi>quantum ſufficit</hi> of them, they would be content, and aſk no better happineſs than what they could extract from theſe.</p>
               <p>BUT let it be remembered that this is not the language of the wiſe, but of the ſlothful, and of ſuch as are puſhed for money, who frequently experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the painfulneſs of being dunn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſometimes taſting the ſweets of eaſe and pleaſure, are ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that if they had but money enough; Oh if they had but money enough to retire from the fatigues and vexations of buſineſs, and to ſpend de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious days and nights in all the varied
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:030282_0137_0FE59F8E38EC99F0"/>
joys of feaſted ſenſe, <hi>how bleſt as the immortal Gods they would be!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND truly, if man was but a more elegant ſort of beaſt, and capable of no higher pleaſures than thoſe of ſenſe, theſe Mahometan dreamers might be more than half in the right. In that caſe, health and competence might very well ſerve our turn; as with the one we might purchaſe, and with the other enjoy, all the happineſs of which we were capable. But ſince God has been ſo good as to raiſe us many degrees above mere animal nature; ſince he has together with bodies, given us immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal minds, endowed with faculties and affections capable of angelic joys, it follows very delightfully, that another gueſs bill of fare muſt be made out for us, than that which would ſerve Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean hogs.</p>
               <p>THOSE gentlemen who are ſo fond of ſtinting themſelves to mere <hi>bodily</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:030282_0138_0FE59F9209AE2E10"/>
would do well to remember, that every rank of animated nature muſt have its proper gratifications or be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. Furniſh earth and water to a <hi>plant,</hi> and it ſhall look green, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh like a cedar in Lebanon; but give nothing but this to a <hi>horſe,</hi> and he ſhall preſently periſh for want of nutriment. Again, give graſs and water to a horſe, and he ſhall look plump as pampered ſpeculation; but confine a <hi>man</hi> to graſs and water, and you ſhall ſoon write <hi>hic jacet</hi> on his tomb. Thus every link in the great chain of being has its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective capacities and enjoyments. Man is favoured with theſe in a degree of perfection above all the creatures that we have ſeen. He poſſeſſes, harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly blended in himſelf, the various excellencies of two different natures; together with a reliſh for all the pleaſures of the moſt perfect animal, he can boaſt capacities equal to the ſublime delights
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:030282_0139_0FE59F93D9697288"/>
of celeſtial ſpirits; now to ſuppoſe that ſo exalted, I had almoſt ſaid ſo divine a creature as this, can be ſatisfied with enjoyments that belong to the pooreſt and meaneſt part of his nature, were a far greater abſurdity, than to ſuppoſe that an animal of the moſt delicate taſte and ſenſe, can be content with earth and water, the ſimple nutriment of a plant.</p>
               <p>ACCORDINGLY we find that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has ever evinced the miſtake of thoſe, who have expected, that ſenſual goods <hi>alone</hi> could make them happy. This is not a novel opinion, but ſeems to have been a favourite notion of ſome in the days of King Solomon, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to examine the truth or falſehood of it. Never man enjoyed equal opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; he had gold and ſilver as the ſtones in the vallies for abundance; and in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he far exceeded all the ſages of the Eaſt. The whole force of this wiſdom and wealth he determined to employ on the
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:030282_0140_0FE59F9567B25E68"/>
experiment. "<hi>Behold</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I will get me down and make me great works, and build me houſes; and plant me vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and make me gardens and pools of water. I will get me men ſingers and women ſingers, and all the delights of the ſons of men; and whatever mine eyes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, I will not keep from them.</hi>" When every thing is thus planned by himſelf, and executed according to his direction, ſurely he is arrived to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his wiſhes, and has aſcended to the ſummit of all human happineſs. The poor, who are taken with fine ſhows, would conclude ſo: Solomon certainly knows beſt; let us aſk him, What does he ſay?</p>
               <p>"<hi>Lo! I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do, and behold all was vanity and vexation of ſpirit, and there was no profit under the ſun.</hi>" Well, gentlemen, you, I mean who think that
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030282_0141_0FE59F97790DC238"/>
if you had but an abundance of <hi>riches,</hi> and <hi>health</hi> to <hi>enjoy</hi> them, you could not fail to be happy. What do you think of having againſt you ſuch a formidable caſe in point as this? Are you not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to ſuſpect that you may have been under a miſtake all this time? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs not the friendly ſuſpicion: Inſtead of repining, you ſhould rejoice to find that you have been in an error. Have you not abundant cauſe of joy, that riches and health with all their ſprings and ſtreams of pleaſure, are not <hi>alone</hi> ſufficient to quench your thirſt of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor able to fill up the vaſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of your nature? After conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one world, Alexander ſat down and wept, that he had not another into which he could puſh his victories: But, thank God, we have not his cauſe of complaint.</p>
               <p>FOR after having puſhed our conqueſts through all thoſe regions of innocent
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:030282_0142_0FE59F9B6976F998"/>
enjoyment which belong to our animal nature, we can enter upon the far wider provinces of REASON and AFFECTION, and poſſeſs ourſelves of all the ſublime pleaſures of angels, <hi>i. e.</hi> the pleaſures of knowledge, imagination, virtue, friendſhip and love. When aſked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Wherein conſiſts the true happineſs of Man?</hi> We readily anſwer, that as the happineſs of a mere animal conſiſts in exerciſing its appetites on ſuch goods as are ſuited to its nature, and capable of gratifying all its ſenſes; ſo the true happineſs of man conſiſts in exerciſing his faculties on ſuch objects as are ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his rational nature, and capable of delighting his ſoul through all her va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious affections. But where is that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite good?</hi> Who is that wondrous being that can feaſt the faculties, and ſatisfy the deſires of an <hi>immortal mind?</hi> 'Tis God; and he alone in whoſe ineffable perfections the whole world of ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:030282_0143_0FE59F9D09E4FD50"/>
will find enough, and more than enough, to employ their admiration and delight through eternal ages.</p>
               <p>ACCORDINGLY we find that Chriſt, when aſked what a man ſhould do to be truly happy, replied, "<hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy mind; and thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf.</hi>"</p>
               <p>IN this admirable reply, which for ſublimity of piety and philanthropy, and for profound wiſdom and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, deſerves everlaſting veneration. We learn three very important leſſons. I. That the chief good or true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man conſiſts in his mind. II. In the affections of his mind. And III. In thoſe affections directed to worthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>I. HE who was perfectly acquainted with our nature, places the ſupreme happineſs of man in the mind. How ſtrange ſoever it may ſeem, yet moſt
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:030282_0144_0FE59F9ED68A5708"/>
certain it is, that this ever was, and ſtill is a new doctrine to the bulk of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. For not only the numerous ſect of ancient Epicureans, and ſenſual Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans, but the generality of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to this day, place the ſeat of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the <hi>body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TALK to them about the pleaſures of the underſtanding, or the ſtill ſublimer pleaſures of devotion, and your words ſeem not to be underſtood; but ſhift the ſubject, and talk about the pleaſures of inheriting large eſtates, of living at eaſe and faring ſumptuouſly every day, and immediately you perceive, by their ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing countenances and ready converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that you have awakened their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite ideas, and that theſe are the things which lie neareſt to their hearts.</p>
               <p>THAT the goods of the body conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſome ſmall part of man's happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that therefore they ought to be valued, and, as far as conſcience and
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:030282_0145_0FE59FA1C2F33408"/>
a regard to higher intereſts will permit, ſhould be ſought after, is <hi>evident.</hi> But that theſe goods and pleaſures of the body, conſtitute man's <hi>ſupreme</hi> happineſs, is one of the moſt degrading, damnable errors, that ever was broached. No man who underſtands the dignity of his immortal part, and who entertains a proper love for himſelf and his fellow men, can hear ſuch a propoſition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abhorrence and indignation. What! ſhall happineſs which all ſo vehemently deſire, and ſo heartily pray for, both for themſelves and for others; ſhall happineſs, the bare hope of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives the heart, and does good like a medicine; which gives ſtrength to the weak, and courage to the fearful; which animates us through life; nor deſerts us in death—Shall this <hi>fondeſt wiſh,</hi> this <hi>ſweeteſt expectation</hi> of all men, conſiſt merely in the goods and pleaſures of the body. Conſider, thou cruel mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:030282_0146_0FE59FA6C1C15740"/>
of thyſelf; thou barbarous aſſaſſin of human kind, how few over attain thoſe pleaſures to which thou ſtupidly confineſt the happineſs of man; how fewer ſtill ever <hi>enjoy</hi> them, and how ſoon death will ſnatch them out of the hands of thoſe who are ſo fortunate! Reflect what unnumbered millions are born to no better inheritance than po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and bondage, and who, inſtead of being careſſed in the ſoft lap of eaſe and pleaſure, are driven through life by the ſcourge of cruel tyrants, or more cruel wants! hard put to it to get a little bread, and ſometimes <hi>never</hi> get <hi>it,</hi> at leaſt not comfortably; but from various cauſes, eat it all their lives long in bitterneſs of ſoul! And of thoſe ſeemingly happy ones who poſſeſs all the goods of the body, How few enjoy them without alloy? How many, by abuſing theſe bleſſings, contract diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which render fleeting life one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030282_0147_0FE59FA8850B4668"/>
ſcene of ſorrow and ſuffering? And in thoſe apparently fortunate caſes, where the greateſt abundance of ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al goods is accompanied with health and power of enjoyment; yet, alas! how ſoon does enjoyment conſume the little good which they contained, and leave the wealthy glutton to languiſh under indifference, to fret through diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to ſigh for ſomething elſe?</p>
               <p>CAST your eyes on that pale bloated figure. It is the Emperor Heliogabalus, corrupted by the brutalizing ſophiſtry of Epicurus, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the pleaſures of the body conſtitute man's only happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he reſolved to be happy to ſome purpoſe. All Italy was taxed; all Aſia robbed to ſupport his luxury; every region of the earth was explored; every element ranſacked to furniſh his table. All that bounteous nature beſtows of rare and delicious among her birds, beaſts, fiſhes, fruits and ſpices; and
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:030282_0148_0FE59FAA8D6250B8"/>
all theſe prepared by the niceſt hand of cookery, were ſerved up to feaſt and delight his appetites. Surely, if luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious eaſe and delicious fare were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, Heliogabalus muſt have been bleſt indeed. The diſcontent viſible in his countenance proves the reverſe. Could you aſk him, he would tell you that his pleaſures are at beſt but vain, and too frequently vexatious. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he was mortified, becauſe, through defect of appetite, he could not enjoy his delicious morſels. At other times, tempted by their luſcious flavour, he fed to an exceſs, which brought on him a variety of painful and loathſome diſeaſes. And at all times it was matter of grief to him, that the pleaſures of eating and drinking ſhould ſo ſoon be over. This circumſtances cauſed one of the Roman Emperors to quarrel with his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and to wiſh, in all the rage of diſappointed pleaſure, that he had the
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:030282_0149_0FE59FAC9BB4E540"/>
ſtomach of a horſe, that he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſatisfaction of eating ten times as much as its preſent ſcanty capacities would allow. And another Emperor, for the ſame ſwiniſh reaſon, preferred his petition to the Gods, that they would grant him a neck as long as that of a crane, vainly hoping, that he ſhould thereby the longer enjoy the dear pleaſure of ſwallowing.</p>
               <p>BUT granting the ſenſuality an utter exemption from all the ills and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of gluttony; that his coveted dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are all ſerved up in the moſt invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtyle of perfection; that his fruits are luciouſly ripe and freſh; his meats tender and deliciouſly flavoured; his cookery the moſt exquiſite in the world, and his wines equal to the nectar of Jove. And granting too that he has an appetite to ſeaſon, and health to enjoy all theſe dainties, yet, alas! how ſoon muſt the ſeaſon of enjoyment be
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:030282_0150_0FE59FB0919F2F48"/>
over with him forever! Old age will preſently ſteal on him; his nerves muſt ſoon grow hard and dull, and loſe their delicate edge and ſenſibility, and then, though he may ſit <hi>down,</hi> yet can he not enjoy his dainty morſels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BEHOLD, I am now</hi> (ſaid the rich old Barzillai) <hi>fourſcore years old, and can I diſcern what is ſavoury? Can I taſte what I eat or what I drink; or can I hear the voice of ſinging men and ſinging women?</hi> After this humiliating period, what ſad diſhonours will ſickneſs and death ſoon bring upon the body, the gluttons pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered pride! His cheeks once ſo plump and roſy, are now pale and emaciated. His ſkin, formerly ſo ſmooth and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, is now deformed with wrinkles. His body once ſtraight and erect, is now crooked and bent with years. His limbs, late ſo nimble and active, are now ſtiff and ſcarcely able to move. And he who forty years ago poſſeſſed all the
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:030282_0151_0FE59FB22ED29A50"/>
bloom and vigour of full formed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, is now ſhrunk away to mere ſkin and bone, and experiences all the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs of a ſecond childhood.</p>
               <p>SUPPORTED on his crutches or cane, he attempts to move, but it is with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and pain. His knees knock a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt each other through weakneſs. His hands tremble, and his whole body ſhakes as with an ague. In a little time his infirmities prevail; his body, though but the ſhadow of his former ſelf, is now too heavy for his exhauſted ſtrength. In a low faultering voice, he begs to be led to his bed, and there lies down never more to riſe. Nature now ſinks apace; his heart labours; his breaſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves; his breathing becomes ſhort and quick; his eyes are hollow and ſunk; his voice grows hoarſe; he rattles in the throat; his limbs wax cold; his teeth turn black; he foams at the mouth; a feeble convulſion ſhakes his frame,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:030282_0152_0FE59FB442245AE8"/>
and, with a deep groan, his unwilling ſpirit takes her leave. Immediately pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction and worms begin their loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome office; and in a little time, this pampered, idolized fleſh, returns to the duſt of which it was formed.</p>
               <p>WHO can contemplate this picture, and not bewail with tears of blood, the madneſs of thoſe who expect their only happineſs from ſuch a <hi>vile</hi> body! O how infinitely ſuperior to theſe miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deluſions is the Heaven deſcended philoſophy of Jeſus Chriſt! In that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine religion, the body, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exalted as the ſeat of our happineſs, is depreciated as the principal cauſe of our miſery, being, as the poet expreſſes it, not only a neſt of pain and bag of corruption, but the moſt fruitful ſource of our ſins and ſorrows. Chriſt ſeldom mentions the body, except to expoſe its comparative worthleſſneſs, and to caution us againſt its defiling luſts. In

every part of the ſacred volume, you hear his voice exclaiming with all the earneſtneſs of parental affection: "<hi>Woe be to him who truſteth in the body, and maketh fleſh his hope, for wherein is it to be relied on? Its origin is but duſt, its beauty but a flower, its life but a vapour, and its duration but a moment. Pain and wearineſs accompany it while living, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and worms ſeize on it when dead. O let not thine heart decline to its luſts, and yeild not to its enticements, for they have caſt down many wounded; yea, many ſtrong men have been ſlain by them; their way is the way to hell, going down by the chambers of death. But though in the body thou canſt find no true content, yet think of thy ſoul and rejoice, for ſhe is more precious than ſilver, yea much fine gold is not to be compared unto her. Her beginning is from the breath of the Almighty, and her duration is as the days of eternity. She was made but a little lower than the</hi>

                  <hi>angels, and heaven was prepared of old for the place of her habitation. Wouldſt thou be happy, deck her with the jewels of piety, and cloath her with virtue as with a garment; then ſhall the lamp of the Almighty ſhine into thy heart, and joy ſhall be thy conſtant companion. When thou walkeſt by the way, thy foot ſhall not ſtumble; and when thou lieſt down, thy ſleep ſhall be ſweet. In the day of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thou ſhalt not be afraid, and when death cometh upon thee, thou ſhalt laugh him to ſcorn; for the Lord of hoſts is thy friend, and underneath thee are the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting arms. He ſhall ſay unto thee, fear not, thou worm Jacob, for I am with thee; be not diſmayed for I am thy God. Then ſhall he ſtrip off thee the vile rags of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and cloath thee with the garments of ſalvation. He ſhall wipe from thine eyes the tear of ſorrow, and anoint thy face with the oil of gladneſs. He ſhall conduct thee into his own city, the city of</hi>

                  <hi>the living God, and unto the general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of angels, and ſpirits of juſt men made perfect. He ſhall give thee to drink with them of his rivers of pleaſure, and to feaſt on joys at his right hand forever more.</hi>"</p>
               <p>THUS ſplendid are the honours and felicities of which the ſoul of man is capable. Theſe are the eternal goods to which Chriſt intreats us to aſpire, and for the ſake of which, he bids us deſpiſe the low unſatisfactory pleaſures of a dying body.</p>
               <p>WHAT divine goodneſs, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect wiſdom, are blended in that philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, which enjoins us to ſeek our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the <hi>mind</hi> and not in the <hi>body.</hi> In <hi>that</hi> part of our nature which exalts us to God, and not in that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes us to the brute. In that part of us which will live forever, and not in that which is daily in danger of dropping into the grave. In that part of us which can enjoy the noble plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:030282_0156_0FE59FBE34E58100"/>
of the glorious ones in Heaven, and not in that whoſe few pleaſures are in common with the creatures of the ſtalls and ſtyes.</p>
               <p>BUT our divine Philoſopher places the ſupreme happineſs of man, not only in the mind, as we have juſt ſeen, but</p>
               <p>II. IN the <hi>affections</hi> of the mind.</p>
               <p>THIS alſo will appear to many as a ſtrange ſaying. It muſt expect to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, not only the prejudices of coarſe Epicures, but the more ſerious doubts of many who ſeem to be more refined and rational in their ſchemes of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Many, even of thoſe, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining a vile body, ſunk their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the immortal mind, have never yet dreamed that it conſiſts in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but have ſought it rather in the improvements of the <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Obſerving the great reſpect that is paid to men of learning, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering the high entertainment which
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:030282_0157_0FE59FC0CB28A8B0"/>
they themſelves have derived from the converſation of ſuch men, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that learning muſt be the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ornament and higheſt happineſs of human nature. In their eſtimation, the man whoſe comprehenſive mind takes a wide ſurvey of the works of God, and of the inventions of men; who ſoars into the Heavens, and calls the ſtars by name; calculates eclipſes, and fortells comets; who thence goes down into the depths of the ſea, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the cauſes of its ceaſeleſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; who traverſes the boundleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the earth, knows <hi>all their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, with the glory of them;</hi> who ſpeaks various languages, fathoms the depths of arts and ſciences, underſtands the hiſtory of nations, the laws and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of all people. This, in their eſtimation, is the truly happy man. In a mind thus richly furniſhed, he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes (as they ſuppoſe) the materials of
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:030282_0158_0FE59FC3C63F6550"/>
an enjoyment, of which nothing can ever deprive him.</p>
               <p>FAR be it from me to ſpeak diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully of learning, for certainly learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or wiſdom is the <hi>pia mater,</hi> or firſt attribute of God himſelf, and the vaſt circumference within which lies all the happineſs that human or angelic minds can enjoy. But this I ſay, that all the learning in the world, if ſeparated from the <hi>affections,</hi> can never make us truly happy: And that theſe ſplendid attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſcience were never intended to form the <hi>ſupreme</hi> happineſs of man, is evident, becauſe the bulk of mankind are not capable of becoming great ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and philoſophers. Alas! What numbers, after all the pains that have been taken with them, never learn even to read their mother tongue with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety! How many, who after a ſeven years apprenticeſhip, and a whole life's employment, never learn to fit on a
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:030282_0159_0FE59FC5FB399B18"/>
handſome boot or ſhoe! Many born with genius equal to the attainment of learning, are conſtrained to live and die in ignorance, for want of means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the expence of education; while others are obliged to ſtop in the middle of their career, and to give up the fond hopes of knowledge, becauſe of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution too delicate to bear the fatigues of ſtudy. But granting to the lover of learning, every advantage of genius, conſtitution and fortune, that ever fell to the lot of the moſt favoured of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, what mighty acquiſitions can be made by him whoſe genius is, at beſt, but dulneſs, and whoſe days are but a moment! When he conſiders the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of art, ſo multiplied and myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, he ſits down in deſpair. When he contemplates the works of God, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and unſearchable, the ſpirit faints within him, and he ſeems to himſelf, but as a feather floating on the ſurface
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:030282_0160_0FE59FC80ADC1720"/>
of a mighty ocean, whoſe wonders he can never explore. And were he aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſum of his learning, he would, if honeſt, take up the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the old philoſopher, and reply, that after the vain toils of threeſcore years, he has learned to know that he knows nothing.</p>
               <p>BUT admitting that he has acquired that ſtock of learning on which vain mortals are ſo adventurous as to ſet up for <hi>maſters</hi> and <hi>doctors.</hi> Admitting that he has learned languages, ſtudied arts and ſciences, &amp;c. &amp;c. What is there in all this to make him happy, or to ſatisfy the deſires of an immortal mind? As to languages, what folly to dream as ſome do, of great wiſdom and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be found in learning them! For, What is language but words or ſounds by which we communicate our thoughts to one another? If theſe words or ſounds had the power like
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:030282_0161_0FE59FCA1370E5F0"/>
                  <hi>charms,</hi> to brighten our wits, or to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our hearts, this language-mongery would be a noble ſpeculation; but, alas! inſtead of making us wiſer, theſe <hi>learned</hi> languages often make us greater fools. For, allowing, that after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of five years, and of at leaſt as many hundred pounds, a young man has learned enough to give his horſe a Latin or Greek name; What mighty advantages does he derive from this pretty art of nick-naming God's crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Does it teach him any new ideas relative to the nature and qualities of a horſe? Or can it furniſh him one uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful receipt in farriery, or a ſingle rule for the better management and choice of that noble animal?</p>
               <p>EVIDENTLY, therefore, the <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> or chief good of man does not conſiſt in <hi>dead languages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND as to ſyſtems of human learning, from which ſome fondly expect unfail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:030282_0162_0FE59FCE5A2E83C0"/>
pleaſure and eternal honour, what are they, <hi>frequently,</hi> but ſyſtems of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man error, monuments of the pride of man, who, impatient to be thought ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of any thing, boldly ſeizes fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for fact, and conjecture for evidence, and with theſe fairy workmen, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly runs up vaſt Babels of <hi>philoſophy, vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called.</hi> A whole lifetime is hardly ſufficient to underſtand theſe pompous errors; and ſcarcely are they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, before they are exploded to make room for ſome other ſet of notions, equally vain and periſhable.</p>
               <p>BUT, admitting that we have turned our ſtudies to the nobleſt of human ſciences, ſciences founded on truth, and promiſing much entertainment and uſeful knowledge; yet, alas! full ſoon ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience prove the truth of the remark made by Solomon, that "<hi>In much learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is much trouble; and he who increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es knowledge, increaſes ſorrow.</hi>" See!
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:030282_0163_0FE59FCFEADF0960"/>
how <hi>enviouſly,</hi> ſharp thorns and briars ſhoot up among the ſweet flowers which we expected to gather. To make any conſiderable progreſs in ſciences, we muſt renounce ſome of the freedom and amuſements of life; this is mortifying; confinement is weariſome; hard ſtudy fatigues the brain; intenſe thinking ſours the temper; ſlow progreſs is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartening; doubts are vexatious; and preſently darkneſs and thick clouds ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over the path of ſcience, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us to proceed any farther. <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man walketh in a vain ſhadow, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieteth himſelf in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT ſuppoſing that we could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all human ſciences in the moſt perfect degree, how very ſhort lived would be the pleaſures ariſing from them! When firſt made, and freſh on the mind, the diſcoveries of truth are highly gratifying to curioſity, but in a ſhort time they become familiar, and
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:030282_0164_0FE59FD17B4B9890"/>
thence almoſt inſipid. Hence we often ſee learned men as diſcontented and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh as others; a plain proof that <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man learning</hi> opens no ſpring of laſting happineſs in the mind. Indeed, ſo far from producing this very deſireable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it frequently nurſes paſſions the moſt <hi>unfriendly</hi> to his happineſs, both in this world and the next. The bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er talents and ſuperior fame of a rival wit, often pierce his heart with the keeneſt pangs of envy; ſucceſs puffs him up with pride, and renders him inſufferably diſagreeable; diſappointment fires him with rage, or ſinks him into deſpondency: While the flaſh of an unguarded witticiſm often loſes him a valuable friend, or creates a mortal enemy. But allowing that he were the greateſt ſcholar and orator of the age, and could harangue on any ſubject, with all the force of argument and charms of eloquence: that whenever he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:030282_0165_0FE59FD4062F8AB8"/>
the impatient crowds repaired to hear the magic of his enchanting tongue: that princes were his patrons, and the great ones of the earth his admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; yet how vain and treacherous a good would all this be! How utterly unworthy to be coveted as the chief good of man! For yet but a few fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing years, and the cold hand of age will be on him, and then, alas! all theſe fine talents and blooming honours, ſhall periſh as the lovely flower periſhes when touched by the killing froſts of winter. His wit ſhall ſparkle no more; no more ſhall his fancy charm us with the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of its images, nor his mind aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with the vaſtneſs of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; his memory muſt then give up all her precious treaſures; and dumb forever will be that tongue whoſe elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, like ſweeteſt muſic, ſoothed each liſtening ear, and led in triumph all the obedient paſſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="unknown:030282_0166_0FE59FD7394A1788"/>
AND are ſuch fading accompliſhments as theſe, fit food for an immortal ſoul that was born for heaven?</p>
               <p>BUT although this acknowledged va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and vexation of human learning, ſufficiently proves the ſad miſtake of thoſe who make an <hi>idol</hi> of it; yet let us not, on the other hand, run into the equal error of ſuch as trample it under their feet as vain and worthleſs altogether. Along with its droſs, it contains much uſeful metal, for the ſake of which we may well afford to toil.</p>
               <p>EVEN the <hi>languages,</hi> though the <hi>leaſt</hi> neceſſary of all human learning, are not entirely without their uſes. We may chance to fall in with a poor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eigner who has not broken Engliſh enough to tell us his wants. We may get honeſt bread by interpreting, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, or teaching languages. Or ſhould it be our fortune to ſtand behind a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:030282_0167_0FE59FD902E2D0B8"/>
we may, with the help of a little <hi>bad</hi> French, ſell a great deal of <hi>good</hi> merchandize. We may likewiſe find much <hi>pleaſure</hi> in reading the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing works of foreign poets, hiſtorians, &amp;c. and this effect may lead to one ſtill more valuable; it may inſpire us with ſentiments of friendſhip for the nation to which theſe excellent men belong, and thus happily moderate that reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, under certain circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances we might feel againſt them. Theſe effects, in a very comfortable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, I have myſelf experienced. I have found, that my paſſions, kindling into pain from the blows ſtruck our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offending country, by the Britiſh, have been conſiderably calmed by recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that theſe our <hi>injurers,</hi> are the children of the ſame once <hi>glorious iſland</hi> which gave to us and to all mankind, a Milton, a Newton, a Locke, a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and other UNEQUALLED LIGHTS
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:030282_0168_0FE59FDB0D846B30"/>
of philoſophy and divinity, whoſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſplendors have contributed ſo happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repel the coming clouds of "<hi>chaos</hi> and <hi>old night,</hi>" and to eſtabliſh the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of reaſon and <hi>pure</hi> religion.</p>
               <p>HITHER TO we have endeavoured to point out the miſtake of thoſe, (a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous race) who look for happineſs among ſenſual pleaſures, and in human learning. Two other orders of candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates, equally numerous, and, as I think, equally miſtaken, preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,—I mean the hardy ſons of ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and ambition. The firſt of theſe, the miſer, bleſſes God; wonders how people can be ſo weak as to throw away their time and money on <hi>book learning</hi> and <hi>ſilly pleaſures.</hi> He has juſter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things. Gold is with him <hi>the one thing needful. He riſes early, early, late takes reſt, and eats the bread of careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and toil, in order to join houſe to houſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="unknown:030282_0169_0FE59FDD1B234BD0"/>
                  <hi>and field to field,</hi> and thus to remove himſelf far from all dread of want.</p>
               <p>BUT of wealth it may be ſaid, <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not here.</hi> Gold, it is true, is the quinteſſence of lands, houſes, ſoft cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſumptuous fare, and of every other pleaſure that fleſh and blood is heir to. But evident it is to <hi>reaſon,</hi> that all the treaſures on earth can never ſatisfy an immortal ſoul: And Scripture aſſerts, that "<hi>A man's life conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth.</hi>" And whoſe experience doth not witneſs it? We call the rich <hi>happy!</hi> Alas! could we but ſee their anxious cares, their inward reſtleſſneſs, the miſeries of deſires delayed or diſappointed, which ſometimes attend even the moſt fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; could we know their conſtant fears of loſing, and their thirſt for more, which ſuffers them not to enjoy their preſent gains; could we follow one who is "<hi>making haſte to be rich,</hi>" through
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:030282_0170_0FE59FE0D00E6D88"/>
all his toils and labours, his weary days and ſleepleſs nights, and all his various vexations, we ſhould be fully convinced of the truth of this, that <hi>he who increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth riches, increaſeth ſorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I MAY appeal to every man's heart who has ſought happineſs from this quarter, if this has not been his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant experience. You promiſed your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that you ſhould be perfectly happy when the other thouſand was added to your ſtock, or the next purchaſe enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you eſtate: You had your wiſh, and yet you ſtill wanted: Something was lacking. You propoſed new additions, and waited for your happineſs again; but a new thirſt urged you again to new cares and to new toils. And if the time ſhould ever come, that you ſhall think that you have enough, and like the rich man in the goſpel, "<hi>begin to pull down your barns and build greater; and to ſay to your ſoul, Soul, thou haſt much</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="unknown:030282_0171_0FE59FE25FDDDE10"/>
                  <hi>goods laid up for many years, take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry:</hi>" Then expect the final diſappointment in that alarming meſſage, "<hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee; then whoſe ſhall all thoſe things be which thou haſt ſo laboriouſly laid up?</hi>"—Such is the happineſs of thoſe who <hi>truſt in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain riches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE ambitious ſeeks his happineſs in the attainment of honour: And indeed to be diſtinguiſhed in the world, treated with reſpect, ſpoken of with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, careſſed and courted by all around us, is highly pleaſing to the heart of man, and, in the eyes of many, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes charms far ſuperior to the vanities of pleaſure, or the ſordidneſs of gain; yet doth the deſire of wordly eſteem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the ſoul as far from true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as the former. The enjoyment ariſing from the honour which cometh from man, ſtand continually on a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:030282_0172_0FE59FE3EF3459C0"/>
foundation; it totters before every blaſt of diſreſpect, and every ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of malevolence. <hi>Like graſs on the houſe top, it often withereth before it is plucked up;</hi> For what can ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore envy? The hopes of men, like bubbles in the air, uſually burſt as they expand. The labours of ambition are diſappointed, the pride of honor mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, the idol of reputation broken to pieces, and the friendſhips of the world generally faithleſs.</p>
               <p>ALAS! That man, born for heaven, ſhould waſte his ſhort day of grace in torturing himſelf to conform to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of a vain world; ſeeking a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of fame lighter than air; graſping at diſtinctions vain and inſignificant; ſtaking his happineſs on the beck or breath of worms like himſelf; and after all, too frequently obliged to take up the lamentation of the once great Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Woolſey: "<hi>Had I but ſerved God</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="unknown:030282_0173_0FE59FE617845AF0"/>
                  <hi>as faithfully as I have ſerved the world, he would not thus have forſaken me in my grey hairs.</hi>"</p>
               <p>BUT the vanity of ſeeking happineſs from riches, honors and pleaſures, is yet more convincingly felt when death comes to put a final cloſe to this mortal ſcene. Ah! my friends, this is the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hour that ſtrips off the tinſel cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of folly, ſtamps vanity on all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ſun, and ſhews that
<q>
                     <l>"Too low they build, who build beneath the ſtars."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>IN that day of terror and deſpair, what can a rain world offer its poor deluded followers? Will a party of pleaſure ſuit the chamber of ſickneſs? Or the ſongs of folly delight the ear that liſtens with trembling to the ſtriking hour? What muſic will ſound in concert with dying groans? Or what joy can jewels and brocades afford when the ſhroud is ready to ſupplant them? Will the ſparkling bowl revive any longer, when the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:030282_0174_0FE59FEC29B421D8"/>
tongue begins to faulter? Or beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty kindle the <hi>unhallowed fire</hi> when death ſits on the fixed eye balls, and ſpreads his chilling damps over the heart? Alas! my brother, <hi>vanity of vanities, all is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> is now ſeen in characters too legible to be overlooked. The remembrance of a life miſpent in <hi>vain</hi> or in guilty pleaſures, will fill the ſoul with pangs of remorſe, with agonies of horror, of which none but the wretched ſufferers can form any idea. "<hi>Ah pleaſure, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Thou vile ſorcereſs! Thou curſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of my ſoul! Thou once ſmiledſt as with the charms of innocence, now I feel thee ſting as a viper. Where are thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of delight? Fool that I was to believe thee! For thy ſake I have enſlaved my ſoul to the luſts of a brute, and cheriſhed the paſſions of a demon! I have neglected God, and ſold my birth-right to heaven! Me, miſerable! Whether am I going?

Why love,—Love to God and to our neighbour.</p>
               <p>THESE are the true treaſures; the treaſures of the heart. No pleaſures are comparable to thoſe that affect the heart; and there are none that affect it with ſuch exquiſite delight, as loving and being beloved by a worthy object. Aſk the young Theodoſius, and he will tell you, that the moſt delicious feelings his heart ever experienced, were thoſe of virtuous love; and that he never

knew what rapture was until he ſaw the incomparable Conſtantia, in whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and manners are concentered all the charms of beauty, and all the graces of virtue.</p>
               <p>NOW, if love, when directed to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can open ſuch a heaven in our boſoms, what muſt it do when directed to God, the eternal fountain of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and goodneſs? Would you know the bleſſing of all bleſſings, it is this <hi>love</hi> dwelling in the ſoul, ſweetening our bitter, lightening our dark, enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſad, and filling to the full of joy the ſouls that muſt ever thirſt until they come to this great fountain of all happineſs. There is no peace, nor ever can be for the ſoul of man, but in the exerciſe of this love; for as love is the infinite happineſs that created man; ſo love is the only perfection and felicity of man; and no one can live in happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but as he lives in love. Look at
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:030282_0181_0FE59FFC7B74A460"/>
every pain and diſorder in human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, you will find it to be nothing elſe but the ſpirit of the creature turned from love to ſelfiſhneſs; and thence, in courſe, to anxiety, fear, covetouſneſs, wrath, envy, and all evil: So that love alone is, and only can be, the cure of every evil; and he who lives in love is riſen out of the power of evil into the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and joy of one of the ſpirits of heaven. All wants are ſatisfied, all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of nature are removed; no life is any longer a burden; every day is a day of peace; every thing is a ſpring of joy to him who breathes the ſweet gentle element of love.</p>
               <p>BUT ſome men, of gloomy and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholic humours, will aſk, Is it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that God loves mankind? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the innumerable favours which he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhes upon us, muſt ſet his love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="unknown:030282_0182_0FE5A000B4CF0EE8"/>
To aſk whether God loves mankind, is indeed to aſk whether he is good, which is the ſame as queſtioning his very exiſtence; for how is it poſſible to conceive a God without goodneſs? And, what goodneſs could he have were he to hate his own works, and to deſire the miſery of his creatures?</p>
               <p>A GOOD prince loves his ſubjects; a good father loves his children: We love even the tree we have planted; the houſe we have built; and is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for God not to love mankind? Where can ſuch a ſuſpicion riſe, except in the minds of thoſe who form a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious and barbarous being of God; a being who makes a cruel ſport of the fate of mankind; a being who deſtines them, before they are born, to hell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to himſelf one, at moſt, in a million, and that one no more meriting that preference, than the others have deſerved their damnation? Impious blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:030282_0183_0FE5A0024B9A2760"/>
who endeavour to give me an averſion to God, by perſuading me that I am the object of <hi>his</hi> averſion!</p>
               <p>YOU will ſay, he owes nothing to man; well, but he owes ſomething to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> he muſt neceſſarily be <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>beneficent.</hi> If a virtuous heathen could declare that he had much rather it ſhould never be ſaid that there was ſuch a man as Plutarch, than that he was cruel and revengeful, how muſt the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of <hi>mercies</hi> be diſpleaſed to find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf charged with ſuch hateful qualities?</p>
               <p>BESIDES, I know he loves me, by the very love I feel for him; it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loves me that he has engraved on my heart this ſentiment, the moſt precious of all his gifts. His love is the ſource of mine, as it ought to be, indeed, a motive to it.</p>
               <p>GIVE me leave, in order to convey an idea of the love of God, to deſcribe the paſſion of a virtuous lover for his
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:030282_0184_0FE5A00453B74D60"/>
miſtreſs. The compariſon in itſelf has nothing indecent. Love is a vice only in vicious hearts. Fire, though the pureſt of all ſubſtances, will yet emit unwholeſome and noxious vapours when it is fed by tainted matter; ſo love, if it grow in a vicious mind, produces no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſhameful deſires and criminal deſigns, and is followed with fear, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and miſery. But let it riſe in an upright heart, and be kindled by an object adorned with virtue as well as beauty, it is ſafe from cenſure; far from being offended, God gives it his approbation. He has made amiable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects only that they might be loved.</p>
               <p>NOW let us ſee what paſſes in the heart of a perſon deeply ſmitten with love. He thinks with delight of the perſon beloved; he hurries with impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity towards the charming object, and whatever keeps or removes him from her is tormenting; he is afraid of
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:030282_0185_0FE5A0066700F088"/>
giving her any diſpleaſure; he inquires into her taſte and inclinations, in order to comply with and gratify them; he likes to hear her commended; talks of her with ſatisfaction, and careſſes every thing that renews the agreeable idea.</p>
               <p>IT is a miſtake to think that there is an eſſential difference between this and divine love. We have but one way of loving: Men love God and their friends in the ſame manner; and theſe affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions differ only in the diverſity of their objects and ends. Thus a pious man filled with ſentiments towards God, like thoſe of a virtuous lover, would be glad to behold him, and to be united to him; he thinks of him with delight, and ſpeaks of him with reverence; he rejoices to ſee him honored, and is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to hear him praiſed; he meditates on his laws with pleaſure, and obeys them with alacrity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:030282_0186_0FE5A0090FE872E0"/>
THAT this love by which a pious mind is united to its Creator, is a ſource of the pureſt pleaſures, we now proceed to ſhew, not ſolely on the authorities of ſcripture, but by the force of reaſon and common ſenſe.</p>
               <p>THE man who loves God, enjoys that firſt of felicities, the <hi>conſciouſneſs</hi> of having placed his affections on the only object in the univerſe that truly deſerves them. Our love is the moſt precious thing we poſſeſs; it is indeed the only thing we can properly call our own, and therefore to beſtow it unworthily, is the greateſt ſhame and ſoreſt miſtake that we can ever commit. A man muſt needs be infinitely mortified and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, when he finds that the object of his love poſſeſſes not that excellence which he fondly expected would ſatisfy his wiſhes and make him completely happy. Alas! What is a little ſkin deep beauty, a few flaſhes of wit, or
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:030282_0187_0FE5A00B1EE0CCE8"/>
ſome ſmall degrees of goodneſs? We ſoon ſee to the bottom of ſuch ſhallow goods, and conſequently muſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a decay of that admiration and affection which conſtitutes happineſs in the firſt degree. But to no ſuch mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying diſappointment is he liable, who directs his love to God. In him the enlightened eye of true philoſophy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers ſo much of all that is great and good, as to keep the happy mind in an eternal extacy of admiration and love.</p>
               <p>DIVINE love advances the happineſs of man, becauſe it tends, above all other attachments, to refine and ennoble his nature. The moſt inattentive muſt have obſerved, that love has a ſurprizing force to give our manners a reſemblance to thoſe of the perſon we love. Seen through the eyes of a tender affection, even blemiſhes appear like beauties, and heaven born virtue puts on charms more than human. No wonder then that we
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:030282_0188_0FE5A00D27331C48"/>
ſo eaſily adopt the ſentiments, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the manners of thoſe we love. This is a conduct ſo natural and common, that to tell the character of any man, we need but be told that of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's he loves.</p>
               <p>HENCE, the anxious parent rejoices to ſee his child fond of the ſociety of the virtuous and wiſe: he knows that ſuch an attachment indicates a reliſh for virtue, and promiſes an honourable and happy event: while, on the other hand, he deplores his attachment to the vain and vicious, as a ſad, but certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of folly and depravity.</p>
               <p>CERTAINLY then, in order to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, it moſt nearly concerns us to direct our love to the proper object. But who, or what is that object? The creatures all have their imperfections. They are all utterly unworthy, and beneath the ſupreme love of an immortal mind. And to love theſe in the extreme, is
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:030282_0189_0FE5A00F33AA1EB8"/>
infinitely to demean ourſelves, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace our underſtandings, to contract low earthly paſſions, and conſequently to make ourſelves miſerable. Would we do honour to our reaſon, would we dignify our affections, ennoble our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and riſe to true happineſs, let us give our hearts to God. The man who loves God is animated with an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becoming the dignity of his birth; he is inſpired with a greatneſs of ſoul that ſpurns all grovelling paſſions and baſe deſigns. The love which he has for God impells him, by a ſweet and powerful influence, to imitate his all lovely and adorable perfections, and conſequently renders him every day a more divine and heavenly creature.</p>
               <p>GOD is the only worthy object of our love, becauſe he is the only one who will certainly and generouſly reward it. Love, as we have obſerved, was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the ſpring of joy, but, alas!
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:030282_0190_0FE5A011C0726CF8"/>
when placed on the creature, it often proves a ſource of ſorrow, becauſe it is too often treated with ingratitude and neglect. The lover in giving his heart, gives his <hi>all;</hi> and, if after ſo great a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, he cannot obtain the fond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn he coveted, what can be expected but that he ſhould ſicken with grief, and ſink under an oppreſſive load of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly? But though our fellow worms ſhould reject our love with diſdain, yet it is always—O! adorable goodneſs! it is always acceptable to God. Amidſt the adorations of millions of glorious angels, he graciouſly obſerves the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we pay him, and receives with complacency our ſmalleſt tribute of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. He knows that the ſouls which he has made cannot be happy until they return to him. Unceaſingly he calls to them—</p>
               <p>"<hi>SEEK ye my face.</hi>" And if, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by a thouſand diſappointments,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:030282_0191_0FE59864B3A0DBA0"/>
of the vanity of all other loves, we ſhould at length, happily take up our reſolution and ſay, "<hi>Thy face, O God, we will ſeek.</hi>" Immediately his prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love meets us more than half way; the harps of Heaven ſwell with louder ſtrains of joy, and ſongs of congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fill the eternal regions.</p>
               <p>DIVINE love infinitely exceeds in point of true happineſs, all other attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe, it does not, like them, expoſe us to the pangs of ſeparation. If that ſweet paſſion, which, with chains dearer than thoſe of gold, unites earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lovers, were never to be diſſolved, it would be well: But, alas! this is a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity which Heaven has not thought fit to confer on erring mortals. The iron hand of neceſſity or duty often tears us away from our deareſt friends, and conſigns us to weariſome months of mutual fears and reſtleſs longings for re-union. Sometimes, in the happieſt
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:030282_0192_0FE5A015F10F6708"/>
moments of friendſhip, the thought of death occurs and throws a ſudden damp on our riſing joys. Sometimes it is our lot to ſit by the ſick beds of thoſe we love, and hear their piercing moans, to mark, with unutterable anguiſh, the faultering ſpeech and ſinking eye, or wipe the cold damps of death from thoſe cheeks which we have kiſſed a thouſand times. Such ſcenes and ſeparations, and all mortal loves are liable to ſuch, occaſion a grief not to be equalled by all the misfortunes of life, and make us dearly pay for all the paſt pleaſures of friendſhip.</p>
               <p>IN theſe melancholy moments we are made to feel how truly bleſſed are they who have made the eternal God their love, nothing can ever ſeparate them from him. When the faireſt of the human fair are gone down into the duſt, and have left their lovers to mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and woe. Nay, when after millions
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:030282_0193_0FE5A017FB612430"/>
of revolving years, the ſun is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in the ſkies, and the lamps of heaven have loſt their golden flames; when old time himſelf is worn away, and nature ſunk under the weight of years; even then the God Jehovah will be the ſame, and his days ſhall never fail. Even then ſhall his triumphant lovers behold his glorious face cloathed in eternal beauty, and ſhall drink of the rivers of pleaſure that flow at his right-hand forevermore. Neither will the lovers of God ever experience, even in this world, the pangs of ſeparation from him, while they walk firmly in the golden path of duty. Should they be driven from their homes, and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to forſake their deareſt friends; ſhould they be compelled to plough diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſeas, or to toil in the remoteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the earth; even there they will ſweetly feel that

For as man is by nature a ſocial being, he muſt be miſerable unleſs he has ſome beloved friend to converſe with. But, as thoſe who do not love God, take little or no delight in converſing with him, they become more dependent on the company and converſation of their earthly friends. And, when deſtitute

               <p>HAPPILY different is the condition of the man who loves the great author of

his being! When that divine paſſion, (the ſoul's true light) is ſet up in our hearts, the ſcales of blindneſs fall from our eyes, the ſhades of night fly far away, and God, the bleſſed God, ſtands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed before our admiring view.

WHEN, leaving theſe amazing ſcenes, we contemplate other parts of the divine dominions; when we walk through the fields and obſerve his wondrous work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip in the touring trees or humbler ſhrubs; in the gentle rill or majeſtic flood; in the birds winging their airy flight, or perched on branches warb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their melodious lays; in the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful flocks grazing their ſimple paſtures with herds of nobler cattle; or, in the ſwarms of gilded inſects that, with ceaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs buzz, and vigorous motion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their golden wings to the ſun.

               <p>DIVINE love adds greatly to our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, becauſe it diſpoſes us to rejoice in every thing that ſeems connected with the honor of God. His Sabbath, his houſe, &amp;c. become objects of our moſt hearty love and delight.</p>
               <p>WE live in a country, where one day in every week is ſet apart for the public worſhip of God. To the man who loves not his maker, this diſpoſition of the ſeventh day is not very likely to be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As he is not a religious man, it is more than probable that he is a man of the world, a man of buſineſs or pleaſure; and in either caſe the Sabbath muſt be unwelcome, as it is an interruption, and indeed a clear loſs of one day's pleaſure or profit in every week. A loſs, which in the courſe of years muſt grow to be
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:030282_0199_0FE5986FF463AEA0"/>
very ſerious: For, if we take fifty, (the number of taſteleſs and unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sabbaths in the year,) and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thoſe by ſeventy, (the years in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran's life) we ſhall find that it will amount to eight or ten years. Now, out of ſo ſhort a life as threeſcore and ten, to be obliged to ſpend eight or ten years in lounging, moping, tireſome Sabbaths, muſt appear to men who have their intereſts and pleaſures at heart, a heavy tax, a great drawback. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch men would give their thanks; nay, I ſuppoſe, would chearfully vote the thanks of all chriſtendom to him, who ſhould put them in the way to make the Sabbath the moſt agreeable day in the week. Let us love God, and the work is done. We ſhall then rejoice that there is ſuch a day, becauſe our hearts will then approve the purpoſes for which it was appointed. A day that is taken from the cares of a ſhort
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:030282_0200_0FE598768AB65710"/>
life, and laid out on the intereſts of eternity. A day that is ſpent in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering our obligations to God, in thanking him for his favours, confeſſing our unworthineſs, and imploring his forgiveneſs; in ſhort, a day ſpent in a way ſo admirably adapted to inſtruct the ignorant, to reclaim the bad, to ſtrengthen the good, to honour God, and to make ourſelves happy; ſuch a day muſt, to him who loves God and man, be the moſt joyful day of the whole week.</p>
               <p>ON this account too, the man who loves God, will ſee a church in quite another light, and with ſentiments hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily different from thoſe of the man who loves him not. To the latter, prayers, pſalms and ſermons, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been weariſome; and, as it is in the church that he has been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do ſuch penance, he inſenſibly contracts a diſlike to it, and comes at
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:030282_0201_0FE5A022046BED70"/>
laſt to view it with ſentiments ſuch as thoſe with which an idle boy regards his ſchool-houſe.</p>
               <p>BUT the pious man, conſidering the church as the place where people meet to honor the God whom he <hi>delights</hi> to honor, to learn and love that goodneſs which he ſees to be ſo eſſential to the happineſs of the world, ſuch a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the church as the moſt beautiful and lovely building in the world; and the view of it gives him a more ſincere pleaſure than that which others feel in viewing the places of their moſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite amuſement.</p>
               <p>"<hi>How amiable are thy tabernacles, O God of hoſts; how pleaſant is the place where thine honor dwelleth!</hi>"</p>
               <p>BUT if gratitude, when exerted from man to man, produces ſo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it muſt exalt the ſoul to rapture, when it is employed on this great object of gratitude, on this infinitely benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:030282_0202_0FE5A025831B1310"/>
being, who has given us every thing we already poſſeſs, and from whom we expect every thing we yet hope for. When a good man looks around him on this vaſt world, where beauty and goodneſs are reflected from every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and where he beholds millions of creatures in their different ranks, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the bleſſings of exiſtence, he looks up to the <hi>univerſal Father,</hi> and his heart glows within him. And in every comfort which ſweetens his <hi>own</hi> life, he diſcerns the ſame indulgent hand. Is he bleſt with tender parents, or with generous friends who preſs him with their kindneſs? Is he happy in his family riſing around him, in the wife who loves him, or in the children who give him comfort and joy? In all theſe pleaſing enjoyments, in all theſe beloved objects he recognizes the hand of God. Every ſmile of love, every act of tenderneſs is an effect of
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:030282_0203_0FE5A02715E64ED8"/>
his goodneſs. By him was kindled every ſpark of friendſhip that ever glowed on earth, and therefore to him it juſtly returns laden with the pureſt incenſe of gratitude. Has God prepared a table for him, and cauſed his cup to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow? Inſtead of aſcribing it to the policy of his own councils, or to the ſtrength of his own arm, he gives the praiſe to him alone, who ſtrews the earth with good things for man, and teaches him wiſdom to improve and convert them to his own uſe.</p>
               <p>THUS it is that gratitude prepares a good man for the enjoyment of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for not only has he as full a reliſh as others of the innocent pleaſures of life, but, moreover, in theſe he holds commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God. In all that is good or fair, he traces <hi>his</hi> hand. From the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of nature, from the improvements of art, from the bleſſings of public or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, he raiſes his affections to the
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:030282_0204_0FE5A0292915C2E0"/>
great fountain of all the happineſs which ſurrounds him, and thus widens the ſphere of his enjoyments, by adding to the pleaſures of ſenſe, the far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite joys of the heart.</p>
               <p>BUT divine love adds greatly to our happineſs, not only by giving a freſh flavour to the ſweets of proſperity; but by correcting in an eminent degree, the bitterneſs of <hi>adverſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS in times of proſperity, among perhaps a few real friends, many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ones intrude themſelves, who in the hour of diſtreſs are quickly diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and know us no more; ſo in thoſe times alſo, many falſe and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed joys court the affections and gain the heart of inconſiderate man. But, when calamity comes, thoſe vain <hi>joys</hi> immediately diſcover their deceitful nature, deſert the aſtoniſhed man in his greateſt need, and leave him a prey to ſhame, ſorrow and remorſe.
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:030282_0205_0FE5A02B42C66B30"/>
Adverſity is the grand teſt of what is true and what is falſe among the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent objects of our choice; and our love of God, tried by this teſt will ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its infinite value and excellence. Perſons of every character are liable to diſtreſs. The man who loveth God, and he who loveth him not, is expoſed to the ſtroke of adverſity. But on the bad man, adverſity falls with double weight, becauſe it finds them without defence and without reſource. When his health, his riches and pleaſures, in which he placed his happineſs, are all torn from him, overwhelmed with ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deſpair, he knows not whether to turn for relief. If, as is moſt natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for a creature in diſtreſs, he lifts his ſupplicating eyes to his maker, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ingratitude and diſobedience to God, immediately check him: if he turn to his fellow-men, whom he has abuſed or neglected, conſciouſneſs of meriting their
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:030282_0206_0FE5A02F5EAF7030"/>
contempt or averſion, diſcourages him. If he ſeeks relief in his own mind, there, ſhame, remorſe and ſelf-condemnation, muſt overwhelm him.</p>
               <p>BUT to the man whoſe ſoul rejoices in his God, adverſity has nothing gloomy and terrible. Believing every thing in the world to be under the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of God, and looking up to that God, as to an all-wiſe and benevolent father and friend, he welcomes every thing that comes from him. Perſuaded that the Father of Mercies, delighteth not needleſsly to <hi>grieve</hi> the children of men; and well knowing that he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw this impending affliction, and could eaſily have prevented it: he concludes, that, ſince it <hi>is</hi> come, it is come on ſome errend of love.

O the ſweetly powerful influences of love! Love can enable the ſugar-doating child cheerfully to take the cup of <hi>wormwood,</hi> from the hand of the parent whom he loves. Love can cauſe the delicate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to forget better days, and to ſmile in poverty and toil with the huſband whom ſhe loves. Aye, and if we loved God as we ought, none of his dealings would ſeem grievous to us. The very idea, that this or that affliction was brought on us by him, would ſweetly reconcile us to it, and kindle in us a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ambition to pleaſe him by the cheerfulneſs of our ſubmiſſion. Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we ſhould look on not as marks of
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:030282_0208_0FE5A0330FA17700"/>
God's diſpleaſure, but as certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of his love—
<q>"As many as I love, I chaſtiſe."
<bibl>JEHOVAH.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"<hi>I HAVE ſmitten you with blaſting and mildew, your vineyards and your fig trees did the palmer worm devour.</hi>"—JEHOVAH.</p>
               <p>AND then the love that did this, makes this complaint, "<hi>Yet ye have not returned to me.</hi>"</p>
               <p>"<hi>PESTILENCE have I ſent amongſt you; I have made the ſmell of your dead to come up even in your noſtrils.</hi>"</p>
               <p>AND then the ſame love that inflicted this wholeſome chaſtiſement repeats the complaint. O my brethren, ſee here the deſign and end of all God's chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements! "<hi>Yet have ye not returned to me.</hi>"</p>
               <p>THESE are the views in which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine lover is taught to contemplate the afflictive diſpenſations of his God; not as the meſſengers of his wrath, but as the miniſters of his mercy, and the great
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:030282_0209_0FE5A03518421928"/>
means of wiſdom and virtue. Such views of God's adorable government, impart the moſt ſenſible conſolation to every pious heart. They place the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions of the univerſal Father, in the moſt endearing light. And theſe <hi>afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which human follies render neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; inſtead of eſtranging, do but the more cloſely attach a good man to his God. "<hi>Although the fig tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the vine; the labour of the olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat: yea, though the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls; yet, will I rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi>"</p>
               <p>BUT a ſupreme love of God adds unſpeakably to the happineſs of life, becauſe it raiſes us ſuperior to the dread of death. To form a tolerable idea of the magnitude of this bleſſing, let us viſit the death bed of him who is about
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:030282_0210_0FE5A03911810C70"/>
to depart without love or hope in his God.</p>
               <p>BEHOLD him arreſted by the ſtrong arm of death, and ſtretched out hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and deſpairing on that laſt bed from which he is to riſe no more. Art has done its all; the mortal malady mocks the power of medicine, and haſtens with reſiſtleſs impetuoſity to execute its dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful errand. See the thick gloom that covers his ghaſtly countenance, and the wildneſs and horror that glare on his rolling eye-balls! Whither now is fled that giddy thoughtleſſneſs which mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his mad career through life? Where now are his ſcoffs, his ſneers, his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantries on religion? Where are his boon companions who joined him in his dull profanity, and who applauded the keeneſs of his ſatire and the brilliancy of his wit? Alas! ſuch ſcenes as theſe are not for them.

<pb n="210" facs="unknown:030282_0211_0FE5A03AF7E21760"/>
conſolation to a dying friend is no employment of theirs. In far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſcenes they are now forgetting their no longer entertaining friend, and their preſent alarming thoughts.</p>
               <p>UNHAPPY Man! wherever he turns his eyes, he ſees none but ſubjects of ſorrow and diſtreſs. Forſaken by thoſe whom he fondly called his friends; cut off from all the pleaſures and cheerful purſuits of men, abandoned to the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of a dying chamber, with no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations but thoſe of a tortured body; no comfortor but a guilty conſcience, and no ſociety but ſuch as fills his troubled mind with ſhame and remorſe; a weeping wife whom he has injured; children whoſe beſt intereſts he has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected; ſervants whom he has treated with cruelty; and neighbours with whom he has long lived at ſhameful variance—Whither ſhall he look for help? If he look backward he ſees nothing but ſcenes
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:030282_0212_0FE5A03D0A222D60"/>
of horror, a precious life miſpent, an immortal ſoul neglected; and, O inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable thought! his day of trial about to ſet forever. If he looks forward, he ſees an offended God, a fearful reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and an awful eternity. If he looks up to Heaven for mercy, conſcious guilt depreſſes his ſpirits and overwhelms him with deſpair. Ah! what mortal ſcene can well be conceived more fraught with wretchedneſs!

               <p>BUT in heaven, our love of God will have none of theſe diſquieting circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attending it; for there he will never be abſent from us, but will be continually entertaining our amorous minds with the proſpect of his infinite beauties. There we ſhall always feel his love to us in the moſt ſenſible and endearing effects, even in the glory of that crown which he will ſet upon our heads, and in the raviſhing ſweetneſs of thoſe joys which he will infuſe into our hearts. There we ſhall experience the continuation of his love in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued fruition of all that an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heaven means, and be convinced,
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:030282_0220_0FE5A05002E28298"/>
as well by the perpetuity of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us, as well as by the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his nature, that he is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable lover. And there we ſhall find him a moſt happy being, happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the vaſteſt wiſhes of our love; ſo that we ſhall not only delight in him, as he is infinitely lovely, but rejoice and triumph in him too as he is infinitely happy. For love unites the intereſts, as well as the hearts of lovers, and gives to each, the joys and felicities of the other. So that in that bleſſed ſtate we ſhall ſhare in the felicity of God proportionably to the degree of our love to him: For the more we love him, the more we ſhall ſtill eſpouſe his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py intereſt; and the more we are inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in his happineſs, the happier we muſt be, and the more we muſt enjoy of it. Thus love gives us a real poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and enjoyment of God; it makes us co-partners with him in himſelf, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:030282_0221_0FE5A0520B341290"/>
his happineſs upon us, and makes it as really ours as his. So that God's happineſs is, as it were, the common bank and treaſury of all divine lovers, in which they have every one a ſhare, and of which, proportionably to the degrees of their love to him, they do all draw and participate to all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And could they but love him as much as he deſerves, that is <hi>infinitely,</hi> they would be as infinitely bleſſed and happy as he is: For then all his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would be theirs, and they would have the ſame delightful ſenſe and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, as if it were all tranſplanted into their own boſoms. God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being an infinitely lovely, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loving, and infinitely happy being, when we come to dwell forever in his bleſſed preſence, our love to him can be productive of none but ſweet and raviſhing emotions; for the immenſe perfections it will then find in its object,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:030282_0222_0FE5A055851BADA0"/>
muſt neceſſarily refine it from all thoſe fears and jealouſies, thoſe griefs and diſpleaſures that are mingled with our earthly loves, and render it a moſt pure delight and complacency. So that when thus refined and grown up to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the heavenly ſtate, it will be all heaven, it will be an eternal paradiſe of delights within us, a living ſpring whence rivers of pleaſures will flow for evermore.</p>
               <p>THESE, O man, are ſome of the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en fruits that grow upon the tree of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love. Happy, therefore, is the man, beyond all expreſſion of words, beyond all conception of fancy, happy is he who obtaineth this angelic virtue!</p>
               <p>"<hi>FOR the merchandiſe of it is better than the merchandiſe of ſilver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies, and all the things that thou canſt deſire are not to be compared unto her. She is a tree of life to them</hi>

               <p>SINCE a ſupreme love of God is the only true wealth of an immortal mind, O! with what diligence ſhould we apply ourſelves to obtain it! We are all ready enough to acknowledge our obligations to God, and to own that it is our duty to love him, but ſtill complain of the difficulty that attends it. But let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that this difficulty is chargeable upon ourſelves, and is the effect of our own ſhameful inconſideration. Taken up with the little cares of life, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect and forget God; hence, it is not ſurpriſing that we do not love him. Would we but often think of him, what he is in himſelf, and contemplate him in the full blaze of his wonderful and amiable perfections, we ſhould be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with delightful admiration of him, and eaſily take up the moſt exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eſteem and friendſhip for him. And
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:030282_0224_0FE5A05920091878"/>
were we but frequently to conſider him, what he is to us, how infinitely condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, generous and good, we ſhould ſoon feel our hearts melting into all the tenderneſs of love and gratitude. We, none of us think it hard to love the tender mother who brought us into the world, the fond father who ſupplies our wants, or the attentive teacher who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us in uſeful and ornamental knowledge; ah! why then ſhould we think it hard to love our God? Did we but reflect, we ſhould ſoon perceive that he is really and truly our mother, our father and our teacher; and that thoſe whom we honor as ſuch, are, properly ſpeaking, only the inſtruments of his goodneſs to us.</p>
               <p>SYLVIA arrived to years of maturity, receives the addreſſes of a young and accompliſhed lover. Sylvia bluſhes and likes him. Youthful modeſty cauſes her to heſitate a while, yet, unable to
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:030282_0225_0FE5A05B2E292768"/>
reſiſt ſo much merit, ſhe at length yields to the impulſe of a virtuous paſſion and marries. In due ſeaſon ſhe becomes a mother. Now, what has Sylvia hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to done for her child? The whole is the work of God. When he laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the heavens and the earth, he had this child in view, and diſpoſed, from ſo remote a period, a long chain of events, which were to terminate in his nativity. The time being come for the opening of this bud, he was pleaſed to place it in Sylvia's womb, and took care himſelf to cheriſh and unfold it.</p>
               <p>THAT this child ſhould love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor his mother is what he certainly ought to do, for ſhe has ſuffered, if not for his ſake, at leaſt through him, the inconveniencies of pregnancy, and the pains of child-birth. But let him carry his grateful acknowledgments ſtill high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and not imitate thoſe ſuperſtitious idolators, who, ſeeing the earth yearly
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:030282_0226_0FE5A05F442A40F0"/>
covered with corn, fruits and paſtures, ſtupidly worſhipped this blind inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bounties of their Sovereign Lord, without ever thinking to praiſe the powerful arm from whence it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives its fruitfulneſs.</p>
               <p>CHARLES loves his father Eugenis, Charles does well; but what has Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genis done for Charles? Eugenis has not, it is true, reſembled that proud pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent who beggars the reſt of his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in order to ſwell the fortune of an elder brother. Nor is he like that ſtern tyrannical father who never looks at his children but with fury, never ſpeaks to them but in paſſion, never inſtructs them but by threats, and corrects them like a butcher and a murderer. Nor yet does he act like Florimond, that unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural father, who lives like a ſtranger in his own houſe; goes in and out, drinks, games, and ſaunters; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while his neglected children grow up
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:030282_0227_0FE5A060D689E9A8"/>
to the years of maturity; happy indeed if of themſelves inclinable to virtue, they make any attainments in uſeful knowledge and accompliſhments, or think of ſettling in the world; for as to his part, he never troubles his head about them. No, far unlike theſe, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genis is the beſt of parents; he ſpares no pains nor expence to render his ſon Charles an ornament and a bleſſing to his country. He accuſtoms him by times to a temperate diet, furniſhes him with decent apparel, and charges the ableſt maſters with his inſtruction; he carefully teaches him his relation to God, and his obligations to that beſt of beings; and, at the ſame time, by precept and example, endeavours to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire him with the love of juſtice, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and induſtry. Theſe are, to be ſure, the deareſt expreſſions of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's love, and hard and deteſtable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed would be Charles' boſom, if he
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:030282_0228_0FE5A062DFFFA680"/>
could refuſe to love ſuch a parent; but let him remember, that all this comes ultimately from God; for we ſhould always aſcend to this original of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. When Eugenis watched for his ſon's preſervation; it was God who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him; when he took care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him, it was God who opened his underſtanding; and when he entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the charms of virtue, it was God who excited him to love it.</p>
               <p>"<hi>THE labourer digs the mine; the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher directs the work; but neither of them furniſh the gold which it contains.</hi>"</p>
               <p>BUT what heart ſo hard as to reſiſt the golden ſhafts of love, eſpecially when coming from a friend that is far ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to us? If ſome good and mighty prince were to invite us to his court, and to treat us with all the tenderneſs of parental affection, ſhould we not find it a very eaſy thing to love him? Now, has not this been the conduct of God
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:030282_0229_0FE5A064F08A1A08"/>
our Maker? When we lay in all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of duſt, he ſent a meſſage of love, and called us into life, not the life of fluttering inſects, but of infant immortals. For us, and for our ſakes, he built this vaſt world; he covered it with the canopy of the heavens, and ſtored it with good things innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. At his command the ſun riſes to gladden us with the golden day; and the moon with ſilver beams to cheer the darkneſs of the night. He waters the hills from his ſecret cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and bids the clouds pour down their fattening ſhowers upon the earth. Thus he covers our tables with bread to renew our ſtrength, and with wine that makes glad our hearts.</p>
               <p>BUT he has not only compaſſed us round, like ſo many fortunate iſlands, with a vaſt ocean of good things for our bodies; but he has likewiſe inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with immortal minds, and has
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:030282_0230_0FE5A06933A90D48"/>
induced them with the high capacities of <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> whereby, as on golden ladders, we may aſcend to the perfection and happineſs of celeſtial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And to gratify theſe our noble capacities, he has prepared for us a glorious heaven, and has furniſhed it with all the pleaſures and delights that heavenly ſpirits can deſire or enjoy. Beſides all this, he has ſent his own ſon from heaven to reveal to us the way thither, and to encourage us to return into it by dying for our ſins, and thereby obtaining for us a public grant and charter of mercy and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, on condition of our return: and, as if all this were too little, he hath ſent his ſpirit to us in the room of his ſon, to reſide amongſt us, and, as his vicegerent, to carry on this vaſt deſign of his love to us, to excite and perſuade us to return into the way leading to heaven, and to aſſiſt us all along in
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:030282_0231_0FE5A06AC7B309F0"/>
our good travels thither. Such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful care has he taken not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated of this his kind intention to make us everlaſtingly happy. "<hi>O that men would therefore love the Lord for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and declare the wonders that he doth for the children of men.</hi>"</p>
               <p>THAT theſe dear pledges of God's love may inſpire our hearts with ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able returns of gratitude, we ſhould often <hi>reflect</hi> on them, and ſpread them before our minds in all their endearing circumſtances. We ſhould frequently ſet our cold and frozen affections before theſe melting flames of his love, and never ceaſe fanning the ſmoking flax until we feel the heavenly fire begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to kindle in our boſoms.</p>
               <p>AND, while we are ſeeking this <hi>Iſrael</hi> of <hi>great price,</hi> let us, as we hope for ſucceſs, guard our <hi>innocence,</hi> as the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling miſer guards his hoarded gold. The boſom that burns with impure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:030282_0232_0FE5A06CD131AC20"/>
or that is corroded with malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant paſſions, finds no delight in God. No, that is a happineſs reſerved only for the pure in heart, and for him who knows how to pity an offending bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>AND, together with our own exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we ſhould often implore the aid of all aſſiſting heaven. To him, who alone knows its ineſtimable worth, let our fervent prayers be conſtantly aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>"<hi>FATHER of life and love, thou God ſupreme, O teach our hearts to love thee: For to whom, O Lord, ſhall we give our hearts but to thee? Thou alone haſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly created them; thou alone haſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely deſerved them; and thou alone canſt completely and eternally ſatisfy them.</hi>"</p>
               <p>THESE preſcriptions, faithfully obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will ſoon produce in our hearts that love, whoſe joy paſſeth all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that love, poſſeſſed of which, the
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:030282_0233_0FE5A06EDBA68978"/>
pooreſt ſlave is paſſing rich; while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, the ſceptered monarch walks but in ſplendid poverty.</p>
               <p>HE who loves God is the alone wiſe, dignified and happy man. For he loves the only good that is worthy the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of an immortal mind. He loves a friend who alone poſſeſſes almighty power to protect him, unerring wiſdom to counſel him, and infinite love to bleſs him. He loves an immortal friend who can never die and forſake him, and an unchangeable friend who will never requite his love with neglect.</p>
               <p>HIS love of God ſweetens every duty, and makes the yoke of obedience to ſit light. It heightens the ſmile of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and cheers the gloom of adverſity. Bleſſings are doubly dear coming from ſuch a friend; and afflictions not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome, when looked on as tokens of his no leſs tender love. Under the languors of ſickneſs he remembers, not
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:030282_0234_0FE5A07275668840"/>
without ſacred comfort, that the end of his ſufferings is at hand; and even when this earthly tabernacle of his fleſh is pulling down, he is not diſconſolate; he rejoices in the hope of that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houſe not made with hands, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the heavens. There, far remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all the miſeries of this mortal life, advanced into the preſence of him who made him, and accompanied by millions of loving and bleſſed ſpirits, he ſhall enjoy a happineſs as far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his expectations as his deſerts:—"<hi>A happineſs which eye hath not ſeen nor ear heard, nor hath entered into the heart of man to conceive.</hi>"</p>

               <p>THE firſt fruits of a creature's love are due to God, as to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and the author of all his good; the ſecond are due to men, as to his brethren and fellow ſharers in the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their common parent.

To be careſſed and beloved by all around us, is one of the deareſt wiſhes of the human heart. It is a natural, it is a laudable wiſh. Great pains have been taken, and infinite expence incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to attain this coveted honor, and yet the greater part never attain it, merely through defect of love on their own part. Let beauty, wit, gold, &amp;c. boaſt and do all they can, yet will it be found in the end, that
<q>
                     <l>"In ſpite of all the dull miſtaken elves,</l>
                     <l>"They who wou'd make us love, muſt love, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>LOVE is the univerſal charm. It poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes a beauty that wins and raviſhes every heart. A ſingle ſpark of it in generoſity of dealing excites our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; a glimpſe of it in courteous behaviour ſecures to a man our eſteem, and ſweetly endears him to us. How charming is the countenance that is brightened by the ſmiles of love! How ſweet the voice that is tuned by the
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:030282_0237_0FE5A07879A026C8"/>
melody of love! How gladdening to the heart, the beams that ſparkle from the eye of love! Indeed love, or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is but another name, is the only amiable thing in nature. Power and wealth may be reſpected, wit and beauty may be admired, but if ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from goodneſs, they neither deſerve nor can command our love: For the worſt and moſt wretched of beings poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them in a very high degree. The prince of darkneſs has more power, and tyrannizes over more ſlaves by far than the Great Turk. One devil may have more wit than all the Achitophels in the world, and yet, with all his wit, he is very odious and miſerable. And ſuch, in proportion, is every one who partakes in his accurſed diſpoſition of hatred and malice.</p>
               <p>SEE how Pandorus is beloved and careſſed. Is it becauſe of his honeſty? This virtue only gains our eſteem, but
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:030282_0238_0FE5A07CEA21CC10"/>
does not captivate the heart. Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is beneficent and friendly? Many who are ſo fond of his company have no need of his aſſiſtance. Is it becauſe he is gay, humorous, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining? This would render him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, only when gaiety is ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. No, he is more beloved than any other man in the world, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the moſt <hi>affectionate</hi> man in it. He ſeems to live but to pleaſe, to oblige, and to ſerve his friends. If he find out what will pleaſe you, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents your deſires, and does it with ſuch an air of cheerfulneſs, that, while he has no other view than to oblige you, he ſeems to follow nothing but his own choice and inclinations. This charming complaiſance of Pandorus was not learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſchool of the world; but is the rich fruit of his genuine benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Hence it renders him equally endearing and equally agreeable, at all
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:030282_0239_0FE5A07E828D0BB0"/>
times, and to all ranks. He is not a ſycophant to the great, and ſcornful or negligent of the poor; he does not treat you to-day as a <hi>dear friend,</hi> and to-morrow <hi>knows you not,</hi> but <hi>uniformly</hi> his looks and manners are thoſe of the man who conſiders both the rich and the poor as his brethren. If you love like Pandorus, and like him take a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in contributing to the happineſs of others, I will anſwer for the friendſhip of all who know you; this is a perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that will engage people at all times, in all places, and on all occaſions.</p>
               <p>BUT love not only renders us thus dear and deſireable to others; but it ſpreads the ſunſhine of ſweeteſt peace over our own minds. It delivers us from the tyranny of all thoſe bad paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which make us miſerable. Like a golden curb it checks the fierceneſs of anger, that dangerous ſtorm and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane of the ſoul. A man can hardly
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:030282_0240_0FE5A0808C8B26B0"/>
be incenſed againſt thoſe whom he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly loves: an accidental neglect, a haſty word, a ſmall unkindneſs, will not agitate a loving ſpirit, much leſs work it up to hateful <hi>fire-eyed</hi> fury.</p>
               <p>IT baniſhes envy, that ſeverely juſt vice which never fails to puniſh itſelf; for it is impoſſible to repine at the wealth or proſperity, at the virtue or fame of him whom we cordially love. It excludes revenge, that cruel canker of the heart; for who can indulge bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſentments, or form dark deſigns of evil againſt him whom he tenderly loves, and in whoſe good he heartily delights?</p>
               <p>IT ſubdues ambition and avarice, thoſe aſpiring painful paſſions. For who could domineer over thoſe whom he loves, and whoſe honor he tenders as his own? Who could extort from and impoveriſh thoſe whom he earneſtly wiſhes and would gladly ſee to proſper?
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:030282_0241_0FE5A0829A7D0D38"/>
A competence will ſeem like abundance to him who lives as among brethren, taking himſelf but for one among the reſt, and can as ill endure to ſee them want as himſelf.</p>
               <p>IT is in the prevalence of ſuch bad paſſions as theſe, that human miſery chiefly conſiſts. Love is their only ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign antidote. It alone ſubdues and expels their fatal poiſon, and thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores health and happineſs to our long tortured boſoms. Love, like a celeſtial queen, walks before, meekneſs and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs follow as her eldeſt daughters, while joy and peace, with all the ſiſter graces, make up the immortal retinue.</p>
               <p>BUT love preſerves us not only from our own, but from the malignant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of others. Like ſweeteſt muſic, it has power to ſooth the ſavage breaſt, to melt hearts of flint, and to tame the fierceſt ſpirits. Its mild and ſerene countenance, its ſoft and gentle ſpirit

its courteous and obliging manners, its fair dealing, its endearing converſation, its readineſs to do good ſervices to any man, is the only charm under heaven to diſarm the bad paſſions of men, and to guard our perſon from aſſault, our intereſt from damage, and our reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſlander. For who can be ſo unnatural as to hate the man who loves us and is ever ready to do us good? What wretch, what demon, can find in his heart to be a foe to him who is a warm friend to all? The vileſt ſinner cannot be ſo vile, ſo deſtitute of goodneſs. <hi>If you love thoſe who love you what reward have you, do not even ſinners the ſame?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OF this wonderful power of love, to convert foes into friends, we have many pleaſing examples in holy writ. Eſau was a rough man, and exceedingly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with his brother Jacob, and yet how eaſily did Jacob's meek and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate behaviour overcome him! "<hi>Eſau</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="unknown:030282_0243_0FE5A087AAB18508"/>

               <p>SAUL was poſſeſſed with a furious envy and ſpite againſt David. Yet what acknowledgments did David's generous dealing extort from him?—</p>
               <p>"<hi>IS this thy voice my ſon David? Thou art more righteous than I, for thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded me good, whereas I have reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the evil; behold I have played the fool, and erred exceedingly.</hi>"</p>
               <p>THOUGH gratitude is not ſo common a virtue as it ought to be, yet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his former kindneſſes often ſurrounds a good man in diſtreſs, with many warm friends and generous comforters. Is he in danger, who will not defend him? Is he falling, who will not uphold him? Is he ſlandered, who will not vindicate him?</p>
               <p>LOVE diſpoſes us to put to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per uſes every bleſſing that may fall to our lot; while, <hi>without it,</hi> the moſt

ſplendid advantages that we could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the largeſt fortunes and brighteſt parts, will become vain and fruitleſs, if not pernicious and deſtructive to us. For, what is our reaſon worth if it ſerve only to contrive little ſorry deſigns for ourſelves? What is wit good for, if it be ſpent only in making ſport, or creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſchief? What ſignifies wealth, if it be uſeleſsly hoarded up, or vainly thrown away on the luſts of one poor worm? What is our credit but a mere puff of air, if we do not give it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by making it an engine of doing good? What is our virtue itſelf, if bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in obſcurity it yield no benefit to others by the luſtre of its example, or by its real influence? If theſe advantages miniſter, only to our own particular pleaſure or profit, how mean and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable they appear!</p>
               <p>BUT under the management of love, ſee what worth and importance they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume.
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:030282_0245_0FE5A08BBB80F4B8"/>
Our wealth becomes the bank from which the weeping widow, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent young tradeſman, and the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs orphan, draw the ſupply of their wants. Our wit is employed to expoſe the deformities of vice, and to paint virtue in her lovelieſt colours. Our knowledge is applied to inſtruct the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, to admoniſh the guilty, and to comfort the wretched. Thus love ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles us to lay out our talents in ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a manner as to ſecure thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable bleſſings—the love of God, the friendſhip of mankind, and all the exquiſite pleaſures of doing good. How great then is the worth of love, ſince without it the goods even of the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt are but temporal and tranſient, ſuch as too often prove dangerous ſnares and baneful poiſons, and are at beſt but impertinent baubles.</p>
               <p>LOVE gives worth to all our apparent virtues, inſomuch, that without it no
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:030282_0246_0FE5A08F57937620"/>
quality of the heart, no action of life is valuable in itſelf or pleaſing to God. Without love, what is courage, but the boldneſs of a lion or the fierceneſs of a tyger? What is meekneſs but the ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a woman, or the weakneſs of a child? What is politeneſs, but the gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mace of a monkey, or the fooleries of a fop? What is juſtice, but paſſion or policy? What is wiſdom but craft and ſubtilty? Without love, and what is faith but dry opinion? What is hope but blind preſumption? What is alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving but oſtentation? What is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom but ſtubborneſs? What is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion but a mockery of God? What is any practice, how ſpecious ſoever in itſelf, or beneficial to others, but the effect of ſelfiſhneſs and pride? "<hi>Though I have faith ſo that I could remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and have not love, I am nothing. Though</hi> I give all my goods to feed <hi>the</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="unknown:030282_0247_0FE5A090E9055F90"/>
                  <hi>poor, and have not love, it profiteth me nothing.</hi>"</p>
               <p>BUT love ſanctifies every action, and converts all that we do into virtue. It is true bravery indeed, when a man, out of love to his neighbour, and a hearty deſire to promote his good, encounters dangers and difficulties. It is genuine meekneſs, when a man out of love, and an unwillingneſs to hurt his neighbour, patiently puts up with injuries. It is politeneſs indeed, when cordial affection expreſſes itſelf in civil language, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful manners, and obliging actions. It is excellent juſtice, when a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding his neighbour's caſe as his own, does to him as he would have it done to himſelf. It is admirable wiſdom, which ſtudies to promote our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's welfare. It is a noble faith, which, working by love, produces the rich fruits of obedience. It is a ſolid hope, which is grounded on that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:030282_0248_0FE5A092F97044F8"/>
baſis of love which never fails. It is a ſincere alms, which not only the hand but the heart reaches out. It is an acceptable ſacrifice, which is kindled by the holy fire of love. It is an hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed devotion which is offered up from a heart pure and benevolent like the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom it adores.</p>
               <p>LOVE is a grand inſtrument of our happineſs, becauſe it alone renders ſweet and pleaſant all the duties which we owe to our neighbour. All agree, that the ſecond great buſineſs of men in this life is to learn to love one another. And ſince the conſtant performance of kind and generous ſervices to each other, tends moſt effectually to fan the flame of love, our heavenly Father is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually calling on us to perform thoſe good offices to our brethren. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>the ſtrong to bear the burdens of the weak, the rich to abound in good works</hi>
                  <pb n="248" facs="unknown:030282_0249_0FE5A0950BEA3B60"/>
                  <hi>to the poor, the poor to be cheerfully oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rich,</hi> and all of us to exerciſe meekneſs, gentleneſs, hoſpitality, juſtice, honor, truth, &amp;c. Such ſentiments and works of beneficence and love, make a conſiderable part of our duties, duties that occur every <hi>day</hi> and <hi>hour</hi> of our lives. To perform theſe with alacrity and pleaſure muſt add greatly to our happineſs, becauſe, ſince they occur ſo frequently, if we have but the art to turn them into pleaſures, our whole life muſt be one continued round of pleaſure. Whereas, on the contrary, if we take no delight in them, we ſtand a fair chance to lead very uneaſy lives; as we ſhall be continually called on by duties which we cannot perform with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reluctance, nor yet neglect without much vexation and regret.</p>
               <p>WOULD we have this, our field of trial, to become a garden of pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Let us love. Love is the great
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:030282_0250_0FE5A097880CC2B0"/>
wonder-worker. It converts duties into delights, and penances into pleaſures. Are you wealthy? In making you ſo, heaven kindly intended for you the joy of acting as the friend and benefactor of the poor. That you may be ſenſible how eſſential love is to the cheerful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the duties of beneficence, turn your eyes towards Dives: In him you behold one of the wealthieſt of the ſons of fortune. His cellars, his barns, his coffers, are all burſting out with abundance; but his heart poſſeſſes not one ſpark of love. Alas! the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of his lacking <hi>this one thing needful.</hi> Hence, though poſſeſſed of wealth ſufficient to enable him, like the good angel of his neighbourhood, to ſcatter bleſſings around him on at leaſt fifty needy families; he loſes the joy, and they the benefit of ſuch noble cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. Deſtitute of love, Dives takes no delight, even in feeding the hungry,
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:030282_0251_0FE5A099D45D6100"/>
in cloathing the naked, or in ſoothing the ſorrows of ſickneſs and poverty. Unhappy Dives! Works of love which bleſſed angels would prefer to their nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar and ambroſia, are ſet before thee, but thou haſt no reliſh for them. Dives keeps a ſplendid table, has vaſt apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, rich furniture, coſtly jewels, a large number of ſervants, and ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous equipages; and that is enough for him; his poor childiſh fancy has no idea of any thing ſuperior.</p>
               <p>BUT ſee the noble and excellent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mophilus. Demophilus poſſeſſes an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate not inferior to that of Dives; but his eſtate, though ample, is not half ſo ample as his heart. Demophilus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies himſelf all the pomps and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities of life, in order that he may ſwell the tide of his liberality to the poor. It were an endleſs, though pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taſk, to relate how many friendleſs little children he has educated, how
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:030282_0252_0FE5A09BDBA1AB60"/>
many poor young tradeſmen he has ſet up in good buſineſs; and how many helpleſs old perſons, provided for by his bounty, are now ſpending the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their days in peace and comfort. Every day is to Demophilus a day of happineſs, becauſe it is ſpent in offices of kindneſs to thoſe whom love has taught him to view in the endearing light of relations; and, in ſerving whom, he acts with all the alacrity of a brother. Thus love employs him in ſuch good works as yield the pureſt pleaſures while he is engaged in them, and the remembrance of which will be a well of ſweeteſt waters ſpringing up in his boſom to eternal life.</p>
               <p>ARE you a poor man? You will find love to be equally eſſential to your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hapineſs. Love will not only preſerve you from all the pangs of envy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content; thoſe infernal vipers which pry on the vitals of too many of our
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:030282_0253_0FE5A09DEB4E4DC0"/>
poor brethren! But it will enable you to look with the joy of a brother on the ſuperior proſperity of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. It will inſpire you with that ſublimeſt devotion, prayers for your wealthy neighbour, that he may be ſenſible of the bleſſings he poſſeſſes in poſſeſſing wealth and power, that he may be thankful for them, and put them to ſuch good uſe as at once to pleaſe the ſupreme giver, to win the gratitude of the poor, and to fill his own heart with joy.</p>
               <p>ARE you in debt to your neighbour? Then it nearly concerns you to love him. I will not indeed ſay, that if you do not love, you will never pay your debts, for a ſenſe of honor may incline you, as it does many who are deſtitute of love, to be honeſt; but this I will ſay, that if you love your neighbour, you will pay him with much more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and ſatisfaction than you other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:030282_0254_0FE5A0A143F65FB0"/>
could. If you love your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, you will not be able to run in debt to him, when you forſee that you can never pay him.</p>

               <p>Now turn your eyes to a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent character; I mean Benevolus. It is love only that makes the difference. Benevolus owes a ſum of money to his neighbour Agathos. Benevolus poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes not only that delicate ſenſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and that nice regard to reputation, thoſe laudable motives to duty which animate all men of honor; but he feels ſome of a ſweeter and ſtill ſtronger na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.—Benevolus loves his neighbour Agathos; hence he takes an intereſt in his welfare. Agathos, in lending this money, ſhewed a confidence in Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volus. Benevolus is eager to evince that it was well-founded. Agathos, may by this time be <hi>wanting</hi> his money,—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolus feels an anxiety to replace it. Benevolus has reaſon to believe that it would be a pleaſure to Agathos to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

               <p>"I ONCE, ſaid the charming Pulche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, owed a neighbouring woman, a ſum: On going to her houſe to pay it, I met one of her daughters, whoſe dreſs ſhewed a tattered wardrobe: my heart rejoiced that the ſupply of their wants was at hand: and had I, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the dear girl, been in ſufficient circumſtances, nothing would have made me happier than to have owed them ten times as much."—O for more love; more love! Without this, there can be not only no pleaſure, but indeed no <hi>ſteadineſs</hi> in the payment of debts.—Great ſtreſs I know has been laid on what is called a ſenſe of honor: But a mere man of honor is an unſafe debtor. In thoſe corrupted countries, where the <hi>laws</hi> and <hi>faſhions</hi> are not very decidedly in favour of juſtice, men of honor have

               <p>MISOCHRISTIS is a man of honor; but he lives in a country where it happens not to be the <hi>faſhion</hi> for men of honor to pay their debts under three or four years.

Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten had he avoided them before by making his ſervants deny him; but, unfortunately, that ſtratagem would not anſwer to day, for they poped in upon him before his uſual hour of riſing. He at firſt determined not to ſtir out of his chamber; but they as obſtinately determined not to ſtir until they ſaw him. He then ordered his ſervant to tell them that he was indiſpoſed and could ſpeak to no body; but the news of his indiſpoſition did not ſoften them in the leaſt:—See him they muſt. Whereon he ſent word that he would

But the benevolent Agathocles, a ſtranger to ſuſpicion, grants the loan. Adraſtus pockets the money and rides off, the happieſt man in the world. For three years the good Agathocles got nothing from Adraſtus but empty promiſes and ſorrowful details of diſappointments and loſes. At length a war breaks out, and the country wanting money, the preſs is converted into a mint, and paper dollars are ſtruck off by the ream. Theſe the legiſlator pronounces to be of equal value with gold and ſilver,
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:030282_0265_0FE5A0BA1459A7E0"/>
and threatens trouble to the tory that ſhall refuſe them as ſuch. "<hi>Hurra for us debtors,</hi>" is now the cry. Bleſſed times! Whole caravans of honeſt men are now in motion to pay their debts. Adraſtus joins the happy throng; and taking a witneſs with him, waits on the good old Agathocles, whoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous loan of a <hi>thouſand guineas,</hi> he pays off with half a quire of paper cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency—worth about £. 40.</p>
               <p>ALAS! poor honor! when ſevered from the love of God, and of man, what art thou but an empty name! Had Adraſtus loved his God, could he thus have deſpiſed that golden precept which enjoins him—<hi>to do unto others as he would that others ſhould do unto him?</hi>—Had Adraſtus loved the generous Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, could he have thus requited him evil for good—could he have thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payed the nobleſt friendſhip with the
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:030282_0266_0FE5A0BDA23A0620"/>
baſeſt ingratitude?—Let the following true ſtory reply.</p>
               <p>A YOUNG gentleman, whom we ſhall call Leander, had the good fortune to be born of parents, who well knew that happineſs conſiſts rather in the good qualities of the heart, than in the rich contents of the ſtrong box. He was therefore early taught to look on the love of God and of his neighbour, as the beſt wealth that man or angel can poſſeſs. His progreſs in virtue was equal to the fondeſt expectations of his parents. Truth, honor and goodneſs, ſhone ſo conſpicuouſly in all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that to love him, one needed but to know him. At the age of three and twenty he loſt his father; and poſſeſſing but a very ſmall fortune, he reſolved to go into trade. Leander had five or ſix mercantile friends, each of whom throwing in a couple of hundred pounds worth of goods, made him up a pretty
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:030282_0267_0FE5A0C0030B6758"/>
aſſortment. With great alacrity he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon this new employment; but, as it would ſeem, merely to evince the error of thoſe parents, who think that religion alone is ſufficient to make their children happy. His father had taken great pains to fit him for heaven; but had not ſufficiently inſtructed him to make his way good here on earth. He had ſcarcely ever told Leander, that though it be happineſs to love, it is ſtill virtue to be prudent; and, that to mingle the <hi>harmleſſneſs of the dove with the wiſdom of the ſerpent,</hi> and to <hi>take head of men,</hi> even while he <hi>loves them,</hi> are commandments of the Great Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher himſelf. He had hardly ever men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to Leander, the importance of receipts, vouchers, and written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts; nor related to him the many ſad inſtances of unſuſpecting goodneſs ſnared and ruined by inſidious villainy; and how often, for want of receipts,
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:030282_0268_0FE5A0C211312B38"/>
the beſt men have been compelled to a ſecond payment of debts that have kept their noſes to the grindſtone half their lives after. No; but to conſider all men as the children of God, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs of glory; to love them as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to <hi>think evil of no man</hi>—theſe were the only ſentiments which Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was taught: Theſe he carried with him behind the counter. Leander was ſoon found out to be a <hi>fine young man!</hi> every body admired his goods, and wiſhed to buy if they could but have a little credit. Leander anticipated every wiſh, and credited every body.</p>
               <p>IN a very ſhort time, out of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds worth of goods, he had not a remnant left. His rivals were ſit to burſt with ſpleen and envy at ſuch prodigious ſales; while his friends aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed ſuch ſingular ſucceſs to divine interpoſition. At the appointed time his creditors demanded their money.
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:030282_0269_0FE5A0C41DD0C448"/>
The too credulous Leander was not prepared to pay. Unable to wait longer, they ſeized on his little patrimony, and threw him into priſon. Cruel parents, who thus expoſe your children uncover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſhield of prudence, to the <hi>fiery darts</hi> of fraud and villainy! O re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the want of prudence, is too often, even in the beſt men, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by the want of virtue; and that, in many inſtances, the devil himſelf aſks not an abler advocate for <hi>vice</hi> than <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.</hi> Happily for Leander, his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue was full grown, and of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. He did not, as thouſands have done, curſe that eaſineſs of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that benevolence of ſentiment, which had duped and betrayed him; he did not vow eternal war againſt his ſpecies, and reſolve to practiſe in future the ſame arts which had wrought his ruin. No! fraud and injuſtice now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him hateful as the hags of hell.
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:030282_0270_0FE5A0C814C71B68"/>
While, by contraſt, his love of virtue was exalted to adoration. To have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, though unintentionally, and thence to have injured his patrons, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Leander much grief; but it was grief unimbittered by the gall of guilt. To have diſcovered ſuch a want of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and humanity among men, excited emotions, but they were the emotions of compaſſion, not of reſentment. Still <hi>his prayers and his benevolence went up before God.</hi> After fifty days confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſtill virtuous Leander was diſcharged from priſon, and from all legal obligation to pay his former debts. He then went round again among his debtors; many of whom affected by his pathetic remonſtrances, diſcharged their accounts. With this money, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing a ſmall aſſortment of goods, he entered a ſecond time into trade, and with becoming caution. At the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of five years, having ſaved enough
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:030282_0271_0FE5A0C9A61E3978"/>
for that purpoſe, he haſtened up to town to pay off his former debts, and to evince the divinity of that love, which cannot be happy while it <hi>owes any man</hi> any thing. He called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his former creditors to a tavern, where, by his orders, a handſome din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was prepared for them. He receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with the utmoſt cordiality, and, without having as yet gratified their curioſity as to the occaſion of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he politely preſſed them to ſit down to dine. On turning up their plates, every man beheld in a heap of ſhining gold, the full amount, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and intereſt, of his former claim againſt Leander.</p>

WE have been copious on this part of our ſubject, for a very plain reaſon: the payment of our debts is a duty that occurs ſo frequently, that whatever tends to make it a pleaſure, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently add <hi>greatly</hi> to our happineſs; and have abundantly ſhewn it is love, and love alone that can make honeſty at all times a pleaſure.</p>
               <p>BUT there are many other duties, of equal importance to our own, and to the happineſs of ſociety, to the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful performance of which, love is as indiſpenſibly neceſſary. This man's ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice may claim a part of our eſtate; or that man's unprovoked rage may inſult our perſon, or ſlander our name; now, to bear all this with temper, and to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociate ſo diſcreetly with theſe our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous neighbours, as to diſarm their paſſions, and to make an honorable and laſting peace, is certainly a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable event; but it is an event which
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:030282_0273_0FE5A0CDC8A9D1B8"/>
nothing but almighty love can accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh. And through defect of this love, how frequently have we ſeen the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt incroachments, or provocations to ſtir up ſuch horrid paſſions, in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms of neighbours, and to hurry them into ſuch ſhameful exceſſes of injury and revenge, as have ended in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of each others ſouls, bodies, and eſtates!</p>
               <p>LET the real hiſtory of goodman Gruff and his neighbour Grub, eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date this melancholy truth.</p>
               <p>THESE two men, whoſe fortunes were ample, lived near neighbours to each other; ſo near, that their lands, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the paſſion of their owners, lay and ſlept together in the moſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraces. That good being who had thus appointed their lots together in the ſame pleaſant places, had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably intended, that they ſhould learn from their own experience, how
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:030282_0274_0FE5A0D10E7E76E8"/>
happy a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. But alas! the ways of peace they knew not, for they were both ſtrangers to love; and, by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſequence, both proud, ſelfiſh, iraſcible and vindictive. On a reſurvey of his plantation, goodman Gruff found that his neighbour Grub had about two acres and a quarter of his ground in poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>NO ſooner had he made this <hi>impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant diſcovery,</hi> than he ſent orders to Mr Grub, and not in the moſt gentle terms, inſtantly to remove his fences, from that ſpot of ground, or he ſhould adopt meaſures to compel him. From no friend on earth, would Mr. Grub have brooked ſuch a meſſage; but from Gruff, it was altogether inſupportable. A reply, ſuch as pride and hatred could dictate, was immediately made. A law ſuit, of courſe, commenced.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="unknown:030282_0275_0FE5A0D2CD600E98"/>
THIS produced the effect that uſually attends law-ſuits,—"a death unto friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and a new birth unto hatred." Every expence incurred in the courſe of the ſuit inflamed their mutual hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for they never failed to ſet down theſe expences to the account of each others roguery: They never deigned to ſalute, or to exchange a word; and, if accident at any time threw them into the ſame company, they caſt ſuch eyes of death on one another, and were ſo pointedly brutal in their manners, as to ſhock all who were not loſt to humanity. To be threatened with the loſs of two acres of land, or to have that much with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, though each poſſeſſed many more than they could cultivate, was enough in ſuch ſordid ſouls, to awaken the moſt deadly paſſions. Theſe were ſoon communicated to the reſt of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. The wives and daughters, could not, even at church, treat each other
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:030282_0276_0FE5A0D4E0F9C1D8"/>
with common civility; and the ſons often diſgraced themſelves in bloody battles. Nor was this all, for their poor unoffending cattle, their hogs and horſes, who, <hi>poor things!</hi> knew not the right leg from the left, were made to feel the ſad effects of this unnatural ſtrife: For, if careleſsly wandering in queſt of graſs or roots, their homely fare, they happened in luckleſs hour, to ſtray within the hoſtile lines, ſtraight a troop of angry ſlaves, with worrying dogs and furious ſtones, attacked them: or ſlily taking and loading them with yokes, doomed them to waſte full many a day in woe and pain.</p>

But being found, as generally happens, much more compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated than it had at firſt appeared; it was kept ſo long in the different courts in which it had the fortune to be tried, that goodman Gruff was often heard to ſay, that <q>though he had gained his ſuit, yet, through loſs of time, neglect of buſineſs, tavern charges, and extra fees to lawyers, he had expended at leaſt one hundred half-joes.</q> While poor Grub, obliged to carry on ſo long a ſuit with monies borrowed on an exorbitant premium,
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:030282_0279_0FE5A0DBA29BAE20"/>
incurred a debt which coſt him the whole tract, together with the two acres and a quarter which he had ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately defended.</p>

               <p>HAD theſe unfortunate men but loved, they might have lived happy.

               <p>ASK the benevolent old Ralph, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would thus have threatened and perſecuted his neighbour Paul for a couple of acres? Obſerve how he ſhakes his venerable locks, and, with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance

ſtrongly marking his abhorrence of ſuch a thought, thus replies:—</p>
               <p>
                  <q>NO, my friend, two acres of land ſhould never have ſet me and my neighbour Paul at variance. Forty years have we lived near each other, and, thank God, it has been forty years of peace and friendſhip. Paul appears to me now like a brother; and the affection that I have for him, gives me a double enjoyment of what I have, becauſe of the pleaſure I find in communicating of it to him. If I take a hive, he is ſure to receive a plate of the choiceſt comb. If I kill a fat mutton, the beſt quarter is ſent to him. His company heightens my joys, his counſel and aſſiſtance leſſen the weight of my ſorrows. Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we enjoy the good things of this life, and together we often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe about the happineſs of that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life to come.

all this ſweet heavenly peace, and plunge myſelf into helliſh hatred and ſtrife, by quarrelling with my good friend Paul on account of two acres of ground? No, no, no; ſooner than ſee that hated day, let theſe eyes be cloſed for ever; and let my grey hairs go down with joy to the grave! Take two acres of land from Paul? O how gladly would I give him a thouſand!</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT ſuppoſing, Father Ralph, that inſtead of the gentle Paul, it had been your deſtiny to dwell in the neighbourhood of the churliſh Mr. Gruff, how would you have reliſhed his orders to relinquiſh two acres of your land?</p>
               <p>

BUT, what if he had replied, that ſince by the late variation of the compaſs, the limits of his tract were ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged as to take in thoſe two acres of yours, he claimed them by virtue of the law, and would have nothing to do with arbitrators?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>WHAT would I have done? Why, I would have pitied him—from the bottom of my heart would I have pitied him for ſuch a ſentiment. And on taking my leave, would have addreſſed him in ſuch words as theſe:—Neighbour Gruff, the good for which you ſeem ſo ready to contend, deſerves not to be put in the ſcale againſt the numerous evils of a law-ſuit. Let famiſhed ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men quarrel and fight for a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of bread, or draw lots for each others lives, but for us who live in a land ſo thickly ſtrewed with the bleſſings of heaven, that we

I feel, neighbour Gruff, that love and peace are the greateſt bleſſings of life, and, well knowing that law-ſuits are no friend to thoſe, but, on the contrary, their moſt mortal enemies, I wiſh never to have any thing to do with law-ſuits—I mean on ſuch trifling occaſions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the ſake of God, the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of peace, and for our mutual good, I cheerfully compliment you with theſe two acres for which you are ſo ready to go to law with me.

LOVE adds greatly to the happineſs of man, becauſe it puts us in poſſeſſion and gives us the enjoyment of every thing that is good and deſireable in this life. By it, we may, without greedy avarice, or its cares and drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſwim in tides of wealth. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proud ambition or any of its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and dangers, we may aſcend to the higheſt ſeats of honor: without ſordid voluptuouſneſs, or its diſeaſes and diſguſt, we may baſk in the lap of true pleaſures; without its pride, luxury or ſloth, or any of its ſnares and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we may feaſt at the table of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity. We may pluck the richeſt fruits of ſcience and learning, without the pain of laborious ſtudy: and we may taſte the ſweets of virtue and goodneſs without their toils. For, are not all theſe things ours, if we make them ſo, by finding much delight and ſatisfaction in them? Does not out neighbour's
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:030282_0285_0FE5986A5BA10F20"/>
wealth enrich us, if we are happy in his poſſeſſing and uſing it? Does not his preferment advance us, if our ſpirit riſes with it into a cordial complacency? Does not his pleaſure delight us, if we are pleaſed with his enjoyment of it? Does not his proſperity bleſs us, if our hearts exult and triumph in it? This is the true Philoſopher's ſtone, the divine magic of love which conveys all things into our hands, giving us a poſſeſſion and uſe in them of which nothing can deprive us.</p>
               <p>BY virtue of this, (as Paul juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) <q>
                     <hi>Being ſorrowful we yet always rejoice; having nothing we yet poſſeſs all things.</hi>
                  </q> Neither is this property in our neighbour's goods merely imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, but real and ſubſtantial; indeed, for more real to the true lover of men, than it is generally to the legal owners of them. For how is property in things otherwiſe to be conſidered than by the
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:030282_0286_0FE5A0F0B162B728"/>
ſatisfaction which they yield to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed owner? And if the benevolent man find this ſatisfaction in them, and in a high degree, why are they not truly his? May not the tree with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of propriety be called yours if you can pluck and enjoy its fruits at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? Nay, does not the propriety more truly belong to you, if you equally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefit, without partaking the trouble and expence which fall on the real owner? A loving man therefore can never be poor or miſerable, except all the world ſhould come to want and diſtreſs, for while his neighbour has any thing, he will enjoy it—<q>
                     <hi>rejoicing with thoſe who rejoice.</hi>

               <p>BUT love not only advances us to the higheſt pitch of happineſs attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this life, but, like a true friend, it will accompany us into heaven, and there complete our felicity, by exalting

us to the ſociety of <q>

               <p>AMONG all the nations of the earth, the pleaſing perſuaſion has prevailed, that the ſouls of good men ſhall paſs away after death into brighter climes than theſe, where aſſembled in the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſociety, they ſhall enjoy pleaſures which were never permitted them to taſte in this vale of tears.</p>
               <p>THIS ſtrongeſt and deareſt ſentiment of nature, is confirmed by revelation, which aſſures us, that heaven, the city of the eternal King, is inhabited by a great multitude, which no man can number, compoſed of all the wiſe and good that ever exiſted in the univerſe of God; and who, now ſeparated from every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, dwell together in the deareſt amity and peace.</p>
               <p>DESIREABLE indeed muſt an acceſs to ſuch a ſociety appear to us, who dwell in theſe abodes of frail humanity,
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:030282_0288_0FE5A0F453487E30"/>
whoſe paſſions are ſo much at variance with our repoſe! This man wounds us by a mortifying neglect, that inſults us with ſcorn and contempt. A third cruelly envies our felicity. A fourth inhumanly ſlanders our good name. And a fifth goes to law with us for our eſtate. While thoſe few who love us, often add to our uneaſineſs by their follies or vices. Who would not leave ſuch a wretched ſociety as this, and gladly go to mingle with thoſe bleſſed friends, who can no more be miſerable themſelves, nor render us ſo? Where every countenance will ſhine upon us with ſmiles of undiſſembled affection; and every eye will beam unutterable love? Where mighty angels will be as endearingly attentive to us, as fondeſt bretheren; while heavenly ſages will pour forth the treaſures of their wiſdom to entertain us, though the feebleſt of ſaints?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="unknown:030282_0289_0FE5A0F5E365F748"/>
BUT, alas! is it for us whoſe hearts are defiled, and who drink in iniquity like water, to be numbered with theſe children of God, and to have our lot among ſuch ſaints? Yes it is. For though the precious gold of Ophir could not purchaſe ſuch high honors for us; and though rocks of proffered diamonds would not be received in exchange; yet there is a power, a ſecret charm, that can open for us the everlaſting doors, and admit us into thoſe courts of glory. That charm is LOVE, which, by exerciſing every odious paſſion, and adorning us with its own celeſtial gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, will ſecure our welcome, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us dear to every ſaint in paradiſe. And were it not for love, which thus refines our nature, and transforms us into angels of light, never could we mingle in the ſociety of thoſe heavenly lovers.</p>
               <p>

                  <q>BIRDS of a feather flock toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q>—As gentle doves, who delight in mutual careſſes, fly on wings of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, from thoſe birds whoſe fiery eyes threaten hateful ſtrife; ſo angels of love, muſt retire with as natural an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, from the ſociety of dark and malignant ſpirits. Between no two things in nature, does there exiſt ſo irreconcilable an oppoſition, as between love and hatred. Water and oil—fire and ſnow, may, by the powerful arts of chemiſtry, be taught to forget their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive antipathies, and to ruſh together into friendly embraces: But by no arts can tender-hearted love be brought to look with complacency on any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of hatred and miſery. And the more ardent our love, the more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite will be our diſtreſs, at the view of ſuch ſcenes.</p>
               <p>PHILANDER, whoſe life is a ſeries of beneficence that reflects honor on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:030282_0291_0FE5A0FC88B55308"/>
nature, was, during the earlier part of his days, ſtrangely fond of that moſt vulgar practice, boxing. But hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to read Dr. Blair's ſermon on gentleneſs, he was brought to ſee ſo clearly, the beauty and bleſſedneſs of a benevolent temper, that he has ever ſince cultivated it as the brighteſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and higheſt happineſs of his life. Philander often now obſerves to his friends, that nothing ſurpriſes him more than the difference which he finds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the feelings, of the preſent and paſt periods of his life. That formerly, when a ſtranger to love, the ſight of a battle was <hi>matter of fun</hi> to him; and a broken head, or a bloody noſe, a mere bagatelle, <hi>quite a trifle.</hi> But that now, were he compelled to ſee two men ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in battle, and with furious counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and eyes darting hatred, inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cruel blows on each other, he verily believes it would harrow up his ſoul
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:030282_0292_0FE5A0FE962A4548"/>
and ſill him with inſupportable horror. And ſuch, I am confident, would be the feelings of every truly benevolent heart. Now, if we who are but babes in love, and whoſe hearts ſtill retain much of their former hardneſs and inſenſibility, are, notwithſtanding, ſo ſhocked at the ſight of bad paſſions; how much more would the bleſſed angels, thoſe pure ſpirits of love, be ſhocked at the ſight of ſuch things? Hence, it clearly appears, that were God to throw open the gates of heaven, and to invite us to enter with all our pride, haughtineſs, ſcorn, envy and hatred about us; ſo far from being welcome to the angels, we ſhould turn their heaven into hell. It would grieve their generous boſoms, to ſee us ſo completely damned; and it would equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhock their feelings to ſee us ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly loathſome and abominable; and they would, no doubt, prefer their joint petitions to God, for permiſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:030282_0293_0FE5A100A53B76B0"/>
into ſome other part of his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where, far removed from ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting ſcenes, they might renew their joys in contemplating the beauty of each others virtues, and in rejoicing in the greatneſs of their mutual bliſs. Would we therefore gain a welcome admiſſion into thoſe bleſt abodes, where angels and the youngeſt ſons of light, ſpend their bliſsful days in joys unknown to mortal ſenſe—Let us Love. This is the darling attribute of God; "<hi>For God is love.</hi>" And this is the grace that gives to miniſtering ſpirits all their ſurpaſſing joys and glories. Waſhed in this heavenly Jordan, the fouleſt leper becomes freſher than the new-born babe. Bathed in this divine Betheſda, the blackeſt heart and moſt malevolent ſpirit becomes whiter than ſnow. Mark the glorious change. His eyes, lately glaring with infernal fires, now emit the ſofteſt beams of benevolence. His
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:030282_0294_0FE5A105DB560818"/>
cheeks, once pale with envy, now bloom with the roſy-red of joy. His counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, e'er while dark with angry paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, now wear the opening radiance of friendſhip. His voice, lately broken and diſcordant with rage, is now ſweeter than muſic; his heart, once the den of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous adders, is now the abode of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleſt affection; and he who ſome time ago was the terror or hatred of all who knew him, is now become the delight of each eye and joy of every heart. His admiring friends, view him with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port as a dear monument of the mighty power of love; while holy angels wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him with ſweeteſt ſymphonies, and fill the eternal regions with accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of joy. "<hi>Behold, this our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was loſt, but is found, he was dead, but is alive.</hi>"</p>
               <p>AND though on our firſt entrance into the company of bleſſed angels, we cannot be half ſo loving and lovely as
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:030282_0295_0FE5A107C6014310"/>
they are, yet will not this diminiſh their affection for us; for, clearly perceiving, that though but babes, we yet poſſeſs the fair features and precious qualities of godlike ſouls, they will cordially love and tenderly embrace us, as their young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er brethren, and as infant angels. While meeting with no cruel obſtructions to our love, as in this world, but on the contrary, finding ourſelves beloved and careſſed by each ſaint and angel, we ſhall daily become more grateful and affectionate, and conſequently more love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the eyes, and more dear to the hearts, of thoſe bleſſed people. And now, what words can expreſs, what fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy can conceive the various and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite pleaſures, that we may expect to meet with, in ſo wiſe, ſo all-accompliſhed and endearing a ſociety? If the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good natured wits,</hi> be ſo highly entertaining, that men of taſte would give any thing to ſpend an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:030282_0296_0FE5A109DF799630"/>
with a party of ſuch; how much more deſireable muſt it be to ſpend an eternity in the company of angels? For, as in point of knowledge, wit, and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, they muſt be far ſuperior to the brighteſt geniuſes of our world, and incomparably more affectionate, they cannot but make the moſt delightful company. From the vaſt ſtores of their wiſdom and experience, they can eaſily draw an almoſt infinite variety of the moſt entertaining topics, on which ſuch good and gentle ſpirits, will not fail to converſe in the moſt free and endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner. Then, what a heavenly converſation muſt theirs be, whoſe ſcope is the moſt glorious knowledge, and its law the moſt perfect friendſhip?</p>
               <p>WHO would not willingly leave a child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, forward and ill natured world, for the bleſſed ſociety of thoſe wiſe friends and perfect lovers? And what a felicity muſt it be to ſpend an eternity, in ſuch
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:030282_0297_0FE5A134933D2008"/>
a noble converſation? Where we ſhall hear the deep philoſophy of heaven com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with mutual freedom, in the wiſe and amiable diſcourſes of angels, and of glorified ſpirits, who, without any reſerve or affectation of myſtery, without paſſion or peeviſh contention for victory, do freely philoſophize and impart the treaſures of each others knowledge? For ſince all ſaints there are great philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and all philoſophers perfectly ſaints, we may conclude, that knowledge and goodneſs, wiſdom and love, will be moſt charmingly intermixed throughout all their converſation, and render it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful in the higheſt degree. When therefore we ſhall leave this vain and unſociable world, and on our landing on the ſhores of eternity, ſhall be met by all our good old friends, who are gone to heaven before us, and who now with infinite joy for our ſafe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, receive and conduct us into the
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:030282_0298_0FE598737567F388"/>
ſplendid ſociety of all the good and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſouls, who ever lived in the world: when we ſhall be familiar friends with angels and archangels; and all the ſhining courtiers of heaven ſhall call us bretheren, and welcome us into their glorious ſociety, with all the tender en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments and careſſes, of thoſe heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lovers, O how will all theſe mighty honors and joys, ſwell our boſoms with tides of tranſport almoſt too big to bear!</p>
               <p>BUT love not only renders us thus happy, by adorning us with ſuch graces as give us a hearty welcome to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and joys of angels; but, O god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like power of charity! it even enables us to make all their joys our own.</p>
               <p>IT is a natural property of love, when ſincere, to unite ſo cloſely the hearts o lovers, as to make their intereſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and thus to render the joys of the one, the joys of the other. Every man carries in his own boſom a proof of
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:030282_0299_0FE5A10B71654B50"/>
this delightful truth. Do not the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of a dear brother, give us as exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite joy, as if we ourſelves were adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them? Have not the high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations beſtowed on a beloved ſiſter, thrilled through our hearts, in as pure ſtreams of pleaſure as if we ourſelves had been the honored ſubject of them? Now, if love, which is a native of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, produces, even in the cold ſoil of the human heart, ſuch <hi>delicious fruits of joy</hi> at the ſight of our neighbour's happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, how much more copious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite muſt be its growth and flavour, when reſtored to heaven, it enjoys all the energies of its native ſoil and cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate? If therefore, while here on earth, we make ſuch progreſs in brotherly love, as to reliſh our neighbour's happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as our own, "<hi>heartily rejoicing with him when he rejoices;</hi>" we may reſt aſſured, that on going to heaven, and entering into the ſociety of bleſſed
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:030282_0300_0FE5A10DDA2563D0"/>
angels, we ſhall find the joys of congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulating love, far ſuperior to what we ever experienced in this world. With what ſacred delight ſhall our hearts overflow, when, on opening our eyes in thoſe bliſsful manſions, we behold around us, ſuch bright bands of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beings? The ſight of theſe lovely and happy people, will open new ſprings of joy in our boſoms. With what wonder, love, and praiſe, ſhall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template that hand which drew ſuch mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent ſcenes; theſe ſtreets paved with gold, theſe gorgeous palaces hewn from diamond quarries, theſe walls flaming with the ſtones of heaven, theſe rivers flowing with liquid ſilver, theſe fields decked with immortal flowers, theſe ſacred ſhades formed by the trees of God; and which, after having cloathed theſe regions in ſuch godlike ſplendors, raiſed up ſo many myriads of glorious beings to inhabit them forever? There,
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:030282_0301_0FE5A1125FC15178"/>
among thoſe favoured ſpirits, we ſhall meet with none of thoſe melancholy ſcenes which here ſo often embitter our lives. Here, the ſtrong pains and cries of thoſe whom we love, often wring our hearts and call tears of bittereſt ſorrow from our eyes; but there, God ſhall wipe all tears from our eyes, and pain and ſickneſs are unknown. Here, the pale cheek, the hollow eye, and trembling voice of languiſhing friends, often ſicken our hearts, and preſs our ſpirits to the earth; but there, health blooms with freſheſt roſes on each im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal cheek, and imparts a vigor that ſhall never know decay. Here, we often behold our deareſt relatives ſtruggling in the agonies of death, and hear, with ſtupifying grief, their laſt expiring groans; but there, among thoſe holy angels, death never ſhewed his ghaſtly countenance, and their glorified bodies are deathleſs as the eternal Jehovah.
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:030282_0302_0FE5A113F0C95D58"/>
Now, what words can expreſs the joys of thoſe bleſſed people, who love each other with a tenderneſs unknown to mortal boſoms, and whoſe love is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually feaſted with the view of each others happineſs, a happineſs which no time can terminate, and which neither man nor devil can impair! For perfect lovers have all their joys and griefs in common between them; but the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lovers having no griefs among them, do only communicate their joys to one another. And where they love ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as they do in heaven, there can be no ſuch thing as a private or particular happineſs, but every one <hi>muſt</hi> have a ſhare in that of every one, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in this, their mutual communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of joys, every one's happineſs, will, by his friendſhip to every one, be multiplied into as many happineſſes as there are ſaints and angels in heaven; and thus, every joy, of every member
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:030282_0303_0FE5A1169E0A0C58"/>
of the church triumphant, runs round the whole body, in an eternal circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For that bleſſed body being all compoſed of conſenting hearts, that, like perfect uniſons, are tuned up to the ſame key, when any <hi>one</hi> is touched, <hi>every one</hi> echoes, and reſounds the ſame note: and while they thus mutually ſtrike upon each other, and all are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with every one's joys, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, but, that in a ſtate where there is nothing but joy, there ſhould be a continual concert of raviſhing harmony among them. For ſuch is their dear concern for one another, that every one's joy not only pays to, but receives tribute from the joy of every one: ſo that when any one bleſſed ſpirit rejoices, his joy goes round the whole ſociety, and then all their rejoicings in his joy, reflow upon, and ſwell and multiply it; and ſo as they thus cordially borrow each others joys, they always pay them
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:030282_0304_0FE5A119CB4F08E8"/>
back with intereſt, and by thus recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, do everlaſtingly increaſe them. And now, what unſpeakable rejoicing and congratulations will there be among us, when we ſhall paſs all heaven over, through ten thouſand millions of bleſſed beings, and meet none but ſuch as we moſt dearly love, and are as dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by? eſpecially when we ſhall find no defect either of goodneſs, or happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them, nor they in us, to damp our mutual joy and delight, but every one ſhall be what every one wiſhes him—a perfect and bleſſed friend.</p>
               <p>WHAT eternal thanks do we not owe to the author of all good, for giving us ſouls that are capable of aſcending to the ſociety of theſe glorious beings, and of participating forever in their exalted delights? And how muſt it inflame our gratitude to him for appointing LOVE to be the golden road leading to thoſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial regions, and for employing ſo
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:030282_0305_0FE5A11BC3EEAB08"/>
many arguments, and taking, if we may thus ſpeak, ſo much pains to perſuade us to walk in it? For, take all the laws of God, whether written on hearts of fleſh, or tables of ſtone, or on ſofter leaves of evangelic paper, and caſt them up—What is their amount? LOVE.—<hi>Love is the bond of perfection. Love is the fulfilling of the law. He hath ſhewed thee, O man! what is good, and what doth the Lord thy God require of thee but to love him, thy Parent God, with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thyſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND as God has thus enjoined love, ſo has he diſpoſed every thing in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt favourable to the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
               <p>FOR who is this neighbour whom we are enjoined to love? Is he ſome vile inferior creature whom it were hard, if not impoſſible to love? No, he is, on the coutrary, a moſt noble being, and deſcended from the greateſt family in
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:030282_0306_0FE5A11D545D2E38"/>
the univerſe. He is no leſs a perſonage, than a young prince, a ſon of the Great King eternal, whom he is not only allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but even commanded to call <hi>his</hi> father. If ſome young nobleman cloathed in ſilks and broad-cloaths, ſcented with rich per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, and richly equipaged, were to call at our houſes, we ſhould inſtantly be impreſſed with ſentiments of reſpect, and good will for him, and readily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite him to the hoſpitalities of our tables. But what are ſilver and gold? what are ſilks and broad-cloths? what are fine horſes and ſervants? in compariſon of that immortal ſoul which this neighbour poſſeſſes, and thoſe eternal beauties of which his ſoul is capable? know, that he was made but <hi>a few degrees lower than the angels,</hi> and that God, the true judge of merit, has, on account of the rich excellencies of his nature, created this world, with all the goodly bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:030282_0307_0FE5A11F62ECC3F0"/>
of heaven, and all the coſtly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of earth, to ſerve him.</p>
               <p>"<hi>THOU madeſt him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou haſt put all things under his feet.</hi>"</p>
               <p>HE poſſeſſes a ſoul capable of ſo <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly great and eternal a weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that rather than he ſhould be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of it forever by ſin, God himſelf came down on earth to expiate it, and by his own moſt perfect and amiable life and leſſons, to allure him back to love heaven. God has adopted him as his ſon, and made him a free denizen of his heavenly city; and has appointed his own glorious angels to wait on him, as on the heir of ſalvation and candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date for eternal glory. Can we then think it hard to love him whom God thus loves and thus delights to honor?</p>
               <p>BUT if it be eaſy to love a perſon of eminent dignity and excellence, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes eaſier and pleaſanter ſtill to love
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:030282_0308_0FE5A123EB9D3CC8"/>
him, if he be a near kinſman and friend. Well, this is truly the caſe betwixt our neighbour and us. He is our near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—our brother—bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh. God kindly raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him up to be unto us as a companion and a help-mate, to lighten our burdens, to multiply our comforts, and, like dear <hi>children walking in love,</hi> to enjoy toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the rich fruits of our mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, rejoicing in the preſent bounties of our common parent, and exulting in the hopes of better yet to come.</p>
               <p>AND as if all theſe tender and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing circumſtances were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, God himſelf has put forth his hand, and touched our hearts with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of good will towards each other.</p>
               <p>THESE native ſentiments of love, theſe dear remains of God's own image, origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſtamped on our minds, appear very viſible in all, even in thoſe unfortunates,
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:030282_0309_0FE5A125DA9DF700"/>
whoſe hard lot and corrupting compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions have done much to ſtifle them.</p>
               <p>TAKE you pooreſt of men! who gleans precarious and ſcanty bread, by hard and humble toil. His ſour looks and crabbed manners give room to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that he is a miſanthrope, an utter ſtranger to <hi>natural affection;</hi> but the ſlighteſt experiment will ſoon diſcover what tender ſympathies unite him to his kind.</p>
               <p>YOU need not tell him of flouriſhing cities, with all their gay inhabitants, ſwallowed up by the devouring ſword, or ruthleſs flames, while mourning mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions loaded with chains, are driven far from their native homes to make room for new maſters. No; ſuch horrid tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies are not neceſſary to touch the ſprings of his compaſſion. Let him but hear the ſong of Chevy Chaſe, or the tender ballad of the Babes in the Wood; or carry him to the Theatre, and let
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:030282_0310_0FE5A127E92825E8"/>
him hear, though but in a play, in mere fiction, the ſtory of poor Barnwell, let him behold that unfortunate young man, who ſet out in life charmed with comely virtues, and the darling of all who knew him; but ſoon alas! too ſoon, arreſted by a beauteous harlot, he falls an eaſy prey to her wiles, is ſtript of all his virtues and honors, and betrayed into crimes for which he dies on the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious gallows.—'Tis enough, this ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tale of woe calls up all his feelings of generous diſtreſs, and bathes his cheeks in floods of ſympathetic tears.</p>
               <p>DOES not this our ready diſpoſition to ſuffer with our ſuffering neighbour, and to <hi>weep with him when he weeps,</hi> plainly prove how much God has done to make it eaſy for us to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To this he has added another charming evidence, I mean the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible joy which he infuſes into our
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:030282_0311_0FE5A129F6C67DD0"/>
hearts on doing works of love to the neceſſitous.</p>
               <p>"PRAY ſir," ſaid a young Virginian to his friend, <q>on what act of your life do you reflect with the higheſt complacency?</q> "Why ſir," replied the other, <q>happening to hear that an old ſlave of my father's was ſick, I went up to his quarter to ſee him. On enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I found, that in conſequence of his extreme age, and inability to render further ſervices in the crop, he was cruelly neglected by the overſeer, and often made to ſuffer for a meal of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals. Bluſhing to find that this was the principal cauſe of his preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, I inſtantly returned, and taking a negro lad, carried up a flitch of bacon, a loaf of bread, and a peck of meal. On ſeeing the preſent which I had brought him, his half-famiſhed nature revived, and a ſudden guſh of tears trickled down his cheeks.

Lifting up his eyes, he gave me ſuch a look of gratitude and love, as pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced my very ſoul, and kindled a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which time, inſtead of diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, does but increaſe!</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE pleaſures which we find in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, we gratefully conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as given by the Creator, to attach us to thoſe refreſhments ſo neceſſary to life. With equal wiſdom and gratitude, let us remember that the heartfelt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light which accompanies and ſucceeds our deeds of love, were meant to allure us to cheriſh that divine affection which is <hi>better than life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FOR the ſame benevolent purpoſe, the author of our being is pleaſed to exert on us the whole force of another power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpring of action; I mean intereſt. Our deareſt intereſts in this world are beſt promoted, by maintaining a loving correſpondence with our neighbours. So uncertain is our condition, ſo liable
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:030282_0313_0FE5A130653F52F8"/>
are we all to the changes and chances of this mortal life, that no man can tell how ſoon he may owe his very life and fortune to the gratitude of a poor neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or ſlave who loves him. How many accounts have we heard of poor negroes, whoſe love for a good maſter has made them bravely to ſtep in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and danger; ſometimes, like faithful ſpaniels, plunging in, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him out of deep waters, where he was in the very act of drowning? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, like Salamanders, ruſhing upon and extinguiſhing furious fires, that were deſtroying his houſes, and perhaps half the labours of his life? And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, like Hectors, fighting with deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate courage in his defence, when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacted, and in danger of being ſeverely beaten and killed by his enemies?</p>
               <p>BUT love not only thus marſhals <hi>an army with banners</hi> around us for our
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:030282_0314_0FE5A1327B339808"/>
ſafety; it alſo pours a ſweet ſunſhine of peace and harmony over our days.</p>
               <p>ST. PAUL, who was a much ſafer guide in matters of <hi>religion,</hi> than Mr. Paine, adviſes us to <hi>walk in love with our neighbours, if we would lead a quiet and peaceable life.</hi> For as men naturally perceive a fragrance in the roſe, and a ſweetneſs in the honey-comb; ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally do they diſcern a heavenly charm and beauty in love. Adorned therefore with the friendly diſpoſitions, the fair dealings, and gentle manners of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine paſſion, we ſhall not fail to find favour in the eyes of our neighbours, and to be beloved and careſſed by them. Hence we walk among them as among brothers, in every face we ſee a friendly ſmile, at every houſe a hearty welcome, never deviſing any miſchief againſt them, we never dream of their deviſing any againſt us. Our hearts are now at reſt, our countenances are ſerene, our voices
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:030282_0315_0FE5987178C87FC0"/>
melodious, our manners mild, our ſleep ſweet, and our whole life quiet and peaceable: And, as a bleſſed conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of all this, together with the higheſt enjoyment of the preſent life, we are in the beſt frame of mind to prepare ourſelves for that which is to come. Happily freed from the anxiety and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of all bad paſſions, we profitably contemplate our numberleſs obligations to love God and one another, and thus, in the multitude of our good thoughts, daily grow in virtue and piety.</p>
               <p>BUT all this goodly Canaan, this land of love, flowing with richeſt milk and honey of peace, is ſnatched from our eyes by the demon-hand of hatred, and nought appears in its place but a land of darkneſs and of death, whoſe ſtreams are of gall, and its fruits of bitter aſhes.</p>
               <p>BY over-reaching a neighbour in a bargain (which we ſhall be too apt to do if we love him not), we make him
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:030282_0316_0FE5A1379201B5F0"/>
our enemy. Perhaps he has the ſpirit to tell us of our baſeneſs to our faces, or to talk of it behind our backs. This fires our boſoms with odious and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſſions. Challenges or law-ſuits, with all their ignominious vexations, hurtful, and often fatal conſequences, enſue.</p>
               <p>OR by treating him with unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſeverity (a thing very feaſible if we love him not), we enflame his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment to ſuch an height, that not content with ſtabbing our reputation, he threatens our property and lives. Our curſes now multiply thick and faſt upon our heads. We can no longer ſleep in quiet, from dread of having our houſes fired over our heads. We are actually afraid (the memory of thoſe who read may help them to inſtances) to ſtir out, or, like people in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of hoſtile Indians, muſt make
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:030282_0317_0FE5A139D8D39F10"/>
our viſits with piſtols in our pockets, and carabines in our hands.</p>
               <p>THUS, through defect of love, we are often dragged upon the ſtage againſt our wills, and there made to act parts in tragedies, which neither become nor pleaſe us. Our thoughts taken off from all delightful ſubjects, are turned to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous cares of ſelf-preſervation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Our minds are diſcompoſed by vexatious paſſions. Our credit is blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by falſe reports and ſlanderous defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations. Our hearts are kept continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally boiling with choler, our faces over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded with diſcontent, our ears filled with diſcordant noiſes of contradiction, clamor and reproach; and our whole frame of body and ſoul diſtempered with the worſt of paſſions. In the meantime our natural reſt is diſturbed, our neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry buſineſs is hindred, our happineſs in this life is utterly wretched and loſt, and the great concerns of heaven and
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:030282_0318_0FE5A13BEDF26BB0"/>
eternal glory are entirely laid aſide. O how much better it is to walk in the ſmooth and flowery paths of love, than thus to wander in the rugged ways of hatred, overgrown with briars, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with ſnares; to ſail gently down the courſe of life on the ſilver current of friendſhip, than to be toſſed on the tempeſtuous ſea of contention; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the lovely face of heaven ſmiling with a cheerful ſerenity, than to ſee it frowning with clouds or raging with ſtorms! How much a peaceful ſtate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles heaven, into which no ſtrife nor clamor ever enter, but where bleſſed ſouls converſe together in perfect love, and perpetual concord! And how a condition of enmity reſembles hell, that black and diſmal region of dark hatred, fiery wrath, and horrible tumult! How like a paradiſe the world would be flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in joy and reſt, if men would but cheerfully conſpire in love, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:030282_0319_0FE5A13D80206110"/>
contribute to each others good: and how like a ſavage wildneſs it now is, when like wild beaſts, they vex and perſecute, worry and devour each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>AND to conclude, let us remember, that "<hi>Love ſhall never fail,</hi>" and that, the man of love "<hi>ſhall be had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting remembrance, and his memory ſhall be bleſſed.</hi>" No ſpices can ſo embalm a man, no monument can ſo preſerve his name, as works of love. The renown of power, of wit, and of learning, may reſt on the minds of men with ſome admiration; but the remembrance of love reigns in their hearts with ſincereſt affection, there erecting trophies trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant over death and oblivion. The good man's very duſt is fragrant, and his grave venerable. His name is never mentioned without the tribute of a ſigh, and loud acclamations of praiſe. And even when he is gone hence, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:030282_0320_0FE5A141F1AF0650"/>
is no more ſeen, he remains viſible in the footſteps and fruits of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The poor man beholds him in the comfortable ſubſiſtence which he ſtill receives from his bounty. The ſick man feels him in the refreſhments which he yet enjoys from his charity. He ſurvives in the hearts of the afflicted, who ſtill remember the ſervices which he rendered them ſo cheerfully. And his weeping friends dry up their tears when they think of his virtues, the rich fruits of which they doubt not, he is now enjoying in a better world. <hi>His memory ſhall likewiſe endure forever,</hi> in the favor of God, and in thoſe glorious rewards which he will beſtow upon him for his love to his brethren. <hi>God will not forget his labour of love,</hi> but will raiſe him up after the ſhort ſlumbers of the grave, to receive that unfading crown, and that precious pearl of eternal life:—"<hi>Well done good and faithful ſervant,—I</hi>
                  <pb n="320" facs="unknown:030282_0321_0FE5A144D0B6BF60"/>
                  <hi>was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirſty and you gave me drink, naked was I and you cloathed me, ſick and in priſon and you viſited me, enter now into the joy of your lord.</hi>"</p>
               <p>THUS, when all the flaſhes of ſenſual pleaſure are quite extinct; when all the flowers of ſecular glory are withered away; when all earthly treaſures are buried in darkneſs; when this world with all its faſhions are utterly vaniſhed and gone, the good man's ſtate will be ſtill firm and flouriſhing, <hi>and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhall endure for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF then you would be happy indeed; happy in every condition, and in the diſcharge of every duty; happy in life and in death; happy in this world and in that which is to come; learn to LOVE.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>THIS having learnt, thou haſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſum of wiſdom. Hope no higher, though all the ſtars thou
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:030282_0322_0FE5A14690E7ED38"/>
knoweſt by name, and all the etherial powers; all ſecrets of the deep; all nature's works, or works of God in heaven, earth, air, or ſea; and all the riches of this world enjoyedſt, and all that rule one empire. Only add deeds to thy knowledge anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Add faith, add virtue, patience, temperance; add LOVE, the ſoul of all the reſt; then ſhall thou not be loath to leave this world, but ſhalt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit a world that's happier far.</q>
