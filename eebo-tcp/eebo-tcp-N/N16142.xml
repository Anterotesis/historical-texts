            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE yielded with diffidence to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations of the Principal of the Academy, in undertaking to expreſs my regard for the proſperity of this Seminary of Learning, by ſubmitting to your candor, a few Thoughts upon Female Education.</p>
            <p>The firſt remark that I ſhall make upon this ſubject, is, that female education ſhould be accommodated to the ſtate of ſociety, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and government of the country, in which it is conducted.</p>
            <p>This remark leads me at once to add, that the education of young ladies, in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſhould be conducted upon principles very different from what it is in Great Britain, and in ſome reſpects different from what it was when we were part of a monarchical empire.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral circumſtances in the ſituation, employments, and duties of women, in America, which require a peculiar mode of education.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:020691_0005_0FB09CB384E806F8"/>I. The early marriages of our women, by contracting the time allowed for education, renders it neceſſary to contract its plan, and to confine it chiefly to the more uſeful branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of literature.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſtate of property, in America, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it neceſſary for the greateſt part of our citizens to employ themſelves, in different occupations, for the advancement of their fortunes. This cannot be done without the aſſiſtance of the female members of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. They muſt be the ſtewards, and guardians of their huſbands' property. That education, therefore, will be moſt proper for our women, which teaches them to diſcharge the duties of thoſe offices with the moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and reputation.</p>
            <p n="3">III. From the numerous avocations to which a profeſſional life expoſes gentlemen in America from their families, a principal ſhare of the inſtruction of children naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves upon the women. It becomes us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prepare them by a ſuitable education, for the diſcharge of this moſt important duty of mothers.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The equal ſhare that every citizen has in the liberty, and the poſſible ſhare he may have in the government of our country, make
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020691_0006_0FB09CB621ED1AB8"/>
it neceſſary that our ladies ſhould be qualified to a certain degree by a peculiar and ſuitable education, to concur in inſtructing their ſons in the principles of liberty and government.</p>
            <p n="5">V. In Great Britain the buſineſs of ſervants is a regular occupation; but in America this humble ſtation is the uſual retreat of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected indigence; hence the ſervants in this country poſſeſs leſs knowledge and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination than are required from them; and hence, our ladies are obliged to attend more to the private affairs of their families, than ladies generally do, of the ſame rank in Great Britain. "They are good ſervants (ſaid an American lady of diſtinguiſhed merit <note n="*" place="bottom">Mrs. GRAEME.</note> in a letter to a favorite daughter) who will do well with good looking after." This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ſhould have great influence upon the nature and extent of female education in America.</p>
            <p>The branches of literature moſt eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for a young lady in this country, appear to be,</p>
            <p n="1">I. A knowledge of the Engliſh language. She ſhould not only read, but ſpeak and ſpell it correctly. And to enable her to do this, ſhe ſhould be taught the Engliſh grammar, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020691_0007_0FB09CB75A2DA130"/>
be frequently examined in applying its rules in common converſation.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Pleaſure and intereſt conſpire to make the writing of a fair and legible hand, a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary branch of female education. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhe ſhould be taught not only to ſhape every letter properly, but to pay the ſtricteſt regard to points and capitals<note n="*" place="bottom">The <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> among perſons of taſte is to uſe a capital letter only for the firſt word of a ſentence, and for names of perſons, places and months, and for the firſt word of every line in poetry. The word ſhould be ſo ſhaped <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> a ſtraight line may be drawn between two lines. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the word in either of them</note>.</p>
            <p>I once heard of a man who profeſſed to diſcover the temper and diſpoſition of perſons by looking at their hand writing. Without enquiring into the probability of this ſtory; I ſhall only remark, that there is one thing in which all mankind agree upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and that is, in conſidering writing that is blotted, crooked, or illegible, as a mark of a vulgar education. I know of few things more rude or illiberal, than to obtrude a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon a perſon of rank or buſineſs, which cannot be eaſily read. Peculiar care ſhould be taken to avoid every kind of ambiguity and affectation in writing <hi>names.</hi> I have now a letter in my poſſeſſion upon buſineſs, from a gentleman of a liberal profeſſion in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſtate, which I am unable to anſwer,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020691_0008_0FB09D81A0F9AA68"/>
becauſe I cannot diſcover the name which is ſubſcribed to it. For obvious reaſons I would recommend the writing of the firſt or chriſtian name at full length, where it does not conſiſt of more than two ſyllables. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviations of all kinds in letter-writing, which always denote either haſte or careleſſneſs, ſhould likewiſe be avoided. I have only to add under this head, that the Italian and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted hands which are read with difficulty, are by no means accommodated to the active ſtate of buſineſs in America, or to the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the citizens of a republic.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Some knowledge of figures and book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping is abſolutely neceſſary to qualify a young lady for the duties which await her in this country. There are certain occupations in which ſhe may aſſiſt her huſband with this knowledge; and ſhould ſhe ſurvive him, and agreeably to the cuſtom of our country be the executrix of his will, ſhe cannot fail of deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving immenſe advantages from it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. An acquaintance with geography and ſome inſtruction in chronology will enable a young lady to read hiſtory, biography, and travels, with advantage; and thereby qualify her not only for a general intercourſe with the world, but, to be an agreeable companion for a ſenſible man. To theſe branches of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020691_0009_0FB09D876697DE18"/>
may be added, in ſome inſtances, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral acquaintance with the firſt principles of aſtronomy, and natural philoſophy, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with ſuch parts of them as are calculated to prevent ſuperſtition, by explaining the cauſes, or obviating the effects of natural evil.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Vocal muſic ſhould never be neglected, in the education of a young lady, in this country. Beſides preparing her to join in that part of public worſhip which conſiſts in pſalmody, it will enable her to ſoothe the cares of domeſtic life. The diſtreſs and vexation of a huſband—the noiſe of a nurſery, and, even, the ſorrows that will ſometimes intrude into her own boſom, may all be relieved by a ſong, where found and ſentiment unite to act upon the mind. I hope it will not be thought foreign to this part of our ſubject to introduce a fact here, which has been ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me by my profeſſion, and that is, that the exerciſe of the organs of the breaſt, by ſinging, contributes very much to defend them from thoſe diſeaſes to which our climate, and other cauſes, have of late expoſed them.— Our German fellow-citizens are ſeldom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with conſumptions, nor have I ever known but one inſtance of a ſpitting of blood among them. This, I believe, is in part oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the ſtrength which their lungs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, by exerciſing them frequently in vocal
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020691_0010_0FB09D887995AF18"/>
muſic, for this conſtitutes an eſſential branch of their education. The muſic-maſter of our academy<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. ADGATE.</note> has furniſhed me with an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſtill more in favor of this opinion. He informed me that, he had known ſeveral inſtances of perſons who were ſtrongly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the conſumption, who were reſtored to health, by the moderate exerciſe of their lungs in ſinging.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. DANCING is by no means an improper branch of education for an American lady. It promotes health, and renders the figure and motions of the body eaſy and agreeable. I anticipate the time when the reſources of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſhall be ſo far multiplied, that the amuſement of dancing ſhall be wholly confined to children. But in our preſent ſtate of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and knowledge, I conceive it to be an agreeable ſubſtitute for the ignoble pleaſures of drinking, and gaming, in our aſſemblies of grown people.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The attention of our young ladies ſhould be directed, as ſoon as they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, to the reading of hiſtory—tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels—poetry—and moral eſſays. Theſe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are accommodated, in a peculiar manner, to the preſent ſtate of ſociety in America, and when a reliſh is excited for them, in early life,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020691_0011_0FB09D8A2971E8B8"/>
they ſubdue that paſſion for reading novels, which ſo generally prevails among the fair ſex. I cannot diſmiſs this ſpecies of writing and reading without obſerving, that the ſubjects of novels are by no means accommodated to our preſent manners. They hold up <hi>life,</hi> it is true, but it is not as yet <hi>life,</hi> in America. Our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have not as yet "overſtepped the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of nature," nor are they "torn to tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters," to uſe the expreſſions of the poet, by extravagant love, jealouſy, ambition, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. As yet the intrigues of a Britiſh novel, are as foreign to our manners, as the refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Aſiatic vice. Let it not be ſaid, that the tales of diſtreſs, which fill modern no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, have a tendency to ſoften the female heart into acts of humanity. The fact is the reverſe of this. The abortive ſympathy which is excited by the recital of imaginary diſtreſs, blunts the heart to that which is real; and, hence, we ſometimes ſee inſtances of young ladies, who weep away a whole forenoon over the criminal ſorrows of a fictitious Charlotte or Werter, turning with diſdain at two o'clock from the ſight of a beggar, who ſolicits in fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accents or ſigns, a ſmall portion only, of the crumbs which fall from their fathers' tables.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. It will be neceſſary to connect all theſe branches of education with regular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the chriſtian religion. For this
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020691_0012_0FB09D8B6DED5300"/>
purpoſe the principles of the different ſects of chriſtians ſhould be taught and explained, and our pupils ſhould early be furniſhed with ſome of the moſt ſimple arguments in favour of the truth of chriſtianity<note n="*" place="margin">Baron Haller's letters to his daughter on the truths of the chriſtian religion, and Dr. Beatie's "evidences of the chriſtian religion briefly and plainly ſtated" are excellent little tracts, and well adapted for this purpoſe.</note>. A portion of the bible (of late improperly baniſhed from our ſchool) ſhould be read by them every day, and ſuch queſtions ſhould be aſked, after reading it, as are calculated to imprint upon their minds the intereſting ſtories contained in it.</p>
            <p>Rouſſeau has aſſerted that the great ſecret of education conſiſts in "waſting the time of children profitably." There is ſome truth in this obſervation. I believe that we often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair their health, and weaken their capacities, by impoſing ſtudies upon them, which are not proportioned to their years. But this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does not apply to religious inſtruction. There are certain ſimple propoſitions in the chriſtian religion, that are ſuited in a peculiar manner, to the infant ſtate of reaſon and moral ſenſibility. A clergyman of long experience in the inſtruction of youth<note n="†" place="margin">The Rev. Mr. NICHOLAS COLLIN, miniſter of the Swediſh church in Wicocoe.</note> informed me, that he always found children acquired religious knowledge more eaſily than knowledge upon
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020691_0013_0FB09D8CE3ADFCC8"/>
other ſubjects; and that young girls acquired this kind of knowledge more readily than boys. The female breaſt is the natural ſoil of chriſtianity; and while our women are taught to believe its doctrines, and obey its precepts, the wit of Voltaire, and the ſtile of Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke, will never be able to deſtroy its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon our citizens.</p>
            <p>I cannot help remarking in this place, that chriſtianity exerts the moſt friendly influence upon ſcience, as well as upon the morals and manners of mankind. Whether this be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the unity of truth, and the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual aſſiſtance which truths upon different ſubjects afford each other, or whether the faculties of the mind be ſharpened and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by embracing the truths of revelation, and thereby prepared to inveſtigate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive truths upon other ſubjects, I will not determine, but it is certain that the greateſt diſcoveries in ſcience have been made by chriſtian philoſophers, and that there is the moſt knowledge in thoſe countries where there is the moſt chriſtianity<note n="*" place="bottom">This is true in a peculiar manner in the ſcience of medicine. A young Scotch phyſician of enterprizing talents, who conceived a high idea of the ſtate of medicine in the eaſtern countries, ſpent two years in enquiries after medical knowledge in Conſtantinople, and Grand Cairo. On his return to Britain he confeſſed to an American phyſician whom he met at Naples, that after all his reſearches and travels, he "had diſcovered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing except a ſingle fact relative to the plague, that he thought worth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering or communicating." The ſcience of medicine in China according to the accounts of De Halde is in as imperfect a ſtate <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020691_0014_0FB09D8E996B00F8"/>
of things as they appear to the divine mind. If this remark be well founded, then thoſe philoſophers who reject chriſtianity, and thoſe chriſtians, whether parents or ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, who neglect the religious inſtruction of their children and pupils, <hi>reject</hi> and <hi>neglect</hi> the moſt effectual means of promoting know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in our country.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. If the meaſures that have been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for inſpiring our pupils with a ſenſe of religious and moral obligation be adopted, the government of them will be eaſy and agreeable. I ſhall only remark under this head, that <hi>ſtrictneſs</hi> of diſcipline will always render <hi>ſeverity</hi> unneceſſary, and that there will be the moſt inſtruction in that ſchool, where there is the moſt order.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid nothing in favour of inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal muſic as a branch of female education, becauſe I conceive it is by no means accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the preſent ſtate of ſociety and manners in America. The price of muſical inſtruments, and the extravagant fees demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the teachers of inſtrumental muſic, form but a ſmall part of my objections to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:020691_0015_0FB09D8FE422BF68"/>To perform well, upon a muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, requires much time and long practice. From two to four hours in a day, for three or four years, appropriated to muſic, are an immenſe deduction from that ſhort period of time which is allowed by the peculiar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of our country for the acquiſition of the uſeful branches of literature that have been mentioned. How many uſeful ideas might be picked up in theſe hours from hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, philoſophy, poetry, and the numerous moral eſſays with which our language abounds, and how much more would the knowledge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired upon theſe ſubjects add to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a lady, with her huſband and with ſociety, than the beſt performed pieces of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic upon a harpſichord or a guittar! Of the many ladies whom we have known, who have ſpent the moſt important years of their lives, in learning to play upon inſtruments of muſic, how few of them do we ſee amuſe themſelves or their friends with them, after they become miſtreſſes of families! Their harpſichords ſerve only as ſide-boards for their parlours, and prove by their ſilence, that neceſſity and circumſtances, will always prevail over faſhion, and falſe maxims of education.</p>
            <p>Let it not be ſuppoſed from theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that I am inſenſible of the charms of inſtrumental muſic, or that I wiſh to exclude
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020691_0016_0FB09D94B11B03B0"/>
it from the education of a lady where a muſical ear irreſiſtably diſpoſes to it, and affluence at the ſame time affords a proſpect of ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the uſual cares and duties of the miſtreſs of a family, as will enable her to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it. Theſe circumſtances form an excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the general conduct that ſhould ariſe upon this ſubject, from the preſent ſtate of ſociety and manners in America.</p>
            <p>I beg leave further to bear a teſtimony againſt the practice of making the French language a part of female education in America. In Britain where company and pleaſure are the principal buſineſs of ladies; where the nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the kitchen form no part of their care, and where a daily intercourſe is maintained with French-men and other foreigners who ſpeak the French language, a knowledge of it is abſolutely neceſſary. But the caſe is wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different in this country. Of the many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies who have applied to this language, how great a proportion of them have been hurried into the cares and duties of a family before they had acquired it; of thoſe who have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it, how few have retained it after they were married; and of the few who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, how ſeldom have they had occaſion to ſpeak it, in the courſe of their lives! It certainly comports more with female delicacy as well as the natural politeneſs of the French
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020691_0017_0FB09D96AE03B190"/>
nation, to make it neceſſary for French-men to learn to ſpeak our language in order to converſe with our ladies, than for our ladies to learn their language, in order to converſe with them.</p>
            <p>Let it not be ſaid in defence of a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the French language, that many ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant books are written in it. Thoſe of them that are truly valuable, are generally tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but, if this were not the caſe, the Engliſh language certainly contains many more books of real utility and uſeful information than can be read, without neglecting other duties, by the daughter, or wife of an American citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen.</p>
            <p>It is with reluctance that I object to draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as a branch of education for an American lady. To be the miſtreſs of a family is one of the great ends of a woman's being, and while the peculiar ſtate of ſociety in America impoſes this ſtation ſo early, and renders the duties of it ſo numerous and difficult, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that little time can be ſpared for the acquiſition of this elegant accompliſhment.</p>
            <p>It is agreeable to obſerve how differently modern writers, and the inſpired author of the proverbs, deſcribe a fine woman. The former confine their praiſes chiefly to perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020691_0018_0FB09D98B0DF8538"/>
charms, and ornamental accompliſhments, while the latter celebrates only the virtues of a valuable miſtreſs of a family, and a uſeful member of ſociety. The one is perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the faſhionable languages of Europe; the other, "opens her mouth with wiſdom" and is perfectly acquainted with all the uſes of the needle, the diſtaff, and the loom. The buſineſs of the one, is pleaſure; the pleaſure of the other, is buſineſs. The one is admired abroad; the other is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and beloved at home. "Her children ariſe up and call her bleſſed, her huſband al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and he praiſeth her." There is no fame in the world equal to this; nor is there a note in muſic half ſo delightful, as the reſpectful language with which a grateful ſon or daughter perpetuates the memory of a ſenſible and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate mother.</p>
            <p>It ſhould not ſurprize us that Britiſh cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, with reſpect to female education, have been tranſplanted into our American ſchools and families. We ſee marks of the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity, of time and place, in many other things. We behold our houſes accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the climate of Great Britain, by eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern and weſtern directions. We behold our ladies panting in a heat of ninety degrees, under a hat and cuſhion, which were calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the temperature of a Britiſh ſummer.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020691_0019_0FB09D99C0F861F0"/>
We behold our citizens condemned and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by a criminal law, which was copied from a country where maturity in corruption renders public executions a part of the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the nation. It is high time to awake from this ſervility—to ſtudy our own cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter—to examine the age of our country— and to adopt manners in every thing, that ſhall be accommodated to our ſtate of ſociety, and to the forms of our government. In par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular it is incumbent upon us to make orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental accompliſhments, yield to principles and knowledge, in the education of our wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>A philoſopher once ſaid "let me make all the ballads of a country and I care not who makes its laws." He might with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety have ſaid, let the ladies of a country be educated properly, and they will not only make and adminiſter its laws, but form its manners and character. It would require a lively imagination to deſcribe, or even to comprehend, the happineſs of a country, where knowledge and virtue, were generally diffuſed among the female ſex. Our young men would then be reſtrained from vice by the terror of being baniſhed from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. The loud laugh, and the malignant ſmile, at the expence of innocence, or of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal infirmities—the feats of ſucceſsful
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020691_0020_0FB09D9B2C4B08F8"/>
mimickry—and the low priced wit, which is borrowed from a miſapplication of ſcripture phraſes, would no more be conſidered as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations to the ſociety of the ladies. A double entendre, in their preſence, would then exclude a gentleman forever from the company of both ſexes, and probably oblige him to ſeek an aſylum from contempt, in a foreign country. The influence of female education would be ſtill more extenſive and uſeful in domeſtic life. The obligations of gentlemen to qualify themſelves by knowledge and induſtry to diſcharge the duties of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, would be encreaſed by marriage; and the patriot—the hero—and the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, would find the ſweeteſt reward of their toils, in the approbation and applauſe of their wives. Children would diſcover the marks of maternal prudence and wiſdom in every ſtation of life; for it has been remarked that there have been few great or good men who have not been bleſſed with wiſe and prudent mothers. Cyrus was taught to revere the gods, by his mother Mandane—Samuel was devoted to his prophetic office before he was born, by his mother Hannah—Conſtantine was reſcued from paganiſm by his mother Conſtantia—and Edward the ſixth inherited thoſe great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent qualities which made him the delight of the age in which he lived, from his mother, lady Jane Seymour. Many other inſtances might
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020691_0021_0FB09D9CAC887788"/>
be mentioned, if neceſſary, from ancient and modern hiſtory, to eſtabliſh the truth of this propoſition.</p>
            <p>I am not enthuſiaſtical upon the ſubject of education. In the ordinary courſe of human affairs, we ſhall probably too ſoon follow the footſteps of the nations of Europe in manners and vices. The firſt marks we ſhall perceive of our declenſion, will appear among our wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Their idleneſs, ignorance and profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy will be the harbingers of our ruin. Then will the character and performance of a buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foon on the theatre, be the ſubject of more converſation and praiſe, than the patriot or the miniſter of the goſpel;—then will our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and pronunciation be enfeebled and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by a flood of French and Italian words; —then will the hiſtory of romantic amours, be preferred to the immortal writings of Addiſon, Hawkeſworth and Johnſon;—then will our churches be neglected, and the name of the ſupreme being never be called upon, but in profane exclamations;—then will our Sundays be appropriated, only to feaſts and concerts; —and then will begin all that train of domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and political calamities—But, I forbear. The proſpect is ſo painful, that I cannot help, ſilently, imploring the great arbiter of human affairs, to interpoſe his almighty goodneſs, and to deliver us from theſe evils, that, at leaſt one
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020691_0022_0FB09D9F793825C8"/>
ſpot of the earth may be reſerved as a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the effects of good education, in order to ſhew in ſome degree, what our ſpecies was, before the fall, and what it ſhall be, after its reſtoration.———————</p>
            <p>Thus, gentlemen, have I briefly finiſhed what I propoſed. If I am wrong in thoſe opinions in which I have taken the liberty of departing from general and faſhionable habits of thinking, I am ſure you will diſcover, and pardon my miſtakes. But, if I am right, I am equally ſure you will adopt my opinions; for to enlightened minds truth is alike acceptable, whether it comes from the lips of age, or the hand of antiquity, or whether it be obtruded by a perſon, who has no other claim to atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than a deſire of adding to the ſtock of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man happineſs.</p>
            <p>I cannot diſmiſs the ſubject of female edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation without remarking, that the city of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia firſt ſaw a number of gentlemen aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated for the purpoſe of directing the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of young ladies. By means of this plan, the power of teachers is regulated and reſtrained, and the objects of education are extended. By the ſeparation of the ſexes in the unformed ſtate of their manners, female delicacy is cheriſhed and preſerved. Here the young ladies may enjoy all the literary advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:020691_0023_0FB09DA11745EA90"/>
of a boarding-ſchool, and at the ſame time live under the protection of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>Unnatural confinement makes a young woman embrace with avidity every pleaſure when ſhe is ſet free. To reliſh domeſtic life, one muſt be acquainted with it; for it is in the houſe of her parents a young woman acquires the reliſh.</q> Lord Kaims's thoughts upon education, and the culture of the heart.</note>. Here emulation may be excited with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out jealouſy,—ambition without envy,—and competition without ſtrife. The attempt to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh this new mode of education for young ladies, was an experiment, and the ſucceſs of it hath anſwered our expectations<note n="†" place="bottom">The number of ſcholars in the academy at preſent, amounts to upwards of one hundred.</note>. Too much praiſe cannot be given to our principal and his aſſiſtants, for the abilities and fidelity with which they have carried the plan into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. The proficiency which the young ladies have diſcovered in reading—writing— ſpelling—arithmetic—grammar—geography —muſic—and their different catechiſms, ſince the laſt examination, is a leſs equivocal mark of the merit of our teachers, than any thing I am able to expreſs in their favour.</p>
            <p>But the reputation of the academy muſt be ſuſpended, till the public are convinced, by the future conduct and character of our pupils, of the advantages of the inſtitution. To you, therefore,
YOUNG LADIES,
an important problem is committed for ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020691_0024_0FB09DA487285238"/>
and that is, whether our preſent plan of education be a wiſe one, and whether it be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to prepare you for the duties of ſocial and domeſtic life. I know that the elevation of the female mind, by means of moral, phyſical and religious truth, is conſidered by ſome men as unfriendly to the domeſtic character of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But this is the prejudice of little minds, and ſprings from the ſame ſpirit which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the general diffuſion of knowledge among the citizens of our republics. If men believe that ignorance is favourable to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the female ſex, they are certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for a weak and ignorant woman will always be governed with the greateſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I have ſometimes been led to aſcribe the invention of ridiculous and expenſive faſhions in female dreſs, entirely to the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen<note n="*" place="bottom">The very expenſive prints of female dreſſes which are publiſhed annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in France, are invented and executed wholly by GENTLEMEN.</note>, in order to divert the ladies from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their minds, and thereby to ſecure a more arbitrary and unlimited authority over them. It will be in your power, LADIES, to correct the miſtakes and practice of our ſex up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe ſubjects, by demonſtrating, that the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male temper can only be governed by reaſon, and that the cultivation of reaſon in women, is alike friendly to the order of nature, and to private as well as public happineſs.</p>
