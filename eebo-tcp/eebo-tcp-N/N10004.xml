            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>II KINGS II. 12. —<hi>My Father, my Father, the Chariot of Iſrael and the Horſemen thereof.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THIS was the cry of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> when <hi>Elijah</hi> was taken from him. Though he muſt have the greateſt aſſurance poſſible of his going to a ſtate of reſt and peace; yet he felt the greateſt concern for himſelf and his people, under the ſenſe of ſo great a loſs; and therefore under this deep ſenſe and concern, he cries out as in our text, <hi>My father, my father,</hi> &amp;c. as if it were poſſible to call him back to them again, that the nation might have and enjoy the great benefit of ſuch an eminent man ſtill longer. We have the like expreſſion of the king of Iſrael to this ſame prophet, who uttered theſe words of our text, when he came to ſee him in his laſt ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This king, though he was a wicked man, yet it ſeems he had ſo much ſenſe and knowledge of the great ſafeguard ſo good a man was to his people; as to make him cry with this affecting cry, of words like our text; expreſſive of a deep ſenſe of ſuſtaining, or being about to ſuſtain, a loſs ſo great as even all the military force and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the people. The calling any one father is a moſt engaging appellation: becauſe a father is one on whom the child depends for help, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012713_0004_0F8B8D848241F120"/>and defence. And the natural diſpoſition in a father to grant help to a child, or attend to his cry, makes it the more important.</p>
            <p>Again, what makes the text more important is the doubling the call, <hi>My father, my father;</hi> which implies earneſtneſs, as though every breath was engaged. <hi>The chariot of Iſrael and the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men thereof,</hi> are put in appoſition with <hi>father:</hi> and the words no doubt are deſigned to carry this ſenſe or idea; as if he had ſaid, My father thou art the chariot of Iſrael: Thou art our ſafeguard. Or as if he he had ſaid, By loſing thee, we loſe all the defenſive force of the Nation. For again he ſays, <hi>My father, the horſemen of Iſrael.</hi> As if he had ſaid, If you leave us we ſhall be left na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of chariots and horſemen; or as defenceleſs as a people that have none; and oh how ſad will our caſe be, when it is come to this, and we have ſo many enemies ſurrounding us, and ſeeking our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. O father, what ſhall we then do? O if you might but be continued with us! But now we are left defenceleſs.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s calling <hi>Elijah</hi> father, we are not to underſtand that he was his natural father, or indeed of any near kindred: but it is obſervably very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in ſcripture, for thoſe in public ſtations, to be addreſſed or ſpoken of in that manner; eſpecially thoſe that well filled their places for the good of the people. As a father at the head of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily takes care of, guides, inſtructs and provides for his family; ſo a good king or ruler, or prieſt, or prophet, very juſtly bears the title of a father to the people they ſtand in public relation to. Thus in our text: Thus in what the king of Iſrael ſaid to <hi>Eliſha</hi> when on his death-bed; and alſo when he aſked him if he ſhould ſmite the Syrians,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012713_0005_0F8B8D8542677E68"/>2 Kings 6.21. So <hi>Joſeph</hi> is ſaid to be made a father to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> So alſo, Father is uſed for thoſe of the ſame ſtation or profeſſion, who are advanced in years, as in our text. And hence the young prophets are called the ſons of the prophets. In all theſe ſenſes the word father is uſed in our text, as to age, ſtation, and well filling a public place or character. And in all theſe we may uſe it in the caſe before us.</p>
            <p>In treating upon this ſubject, we may attend to the following things, for illuſtration and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>We may obſerve from the words, that the godly, eſpecially when in a public ſtation, are a great advantage and defence, as fathers to the people where they are.</hi>  
               <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap>  Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>When ſuch are taken away, it is juſt matter of very deep ſorrow and lamentation to the people where they have lived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then we are to attend to the illuſtration of the obſervation, <hi>That the godly, eſpecially when in a public ſtation, are a great advantage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as fathers to the people where they are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our text, as well as the other text hinted, ſets them forth to be not only as fathers, but as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as really as chariots and horſemen: yea, that but one eminently good man for ſafeguard, might be accounted to be as all the martial force of the nation. We accordingly find that God ſet forth his reſpect to good men in this light. Thus he ſpared the old world for a ſeaſon, for the ſake of ſome few good men; of whom we may reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Methuſelah</hi> as well as <hi>Noah.</hi> The flood was ſtayed, and nothing could be done, till one was in his grave, and the other in the ark. That ſelf ſame day that <hi>Noah</hi> entered into the ark, the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012713_0006_0F8B8D876D7F2BC8"/>fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. As ſoon as all good men were out of the way; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction did not wait upon the people one day. In like manner we find, when <hi>Sodom</hi> was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the angel ſaid he could do nothing, till <hi>Lot</hi> was out of the way: but, as ſoon as he was gone, not a moment delay before the dreadful ſtorm of God's wrath was poured down upon them.</p>
            <p>To the ſame purpoſe we find through the whole of God's dealings with the children of Iſrael. While they ſerved the Lord and walked in his ways, things went well with them. Thus in the days of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the elders that out lived him, there was no one able to ſtand before them. But, as ſoon as all theſe good men were dead, they did evil in the ſight of the Lord, and he ſold them into the hand of ſpoilers that ſpoiled them. Judges II. 14. So, through the whole ſtate of the Iſraelites, when they had a good king it went well with them. Thus in the days of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> God ſpared them from the deſtruction he had threatned them for the ſins of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> till after the death of <hi>Joſiah.</hi> But, as ſoon as he was gone, breaches were made upon them one after another, till they were deſtroyed, and as it is expreſſed caſt out of his ſight. The world indeed ſtands for the ſake of the elect. So it is expreſſed in the Revelation, thoſe angels, that were appointed to deſtroy, were not permitted to hurt, till the elect were made ſafe.</p>
            <p>God knows how to ſave them, that are his own, however the world may be involved in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet will withhold the letting forth his wrath and fury upon the ungodly, ſo long as it is for the good and ſafety of his choſen; ſo that they are a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012713_0007_0F8B8D8794A00F50"/>ſpecial ſafeguard and defence to all about them, that have any ſpecial connection with them.— Thus it may with the ſtricteſt truth be affirmed, that the pious and godly are not only as fathers; but a great and ſpecial defence to the people where they dwell.</p>
            <p>We may now attend to ſome particulars ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein they are ſuch a ſafety and defence to their people.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are a ſafeguard to the people where they dwell by their good examples and perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which have a great and conſtraining force with them to keep in awe the vicious, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their out breakings of ſin. Indeed many times vice gets ſo much the aſcendence, that little regard or reverence is paid to the examples of the pious and godly, or even to their advice and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions. But when this is the caſe, it is a ſign and evidence, that deſtruction is at the door. When the godly have loſt all their influence upon thoſe about them, 'tis a ſign and evidence that their work is juſt done; and, when that is done, they will be taken to God himſelf, and deſtruction will ſpeedily come upon thoſe about them. Thus was the caſe of <hi>Lot;</hi> we find, juſt before the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Sodom,</hi> he had loſt all his influence, and all he could ſay to them, met with no better than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. When he eſſayed to diſwade them from that dreadful wickedneſs they were for doing to the angels, they ſay, This one fellow came in to ſojourn, and he will needs be a judge; and go on to threaten and preſs upon him to abuſe him; yea and when he went as a father to his ſons in law, to forewarn them of their danger, they treated him with the utmoſt neglect; all which was the moſt immediate forerunner of that awful deſtruction.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012713_0008_0F8B8D88D2DE3340"/>The ſame alſo appears from what we read of the old man and the Levite, Judg. 19.22 and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The moſt gentle perſwaſives and entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had no effect upon thoſe that beſet the houſe, which appears to be the cauſe of dreadful deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to the tribe they belonged to. Thus we may ſee, that when the godly have loſt their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and neither their examples nor perſuaſions will avail, it is a leading to deſtruction, from which we may ſee, how or wherein they are a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by their good examples.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are not only a ſafeguard and defence by their examples and perſwaſions, but by their advice, exhortations and counſels, to reclaim the ungodly, and to keep them from running to ſo great lengths in their Sin. And not only ſo, but by their counſel and direction, how to conduct, they are a great advantage and defence; for God guideth the juſt; he ordereth their goings aright; he keepeth them in their way, ſo that their feet do not ſtumble; and, when a people have ſuch among them, and will adhere to their advice, it makes their way ſafe. Such pious godly men, who have their dependance upon God, he will never leave nor forſake. Thus, while <hi>Jehoiada</hi> lived, and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſh</hi> followed his advice, he reigned well, and things proſpered among them: but, after the death of <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> the king forſook the Lord, and it was but a little while before things began to decline, and in about the courſe of a year the hoſt of <hi>Syria</hi> came againſt him, and deſtroyed all the princes of the people: For the army of the <hi>Syrians</hi> came with a ſmall company of men, and the Lord delivered into their hand a very great hoſt, becauſe they had forſaken the Lord God of their fathers; ſo they executed judgment againſt <hi>Joaſh;</hi> ſee 2 Chron.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012713_0009_0F8B8D8955BF0440"/>24.23, &amp;c. There we ſee, how that the good inſtruction and counſel of <hi>Jeboiada</hi> was an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and defence, and that as a father he guided and guarded the people, while he continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Thus alſo we may reckon under this particular, that the godly are as fathers and a ſafeguard to their people by their prudence and wiſdom, in adviſing and ordering affairs; for to ſuch God giveth diſcretion. So a prudent woman once ſaved a city by her wiſdom. When God deſigns good for a people, he raiſes up ſome with wiſdom and prudence to lead and to guide them: but when a people are become ſo bad, that God determines evil for them, then he hides counſel from the wiſe, and underſtanding from the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; or takes away the prudent from among them. It is not a <hi>meer political ſagacity,</hi> that can guard and defend a people: but it muſt be a <hi>pious godly prudence,</hi> which is founded in a dependance, ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering; ſo that here we may ſee how that the godly are a ſafeguard to the people where they are.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are as fathers and a ſpecial ſafeguard and defence to the people where they are, by their fervent prayers and frequent ſupplications to God for their people. The effectual fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much; accordingly we find that the earneſt and fervent prayers of <hi>Moſes</hi> were from time to time attended with the ſalvation of the children of Iſrael from immediate deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. How often God threatned to deſtroy them in a moment, and, <hi>Moſes</hi> interpoſing with his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt prayers and ſupplications, God turned from the fierceneſs of his anger, and would not deſtroy them. The ſame may be obſerved of the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012713_0010_0F8B8D8B811FB070"/>prayer of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> againſt the Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an army, and of <hi>Samuel</hi> againſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> in both which they did more than all the chariots and horſemen of Iſrael could do: and many other inſtances to the ſame purpoſe may be found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in ſacred writ; all which ſhews the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard the godly are by their prayers, more than all the chariots of Iſrael and the horſemen thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The godly are a ſafeguard to their people by their truſting in God. When a perſon truſts in God, nothing can hurt him; for <hi>The name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower; the righteous runneth into it and is ſafe,</hi> Prov. 18.10. To the ſame purpoſe alſo we read that <hi>The horſe is prepared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of battle: but ſafety is of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 21.31. The greateſt and moſt terrible armies in array are of no avail, unleſs the Lord go forth with them. The prayers of a few godly men, who put their truſt in the Lord, can blaſt and deſtroy the greateſt armies, as appears in the caſe of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> above hinted, and many other places that might be mentioned. There is no ſafety, where there is no truſt in God, and no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger where there is a gracious truſt in him; for ſuch were never confounded or put to ſhame. So that herein they are a ſpecial ſafeguard and defence, ſo long as people will hearken to them. But, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved, when they have loſt their influence, and their work is thus come to a cloſe, God ſoon takes away, removes them to ſome other place upon this earth, or takes them home to himſelf in his heavenly kingdom.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Once more—The truly pious are an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and defence, as fathers where they are, by their being public ſpirited; for there are none more public ſpirited than ſuch; for they have a
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012713_0011_0F8B8D8C0554F5B0"/>real and ſincere love, tenderneſs, and benevolence toward all mankind: as fathers they delight to do good unto others; for they are the children of their father in heaven, who cauſes his ſun to riſe, and his rain to deſcend on the juſt and on the unjuſt, on the evil and the good: and thus they practice that, which has the ſtrongeſt force to aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate and unite all together, and ſo to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the whole body; which alone is that ſafeguard that can keep every body from deſtruction, and without which, as our Saviour ſays, houſes and kingdoms cannot ſtand.</p>
            <p>Thus we have conſidered ſome particulars, ſhewing, wherein the godly are a ſafeguard and defence as fathers to their people. We now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to our ſecond general head propoſed, viz.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider that, <hi>when ſuch are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it is juſt matter of very deep ſorrow and lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entation to the people where they have lived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although it is <hi>much better</hi> for ſuch godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be gone, and to be with Chriſt, than to be here in the body; yea great <hi>gain,</hi> becauſe of the many troubles they have to meet with in this world. Though it is better for themſelves to be gone; yet, for thoſe where they have lived, it would be better, if they might be continued among them. To this effect the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, Philip. 1.23, 24. The godly are ſo great a protection to the people where they are, as we have above con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that it is a very great loſs for them to be taken away. In the illuſtration of this head, we may firſt take notice of ſome inſtances of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recorded in ſcripture when the pious and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were taken away.</p>
            <p>In general it is remarked in ſcripture, that when any man of public note was taken away, if it was
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012713_0012_0F8B8D8E1DDBC898"/>a pious and godly man, there was great mourning for him; but if it was a wicked man, there was little or no mourning for him. Thus when good old <hi>Jacob</hi> died, there was great mourning and lamentation for him; even the Egyptians were ſo ſenſible what a great loſs it was, that they mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a very grievous cry. So alſo when <hi>Moſes</hi> was taken away, all Iſrael mourned for him. He had long been their guide, their mediator; led, guided, guarded, fed, inſtructed them as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had been their law-giver; a man of ſo great uſefulneſs, that they had indeed very great reaſon to lament the loſs of him. So alſo we find, through the account of the kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when a good king was taken away, there was ſpecial men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people's mourning for him. Many inſtances of this kind are to be found in ſacred writ: But we ſhall proceed to obſerve ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſhewing, why it is ſuch juſt matter of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when the godly are taken away.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the people are ſtripped of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, their force, their guard; the chariots and horſemen of the people are gone; they are as a town invironed with enemies, and all their martial force removed, left naked to the inroads of their enemies, and nothing to look for, but that they ſhall ſoon be cut off, and made a deſolation, unleſs God raiſes up ſome to ſucceed, who ſhall fill up their place. But when God takes away the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the earth, the Inhabitants thereof have great reaſon to look upon it as a teſtimony that God is angry with them: which is moſt juſt cauſe of mourning, that we have thus provoked him to anger, and to threaten to deſtroy us; and it is a loud call to a people to proſtrate themſelves in deep mourning for their ſins; yea, with deep ſorrow
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012713_0013_0F8B8D8E43622A48"/>and repentance with unfeigned grief; that we have provoked him to ſtrip us of ſuch pillars of our welfare.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is juſt cauſe of mourning, becauſe we are now deprived of their good examples. Albeit we may and ought to bear their examples in our minds, ſo that, after they are dead, they may yet ſo far ſpeak to us in their good deeds, and be ſtill an advantage to us after they are gone from us. And thus we ſhould, at their departure, bear in our minds a deep ſenſe of their importance, that we may the longer retain the advantage of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and the bleſſedneſs of their memory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another thing contained in the loſs a people ſuſtain at the departure of a godly man, and makes it juſt cauſe of mourning, is the loſs of their fervent prayers. Such bear upon their hearts before God all, that they ſtand nearly related to; like <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Job. Moſes</hi> when any thing threatned his people, was importunate with God, till it was averted. <hi>Job</hi> ceaſed not every day to offer ſacrifices for his children. Such as are pious good men wreſtle with God for all about them. And, while God keeps up ſuch pillars among his people, ſtirring up his ſervants to ſuch fervent prayers, he will anſwer them; for he does <hi>not ſay to the ſeed of</hi> JACOB, <hi>ſeek ye me in vain.</hi> But when he takes away ſuch from among a people, it is to be feared he is about to withdraw his favor from that people, and what can be a greater cauſe of mourning and lamentation? for then <hi>Ichabod</hi> is written upon all their concerns, the glory is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, church and ſtate are in danger. This ſurely is cauſe of mourning when ſo many earneſt prayers are ceaſed from among a people. What a great gap! What a great loſs! How much it
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012713_0014_0F8B8D8F08295EE8"/>calls for weeping, lamentation, and mourning!</p>
            <p>Once more.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the godly are taken away from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a people, it is juſt cauſe of mourning to them, that now they have loſt the comfort and benefit of their ſociety. Man was made for ſociety, and it is juſt cauſe of mourning, when a ſocial companion is taken away; and eſpecially, when it is one, whoſe company or ſociety tended to make us wiſe; as the ſcriptures ſay, he that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the wiſe, ſhall be wiſe. But when a wiſe companion is taken from us, this is juſt matter of mourning, and will indeed be ſo to us, if we have any reliſh for that wiſdom and piety, which grace the lives of the godly; mourning and grief, that we can no more enjoy that fellowſhip with them here upon earth. Thus we have conſidered ſome things, ſhewing the loſs of the godly is ſuch great cauſe of mourning. We may now attend to ſome</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>And now, beloved, may we not with great propriety apply and make improvement of this ſubject in the caſe before us? Have we not loſt a pious godly <hi>Father,</hi> a father in age, a father in his being in a public ſtation, a father in his good examples, a father in giving good advice and exhortations, a father in his fervent prayers, a father in his prudence and wiſdom, a father in his tender concern for us, a father in his public ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritedneſs, a father to his church and people, a father to the poor, a father to his younger bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the miniſtry? And thus loſt, a very great inſtrumental ſafety, defence, and protection; yea what <hi>Eliſha</hi> in our text does not ſcruple ſpeak
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012713_0015_0F8B8D91312CA750"/>of as the whole martial defence of the people; for although <hi>Elijah</hi> ſtood only in a religious pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick relation to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet his life was of that importance to their ſafety and defence. <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Abner</hi> was killed, very greatly mourneck, when it was only a chief military man, and one, that had but newly turned to his ſide; and he reckons over his being weak and defenceleſs, and the greatneſs of the man loſt, as the cauſe and matter of his great mourning: and if that was ſuch juſt matter of mourning, grief and lamentation; how much more when a father, and all the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive force of the people is removed? Beloved, I claim ſhare in conſidering him as a father, being myſelf a younger brother in the ſtation he ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and which has led my mind to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and applying the words of our text for your contemplation at this time.</p>
               <p>And here, as we conſidered, that the godly were a ſafeguard by their good examples, ſo it may be to our purpoſe, to take a ſhort view of the character of our kind and honoured father, who is taken away from us; praying, that, by thus viewing him, when he is taken from us, a double portion of his ſpirit may reſt upon us, as it was promiſed <hi>Eliſha,</hi> it ſhould be unto him, if he ſaw <hi>Elijah</hi> taken from him. And eſpecially, as he was in a public relation, and as a father both in age and ſtation, we may with propriety look into his character, and hold it up for our imitation, as well as for our mourning on account of the loſs of him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſhall take notice of one thing ſpecially, that did not belong to his character, viz. <hi>Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or affecting to make a great ſhew in the world, of ſcholarſhip, or of importance, in polemick points or diſputes. He was very far from ſhewing
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012713_0016_0F8B8D9156570650"/>himſelf forward in any controverſies; though he was by thoſe, who were intimately acquainted with him, accounted an accurate ſcholar; and all he undertook, to effect it with great care and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: not aſpiring after that more public ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, or an affectatious oſtentation: or as a blazing ſtar, that makes a great ſhew, and is ſo excentric in its orbit, that it is moſtly upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes; either very near the ſun, or at an indeffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſtance from it; ſometimes paſſing toward the ſun with vehement ſwiftneſs, and then again receding with as great vehemency, in directly the reverſe courſe from that, in which it but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſſed toward the ſun. This very curiouſly points forth to us, the caſe of thoſe that make a great blaze in the world; and how they go the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe one time of what they went but a little before. Not ſuch an one was our <hi>Father</hi> taken from us. But he was a regular ſtar, moving in the orb, in which God had placed him, with uniform luſtre. Nor was he one of the dulleſt or obſcureſt ſtars, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting light from the great <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs.</hi> But it was of ſuch brightneſs, that it ſhone with conſpicuous light through the thick clouds that have for ſome years paſt obumbrated our nation and land.</p>
               <p>The light which he eminently reflected from JESUS CHRIST the SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, may be reckoned in a few particulars. 1. Pure and unfeigned love. The benevolence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of a father, the kindneſs of a brother, the faithfulneſs of a friend, eminently appeared in him. His paternal compaſſion, no doubt every one of you can witneſs to, and eſpecially the poor, which you have always with you; who have, I ſuppoſe,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012713_0017_0F8B8D922EDDB610"/>been many times fed, warmed, and relieved by his charitable bounty. His brotherly kindneſs has been abundantly felt by his brethren in the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as I myſelf am witneſs; as well as alſo his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity as a friend.</p>
               <p>In his moſt public exerciſes or performances at ordination ſolemnities, where it very frequently fell to his ſhare to give the <hi>right hand of fellowſhip;</hi> a part which afforded him very ample occaſion for expreſſing this noble affection; he was not wanting in ſhewing a moſt eminent degree of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love and cordial affection toward his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the miniſtry, and the churches of God. I believe all, who have had the opportunity of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon ſuch occaſions, can witneſs, how great he was in ſhewing this Chriſt-like affection. No leſs conſpicuous did his light ſhine in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable affection, wherever he was called to have any concern in diviſions and difficulties in chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, wherein he always appeared to have a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar regard for the truth; as well as love and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for thoſe that were borne upon. And in ſuch affairs he did not put on two faces, and ſide with them that were next him; but ſteadily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to the truth and honeſty of the cauſe, and always ſhewed a very compaſſionate concern for the good, peace and comfort of the church of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But you have had abundant opportunity to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, in his public diſcourſes, what an uncommon degree of ſincere love and tender affection appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus it appeared to me in what little oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity I have had of attending on his public diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations; and I cannot doubt, but it has much more appeared to you, who have for ſo many years
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012713_0018_0F8B8D92C1D3D988"/>been favoured with diſtillings of divine dew, and gentle rain, from his pleaſant voice. No leſs ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and conſpicuous, did this divine virtue of pure love and ſincere friendſhip, appear in his more private affairs of life: He ſhewed a moſt friendly concern for the good, comfort and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of all, wherever he came; even if he was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a wayfaring man, he was not wanting in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very ſingular concern for their welfare: ſo ſingular was he for this, that it might I ſuppoſe be ſaid of him in this, as God ſaid of <hi>Job,</hi> that there was none like him in all the earth, at leaſt none that we know of. Thus he reflected from the divine ſun an uncommon beam of ſingular love; which qualification is the fulfilling of the law: by which he appeared, abundantly endued with that ſingular diſpoſition, of doing as he would be done by; which our Saviour ſays is the law and the prophets.  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>  Hence,</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may remark another very eminent beam of light he reflected from the <hi>Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> was his <hi>Honeſty,</hi> in which as to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affairs, he had, I ſuppoſe, the good report of all men; but his <hi>honeſty</hi> in public character was moſt important and moſt conſpicuous; and in this he ſhone with ſingular luſtre. He was moſt friendly in his temper and diſpoſition, kind and courteous: but yet he had no friend ſo near and dear to him as <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>honeſty:</hi> he would aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don any friend, ſooner than his conſcience, or in he leaſt deviate from truth and honeſty, to which he was ſo cloſely attached, and for which he had ſo great a veneration; that not even the clofeſt friendſhip, could bribe him to turn aſide from the truth; ſuch light did he reflect from the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs,</hi> that he was a ſtar of rare magnitude in this noble qualification.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:012713_0019_0F8B8D938247E0A8"/>
3. To ſum up in a word; the light which he reflected from Chriſt the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs,</hi> he imitated his glorious Maſter in love, in patience, in doing good, and ſeeking the good both of the ſouls and bodies of men; giving up much of his worldly intereſt in his life-time; that by all means he might win ſome; and at his death, viz. in his laſt will and teſtament, having no heirs of his body, he made you the church of Chriſt his heir, in ſuch a manner, as that you ſhall, from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to generation forever, feel the effects of his propitious bounty; ſo that although after he had ſerved his generation by the will of God, he fell aſleep; yet he has made proviſion, whereby you his dear people may forever be fed, by the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of the ſanctuary, from the fruits of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Thus his life and his death were devoted to the good, the ſervice, the well being of the church of Chriſt. Thus he lived Chriſt, as he held forth in his laſt publick labours; and we are in charity bound to believe he is now reaping that <hi>gain,</hi> which in the ſame ſubject, he held forth there was to ſuch in <hi>death;</hi> and eſpecially alſo, as thoſe words appeared to be his ſupport, and the refreſhment of his ſoul, in his laſt hours under the apprehenſions of the near approach of death.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What deſerves to be here reckoned a reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Chriſt the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs,</hi> and what belongs to the character we are conſidering, view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as a <hi>father:</hi> He was a great lover of <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> as a kind benevolent <hi>father:</hi> though in a publick ſtation; yet he would have all as children free, not as ſlaves; all tyranny, either in church or ſtate, was an abomination unto him. He was for that true <hi>liberty;</hi> which is, <hi>liberty</hi> without licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012713_0020_0F8B8D944AB0F428"/>that <hi>liberty</hi> to which we are called, which is a <hi>liberty</hi> to do good, not to do hurt; not <hi>liberty</hi> for a cloak of maliciouſneſs; but <hi>in love to ſerve one another,</hi> as it is expreſſed Gal. 5.13. He did not appear to have any inclination to have any <hi>liberty</hi> to himſelf, but what he was ſincerely willing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould enjoy the ſame in common with him. So generous a ſoul had he, that it was not enough for him to enjoy freedom alone; but he appeared to have a ſpecial happineſs and ſatisfaction in others enjoying the ſame he did himſelf. The freedom and order of our civil and religious conſtitution, was very greatly at heart with him.</p>
               <p>To ſay in a word, and to conclude the character of our departed friend; he was one, that many of the beatitudes may with ſtrictneſs and propriety be predicated of, Meek, merciful, a peace-maker, of whom it is declared, by him that has the diſpoſal of all things, that ſuch ſhall <hi>inherit the earth, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy,</hi> and be called the children of God. Thus we have attended to ſome imperfect hints of the character of him who was dear to us: and therein have viewed our father when he is taken away from us; we ſhould be careful that we ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly behold him in his examples, wherein he followed Chriſt, that ſo we may obtain a double portion of his ſpirit. We may now attend to ſome particular addreſs to the mourners. And firſt to her, who has received the deepeſt wound by this fore ſtroke of divine providence, the ſorrowful widow. We heartily condole you, when we enter that houſe, where we uſed to find our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, our friend, our dear brother and companion: what heavineſs and grief does it work in us that there we ſee him no more! And how much more
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012713_0021_0F8B8D9501914A78"/>this muſt conſtantly attend you, we can faintly imagin, though not fully conceive! We know he was moſt near to you; when he ſuſtained, not only all the relations to you ward, that he did to us: but that moſt near relation of a kind huſband; the deſire of your eyes, the companion and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of all your joys; as well as ſuſtained your griefs and burdens. But now you are left alone to bear a manifold burden of grief; and we would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly take a part of your grief, and bear it for you. But this we grieve, that it is out of our power: caſt thy burdens upon the Lord and he ſhall ſuſtain them: you muſt ſeek to God for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and conſolation, and put your truſt in him, who is the God and huſband of the widow, and ſeek for all your conſolation there; and may God grant you all comfort and happineſs, that is moſt proper for you while here; and bring you at laſt to the full fruition of himſelf, in the world to come.</p>
               <p>I muſt now addreſs myſelf to the beloved church and congregation of this place.—You, beloved, I truſt are more ſenſible what a great loſs you have ſuſtained, than I can deſcribe to you in words. As a faithful and prudent paſtor, he was moſt near to you; as a kind father and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſembled friend, I claim a ſhare with you: here ſhould be our comfort, that when father, and even were it a mother too forſake us, the Lord will take us up, if we truſt in him. Pſal. 27.10. This ſhould be our hope, that although our <hi>father,</hi> and the chariots and horſmen of Iſrael, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from us; yet God is a father to them that put their truſt in him; and he is the Lord of hoſts; he is the ſhepherd of his people; and if he brings
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012713_0022_0F8B8D9655F85FD8"/>us nearer to him, and a more filial dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, then it will do us good; and as our dear friend we hope is a gainer by death, ſo we ſhall be gainers by it too. But we feel ſuch a loſs, that tho' for him to depart and be with Chriſt is better for him; yet for us (it ſeems) it would have been much better, if he might have abode with us. And therefore we can't but cry out with <hi>Eliſha</hi> in our text, <hi>My father, my father, the chariot of Iſrael and the horſemen thereof.</hi> What a great loſs is here; to loſe ſuch a ſtind father, and the defenſive force of the people!</p>
               <p>Beloved, let us take up the mantle of his faith and good examples which he has left us; and ſo wear it, as that we may appear to be in very deed his ſons in all things, wherein he followed Jeſus Chriſt, and as a noble ſtar reflected light from the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs;</hi> and carry it with us to the <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> of death, to ſmite the waters thereof, hither, and thither, that we may paſs over without any harm or fear of evil.</p>
               <p>And my earneſt prayer is, that you may find an <hi>Eliſha</hi> to ſucceed, that ſhall behold your aſcended father <hi>Elijah;</hi> and wearing his mantle of paternal bounty, as well as of faith and good examples, may lead you by the hand, and ever maintain in you a filial affection toward him, whoſe memory deſerves forever to be precious with you even from generation to generation.</p>
               <p>And, that you may be led and conducted to ſuch an one, accept a few hints of advice from one, who ſincerely wiſhes your welfare, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly prays, that in due time you may have one, that ſhall fill up the place of your dear deceaſed paſtor.</p>
               <p>

You are ſenſible, that you muſt look and ſeek to Him, from whom comes down every good and perfect gift; Him who received gifts, and who has ſet in his church ſuch great and important gifts and members. Have your eyes and hearts ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to him, who alone can give paſtors after his own heart. And, in your choice or election, ſeek not a blazing ſtar, who makes a great ſhew, and is ſoon out of ſight, by towering in ſome high flights of learning or diſputes, which may prove no more edification to you, than if he ſpake in an unknown tongue; and moſt likely if you keep ſight of him, will ſoon diſcern him directly in a contrary courſe, from what he but a little before went.</p>
               <p>Neither ſet your hearts on one already in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, which may ſoon ſet and fail you: but rather fix upon one that is juſt riſing, which advances with uniform order and luſtre, kindly reflecting light from the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs,</hi> in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity; or gently diſtilling doctrine as the dew, and as the ſmall rain upon the tender herb; ſo as that every ſpire or tender leaf ſhall have a portion and refreſhment. Not like a ſweeping rain that leaves no food, that ſmothers the low plants, and beats down the graſs and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der herb.</p>
               <p>Make it a ſpecial point, that you chuſe a man of honeſty, modeſty, meckneſs; or you may be ſure he will never wear the mantle of your late departed <hi>Elijah;</hi> not one that looks upon himſelf of great and extraordinary importance; but one that is meek and lowly of heart, or he will never reflect light from the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs;</hi> but will think to lead you by the light of ſparks of his
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012713_0024_0F8B8D98ED641A18"/>own kindling. And, that you may have all the bleſſings of one, who ſhall be a faithful paſtor, a wiſe guide, an able inſtructor, a prudent ruler in the houſe of God, a kind and affectionate father, a loving and beloved brother, an honeſt man, a ſincere chriſtian, an undiſſembled friend, are the ſincere wiſhes and earneſt prayers of him, who has no ſelf intereſt to ſerve thereby, but only that he may have the ſame ſatisfaction and ſocial comfort in him, that he has had in your dear deceaſed paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. And beloved, <hi>ſee that ye fall not out by the way;</hi> but be at peace among yourſelves.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now cloſe up with ſome few words of general <hi>Application</hi> and exhortation, how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and improve our great loſs. What gloomy thoughts does it raiſe in us, when we conſider, we ſhall hear his pleaſant voice no more? Should we not mourn for our ſelves? We do not mourn for him, ſo long as we truſt he is a gainer by the change; ſince he now reſts from his labours, and his works do follow him: he has changed a world of trouble, perplexity and grief for an eternal fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate of (we charitably hope) reſt, joy and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; where all ſorrow and ſighing are fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; where faith is ſwallowed up in viſion; and hope in fruition; where there is the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God and Jeſus Chriſt. Thus we hope our departed friend is triumphing in the realms of uninterrupted bliſs and and happineſs; and it remains for us to mourn, that we have loſt ſuch a father, ſuch a friend, ſuch a dear companion; to bewail the ſinfulneſs of our ſtate, whereby death has taken place and none are ſuffered to continue by reaſon thereof. Even the beſt, the moſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, all muſt go ſooner or later. <hi>The fathers
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012713_0025_0F8B8D99924B22D0"/>where are they; and the prophets, do they live for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever?</hi> Even the high prieſt <hi>Aaron</hi> himſelf was not ſuffered to continue by reaſon of death: <hi>Elijah</hi> who was a man of ſuch eminent worth; muſt not remain, though he was indeed exempted from death, yet he muſt go: <hi>Abraham</hi> the friend of God, and <hi>David</hi> the man after God's own heart muſt die, muſt like down and ſleep in the earth. What doleful havock ſin has made of mankind! None eſcape the dire effects of it. Hence then we ſhould learn to mourn for ſin, to dread and hate it, when this is the cauſe of our being ſeparated from our friends, their being diſtrained from us by death. What a vile monſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſin! it makes us need good friends more; and yet ſcarce have we opportunity to enjoy them before it ſome how parts us. What can there be that ſhould more be the object of our hatred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation? Again, from what we have heard in the conſideration of our great loſs; we ſhould ſtudy to live ſo as to be ready to follow after, that we might live Chriſt, ſo as that when we come to die it may be our gain. We ſhould, in viewing our great loſs, keep our eye upon him, and imitate him in all that, wherein he followed the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in patience, in meekneſs, in love, in mercy, in uprightneſs, in honeſty, covet earneſtly the beſt gifts. To what purpoſe will it be, to reckon up the greatneſs of our loſs, if it be not to ſtrive after the like in ourſelves?</p>
               <p>And here as we conſidered our great friend was eminently as a regular ſtar moving uniform in the orb God had placed him; alas! this ſtar is now ſet, gone out of our hemiſphere! But we have taken a
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012713_0026_0F8B8D9BB894D148"/>view of its courſe; let us walk by the ſame courſe, every one moving regularly &amp; ſtedfaſtly in our orbs; not like blazing ſtars or meteors ſometimes paſſing one way and then the reverſe, ſometimes this way and ſometimes that way. This leads to confuſion; but move ſteadily in the orb, and motion God has allotted out for us; ſtudy what is duty, what is the mind and will of God, what he points out for us to do, by his word and by his providences; and attend conſcienciouſly thereto. This is the way to honor God, and to have the comfortable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of being accepted of him; for them that honor him he will honor. In vain is it to aſpire after great things, and things out of our ſphere; it will be of no avail to have it to brag of at laſt, that we have caſt out devils in Chriſt's name; and in his name done many wonderful works, if there be not charity, love and a conſciencious regard to the honor of God, a tender fellow-feeling toward the flock of Chriſt, the children of God, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt's body, all will be in vain. Thus we ſhould walk, with a ſteady perſeverance in duty, minding thoſe things which have a tendency to do good. Our father which we have now loſt, maintained a ſteady courſe in doing good, in love, meekneſs and honeſty. If all would do ſo; move regularly in their ſpheres; what a different face would there be upon things? How happy might the world be to what it is now: ſurely all conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and jarring muſt ceaſe; all would be love and harmony. But it muſt needs be that offences come; yet wo to that man by whom they come; while bleſſed are the peace makers; for they ſhall be called the children of God. And thoſe, that heartily love and delight in peace and truth here,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012713_0027_0F8B8D9BDC96E0D0"/>have a happy encouragement of enjoying of it to all eternity. But what can the unjuſt, the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, the malicious, the haughty do in heaven? There will be no room for the exerciſing their ungodly tempers there.</p>
               <p>Hence all ſhould be exhorted to live and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have ſo here, as the heavenly inhabitants do. And how great a thing that would be, to live as they do in heaven! In love, uprightneſs and godly ſincerity.</p>
               <p>Finally, at leaſt one more conſideration demands our notice at this time; for when great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant pillars are taken away, the whole build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trembles, and is expoſed to tumble to ruin.</p>
               <p>Surely the removal of ſo great a pillar is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boding of the vengeance of God being poured out upon us; when the righteous and the merciful man is taken from the evil to come, Iſa. 57.1. 2.</p>
               <p>Thus, in the old world, no ſooner was <hi>Methuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lab</hi> gone than the deluge ſwept away the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Thus no ſooner had <hi>Lot</hi> left <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> but they were deſtroyed by fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. No ſooner was <hi>Joſiah</hi> ſecured in his grave; but the captivity began, which finiſhed the Jewiſh ſtate. O then let us conſider, how ſhall theſe threatning aſpects be averted? but by an effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual turning unto God, and becoming ſtedfaſt in thoſe things, wherein our friend and father was eminent, lovely and excellent. Beloved, let all theſe conſiderations awaken us. Let the ſenſe of our great loſs, make a great impreſſion on our
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012713_0028_0F8B8D9CAB4DE830"/>hearts, a great change in our conduct, and ſo a great alteration in the face of things. And may God of his infinite mercy help, now the godly man ceaſeth, and the faithful fail from among the children of men.</p>
