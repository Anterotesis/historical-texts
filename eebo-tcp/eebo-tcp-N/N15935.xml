            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE duties of a ſoldier obliged the Marquis de Clémire to quit his family and join the army. His Lady retired to her eſtate at Champcery, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt part of Burgundy, accompanied by the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronneſs her mother, and the Abbé Frémont, who was tutor to her ſon Caeſar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a youth of about ten years old. Pulcheria was about ſeven years of age, and her ſiſter Caroline eighteen months older.</p>
            <p>Champcery ſoon became agreeable to its inhabitants; the children wondered why they were ſorry to leave Paris; to give variety to their amuſements, the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronneſs and Madame de Clémire, after ſupper, that is, from half after eight to half after nine, promiſed to relate <hi>Tales for their recreation and inſtruction:</hi> This gave the children great pleaſure, and occaſionally introduced converſations highly entertaining and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive.</p>
            <p>One day, after dinner, Madame de Clémire, having a letter to write, left her children in the hall with the Abbé during the hour of recreation: in a quarter of an hour, having finiſhed her letter, ſhe returned, and perceived Caroline and Pulcheria ſitting together read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a corner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:020385_0003_0FAF01BCC4A61040"/>
What are you reading there, my dears? ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Clémire.</p>
            <p>It is a book, mamma, that Mademoiſelle Julien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne has lent us.</p>
            <p>Mademoiſelle Julienne, is ſhe capable of directing you in the choice of books! And beſides, ought you to borrow books without informing me?</p>
            <p>That's what I told theſe young ladies, ſaid the Abbé, who was playing at cheſs, with the Curate, at the other end of the room, but they would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me. Maſter Caeſar is more rational, he is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking our game, and reading the <hi>Journal de Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me ſee what book it is, ſaid Madame de Clé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>Le Prince Percinet,</hi> &amp; <hi>La Princeſſe Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe,</hi> mamma.</p>
            <p>A Fairy Tale! ſaid the Baronneſs. How can you be pleaſed with ſuch a book?</p>
            <p>I ſee, mamma, I have done wrong; but I confeſs I am fond of fairy tales; they are very amuſing; they are ſo marvellous, ſo extraordinary, and have ſo many changes from cryſtal palaces to golden caſtles, that it's quite delighting to read.</p>
            <p>But don't you know that all theſe miracles are falſe.</p>
            <p>To be ſure, mamma; they are fairy tales.</p>
            <p>How does it happen, that this idea does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt you then?</p>
            <p>We own, mamma, the ſtories you tell us are a thouſand times more intereſting. I could hear them for ever, and I ſhould ſoon be tired of fairy tales.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:020385_0004_0FAF01BD2AA999B0"/>
But if you are ſo fond of the marvellous, you might far better fatisfy that inclination by reading books which are inſtructive.</p>
            <p>How ſo, mamma?</p>
            <p>It is your ignorance only, that makes you ſuppoſe the marvellous exiſts no where but in fairy-tales. Nature and art afford phaenomena as ſurpriſing, as the moſt remarkable incidents in <hi>Prince Percinet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it poſſible, mamma?</p>
            <p>I will prove it is; and for that purpoſe undertake to write a tale the moſt ſtriking and ſingular you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard; the marvellous of which ſhall all be true.</p>
            <p>Caeſar, who had overheard in part the converſation, left cheſs and the <hi>Journal de Paris,</hi> and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Madame de Clémire ſaid, are you in earneſt, mamma?</p>
            <p>You ſhall judge yourſelf: I muſt have imaginary perſons, and fabulous incidents; but obſerve <hi>the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous ſhall all be true:</hi> every thing that ſhall wear the face of prodigy or enchantment I will take from nature; the events ſhall be ſuch as either have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, or do daily happen at preſent.</p>
            <p>Well, that now appears incredible.</p>
            <p>But I am ſure of one thing, mamma; which is, that you will have no chryſtal palaces, with pillars of diamond, in your tale.</p>
            <p>Yes, ſince you defy me to it, I will have chryſtal palaces, with pillars of diamond; and what's more, a city all of ſilver.</p>
            <p>What, without the aſſiſtance of magic, fairies, and necromancers!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:020385_0005_0FAF01BDCF955588"/>
Yes, without magic, fairies, or necromancers; with other events ſtill more ſurpriſing.</p>
            <p>I ſhall never recover from my amazement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dear, dear, how impatient I am to hear your tale, mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma!</p>
            <p>It will take me three weeks at leaſt to write it, for I muſt look over ſeveral voyages and works of natural hiſtory.</p>
            <p>What can you find in thoſe inſtructive books, things more marvellous than in Prince Percinet? How does it happen then, that fairy tales are not out of faſhion?</p>
            <p>Becauſe the kind of tales I ſpeak of, require pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious knowledge, which is only to be gained by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>But how then, mamma, ſhall we be able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand your tale?</p>
            <p>I will employ no technical terms, and only relate the effects without explaining their cauſes; ſo that if you had not been told it ſhould be all truth, you would have ſuppoſed it abſolutely a fairy tale; but you muſt wait three weeks, during which time our evening and morning ſtories ſhall all be ſuſpended.</p>
            <p>O dear, O dear, three weeks!</p>
            <p>Do yourſelves juſtice, Caroline and Pulcheria; have I not forbid your ever looking in a book that was not given you, either by me or your grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamma.</p>
            <p>That is very true, and we deſerve a longer pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>The three weeks being expired, Madame de Clé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire promiſed, in the evening, to read them the tale
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:020385_0006_0FAF01C03087DBD0"/>
ſhe had written. After ſupper they ran immediately into the hall, and Madame de Clémire, ſitting by the ſide of a table, took her manuſcript from her pocket.</p>
            <p>Before I begin, ſaid ſhe, you ought to recollect, that I have undertaken chiefly to relate extraordinary, yet poſſible events; incidents which to you ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear incredible, but which, however, have, or might have, all happened: in a word, phaenomena, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of which, paſt or preſent, is well proved. I have only invented the plot of the ſtory, that is to ſay, the ſole part which to you ſhall appear credible; while all that you will think marvellous, all that will recall to your minds your fairy tales, is preciſely true and natural</p>
            <p>O, that will be charming!</p>
            <p>You will think my <hi>incredible truths,</hi> a thouſand times better than your common well confirmed <hi>every day truths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what, mamma, muſt we continually believe what we cannot comprehend?</p>
            <p>Do not think yourſelf humbled by that, Caeſar; that is a deſtiny common to manhood, as well as to infancy; our capacities are too confined to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all the truths which are demonſtrable; and it would be abſurd to affirm a thing does not exiſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is beyond the limits of our underſtandings. Let us not adopt errors, but let us not give way to that vain and ridiculous preſumption which rejects, with diſdain, and without examination, every thing that reaſon cannot conceive.</p>
            <p>Well, mamma, you have told us that every thing in your tale is well authenticated; therefore we may
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:020385_0007_0FAF01C140C75F10"/>
blindly believe and take the facts for granted, and that is as much as I deſire.</p>
            <p>I wiſh to underſtand what I hear, mamma; and therefore ſhall be glad of your explanations.</p>
            <p>I will willingly explain whatever I can; but that will not be much. I am not learned: beſides, as I have ſaid, there is an infinity of phaenomena in exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, of which the moſt learned men cannot explain the cauſes.</p>
            <p>And will you interrupt your tale, mamma, at each marvellous circumſtance, to give us an explanation?</p>

            <p>ALPHONSO, the hero of my hiſtory, was born in Portugal. His father, Don Ramirez, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed riches and preferment becauſe he was a favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite. Born of an obſcure family, but with a ſubtile intriguing, and ambitious character he introduced himſelf at court, found protectors, formed partizans, and became at laſt the idol of his ſovereign. The young Alphonſo was educated at Liſbon, in the ſumptuous palace of his father: an only ſon to the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020385_0009_0FAF01C2573C3A18"/>
richeſt and moſt powerful man in the kingdom, adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation kneeled at his cradle, accompanied and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his youth.</p>
            <p>Don Ramirez, occupied by great projects and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cabals, could not be at the ſame time an aſſiduous courtier and a vigilant father; he was therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to commit the care of his ſon's education to ſtrangers. Alphonſo had teachers of languages, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, geography, mathematics, muſic, and drawing, all of whom wondered, or pretended to wonder, at his prodigious capacity and ſtrength of genius. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, Alphonſo learnt little, except to draw flowers, and play a few airs on the guittar.</p>

Neither did he tell them any thing he did not himſelf believe; for his governor, his teachers, his valets, and the croud of complaiſant people that paid their court to his father, all declared he was a miracle, ſo repeatedly, he could not doubt of its being a certain fact.</p>
            <p>He not only ſuppoſed himſelf the moſt diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed young man at Court, by his talents, beauty and knowledge, but he likewiſe believed his birth to be as illuſtrious as his fortune Don Ramirez, during his leiſure moments, had invented a liſt of his forefathers, as far back as the fabulous times of Luſus<note n="*" place="bottom">The Portugueze were anciently called Luſitanians, from Luſus, or Lyſias, one of their kings, who, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fable, was either the ſon or companion of Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</note>; which

genealogy, every body but his ſon laughed at; the world is not apt to credit old titles, never heard of till the pretended owner is become rich. Alphonſo, however, too vain not to be credulous on ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſaw no one ſuperior to his father, except his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and the branches of the royal family; and yet Alphonſo, inebriated with pride, full of ignorance, folly, and preſumption, ſpoilt by pomp, flattery, and fortune's favours; Alphonſo, I ſay, was yet not loſt paſt retrieving: he was poſſeſſed of courage, a feeling heart, and a good underſtanding; and the inconſtancy of fortune was preparing a leſſon, that would teach him to know himſelf.</p>
            <p>As Don Ramirez owed his elevation only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, ſo a new intrigue unexpectedly changed his deſtiny; he was diſgraced and ſtript of all his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, juſt as Alphonſo was ſeventeen. This unforeſeen revolution not only deprived Don Rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez of titles that flattered his pride, but alſo of a great part of his wealth; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>It is true, that this palace contained immenſe rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, in furniture, plate, paintings, and eſpecially in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amonds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all which Don Ramirez only waited for a favourable opportunity to ſell, when a dreadful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture happened, which gave the finiſhing ſtroke to his misfortunes.

ſon, that the ſtate of his affairs forced him to ſell his palace, and return in the country. At laſt he determined to declare his real ſituation, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſent for him one morning, to open his heart to him on that ſubject.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they were alone, tell me, Alphonſo, ſaid Don Ramirez, what effect has my diſgrace and the loſs of my fortune had upon you?

            <p>You are deceived, Alphonſo, interrupted Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirez; what, are you ignorant that the name of my father was abſolutely unknown?</p>
            <p>I know it was replied Alphonſo; but I alſo know that the old titles which you have re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ed in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, make it equal to any in the kingdom. You yourſelf, my father, have deigned to read thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

proofs of honour, which are contained in the caſket that is locked up in your cabinet.</p>
            <p>Don Ramirez liſtened and ſighed; he had had the ridiculous vanity to purchaſe a genealogy, and never ſufficiently felt, till his diſgrace, how ſuperfluous, unworthy, and contemptible is ſuch deceit. At laſt he ſaw what flattery till then had hidden, which was, that, except his ſon, every body knew his birth, and laughed at his ſilly pretenſions. He wiſhed to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Alphonſo, but could not reſolve to confeſs a falſity which muſt make him appear ſo mean.</p>
            <p>He was in this mournful perplexity and ſilence when he was ſuddenly ſtaggered, and ſaw Alphonſo reel; the colour forſook his cheeks, and he roſe; ſave your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, my father, cried Alphonſo, ſupport yourſelf on my arm, follow—come—</p>
            <p>So ſaying, he impetuouſly hurried his father away; at the ſame inſtant a thouſand confuſed cries were heard; they ran towards the ſtair-caſe, and as they ran, the floor opened beneath the feet of Alphonſo, who, that he might not drag his father down to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, quitted the arm of Don Romirez, inſtantly ſunk, and ſeemed buried in the ruins.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo had the good fortune, however, to be only ſlightly wounded; he roſe, and found himſelf in his father's cabinet: amongſt the rubbiſh which ſurrounded him, were two caſkets, one containing the jewels of his father, the other, the ſo much vaunted genealogy. Alphonſo did not heſitate: willing to ſave, amidſt this dreadful diſaſter, that which appeared to him moſt precious, he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ized the box of titles, and fled into the garden; but recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting

the danger of his father, was determined, at the hazard of his life, again to enter the houſe, when he heard Don Ramirez calling him at the other end of the garden.</p>
            <p>It was not without difficulty they rejoined each other; the earth on which they trod, like the ſea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated by a violent tempeſt, roſe in mountains, or ſunk in dreadful vallies beneath Alphon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> breaking upon the rocks; he ſtaggered, fell, got up, and fell again, and, unable to keep upon his feet, crept on all ſours, with great difficulty, towards his father. He ſaw the earth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen on all ſides, and forming gulphs, whence iſſued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ire and flame, which roſe and vaniſhed in the air; the heavens became dark, the pale and livid lightning pierced through the black clouds that covered them, the deep thunders rolled, and Alphonſo beheld the bolts of heaven ready to fall upon his head, and hell opening beneath his feet.</p>
            <p>Often when he imagined himſelf within a ſtep of his father, a new ſhock threw them at a diſtance; the ſweat ran down his face, his cloaths and hair were covered with ſand and duſt: yet, amidſt the ſcene of horrors, he never abandoned his dear caſket; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he imagined Don Ramirez would receive it with tranſport: that idea ſuſtained his courage and his ſtre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gth. At laſt he rejoined his father, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eived him with open arms, though with an aching heart. Oh my father! cried Alphonſo, look, I have ſaved the caſket.</p>
            <p>The jewels! haſtily interrupted Don Ramirez.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:020385_0014_0FAF01C91CD4A168"/>
No, no, replied Alphonſo; I knew better how to chuſe; it is your genealogy.</p>
            <p>Don Ramirez, in dreadful conſternation, raiſed his eyes to heaven: I am juſtly puniſhed, ſaid he, for my ridiculous vanity. He could ſay no more, his tears interrupted his ſpeech. Alphonſo, too much prepoſſeſſed and agitated to comprehend the meaning of theſe words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> continued in his former error, and thought only of ſaving his father. A moment's calm left them time to conſider the mournful objects that ſurrounded them.</p>
            <p>They ſat down oppoſite their palace, now half deſtroyed: that magnificent palace, built within the laſt ten years, that palace ſo new, ſo rich, ſo admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is now only a heap of ruins. He who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the bare walls, the mouldered columns, the glaſsleſs windows, muſt have believed that time alone could have produced ſo terrible a revolution! Ages ſeemed neceſſary to deſtroy a monument built with ſo much ſolidity, and yet the fearful deſtruction is the work of a few minutes!</p>
            <p>The garden too, that maſter-piece of art and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is now an unmeaning chaos of duſt, mud, and mouldered leaves. In the morning there was ſeen a ſuperb caſcade, where is it now? In the very ſpot where an artificial mount was raiſed, at a prodigious expence, gapes a dreadful gulph. What are become of the citron groves, the marble ſtatues, the vaſes of alabaſter and of porphyry? A few veſtiges ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, a few broken fragments; the reſt is ſwallowed up and loſt!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:020385_0015_0FAF01C9DE2CF9C0"/>
Don Ramirez looked at the ſurrounding diſſolution; he was ſitting near a little wood that had riſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath his own eyes; the trees are all torn up by the roots, ſcattered here and there, buried or extended in the mire: thoſe trees, deſtined to ſurvive the hand that planted them, are torn from the boſom of the earth, with as much eaſe and rapidity, as the verdure and yielding flowers that grew beneath their ſhade.</p>
            <p>Oh! day of horrors! cried Don Ramirez aloud, loft labours, treaſures interred in this place of terrors; why did not I make a better uſe of the money this building and this garden have coſt? But the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake is abated (2), let us endeavour to regain the ruins, let us ſave my diamonds, if poſſible.</p>
            <p>So ſaying, he aroſe, and at the ſame inſtant a new and dreadful ſhock extended him again upon the ground: the remaining walls tumbled, the rubbiſh was ingulfed, and the palace diſappeared; a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, and cloud of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>moke and duſt roſe as it were at his feet; yet, amidſt this ſcene of deſolation, Don Ramirez perceived a moment after a band of harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wretches, bearing lighted torches, and creeping towards the ruins of the palace, with an intent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt ſhock, to pillage (3).</p>
            <p>Alphonſo wiſhed to puniſh ſuch unbridled villainy, and would have ruſhed upon them, had not his father caught and retained him in his arms. Oh! my ſon, ſaid Don Ramirez, bathing him with a deluge of tears, let us fly from this ſcene of horrid deſtruction; we are near the banks of the Tagus, let us ſeek ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſafety on board the ſhips.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:020385_0016_0FAF01CA988AF580"/>
Alphonſo gave one arm to his father, held the caſket in the other, left the garden, and entered one of the public ſquares: the houſes were all in ruins, overthrown, or conſumed, by the flames of a general conflagration. After a thouſand fearful riſks, Don Ramirez and the young Alphonſo, at laſt, found pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection on board a veſſel, commanded by the brave and generous Fernandes. The ſame Fernandes, who formerly had ſo much cauſe to complain of Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirez, but who, in this time of public calamity, ſaw, only, in an ancient enemy, an unhappy man, to whom his aſſiſtance was become neceſſary. He ran to Don Ramirez, embraced and conſoled him; for compaſſion in great minds is ſo forcible and ſo delicate, that it can ſoften woes the moſt cruel. In the mean time, as Fernandes did not once bewail his own ſituation, Don Ramirez queſtioned him concerning it. You had, ſaid he, a great fortune, is it not all lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t in this dreadful day?</p>
            <p>My houſe at Liſbon is conſumed.</p>
            <p>The loſs is, no doubt, conſiderable.</p>
            <p>No; the building was ſmall and ſimple.</p>
            <p>Your jewels and diamonds; are they ſaved?</p>
            <p>I had none.</p>
            <p>You had a garden.</p>
            <p>Yes; but far removed from Liſbon, where I paſſed the greateſt part of my time; it is in Alentejo<note n="*" place="bottom">A province of Portugal, between the Tagus and the Guadiana. Evora is the metropolis.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I have heard of it, and hope to God the earthquake has not ravaged that province. Is your country-houſe a fine one?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:020385_0017_0FAF01CB524B3658"/>
No; but it is convenient.</p>
            <p>Have not you formed ſome advantageous eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there?</p>
            <p>Some ſatisfactory ones; a manufactory, and a hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital. (Don Ramirez ſighed.)</p>
            <p>Is your manufactory profitable?</p>
            <p>Yes; it gives ſubſiſtence to a number of workmen, and defrays, in part, the expences at the hoſpital.</p>
            <p>I ſee you make a worthy uſe of your wealth; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven preſerve it to you. It is, indeed, horrible, to be ruined with a benevolent heart, and to be obliged to relinquiſh ſuch honourable, ſuch glorious eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>One ſhould then find conſolation in the remembrance of the good one had formerly done.</p>
            <p>Don Ramirez again fetched a profound ſigh, and bitterly regretted the uſe he had made of his fortune; his eyes at laſt were opened; but too late, alas! ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his glory or repoſe.</p>
            <p>Thus totally ruined, Don Ramirez received from his ſovereign, thanks to the ſolicitations of the noble Fernandes, a ſmall penſion, though ſufficient to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ord the means of ſubſiſtence. With this he determined to retire to the province of Beira, whither he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his ſon, and ſettled in an obſcure, but pleaſant retreat, on the agreeable banks of the Mondego; but, followed by deep regret, and inceſſant recollection, he found not the tranquillity he ſought.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo, devoted to ambition, and nothing abated in preſumption and pride, conſoled himſelf for the loſs of fortune, by the hope, that in time, he ſhould eſtabliſh a more brilliant, and far more ſolid one than
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020385_0018_0FAF01CC40829998"/>
what his father's had been. He formed a thouſand extravagant and chimerical projects, the abſurdity of which his ignorance and vanity did not ſuffer him to perceive: incapable of reflecting and employing his time in a uſeful and rational manner, he paſſed a great part of it in reading romances; theſe frivolous and dangerous books heated his imagination, and gave him falſe ideas of men and things.</p>
            <p>Not far from the retreat he inhabited, was the famous Fountain of Love; a name it owed to two unfortunate lovers, who, in ancient times, often met on its brinks, drawn thither by an imprudent paſſion. There it was that Don Pedro, and the beautiful, the tender Ines, a thouſand times diſcourſed of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret loves<note n="*" place="bottom">Such is the tradition. This fountain ſtill exiſts in Portugal, near the Mondego, and is called the Fountain of Love. Camoens, in his beautiful poem of the Luſiad, gives birth to this fountain, from the tears which the nymphs of the Mondego ſhed at the death of Ines.</note>. Two antique palm-trees overſhaded the Fountain, united to each other by a flexible gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of vine branches and ivy. The water riſes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſly from a majeſtic rock, returns in a caſcade, and forms, upon a bed of ſhells, a large rivulet, which ſlowly winds, and gently murmurs, among eternal verdures, ſhrubs of myrtle, of citron, and the laurel roſe.</p>
            <p>Thither Alphonſo often went to read and ruminate. One morning, happening to go later than ordinary, he heard, as he drew near the Fountain, two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſpeaking in an unknown tongue: in one of their voices Alphonſo found an inexpreſſible ſweetneſs,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020385_0019_0FAF01CD071E53A0"/>
which wonderfully excited his curioſity; he hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with emotion, behind a myrtle buſh, through the branches of which he diſcovered an object moſt worthy of fixing his attention; a young nymph, for ſo ſhe ſeemed, ſcarce fifteen, of the moſt perfect beauty, was ſitting on the banks of the Fountain, beſide a man, who appeared to be her father; to him ſhe was liſtening with the utmoſt attention, and by her looks it was evident he was reciting ſome intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing event.</p>
            <p>As he proceeded, he often pointed to the palm-trees and the fountain, whence Alphonſo ſuppoſed he was relating the hiſtory of the unhappy Ines. The angelic liſtener had fixed her eyes upon the unknown relater, and kept a profound ſilence; but, from the expreſſion of her countenance, her thoughts might eaſily be divined; curioſity, fear, and pity, were ſucceſſively painted in her eyes; and with ſo much energy, that Alphonſo imagined himſelf was hearing a tale that ſhe was telling; he ſaw her tears, and wept with her the death of Ines. Preſently her eyes became ſuddenly dry, her cheeks pale, and terror and indignation ſucceeded to pity. Alphonſo ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in ſympathy, deteſting the exceſs to which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a deſire of vengeance had carried the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Don Pedro.</p>
            <p>The hiſtory of Ines is ended, and yet the ſtranger continues ſpeaking; no doubt he is making prudent reflections on the danger of the paſſions, and on the criminal and fatal imprudence of a young woman, who, without the conſent of her parents, dared to chuſe for and diſpoſe of herſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:020385_0020_0FAF01CD90BDFAF0"/>
The beauteous hearer ran to the arms of the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, with all the expreſſion of the ſtrongeſt feeling: then turning her gliſtening eyes towards that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which had formerly been a witneſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet vows of love; ſhe ſighed, fell on her knees, raiſed her claſped and eager hands to heaven, and ſeemed to promiſe the author of her days <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n eternal obedience; her beauty, in that attitude, had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing celeſtial and angelic.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo could not contain his extatic tranſports; an exclamation eſcaped aloud, and fearing to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, he haſtily fled from his hiding-place, full of the idea of what he had ſeen. He followed the firſt path he found, but preſently awaking from his dream, again returned towards the Fountain. The beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtranger was gone, and Alphonſo contemplated with grief the place where ſhe had ſat, and thought he ſtill ſaw her on her knees before her father. The next moment he remembers her abſence, his heart is oppreſſed, his eyes filled with tears, he is plunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a profound and melancholy meditation, when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly he hears a cry of terror, which pierces him to the very heart.</p>
            <p>He runs, he flies; but what does he behold! It is the ſtranger, alone, pale, diſhevelled, and flying from a mad bull that purſues her. Alphonſo darts towards her, ſeizes her in his arms, and bears her off, at the very moment, when, overcome by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of fear, ſhe was fallen, not ten pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020385_0021_0FAF01D005313D28"/>
and bears her ſenſeleſs in his arms in ſafety upon a high rock.</p>
            <p>Here he perceived the father of the ſtranger, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wild, and, as ſoon as he ſaw his daughter in ſafety, bleſſing God and her deliverer. At the ſame inſtant the bull returned, and bent his courſe towards the father, who had not time to avoid him, or mount the rock. In vain did Alphonſo ſtill hold his ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs prize in one arm, and extend the other towards her father; the latter cried aloud to him in Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe, not to abandon his daughter on that danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſummit, and ran himſelf immediately behind one of the largeſt of the palm-trees of the fountain.</p>
            <p>The bull endeavoured to paſs between them; the paſſage was narrow, he was in full ſpeed, his body became fixed between the trees, and his head and horns entangled in the feſtoons of ivy and vine-trees. The ſtranger ſeized the advantage of the moment, drew an etwee caſe from his pocket, opened it, took out a pin, and rain it in the back of the bull; but how great was the ſurprize of Alphonſo! when he heard the bull bellow dreadfully, ſaw him drop, ſtruggle to riſe, again fall down, and, after a few vain efforts, expire.</p>
            <p>Nay now, but ſure, cried all the children at once, that is not poſſible.</p>
            <p>Pardon me, ſaid Madame Clémire, but it is.</p>
            <p>What, mamma! cried Caroline; a bull killed by the prick of a pin!</p>

That thorn was not quite ſo dangerous as the pin of the ſtranger.</p>

            <p>Much ſhorter than the pins with which I pin on my hat.</p>

            <p>It is a delightful ſtory: do, dear mamma, have the goodneſs to go on; we will not interrupt you any more.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo, continued Madame de Clémire, was not leſs ſurpriſed than you are, at the ſudden death of the bull; amazement rendered him motionleſs, while the ſtranger aſcended the rock, and took his daughter in his arms, juſt as ſhe began to recover the uſe of her ſenſes and look around. Alphonſo was not an unfeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witneſs of the pure joy teſtified by the father and daughter; the latter did not underſtand Portugueſe, therefore could not thank Alphonſo; but ſhe related to her father, in a few words, the dreadful danger from which ſhe had been delivered.</p>

ſtranger, concerning the manner in which he had been ſeparated from his daughter: he replied, that he had been culling ſimples; that Dalinda, occupied after the ſame manner, was at ſome diſtance from him, but not out of ſight; that lifting up his head, he had ſeen her running with incredible ſwiftneſs; that ſhe had already got above ſix hundred yards from him, and that at the ſame moment be perceived the bull purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her; that he ran after her with all his power, but had ſtumbled over the ſtump of an old tree, and fallen.</p>
            <p>Having finiſhed his recital, Alphonſo aſked if he intended to ſtay long in Portugal? No, anſwered the ſtranger, we ſet off immediately for Spain, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of ſeeing as much of that kingdom as poſſible. This intelligence threw Alphonſo into the utmoſt conſternation! He hung down his head, and was mournfully ſilent; the ſtranger, after again repeating his thanks and gratitude in the moſt affectionate terms, roſe, took his leave, and diſappeared with Dalinda.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo remained, ſome time, petrified, and ſcarcely ſeeming to breathe; at laſt, coming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he flung impetuouſly from the fountain, and flew to find the ſtranger once again, to aſk him a thouſand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> like a madman, but all his ſearches were in vain.</p>
            <p>Overcome with fatigue and deſpair, he returned once more to the Fountain. As he drew near, he
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020385_0024_0FAF01D21C3BAD28"/>
ſaw ſomething ſhining in the path, and approaching, found it was a large blue ribbon embroidered with gold, his heart beat, he knew it to be the ſcarfe of Dalinda. It was in that very place that Dalinda, overcome with terror, had fallen ſenſeleſs; and there it was that Alphonſo, raiſing her in his arms, had untied the ribbon that girded her waiſt.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo affected, ſtooped with tranſport and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, to take up a ribbon ſo precious; the ſaſh of Dalinda was the ceſtus of innocence, and the girdle of the graces. He ſighed, and vowed for ever to preſerve a pledge ſo dear to his heart, which he had thus acquired by chance. In the mean time the hours glided away, Alphonſo could not tear himſelf from the Fountain; and night and darkneſs had ſurprized him, ſtill plunged in his reverie, if Don Ramirez had not come to ſearch for him himſelf.</p>
            <p>Don Ramirez had never taken any part in his ſon's education; had never aſked, nor ever poſſeſſed his confidence. Alphonſo did not mention his adventure to him; but, on the contrary, carefully concealed the thoughts and emotions of his ſoul. Devoted to the romantic ideas which ſeduced his imagination, he had only one pleaſure, that of paſſing his hours at the Fountain, where he firſt beheld Dalinda; there every thing recalled the object, which reaſon ought to have eraſed from his memory; here Dalinda, at the knees of her father, was retraced in his fancy; here, in his fixed thoughts, ſhe ſtill lived in all her bloom of beauty, adorned with every charm of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and virtue; near this ſhrubbery, Dalinda owed to him her life; upon that rock ſhe opened her
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:020385_0025_0FAF01D2D580A380"/>
eyes, and caſt a look of ſweet thankfulneſs upon Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo; beneath theſe palm-trees did ſhe ſit, and that clear water once reflected her ſeraphic form.</p>
            <p>Thus did Alphonſo conſume his days, in vain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets upon the dangerous brink of this fatal ſpring. Such does fable paint the wretched Narciſſus, a feeble victim of inſenſate love; and ſo did Alphonſo, pale, dejected, without force, without courage, fix his eyes, drowned in his tears, upon the Fountain of Love. The echoes of this ſolitary place, which anciently ſo often reſounded with the name of Ines, repeat at preſent, only that of Dalinda. Dalinda is carved upon every tree, even on the very palm-trees, on which formerly Ines alone was read. Alphonſo ſung to his guittar the verſes he had written on Dalinda, and engraved upon the rocks the rhymes that love and melancholy dictated.</p>
            <p>Theſe romantic follies totally occupied him for ſome time: but as the pleaſures which reaſon diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves are never durable, his imagination cooled by degrees, and weariſome diſguſt ſucceeded enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm; his ſongs and complaints began to ceaſe, the echoes of the Fountain became mute, and the trees, the ſtreams, and verdure, no longer could inſpire him with poetry and profound reveries.</p>
            <p>Don Ramirez obſerved the alteration of body and mind which had happened to his ſon; he queſtioned him, and Alphonſo confeſſed himſelf diſſatisfied and conſumed with <hi>ennui.</hi> He had not forgot, that the ſtranger told him he ſhould remain ſome time in Spain; and Alphonſo added, he ardently deſired to travel through, and become acquainted with that
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020385_0026_0FAF01D3C3E3ED08"/>
country. Don Ramirez, who, for his own part, had none of thoſe reſources in himſelf, which make men fond of ſolitude, gladly ſeized this propoſition, and two days after they departed for Spain. After tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing the province of Tralos-Montes, they entered Spain by Galicia; they then travelled through the northern part of Spain, the Aſturi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, Biſcaye, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre, Arragon, and arrived at laſt in Catalonia (4).</p>
            <p>Alphonſo's paſſion for Dalinda was rekindled by this voyage; the hope and the deſire of once more finding her, acquired new force from thoughts, which an enthuſiaſtic imagination had at firſt produced. He was impatient to arrive at Madrid, thinking he could not fail to meet her in this metropolis, but Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirez would abſolutely remain ſome time in Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, in order to viſit the famous Mont-Serrat; this mountain, compoſed of ſteep rocks, is ſo high, that, when arrived on its ſummit, the neighbouring moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that ſurround it, ſeem ſo diminiſhed, as to look little more than mole-hils; and the views from thence are the moſt majeſtic and extenſive poſſible<note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſaid you may ſee the iſlands of Majorca and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norca from this place, which are more than ſixty leagues diſtant.

a cell, a ſmall garden, and a well, dug in the rock. The Hermits who inhabit them, are moſt of them gentlemen, who, diſguſted with the world, come to this place of tranquillity and reſt, and give themſelves up entirely to meditation<note n="‡" place="bottom">See the work laſt cited, Tom. 1.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At break of day, Don Ramirez and his ſon began to aſcend Mont-Serrat; the aſpect of the mountain, might well have made them renounce their deſign; its prodigious elevation, and the enormous and crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy rocks which projected on every ſide, promiſed no agreeable walk; but in traveſing theſe menacing ſteeps, delicious vallies, meadows, enamelled with a thouſand flowers, thickets formed by the ſimple hand of nature, and caſcades, which throw themſelves from the white and ſtoney ridges with animating tumult, give a thouſand varieties, and embelliſh this ſolitude, which is become the fortunate refuge of peace and virtue (5).</p>
            <p>Don Ramirez, on entering the deſert, met one of theſe Hermits reading as he walked. He was ſtruck by his noble and venerable figure; he paſſed near them, and as Don Ramirez was ſpeaking with his ſon, the Hermit, hearing the Portugueſe tongue, took his eyes from his book, and approached the ſtrangers. He told Don Ramirez, how happy he was once more to meet a countryman, and invited them both to reſt a while in his hermitage. The propoſition was gratefully accepted, and the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Recluſe brought them vegetables and fruit.</p>
            <p>After the repaſt, Alphonſo, deſirous of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his walk, left them, telling his father he would
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020385_0028_0FAF01D50F8678D8"/>
wait for him in the deſert. The old man led Don Ramirez to his garden, and there they ſat themſelves down beſide a gentle water-fall, upon a rock over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with moſs.</p>
            <p>Don Ramirez, then addreſſing himſelf to the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, ſaid, what revolution, what cruel reverſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, my father, can have torn you from your native country, and fixed you in this deſert? It is eaſy to ſee by your manners you were not born to end your days in a wilderneſs like this.</p>
            <p>No, replied the Hermit, it has been my misfortune to know the world, and the Court.</p>
            <p>Theſe words inſpired Don Ramirez with the moſt ardent curioſity, which the Hermit conſented to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy.</p>
            <p>It imports you but little, ſaid he, to know my name: I have been twelve years an inhabitant of this mountain. By this time they believe in Portugal that I am dead. I have devoted myſelf to oblivion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not ſpeak of my family, but in as few words as poſſible relate my deplorable ſtory.</p>
            <p>Madame de Clémire was continuing to read, but the Baronneſs gave the ſignal of retreat; in vain were ſeveral voices at once heard, entreating for one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour more; the rule was abſolute.</p>
            <p>The following evening Madame de Clémire again opened her manuſcript, and ſaid, we left off yeſterday where the Hermit was going to recount his hiſtory. Don Ramirez liſtened; the Hermit ſighed, and thus he ſaid:</p>
            <q>
               <p>My family is one of the moſt ancient in all Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal. I received a good education, inherited a
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:020385_0029_0FAF01D7652E1CB8"/>
tolerable fortune, and by my ſucceſs in war, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the eſteem and benefactions of my ſovereign, married a woman whom I loved, became a father, and of courſe became happy.</p>
               <p>Such was my ſituation when the late King died. This event deprived me of a beloved maſter, a protector, and a father; for to a faithful ſubject a good King is all theſe. I retired from Court to an eſtate in the country, and dedicated my time ſolely to the education of my ſon. This ſon, the object of a moſt tender affection, was ſuperior even to my hopes.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he was of an age proper to appear at Court, I entruſted him to the care of a relation, ſent him to Liſbon, and remained in my country ſolitude. I was now, for the firſt time, ſeparated from my ſon, and yet never was happier. I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined his future ſucceſs, and indulged the fondeſt hopes of his riſing fame.—Hope, though the moſt uncertain, the moſt deceitful, is yet, perhaps, the greateſt of bleſſings, and which the heart of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only can properly eſtimate. When our own intereſt produces the flattering illuſion, it is mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, enfeebled, or, perhaps, diſpelled by fear; but what father ever yet preſcribed bounds to the hopes he conceived of his ſon; Alas! I thought to have beheld ſome of mine realized!</p>
               <p>My ſon ſet out with the moſt brilliant ſucceſs. His name, his family, my ſervices, which his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence brought again to remembrance, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his underſtanding, good temper and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, obtained that reſpect at Court, which the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:020385_0030_0FAF01D84EBE4EA8"/>
jealouſy of courtiers looked upon as the beginning of favour.</p>
               <p>He ſaw a young lady of Liſbon, who, in addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to perſonal attraction, talents, and virtue, was of a noble family, and large fortune. My ſon aſpired to her hand, I approved his choice, and this attachment, authorized by my approbation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ixed the ſhort deſtiny of his life. Her parents conſented to an union, by which his happineſs would be enſured, but on condition that he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a place at Court. My ſon aſked a place, and he was promiſed one in three months; it was only required he ſhould keep his ſucceſs a ſecret, for reaſons aſſigned, till the moment of actual poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; with permiſſion, however, to inform the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of his miſtreſs of the event, which he inſtantly did.</p>
               <p>He was accordingly preſented to the young lady as her future huſband, and ſhe, at this interview, thus authorized, confeſſed an affection for him, which crowned his felicity.</p>
               <p>As the marriage was of courſe deferred, till the period when he ſhould be in actual enjoyment of his promiſed place, he tore himſelf from Liſbon, and came to tell me all his happineſs. I had then the pleaſure to hold in my arms, and preſs to my boſom, the child whom I ſo dearly loved, and whom I conſidered as at the ſummit of all his wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Alas! while I ſuppoſed myſelf the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate of fathers, a Barbarian, a Monſter, was forming the black plot, which at once deprived me of wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e and ſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:020385_0031_0FAF01D8DBBE8A00"/>
My ſon's natural candour, prevented him from ſuſpecting the probity of a traitor, who only wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his confidence, that he might ruin him with greater certainty. This wretch, who had been dragged from obſcurity, by the caprice of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, imagined he beheld in him a dangerous rival; but, diſſembling his jealouſy, he ſought, and ſoon obtained the friendſhip of the unſuſpecting youth.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Don Ramirez was greatly diſturbed at this part of the Hermit's recital, but the old man perceived not his emotion, and continued his ſtory.</p>
            <q>
               <p>When my ſon ſolicited the place of which he was deſirous, he truſted the ſecret to that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable man; who, not having, juſt at that inſtant, the power to injure him, pretended to ſecond his requeſt, and participate his joy; but the abſence of my ſon, gave him an opportunity to exerciſe his fiend like malignancy. He knew his own aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy over the King; he calumniated my ſon, and inſpired a young and inexperienced Prince with falſe fears; the gift was revoked, the place given to a creature of this unworthy favourite, and my ſon exiled the Court. By his Majeſty's order, I was firſt informed of this terrible calamity, which forbade my ſon to quit his country-ſeat; and my ſon, at the ſame time, received a letter from the young lady he loved, which contained theſe few words:</p>
               <p>You have moſt unworthily deceived us; we know, from the beſt authority, the place now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of, was never promiſed you; forget there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:020385_0032_0FAF01D9949783D0"/>
the name of one, who will never forgive herſelf for having once eſteemed you.</p>
               <p>After having read this fatal billet, my ſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, Thus then I have loſt the woman I loved, and am diſhonoured! In ſaying this, his knees knocked violently together, the blood for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook his face, and he dropped into my arms. He was taken to bed, whence he never roſe; a violent fever for ever deprived me of him in leſs than a week. O horrible remembrance! Oh moſt unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate father!</p>
               <p>His unhappy mother, a witneſs of the violent emotions of her ſon, ſeemed equally ſtruck; her reaſon became diſordered, in a few hours ſhe loſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Supreme! whoſe heavy hand has fallen upon me! deign, at leaſt, from the bottom of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſs in which thy wrath has plunged me, deign to hear the cries of my deſpair! The voice of the oppreſſed can reach thee, and never haſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected his prayer. I aſpire not to happineſs, that is for ever loſt; 'tis vengeance I aſk, 'tis juſtice I implore. May the perfidious wretch, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal arts have robbed me of my wife and ſon, loſe at once fortune and favour. He is a father; let him weep bitterneſs like me, and may he, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, be unhappy in his ſon!</p>

The Hermit ſtopped, he ſaw Don Ramirez look wildly round, and riſe from his ſeat. You tremble, ſaid he; my exceſs of hatred, and deſire of revenge, has made you afraid of hearing the remainder of my ſtory; but fear not, I have nothing farther of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic to tell. Heaven converted my heart; I ſoon abhorred the revenge which religion condemns.</p>
            <p>Don Ramirez again moved, without anſwering; and, after a few minutes, aſtoniſhment and terror made him motionleſs; then ſuddenly ſtarting—Where am I! cried he, in what aſylum!</p>
            <p>What is the meaning, ſir, ſaid the Hermit, of that fearful agitation in which I ſee you? What impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence have I been guilty of; Is my perſecutor known to you? Is he your friend?</p>
            <p>This Perſecutor! this Barbarian! this Monſter! was Ramirez!</p>
            <p>It was, ſir, I confeſs it; he was the author of all my miſery.</p>
            <p>This Ramirez! this—</p>
            <p>Repeat not that dreadful name, ſir; I ſhudder when I hear it.</p>
            <p>Unhappy Alvarez! Learn, at least, heaven has puniſhed your enemy.</p>
            <p>What ſay you? Does he no longer govern Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal?</p>
            <p>Ruined, ſtripped, without relations, without friends; he has little left but vain regret, and never-ending remorſe.</p>
            <p>Does he ſuffer! I am ſorry!</p>
            <p>Sorry! Is it poſſible?</p>

               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:020385_0034_0FAF01DB11651C18"/>
Doubt it not. But wherefore do you weep, ſir? What ray of light breaks upon my mind? Oh God! Can it be?</p>
            <p>Yes!—I am that wretch, cried Don Ramirez, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf at the Hermit's feet, who, penetrated with involuntary horror, drew back. Oh! reverend father; continued Don Ramirez, following on his knees, and ſeizing his veſt, Stop, hear me, holy man! I own I have merited thy hatred; no words can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the horror with which my preſence ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire thee, but remember I now an unfortunate. And yet I have a ſon, who might conſole, might—Oh! ceaſe, holy father! to curſe me! Ceaſe to pray my ſon may make me more miſerable!</p>
            <p>Oh God! cried the Hermit; Don Ramirez! in this place! beneath this poor roof! a ſuppliant at my feet, and giving me the ſacred title of father! a title formerly my greateſt glory and my bliſs! a title which he robbed me of!—<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Yet—fear nothing, ſaid he, caſting a look of compaſſion on Don Rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez; I again repeat it, hatred has long been baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this boſom.

            <p>Oh! greatneſs of ſoul, which confounds me! ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Don Ramirez Can man then elevate his ſoul to ſo ſublime a degree of virtue?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:020385_0035_0FAF01DBDF6FFD28"/>
No, Ramirez, anſwered the Hermit; ſeek not for that generoſity in the heart of man, which is not in nature; admire not the feeble Alvarez, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and adore the high hand of heaven.</p>
            <p>Thus ſaying, he held out his arms, and advanced to embrace Don Ramirez, whoſe tears bedewed the boſom of the virtuous man; that boſom, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he had ſo cruelly torn.</p>
            <p>A quarter of an hour after this reconciliation, Alphonſo returned to the Hermitage. Don Rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez took his leave of the Hermit, and quitted the mountain, bearing with him remorſe the moſt griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and apprehenſions the moſt fearful; he could not remove from his mind, the malediction ſo ſolemnly pronounced againſt him by Alvarez; he ſaw its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect already in the loſs of his fortune; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the generous pardon he had received, he felt himſelf too guilty not to dread the wrath of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and its injuſtice towards the injured Alvarez. Alas! cried Ramirez, in his height of anguiſh, he remitted vengeance to the arm of God! Such ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance muſt be terrible! Oh my ſon! tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Full of theſe melancholy thoughts, Don Ramirez became abſent, ſilent, and gloomy; often as he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his ſon, would the tears ruſh to his eyes: a vague dread would come over him, and an inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble terror ſeize his heart. He no longer felt the happineſs of being a father.</p>
            <p>

They left Catalonia, after having viſited Tarrago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na and Tortoſa (6), and went to Madrid, where Alphonſo vainly hoped once more to meet Dalinda. He learnt, however, from the deſcription he gave of her, ſhe had been there; that her father was a Swede, his name Theliſmar; that he intended to remain ſome time in Spain, and that he had then taken the route to Grenada.</p>
            <p>This intelligence, which he had been careful to procure unknown to his father, gave him an ardent deſire to go to Grenada; and Don Ramirez, who every where carried his inquietude with him, readily conſented to leave Madrid ſooner than he had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>They went firſt to Toledo, where they ſaw the Alcazar, or ancient Mooriſh Palace<note n="*" place="bottom">There is alſo an Alcazar or Moriſcan Palace at Seville, but not ſo beautiful as that of Toledo.</note>; the architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of which, is a mixture of the Roman, Gothic, and Moriſcan. What they moſt admired in this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, was a hoſpital for the poor of the city and it's environs, eſtabliſhed by the Archbiſhop of Toledo. This hoſpital contains manufactories and drawing-ſchools. They educate about two hundred children, to whom they give a habit of labour, and a love of virtue. Old men and women likewiſe find an aſylum in this ancient palace, thus conſecrated by religion to ſuffering humanity (7).</p>
            <p>After a ſhort ſtay at Toledo, our travellers went to Cordova, in their route to wich they croſſed the Sierra-Morena

            <p>Cordova is built upon the borders of the Guadal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivir, and is overlooked by a chain of mountains, continually covered with verdure, which are a part of the Sierra-Morena.

            <p>Don Ramirez ſtaid three days at Cordova, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his journey. Alphonſo ſaw not the walls of Grenada without emotion (10); he flattered himſelf he ſhould find Dalinda in that city, but he did not long preſerve that hope. Notwithſtanding the cares of love, he was forcibly ſtruck with the delightful ſituation of Grenada, the beauty of it's buildings (11), and the antique and curious monuments, the remains of which, at every ſtep, recall the remembrance of Mooriſh magnificence. Alphonſo viſited, with rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Alhambra and Generalif, and amuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in places full of inſcriptions and verſes, which retraced to his memory the ancient gallantry of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada's Kings, the Misfortune's of the Abencerages, the perſecutions and triumphs of a virtuous Queen (12), and all the marvellous adventures with which hiſtory and romance abound.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:020385_0038_0FAF01DF988E58B0"/>
Alphonſo, however, more and more uneaſy about Dalinda and her father, ſoon learnt they had left Grenada almoſt a fortnight, and were gone to Cadiz; and that they talked of ſtaying there ſix weeks, and afterwards of embarking for the coaſt of Africa. This news afflicted him much; he endeavoured not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade his father to go thither, for Don Ramirez had declared Grenada ſhould be the laſt place he would wander to, and that he would afterwards return to Portugal.</p>
            <p>The deſire of travelling, of finding Dalinda, the hope of making a great fortune, ambition, love, and eſpecially pride, idleneſs, and curioſity, inſpired the culpable Alphonſo, with the imprudent and cruel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of ſecretly flying to Cadiz, and abandoning his father. He felt great uneaſineſs in coming to this determination, but he ſuppreſſed ſuch ſalutary remorſe which he could not help feeling, and employed all his powers to find ſpecious reaſons that might excuſe, and even dignify this criminal act.</p>
            <p>My father, ſaid he, has loſt his fortune; he has only a ſmall penſion, not ſufficient for both of us; in taking half his expence away, I ſhall double his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. I feel I am a charge to him; I even perceive my company is not ſo agreeable to him as formerly; he is become penſive and ſilent, my converſation fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, and my preſence lays him under reſtraint. Beſides, in ſeeking to diſtinguiſh myſelf, and emerge from obſcurity, is it not for him I labour? If I can procure wealth, to him ſhall it be dedicated. My abſence may give him ſome uneaſineſs for a time, but my return will enſure his felicity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:020385_0039_0FAF01E07A576108"/>
Such were the reflections of Alphonſo, who ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed while thus he reaſoned, and his cheeks were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with tears. Had he conſulted his heart, duty, honour, and reaſon would ſoon have reſumed their functions; but he endeavoured to deceive himſelf, and he ſucceeded; without the power, however, of total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtifling the voice of conſcience.</p>
            <p>He had taken care to ſeduce one of the ſervants into his deſign, and had conſulted with him on the means of flight. It was agreed that Alphonſo ſhould go off in the evening; that the ſervant ſhould wait for him at the city gate with two horſes, on which they ſhould ride without ſtopping as far as Loxe, to which place the ſervant knew the road.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo had no money. Certain jewels which he happened to have about him on the day of the earthquake had been ſaved, all of which his father ſold, except two diamond rings wich he had given his ſon. One of theſe Alphonſo privately ſold for four hundred piaſtres (about ſeventy guineas) which he thought a ſum ſufficient to make the tour of the world, if he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>The day fixed for his flight he pretended a violent head-ache, in order to conceal his own anxiety, and induce Don Ramirez to go betimes to bed. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, about eight o'clock, his father retired. Alphonſo's heart was ready to burſt when he bade him good night, and he ran, and ſhut himſelf in his chamber, whither he was purſued by his remorſe.</p>
            <p>Bathed in tears, he wrote to his father, to inform him of the motive of his flight, without mentioning what route he ſhould take, or his paſſion for Dalinda.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:020385_0040_0FAF01E11F019770"/>
He ſealed the letter, and left it on the table, that his father might find it on the morrow; then wrapping himſelf in a countryman's cloak, he put on thick-ſoled clouted ſhoes, took a ſtaff in his hand, with his purſe, and a pocket-book that contained his other ring, and Dalinda's ſaſh properly concealed, opened a window, leaped into a court-yard, and went out of a private door, of which he had procured the key. He paſſed haſtily along the ſtreets, got through the city gate by means of his country diſguiſe, found his ſervant waiting a little way out of town, mounted his horſe, followed his guide, and proceeded towards Cadiz.</p>
            <p>The darkneſs of the night would not permit him to travel as faſt as he wiſhed, while the fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purſued, the grief of leaving his father, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude, remorſe, and repentance, all ſtung him to the heart, and inſpired him with a certain inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable terror, which was doubly increaſed by the blackneſs of the night.</p>
            <p>He had quitted Grenada about two hours, when he was awakened from his gloomy reverie by a moſt ſurpriſing phaenomenon: ſurrounded as it were by the deep, the profound obſcurity of night, darkneſs in an inſtant diſappeared, and light the moſt radiant, dazzled the aſtoniſhed eyes of Alphonſo. He raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his head amazed, and beheld a globe of bright and ſhining fire in the heavens, precipitating itſelf ſomewhat horizontally towards the earth, and augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it fell. It exhibited a thouſand dazzling co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and left a long train of light that marked its path in the atmoſphere. Having traverſed a part of
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:020385_0041_0FAF01E1D5957B70"/>
the horizon, it began to riſe again by degrees, and ſhot forth on all ſides ſparks, and blazing ſheaves, that ſeemed like vaſt artificial fire-works. At length the enormous ball opened, and ſent forth two kind of volcanos, which formed themſelves into two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious rainbows, the one of which vaniſhed in the north, the other in the ſouth; the fiery globe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came extinct, and the moſt impenetrable darkneſs inſtantly ſucceeded to day-light the moſt fervent (13).</p>
            <p>Alphonſo was forcibly and irreſiſtibly alarmed by this prodigy. All uncommon accidents are ill omens to a troubled conſcience. This was highly ſo to him; his grief and doubts were doubled, he increaſed his pace to get rid of his fears, and galloped the reſt of the night without ſtopping.</p>
            <p>At day-break his Valet perceived they had loſt their way, and had ſtruck into a croſs road. Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo looked round, and ſaw a barren mountaneous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try covered with rocks. Unable to diſcover any beaten track, he alighted, tied his horſe to a tree, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by his Valet, went towards one of the higheſt and neareſt rocks, hoping to diſcover from its ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the town of Loxe, from which he imagined they could not be far diſtant.</p>
            <p>Obſerve his country ſhoes were clouted with hob-nails all over; and his ſtaff, being a peaſant's, had a thick iron ferrule at the end.</p>
            <p>Scarcely had Alphonſo proceeded twenty paces upon the rock he meant to aſcend, when he felt his feet fixed to the ſtone! he could not lift! he could not ſtir them! and his ſtaff, too heavy to move,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:020385_0042_0FAF01E297B1B450"/>
ſtood upright, and ſeemed to take root on this fatal rock (14)!</p>
            <p>Oh, my father! cried he, heaven has undertaken to puniſh my ingratitude by a new, an unheard of miracle.</p>
            <p>He could ſay no more. Remorſe, aſtoniſhment, terror overwhelmed him; took away what little ſtrength he had left, made him immoveable and mute, cauſed his hair to ſtand erect, and ſpread a death-like paleneſs upon his cheeks.</p>
            <p>Oh dear mamma! cried Pulcheria, is he changed to a ſtatue?</p>
            <p>Not entirely, anſwered Madame de Clémire, ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; though he himſelf dreaded he was, for that i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea ſtruck him as well as you.</p>
            <p>And well it might, mamma. That invincible power that fixed him to the rock, might make him expect worſe.</p>
            <p>However, my dear, that invincible power was not ſupernatural. You remember I told you, the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly marvellous in my ſtory ſhould all be true.</p>
            <p>And yet the globe of fire, and the fatal rock, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo extraordinary! But tell us, dear mamma, what became of poor Alphonſo.</p>
            <p>He remained petrified with terror in the ſituation I have deſcribed, when the ſky became covered with clouds, the winds howled in the air, and the rain began to ſhower. But how was the terror, how was the horror of Alphonſo increaſed, when he beheld that dreadful rain! When he ſaw, what he thought millions of huge round drops of blood, inſtantly cover the white rocks that ſurrounded him; felt them
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:020385_0043_0FAF01E34F26B538"/>
run in ſtreams from his face, hands, and all parts of his body, and viewed rivers of blood deſcend on all ſides to the green vallies (15)!</p>
            <p>Uncommon terror gave uncommon ſtrength. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo quitted his ſtaff, which remained erect, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the rock, and with violent efforts wrenched his feet from the adheſive ſtone, and fell almoſt ſenſeleſs on the ſand.</p>
            <p>His Valet ſoon after, ſhocked with the miraculous ſhower, came running, and aſſiſted his maſter. He had been ſeeking a track which he had diſcovered, and, as ſoon as they could ſufficiently recover their ſtrength and recollection, they once more mounted their horſes, and left this ſcene of horrors.</p>
            <p>Arrived at Loxe, he ſtaid two or three hours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, then ordered mules and a guide, and purſued his journey. He croſſed Mount Oreſpeda (16), paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ancient city of Antequerra, and did not ſtop till he came to Malaga. He arrived without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable accident at Cadiz<note n="*" place="bottom">In going to Cadiz, it is neceſſary to take a boat at Port Sancta-Maria, a pretty town two leagues from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz. The paſſage is dangerous, and the boats are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently loſt.</note> and put up at the firſt inn he came to.</p>
            <p>As he was going up ſtairs he heard a female ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and accompanied by the harp. Alphonſo trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and guided by the ſound, approached the door of the appartment whence it iſſued. It was ſure an Angel ſinging, and the harmony was heavenly! He could not miſtake the voice, it went to his heart. Delighted, raviſhed, aſtoniſhed, he haſtily deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:020385_0044_0FAF01E4389BAF18"/>
the ſtairs, enquired for the maſter of the houſe, queſtioned him, and learnt his heart had not deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. Dalinda and Theliſmar inhabited the houſe whither he had been conducted by chance.</p>
            <p>Tranſported with the diſcovery he went into the court-yard, was ſhewn which were the windows of his Love, and then went and locked himſelf in his own room, that he might enjoy his unexpected feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city without reſtraint.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon he ſent for a guittar, and in the evening, after ſupper, planting himſelf under Dalin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's window, with a trembling hand he ventured to ſtrike a few arpeggios. The window opened, and fearing to be overheard by Theliſmar, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Portugueze, Alphonſo durſt not ſing the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he had written on Dalinda at the Fountain of Love; but, in timid accents, and an irreſolute voice, he ſang the Torments of Abſence.</p>
            <p>In about a quarter of an hour the window was ſhut, and on the morrow Alphonſo again began to ſing, but in vain, it opened no more: and this rigour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted him as deeply, as though it had deſtroyed hopes that had ſome foundation.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo formed a thouſand projects relative to his paſſion, and executed none of them. He ardently longed once more to ſee Dalinda, but never could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to preſent himſelf as an adventurer. His intention, when he left his father, was to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a companion to Theliſmar during his travels, not doubting but his knowledge and talents would make this propoſition very acceptable; and ſuppoſing
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:020385_0045_0FAF01E4FB021440"/>
likewiſe that gratitude, for having ſaved the life of Dalinda, would put his reception out of doubt.</p>
            <p>When paſſion forms projects, it is blind to all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, will hear no objections; but fearing all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which may deter it from what it is previouſly determined to do, it never diſcovers it's own folly and imprudence till they are paſt remedy.</p>
            <p>Full of fear, incertitude, and heſitation, Alphonſo could reſolve upon nothing. He had carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed himſelf from Dalinda and her father, when one night he was informed that Theliſmar had prepared every thing for his departure, and that he was to go on board the <hi>Intrepid</hi> at break of day, which veſſel was to carry him to C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This intelligence determined the irreſolute Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; he ſold his remaining ring, went to the captain of the ſhip, obtained his paſſage, got on board before day-break, and took poſſeſſion of his little cabin. He had not been there a quarter of an hour, before he heard the voice of Theliſmar, and preſently afterwards the anchor was weighed, and the veſſel ſet ſail.</p>
            <p>Before dinner-time, when the paſſengers muſt meet at the captain's table, Alphonſo collected force enough to deſire a moment's audience of Theliſmar, which was immediately granted; and with an anxiety and agitation impoſſible to paint he entered the cabin. Theliſmar was alone, and turning his head at the creaking of the door, he beheld Alphonſo. He could
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:020385_0046_0FAF01E590657AB0"/>
not forget the deliverer of his daughter; he inſtantly roſe, ran to Alphonſo, and embraced him with all the warmth of the moſt tender friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Tranſported with joy, Alphonſo felt hope ſpring in his heart! He anſwered the queſtions of Theliſmar, however, with more embaraſſment than truth. Afraid to confeſs his faults, my father, ſaid he, had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an immenſe fortune; but now, with barely what is neceſſary, he lives retired on the peaceful banks of the Mondego. He approves my deſire to travel, and hopes, with the education he has beſtowed on me, I may become known, and acquire fame, and—</p>

            <p>You were not deceived in me; I mean to traverſe a great part of the known world; if you will be the aſſociate of my labours, I joyfully conſent.</p>
            <p>Here Alphonſo, at the height of his hopes, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Theliſmar with tranſport, and ſwore never to forſake him.</p>

ſhew a part of my gratitude. Dalinda owes her life to you, and your empire over me is abſolute.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo bluſhed at the name of Dalinda, and too much affected to reply, was ſilent.</p>
            <p>I have need, added Theliſmar, of conſolation, and hope to find it in your friendſhip.</p>
            <p>Of conſolation! Are you then unhappy?</p>
            <p>I am ſeparated, and for four years, from objects the deareſt to my heart! from my wife and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter!</p>
            <p>From Dalinda!</p>
            <p>Yes. I durſt not expoſe her to the fatigues and dangers I ſhall undergo. We travelled through a great part of Europe together, I parted from her at Cadiz, and while we are riding towards the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can coaſt, ſhe is returning with her mother into Sweden.</p>
            <p>Oh heaven! cried Alphonſo in anguiſh; Africa and Sweden! What immenſe! what dreadful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance between her and—you! How I pity you!—</p>
            <p>Alphonſo could no longer reſtrain his tears, and the converſation being interrupted by the entrance of the Captain, Alphonſo went into his cabbin to hide and aſſuage the agitation of his heart In deſpair to think he muſt be four years abſent from Dalinda<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he yet was in ſome meaſure conſoled by the friendſhip of her father, and determined to neglect nothing, by which it might be confirmed and increaſed.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar put ſeveral queſtions to him in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, and aſked if he underſtood the elements of any of the ſciences?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:020385_0048_0FAF01E8E1AF3AE0"/>
Oh yes, anſwered Alphonſo, with great ſelf-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency. There is nothing I have not been taught.</p>
            <p>Do you know any thing of geometry?</p>
            <p>I had a mathematical maſter ten years.</p>
            <p>Have you any acquaintance with natural hiſtory and philoſophy?</p>
            <p>Every thing of that kind is familiar to me: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I am paſſionately fond of the arts, underſtand muſic, and delight in drawing. I draw <hi>flowers</hi> charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>Flowers! Do you love reading?</p>
            <p>Very much.</p>
            <p>Your language is not rich in good authors; but you know the Latin?</p>
            <p>Oh perfectly! as you may imagine, for my teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſaid I conſtrued Virgil and Horace well at ten years old; ſo that I left the ſtudy of the claſſics at twelve, and have not looked at them ſince, having had other employment.</p>
            <p>And I warrant you left mathematics alſo ſoon after?</p>
            <p>I did. I then read generally, and ſoon began to write verſes.</p>
            <p>And from a ſcholar became a wit. The metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis is not always ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>My poetry was very ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>Among your friends, I ſuppoſe.</p>
            <p>Oh univerſally.</p>
            <p>How do you know?</p>
            <p>Every body who viſited my father told me ſo.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo's anſwer made Theliſmar ſmile, and he changed the converſation. Preſently afterwards the
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:020385_0049_0FAF01E952593C30"/>
youth retired, perſuaded he had given Theliſmar a high opinion of his knowledge and genius. The next day Alphonſo recollected the adventure of the mad bull, killed by the prick of a pin, at the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Love, and aſked Theliſmar the meaning of ſo extraordinary a death.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar replied, he had that very day received from an old friend juſt returned from America, a poiſon, ſo powerful and ſubtle, as to produce the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of which he had been a witneſs; that this friend had given him a caſe, which encloſed the fatal pin that had been dipped in the poiſon, and deſigning to make an experiment of its power, he happened to have it in his pocket (17).</p>
            <p>But what ſurpriſes me, ſaid Alphonſo, is, that I have never heard ſpeak of this poiſon.</p>
            <p>I do not think that ſo very ſurpriſing, replied Theliſmar; for, if I am not miſtaken, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other extraordinary things of which you have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard.</p>
            <p>I will not ſay there are none, anſwered Alphonſo, but I dare preſume their number is very limited; for I have had teachers of all forts, and am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; add to which, I have read much, and ſeen and remarked more.</p>
            <p>What prompted Alphonſo to brag with greater confidence was, he ſuppoſed he might do ſo without danger of detection; he looked upon Theliſmar as a plain man, who had only one purſuit, that of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany, and imagined him to be exceedingly ignorant of every thing elſe; in which he was frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:020385_0050_0FAF01EA1F70C078"/>
by the natural reſerve and modeſty of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar.</p>
            <p>Here Madame de Clémire ſtopped, put up her manuſcript, and ended that evening's entertainment.</p>
            <p>The next night, at the uſual hour, after having begged her children not to interrupt her any more by their queſtions, Madame de Clémire thus continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her narration.</p>
            <p>At length they landed at Ceuta, and Theliſmar hired a lodging for himſelf and Alphonſo, at one of the beſt houſes they could find.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo's firſt care on his arrival, was to write to his father a long letter, very contrite and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive. In this he made a faithful confeſſion of all his proceedings, implored his pardon, and permiſſion to follow Theliſmar in all his travels; and as the latter intended to ſtay at Ceuta long enough for Alphonſo to receive an anſwer, he conjured Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirez to fend his orders inſtantly, promiſing they ſhould be obeyed, be they what they might. Not doubting his father had returned to Beira, his letter was directed accordingly.</p>
            <p>Something eaſier, after thus in part relieving his conſcience, Alphonſo fell into his cuſtomary habits, ſung, played on his guittar, and drew various flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which he thought maſter-pieces, and which he conſtantly carried to Theliſmar, who, he continued to believe, was highly delighted with his talents.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar ſent for him one morning, and ſaid, as I know you are exceedingly fond of muſic and drawing, I thought I might do you a favour, by bringing you to ſee two very extraordinary children.
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:020385_0051_0FAF01EAD6DF4920"/>
One is a little boy, who draws aſtoniſhingly in your ſtyle, and the other a girl, who plays charmingly on the harpſichord; come and ſee them.</p>
            <p>So ſaying, he conducted Alphonſo into another room, but desired him to ſtop at the door; for, ſaid he, youth you know is timid; and as you are a connoiſſeur, you might diſturb them were you too near.</p>
            <p>Very true, anſwered Alphonſo; the girl bluſhed as we entered.</p>
            <p>And can you then obſerve her emotion, added The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar?</p>
            <p>Oh very plainly; ſhe can hardly breathe, tho' her boſom heaves.</p>
            <p>All this paſſed at the far end of the room from the young artiſts, and Alphonſo, happy in the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own repute, encouraged the muſician as ſhe played, calling out <hi>bravo! bravo!</hi> with as much pedantry and pride as any other demi-connoiſſeur, who ſuppoſes a word like that from him confers fame and ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>When ſhe had finiſhed her ſonata, the little muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian made a low courtſey; Alphonſo applauded, and Theliſmar advanced.</p>
            <p>Come, ſaid he, now let us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee the boy draw—ſtand there, behind him, and then you will overlook his work with more eaſe. Alphonſo followed his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and remarked, it was odd enough the child ſhould keep his gloves on, and ſurpriſing enough that he ſhould deſign from his own invention, without any drawing to copy from.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:020385_0052_0FAF01EC152B8288"/>
And yet, ſaid Theliſmar, ſee how that flower gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, as it were, and is embelliſhed beneath his fingers.</p>
            <p>Wonderful! cried Alphonſo; aſtoniſhingly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect! Courage, my little fellow! There, ſhade that outline a little; that's it! The little angel! I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare I could not do better myſelf.</p>
            <p>All theſe praiſes gave no diſturbance to the child, who continued his work without remiſſion, except removing it, to obſerve it at a diſtance occaſionally, and blowing away the light duſt of the crayon.</p>
            <p>When the flower was finiſhed, Alphonſo ran di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to kiſs the child, and as ſuddenly ſtarted back with an interjection of aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>Gently, ſaid Theliſmar, laughing, take care leſt you ſhould demoliſh the young artiſt.</p>
            <p>Good heaven! It's a doll! a figure!</p>
            <p>It is an automaton<note n="*" place="bottom">Every body at Paris, in 1783, ſaw the Automatons, of which this is a deſcription. Another has ſince been ſhewn ſtill more remarkable, for it plays at cheſs with any perſon.</note>.</p>
            <p>And the muſician, what is ſhe?</p>
            <p>Own ſiſter to the deſigner.</p>
            <p>But did I not ſee her breathe?</p>
            <p>You thought ſo; and you really ſaw her play with her ſingers upon the harpſichord. Hence you may learn, Alphonſo, that it is unreaſonable to place too high a value upon accompliſhments which automatons may poſſeſs.</p>
            <p>I will break my guittar directly, and burn my drawings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:020385_0053_0FAF01ECFAE68D60"/>
That would be wrong, anſwered Theliſmar. We ſhould be aſtoniſhed to ſee a man paſs his life in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the guittar, and deſigning flowers; but no one would blame you, when you uſe ſuch things only as recreations, by way of agreeably ſaving time which would otherwiſe be loſt, and without being proud of ſuch trifling accompliſhments.</p>
            <p>This leſſon made ſome impreſſion upon Alphonſo; but it was neceſſary he ſhould receive many more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a thorough reformation could be effected.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar was ready to depart from Ceuta, yet Alphonſo had received no letters from his father: imagining, therefore, that Don Ramirez approved his projects, by his not being in any haſte to recall him home, he determined to proceed with Theliſmar.</p>
            <p>Some days previous to their departure for the Azore Iſlands, Alphonſo, who had obſerved workmen buſy about raiſing a kind of machine in the garden, the uſe of which he did not comprehend, learnt that it was done by the order, and under the direction of Thel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſmar, of whom he therefore enquired its uſe. The proprietor of this houſe has told me, ſaid Theliſmar, that the lightning has twice, within theſe twenty years, fallen upon, and damaged the building, and I have promiſed him it ſhall do ſo no more.</p>
            <p>And which way can you prevent it?</p>
            <p>By means of the thing you have ſeen.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I do not comprehend.</p>
            <p>That I can readily believe; and yet it is not the leſs true, that the lightning will now fall at the other end of the garden.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:020385_0054_0FAF01ED1D61A310"/>
Four or five days after, there was a violent thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorm; Theliſmar went to the window, and pointing with his cane towards a black cloud, which was ſeen over the houſe, look, ſaid he, to Alphonſo, at that cloud, it is going ſoon to remove from us, and follow the path which I ſhall direct: I intend that it ſhall open, and be diſperſed at the end of that walk; ſo ſaying, Theliſmar raiſed his cane towards the ſky, while the cloud ſeemed obedient to his will, and durſt not depart from the path which he preſcribed in the air; at that inſtant he had the appearance of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter, who, by the power of his magic wand, commanded the elements.</p>
            <p>Good God! cried Alphonſo, what do I behold! You direct the clouds, and they obey, they go to the ſpot that you ordain.</p>
            <p>You ſee them aſſembled, ſaid Theliſmar, and now they ſhall deſcend, and the lightning ſhall fall not thirty feet from yonder ſpot. Scarcely had he ſpoken, before the thunder began to roar, and its bolts were diſcharged exactly as Theliſmar preſcribed (18); who then ſhut his window, and went out of his room, leaving Alphonſo petrified with aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>The next day Theliſmar, in preſence of Alphonſo, read aloud a letter he had received from Dalinda. Alphonſo had by this time learnt the Swediſh language, to the ſtudy of which he had applied with great aſſiduity, ever ſince he had firſt been told Dalinda was a Swede; and ſince he had travelled with Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, his progreſs in that language had been aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He was enchanted at the letter of Dalinda, and could not repreſs his feelings while he heard it read;
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:020385_0055_0FAF01EDD66FBA88"/>
he found an inconceivable delight in underſtanding words traced by the hand of Dalinda; he heard the ingenuous detail of her thoughts and ſentiments, and imagined he heard her ſpeaking; he obtained a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the goodneſs of her heart and underſtanding, and that knowledge fixed for ever in the boſom of Alphonſo the moſt inconſtant of all the paſſions.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo was very deſirous of having the letter in his own poſſeſſion, and ſeeing Dalinda's writing; but Theliſmar, after having read, put it in the drawer of his bureau. Alphonſo, with his eyes fixed upon this drawer, heard no longer the diſcourſe of Theliſmar, but fell into a profound muſing; Theliſmar therefore took up a book, and Alphonſo recollecting himſelf, left the room.</p>
            <p>In the evening Alphonſo returned to the ſame chamber, and Theliſmar riſing as he ſaw him enter, ſaid, As you know we ſhall embark to-morrow morning for the Azores<note n="*" place="bottom">The Azore Iſlands are ſituated between Africa and America, about two hundred leagues from Liſbon. Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zallo Vello firſt diſcovered them about the middle of the fifteenth century, and called them Azores, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Hawks, from the number of thoſe birds he ſaw there. They are nine in number; the town of Angra, in the Iſland of Tercera, is the capital.</note>, I have various orders to give; if you will ſtay here I ſhall be back in half an hour. So ſaying, he left Alphonſo ſitting oppoſite the bureau.</p>
            <p>This bureau encloſed the letter of Dalinda, and the key was not taken out of the drawer: Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo felt a temptation, which at firſt he did not give
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:020385_0056_0FAF01F010B62708"/>
way to; he paſſionately deſired to open the drawer, and once more read the letter. He felt how much ſuch an action was to be condemned, and yet, ſaid he, this is not to pry into the ſecrets of Theliſmar; he has read me the letter, I ſhall learn nothing new; I only wiſh to ſee, to contemplate the writing.</p>
            <p>At laſt, after various ſtruggles, Alphonſo ſtifled his ſcruples, approached the bureau, and tremblingly took hold of the key; but ſcarcely had he touched it, before he received a ſtroke ſo violent that he thought his arm was broken Alphonſo terrified, ſtarted back, and fell into an arm chair. Juſt heaven! cried he, what inviſible hand is it that ſtrikes (19)?</p>
            <p>The door opened, and Theliſmar appeared; what have you done Alphonſo! ſaid he, with a ſevere tone of voice.</p>
            <p>Oh, ſir, replied Alphonſo, you, whoſe ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral art produces ſo many prodigies, you ſurely have the power to penetrate my moſt ſecret thoughts, read them at the bottom of my heart.</p>
            <p>I can read nothing there, anſwered Theliſmar, that can excuſe an act like this. Remember Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo, to betray a truſt is unpardonable, and that a ſecond fault of this kind would for ever deprive you of my eſteem. As for the myſterious key, cried Theliſmar, it is only hoſtile to indiſcretion; it ſtrikes none but thoſe who would turn it without my leave. I now give you my permiſſion to open the drawer, which you may do without danger.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo advanced, as he was deſired, towards the bureau, opened the drawer, and cried, yes, Theliſmar, I ſee that nothing is impoſſible to you;
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:020385_0057_0FAF01F0F0E1A818"/>
your diſcourſe is full of wiſdom, and your actions of aſtoniſhment: deign ſir, ever to be my guide, my tutelar genius! My ſubmiſſion, affection, and gratitude, will, I hope, render me worthy of your cares. So ſaying, Alphonſo, with a tender and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir, drew near to Theliſmar, who only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him by holding out his arms, and embracing him with affection.</p>
            <p>The next day, after this adventure, Theliſmar and his young travelling companion embarked for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zores. After a happy voyage, they landed at the iſland of St. George<note n="*" place="bottom">Twelve leagues from Angra.</note>, where they reſted for ſome days.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar lodged in a ſmall houſe, the aſpect of which pleaſed him; the owner was a Swede, who had been ſix years in the iſland. As they had only one agreeable apartment, Theliſmar partook his bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with Alphonſo, and had a bed made up for him beſide his own. One night as Alphonſo and Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar were in a ſound ſleep, they both awakened, and leaped up at the ſame moment; they imagined they felt the violent ſhock of an earthquake, and fled into a ſmall garden, whither the maſter of the houſe, and ſeveral ſervants, who had likewiſe experienced the ſame ſenſation, ran for refuge; the latter brought flambeaux, for the darkneſs of the night was extreme; and in expectation of a diſaſter, like that of Liſbon, they remained there in great anxiety for the ſpace of three hours; not having, however, felt the leaſt emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion during this whole time, they determined then to
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:020385_0058_0FAF01F1DE0F2120"/>
return again to the houſe. Theliſmar and Alphonſo did not go to bed, but converſed till day-break.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo, who now no longer hid the name of his father from Theliſmar, and who had often related to him the circumſtances of the earthquake at Liſbon, did not let this occaſion ſlip; but again gave a pompous deſcription of the magnificent palace of Don Rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez, and an emphatic enumeration of the jewels and diamonds he poſſeſſed before that cataſtrophe.</p>
            <p>When day began to appear, Theliſmar and Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo went to the window, whence they had an extenſive, and moſt unuſual proſpect; how great was their aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, to ſee the houſe they lived in, and the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den totally ſeparated from the land, and forming a ſmall iſland in the midſt of the ſea; they ſhuddered at the danger they had been in, and could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by what means the houſe, which had been thrown ſeveral fathoms from the main land, could ſuſtain ſo violent a ſhock without being deſtroyed. It is no doubt, ſaid Theliſmar, the humble dwelling of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As Theliſmar was ſpeaking, his chamber-door o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and the maſter of the houſe entered. This venerable old man, as he approached Theliſmar, fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Though ſix years an exile from my native land, I have not forgot thoſe men who are an honour to it; your name, ſir, is not unknown to me. Our Monarch is the protector of genius and ſcience; he honours you

with a particular eſteem, and I come to beg you will give me letters of recommendation for my ſon.</p>
            <p>You intend to return into your own country then?</p>
            <p>Yes, ſir.</p>
            <p>What accident firſt brought you out of it?</p>
            <p>I was born in an humble condition: but, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſmallneſs of my income, I found the means to give my ſon a good education, much ſuperior to my rank of life. This ſon anſwered my expectations and cares ſo well, that he obtained by his merit, at five and twenty, an honourable and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crative employment. Some time after he fell in love with an amiable, rich young woman, and was upon the point of marrying her, when a dreadful accident obliged me to quit my country. There was a rich merchant who lodged in my houſe; this unhappy man was found one morning murdered in his bed, and his coffers broken open and robbed; all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were taken into cuſtody; and I, of my own accord, delivered myſelf into the hands of juſtice. The wretch who had committed the crime was my accuſer; I had enemies, and the affair took an ill turn. Thanks, however, to the cares and protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of my ſon, as they had not ſufficient proof, I obtained my liberty: but I could not recover my character, I could not endure to live with ignominy, in a land where I had been generally beloved, and determined to become a voluntary exile. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to conceal my intentions from my ſon; but he gueſſed them too certainly from my prepa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

night; I regretted only the loſs of my ſon. I left him, however, in poſſeſſion of a good poſt; and knew that, notwithſtanding our misfortunes, the young woman whom he loved ſtill preſerved her firſt affection. Conſoled by ſuch ideas, I endeavoured to ſupport the exceſs of my misfortunes. I travelled in a poſt-chaiſe, and at day-break perceived myſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcorted, as it were, by a ſtranger galloping on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back at ſome diſtance from my carriage; I looked out—but what was my ſurprize at the ſight of my ſon; it is impoſſible to expreſs what I felt; I ſtopt, jumped out of my carriage, and was inſtantly in my ſon's arms.

            <p>It was my intention here to have ended my days; but the intelligence which I received about two months ſince, has made me change this reſolution. My in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence at length is fully acknowledged; the monſter, who had been guilty of the murder, having commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted new crimes, was apprehended and condemned. Before his death he publicly acquitted me, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing himſelf to be the murderer. We learnt at the ſame time, the young lady my ſon loved was ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married. This has made me wiſh once more to return
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:020385_0062_0FAF01F4C9B6C930"/>
to my native land. We intended to have departed in half a year; but the diſaſter of laſt night, and the loſs of my houſe, which, though not deſtroyed, is no longer habitable, muſt haſten my departure. It is therefore I come to aſk recommendatory letters of you, ſir.</p>
            <p>I will give them you with pleaſure, anſwered The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar, with emotion, and ſuch as I would give a dear friend or brother. Oh, yes; doubt not but our juſt and beneficent ſovereign will worthily reward the virtue of your ſon.</p>
            <p>Oh, ſir! cried the old man, with tears of joy in his eyes, permit me to bring him hither that he may thank you himſelf.</p>
            <p>So ſaying, he went out without waiting for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and Theliſmar turning towards Alphonſo, ſaw him mournfully leaning over a chair, and covering his face with his hands. Theliſmar perceived he was weeping; wherefore, ſaid he, would you hide your tears from me? Let them flow freely, they are an honour to your heart.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar was miſtaken: he attributed thoſe tears to compaſſion, which repentance and bitter remorſe made flow. How criminal did Alphonſo feel, when he compared his own conduct with that of the young man whoſe hiſtory he had juſt heard. This touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recital had torn his very heart, and made painful and afflictive the ſweeteſt of all ſenſations, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of virtue.</p>
            <p>The old man returned, leading his ſon by the hand; Theliſmar claſped the young man to his breaſt;
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:020385_0063_0FAF01F749A5D170"/>
renewed the promiſes he had made his father, and diſmiſſed them, penetrated with gratitude and joy.</p>
            <p>Several inhabitants of the iſland ſoon arrived in light boats, to inquire the fate of thoſe who inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſmall houſe, which they had ſeen ſo ſuddenly thrown, as it were, into the ſea; they told Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, that all the neighbouring houſes had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, while that belonging to Zulaſki (for that was the name of the virtuous young man) had been thus miraculouſly preſerved.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar and Alphonſo went on board the boats, and deſired to be conducted towards that part of the iſland which had ſuffered leaſt from the earthquake. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>arce had they made a quarter of a league, before they were petrified with aſtoniſhment, at beholding eighteen iſlands newly riſen from the bottom of the ocean (20).</p>
            <p>Ye new creations of a juſt and beneficent God! cried Theliſmar; ye new born iſles, how does your aſpect move my heart! Human induſtry will ſoon make you fertile. Oh, may you never be inhabited but by the virtuous!</p>
            <p>After having coaſted along ſome of the iſlands, Theliſmar landed, and was received in a houſe where Zulaſki came to rejoin him the ſame evening. As Zulaſki embarked on board a veſſel bound for Liſbon, in his return to Sweden, Alphonſo committed two let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to his care; the one for his father, in which was ſet down their route, and the places they meant to ſtop at, earneſtly conjuring him to write, and inform Alphonſo of his will and pleaſure; the other for a young man, who lived in the province of Beira, whom

            <p>Zulaſki, after receiving theſe letters and thoſe of Theliſmar, departed without delay; and a few days after, Theliſmar and Alphonſo embarked for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Iſlands<note n="*" place="bottom">The number of theſe iſlands is ſeven, <hi>Teneriff, Great Canary, Gom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At the time of the conqueſt, about 1417, the Spaniards called the natives Guanches; and the town of Guimar, in the iſland of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriff, is peopled chiefly by the deſcendants of theſe ancient Guanches.</note> and Railejo: nature ſeems there to have aſſembled all ſhe has of pleaſant, uſeful, and majeſtic.

<pb n="66" facs="unknown:020385_0065_0FAF01F8A388F838"/>
ſometimes walking, ſometimes ſitting beneath the ſhade of the plaintain-tree, reading paſſages from O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, or Camoen's Luſiad.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo's imagination full of the agreeable ideas of fable, wiſhed, before he quitted that charming place, to carve four verſes he had juſt written upon the bark of a tree: he, for this purpoſe, went to one much like the pine in appearance, drew his knife, began to cut, and ſaw the blood follow the wound (21); tempted to ſuppoſe he had wounded a nymph, metamorphoſed to a tree, he recoiled with terror, and the murderous weapon dropt from his hand. Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar ſmiled, and encouraged him, by proteſting there was nothing miraculous, nothing wonderful in this ſeeming prodigy.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar paſſed ſome days at Laguna, a large and beautiful town, the houſes of which are moſt of them embelliſhed by parterres and terraces, interſected by immenſe walks of the orange and lemon trees; its fountains, gardens, and groves, its lake and aqueduct, together with the cool winds by which it is refreſhed, render it a delicious habitation.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar paſſed through ſeveral other towns, till he came at laſt to one called Guimar, where are ſtill found many families, the deſcendants of the Guanches, the ancient inhabitants of theſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>es. Theſe people, though they have renounced the idolatry of their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage anceſtors, have yet preſerved much of their wild ſuperſtition, and many of their old cuſtoms.</p>
            <p>One day, as Alphonſo was walking alone by the environs of Guimar, he ſtrayed thoughtleſsly into an unfrequented wood, in which he was ſoon loſt. In
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:020385_0066_0FAF01F9D2991008"/>
ſearching his way out, he got entangled in a thicket, which he could ſcarcely make his way through, and which led to a kind of deſart, without trees, ſhrubs, or verdure, a dry plain covered with ſhells, and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a mountain. As he beheld this diſmal place, he recollected that Theliſmar had more than once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him never to walk in ſtrange places without a guide, but this recollection came too late.</p>
            <p>Night drew on, and Alphonſo walked a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; at laſt, overcome with fatigue, he ſtopt near a hill, ſurrounded with briars, underwood, and huge ſtones, heaped confuſedly on each other. In ſitting down on one of theſe ſtones he deſtroyed the equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium of others, which began to roll with conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble noiſe. Alphonſo ſprang from his ſeat to avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt, and turning round, he obſerved that the ſtones, by being removed, had diſcovered a cavity large enough for a man to enter.</p>
            <p>He again drew near, and looking down the cavity, ſaw, with ſurprize, ſteps like a ſtair-caſe: incited by unconquerable curioſity he entered the ſubterranean grotto, and deſcended by ſteps exceedingly ſteep: when at the bottom he looked upwards, but could no longer ſee the light of day. He was inclined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſcend, had he not perceived a light very diſtinctly at a conſiderable diſtance. The ſight of this determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to accompliſh an enterprize which promiſed ſomething extraordinary, and he purſued his road. He proceeded to a kind of obſcure alley, at the end of which he found a ſpacious cavern, lighted by lamps ſuſpended from the roof. Alphonſo looked round, and ſaw himſelf in the midſt of two hundred dead
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:020385_0067_0FAF01FA97DD8328"/>
bodies, arranged, ſtanding againſt the walls of this dreary vault.</p>
            <p>Into what place of death has my temerity brought me? cried Alphonſo; it ſeems to be the cave of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyphemus, or perhaps a robber, ſtill more inhumane, and the dead here, have no doubt been the victims of his monſtrous cruelty. Well, if I have not the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Ulyſſes, at leaſt I have his valour.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo drew his ſword, and determined to ſell his life dearly; he would not attempt to fly, leſt he ſhould be aſſaulted in the obſcure narrow paſſage; he thought he might more eaſily defend himſelf in the cavern: beſides, he ſuppoſed it certain the aſſaſſins had already cloſed the mouth of the cave. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſilence, however, reigned in the dreary vault, and Alphonſo had time to conſider the diſmal and ſurpriſing objects by which he was environed.</p>
            <p>He remarked, that none of the bodies ſeemed to ſuffer putrefaction, or ſent forth the leaſt ſmell, but that they had all preſerved their features. Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was loſt in theſe reflections, when he thought he heard the trampling of feet; he liſtened attentively, and ſoon diſtinguiſhed the voices of people ſpeaking in an unknown tongue,</p>
            <p>Alphonſo would not begin the combat, on a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that it might not be their intention to attack him, but placed his back againſt the wall, hid his ſword, and was ſilent; he ſoon ſaw twelve men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, walking ſlowly two and two, and cloathed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſtrange faſhion. Their peaceable and grave countenances did not announce any thing inimical; but no ſooner did they ſee Alphonſo, than uttering
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:020385_0068_0FAF01FB57EE6F30"/>
ſhrieks of horror, rage, and indignation blazed in their countenances. They drew the long daggers which they carried at their girdles, and fell inſtantly altogether, on Alphonſo, who, brandiſhing his ſword, received them with intrepidity,</p>
            <p>The combat was obſtinate and bloody; the addreſs and valour of Alphonſo triumphed over numbers, and though alone againſt twelve enraged foes, he was the conqueror. He received two ſlight wounds, but his ſword was mortal to ſome of his adverſaries, and the reſt fled, terrified and howling.</p>
            <p>Once more alone in the cavern, Alphonſo tore his handkerchief, applied it to, and bound it on his wounds with his garter: then cutting with his ſword the thong by which one of the lamps was ſuſpended, he took that lamp, and returned without delay; he again followed the dark alley, arrived at the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, haſtily aſceneded, found the cavity, and leapt from this frightful gulph with tranſport.</p>
            <p>He imagined himſelf leaving the gates of hell, and returning again to life, when he breathed the pure air, and once more beheld the ſtarry heavens. Oh! my father! exclaimed he; Oh! Dalinda! and you dear Theliſmar, ſhall I enjoy the happineſs of ſeeing you once again: you alone make life dear to me, and ſhould I not preſerve it, ſince with life I may perhaps attain what moſt I love?</p>
            <p>It was the decline of day when Alphonſo enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cavern, and near midnight when he left it; guided by the brightneſs of the moon and ſtars, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo fled this fatal cave, and after wandering full three hours, ſtopped, as day began to break, near

               </gap>e thirſt, the ſight of limpid wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rekindled his power and courage; he drank hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and eat of the wild fruits; yet found himſelf afterwards ſo feeble and exhauſted, he could no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er continue his route, but laid down upon the graſs, oppoſite to a mountain covered with verdure, and here and there a tree. He repoſed about three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an hour in this wild and ſolitary place, when the heavens became cloudy, the wind began to riſe, and ſome drops of rain to fall; the rain ſoon ceaſed, but the wind continued with redoubled fury. Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo roſe, looked towards the mountain, and ſaw a ſight that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>illed him with aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>On the ſummit of the mountain he beheld an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous pillar riſe, the colour of which ſeemed gold towards the baſe, and at the top a beautifully deep violet. This pillar deſcended with impetuoſity, from the mountain, breaking and overturning the trees that ſtood in its way, attracting and engulphing leaves and branches, and tearing up ſome by the roots; at the bottom of the mountain it paſſed over a ditch, which it filled with ſtones and earth; its paſſage was marked by deep furrows, and during its dreadful and rapid courſe, it made a noiſe like to the bellowing of a bull.</p>
            <p>The formidable column directed its way towards the Lake, pumping up the water, and leaving the vaſt baſon dry; then turning towards the north, it was loſt in a neighbouring foreſt (22).</p>
            <p>To this phaenomenon ſucceded a deſtructive hail, the ſtones of which were enormouſly large; they
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:020385_0070_0FAF01FCD0886048"/>
ſeemed cut in the form of a ſtar, and were accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with long ſplinters of ice, like the ſharp blades of poinards (23). Alphonſo took refuge under a tree, and preſerved himſelf as well as poſſible with his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>t, which he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ld at ſome diſtance from his head, though he received ſeveral wounds on his hands.</p>
            <p>The tempeſt at length ceaſed, the ſky became calm, and Alphonſo, full of amazement, wounded, bruiſed, famiſhed, and fatigued, once more purſued his ſorrowful way. In about a quarter of an hour, he perceived, with exceſſive joy, a human habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it belonged to a Spaniard, who received him with humanity. Alphonſo informed him he had been attacked by aſſaſſins, and learnt in return, he was not more than two leagues and a half from Guimar.</p>
            <p>Not in a condition to continue his route on foot, he determined to repoſe for a few days, and wrote a letter to Theliſmar, which the Spaniard kindly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to ſend: After which Alphonſo, profiting by the humane offers of his compaſſionate hoſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted food, ſuffered him to dreſs his wounds, and was put into an excellent bed made up for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>After ſleeping three or four hours, he awoke, roſe, and dreſſed himſelf; the firſt perſon he met, at leaving the chamber, was Theliſmar; he ran to his arms, Theliſmar received him with a tenderneſs as ſincere as his heart could wiſh. He was going to begin the recital of his adventures, when Theliſmar interrupted him, by telling him he would hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:020385_0071_0FAF01FEF08FF9F0"/>
thing then, but muſt think only of his cure. A carriage waits for us, ſaid he; come, let us take leave of the generous and hoſpitable Spaniard, and return to Guimar.</p>
            <p>As he ſaid this the Spaniard returned, followed by the meſſenger, who had brought back Alphonſo's letter to Theliſmar; he gave it to Alphonſo, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that Theliſmar had juſt left Guimar as he got there. How then, ſaid Alphonſo to Theliſmar, did you know I was here, if you have not received my letter? Of that I will inform you another time, anſwered Theliſmar, ſmiling; at preſent it is time we ſhould depart.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo turning now towards his hoſt, teſtified the warmeſt gratitude; then mounted the carriage with Theliſmar, and took the road to Guimar. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar would not allow him to exhauſt himſelf with ſpeaking, but as ſoon as they got home, put him to bed, where he ſlept twelve hours, and awoke in perfect health. Theliſmar then deſired an account of what had happened to him. Alphonſo began his recital, with informing Theliſmar the things he had to relate were ſo extraordinary and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, he was afraid they might be thought fabulous; and yet Theliſmar heard the whole hiſtory of the cavern, without ſeeming to ſhew the leaſt ſurpriſe; which did not fail, however, greatly to excite the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Alphonſo, and which he could not re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

in the firſt place, ran the terrible riſk you ſpeak of, and in the next, it would ceaſe to ſurprize you.</p>
            <p>I can eaſily imagine, anſwered Alphonſo, had I been more prudent I had followed your advice, and not have wandered in a ſtrange country without a guide; but which way has my vanity contributed to my aſtoniſhment?</p>
            <p>Were it not for that, I repeat, you would not have been in any danger. In every place you have come to yet, I have ſeen you occupied by one ſole idea, that of being very deſirous to inform and aſtoniſh all the world by the recital of the wonderful things you have ſeen. We have met with many men of merit, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſts, Aſtronomers, Mathematicians, and Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics, to whom you have ſpoken a great deal, and liſtened very little. When you come to a ſtrange country, if you find any perſon to whom you can make yourſelf underſtood, you are careful not to aſk them a ſingle queſtion, but very anxious they ſhould learn all, you can teach them. This kind of folly gives no one an opinion of your great capacity, but deprives you of the fruits of all your travels. If, for example, ſince you have been here, inſtead of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſing yourſelf ſo repeatedly by telling what happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you at the Azores, you had aſked the people concerning the curious things in their own country, and its ancient inhabitants, you would have known your cavern had nothing miraculous about it, and that to enter it muſt be at the hazard of your life.</p>
            <p>Which way, ſir?</p>
            <p>By being told the cavern is one of the ſepulchral depoſits of the Guanches. Theſe ancient caves are
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:020385_0073_0FAF01FFDF2F69E8"/>
diſperſed in the deſarts, and are only known to the Guanches, who carefully conceal the entrance to them. They viſit them only in ſecret; and if they find a ſtranger there, they hold him ſacrilegious, a victim devoted to death; and from motives of barbarous ſuperſtition, think it their duty to kill him (24).</p>
            <p>Well, ſir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid Alphonſo, a little piqued, I owe, at leaſt, to my ignorance and want of thought, the advantage of having ſeen one of theſe curious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns.</p>
            <p>I have killed no man in my own defence, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Theliſmar; I have ſuffered neither hunger nor thirſt; I have not lain in the inclement air, nor have I afflicted my friend by the moſt cruel anxiety; and yet I have, as well as you, been in a ſepulchral cave of the Gaunches.</p>
            <p>Have you! How did you get admittance?</p>
            <p>I knew theſe caverns exiſted, had a ſtrong deſire to ſee them, found an opportunity of effectually ſerving a Guanch, and prevailed on him to ſecretly conduct and ſhew me one of them.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo had nothing to anſwer, but held down his head, and was ſilent; recollecting himſelf a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, he continued thus: I flatter myſelf that what I ſhall farther relate may yet incite your won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. After quitting the cavern, I ran, at firſt, where chance directed me; coming to the banks of a Lake—</p>
            <p>You need ſay no more, interrupted Theliſmar, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Know the reſt! how can that be? I was alone, and I have told nobody!</p>
            <p>After drinking the water of the Lake, you ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered ſome wild fruits, laid down on the graſs, and a dreadful tempeſt aroſe.—</p>
            <p>Good heavens! by what magic, what enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, can you tell all this?</p>
            <p>The column deſcended from the mountain, the Lake was dried up, and—</p>
            <p>What do I hear! exclaimed Alphonſo; conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, ſir, to explain this new miracle; who can have told you theſe things?</p>
            <p>No one; I beheld them all.</p>
            <p>Beheld them! where were you?</p>
            <p>Here at Guimar, upon my terrace.</p>
            <p>That was three leagues diſtant from me!</p>
            <p>Very true; and yet I repeat it, I ſaw you all the while.</p>
            <p>I can no longer doubt! O Theliſmar! you are ſome ſupernatural being!</p>
            <p>A man, my dear Alphonſo; and by no means one of the wiſeſt.</p>
            <p>Explain then this ſtrange enigma!</p>
            <p>A day would not be ſufficient; I might eaſily teach you terms and names, and ſhew you certain effects, but this would be treating you like a child. If you wiſh to know cauſes, you muſt gain more ſolid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>It is what I wiſh; inſtruction, ſuch as your's, which can make me comprehend your actions.</p>
            <p>Well, I will lend you books: and when you have read them with attention, we will converſe together.
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:020385_0075_0FAF02014F7D39A8"/>
I will then begin to unveil ſome of thoſe myſteries at which you are ſo much ſurpriſed.</p>
            <p>Oh give me thoſe precious books; ſee with what ardour I will ſtudy them; how utterly I will reject all other books.</p>
            <p>I do not wiſh you ſo to do; but the contrary. You love poetry; cheriſh that predilection; but read none but good poetry; leave novels, and read books that ſhall teach you to know yourſelf; dedicate two hours a day to the books I ſhall give you; think much, ſpeak little, and be attentive to others; this is all I aſk.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar then took Alphonſo to his cloſet, and gave him a few books; when you have read thoſe, ſaid he, I will communicate a treaſure to you, which will finiſh the work of inſtruction. Look at that cheſt; it contains the treaſure I talk of.</p>
            <p>Ah! ſaid Alphonſo, ſighing, muſt I never hope for other reward!—He ſtopt, and bluſhed, and the tears guſhed in his eyes.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo, replied Theliſmar, I do not pretend to deny that I love you; but to obtain the reward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Oh my father! cried Alphonſo, falling at the knees of Theliſmar; yes! my father! permit me the uſe of a word ſo dear, and expect every thing from me; I will obtain that precious eſteem, that eſteem, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which I could not live: what muſt I perform?

            <p>Every thing will be eaſy to me.</p>
            <p>Know then, I have read your heart. I authorize your hopes; but I require you ſhould never converſe with me on that ſubject.</p>
            <p>Never! Oh heaven!—Nor of the object of—</p>

            <p>Well; I ſubmit with joy—but ſuppoſe <hi>you</hi> mention her name?</p>
            <p>You then may anſwer; otherwiſe never utter a word, which can be conſtrued into the leaſt reference.</p>
            <p>I obey; happily you have not forbade me to think.</p>
            <p>No; I permit you ſometimes to think of her.</p>
            <p>Sometimes! Ever; not a moment of my life, but—</p>
            <p>What, retracting already?</p>
            <p>Which way?</p>
            <p>Have not you promiſed me ſeriouſly to follow your ſtudies?</p>
            <p>Moſt certainly.</p>
            <p>And how may that be, if you always think of Dalinda.</p>
            <p>Dalinda! heaven be praiſed! I did not firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce her dear name.</p>
            <p>Is it thus, Alphonſo, you keep your engagement? Is it thus you will drive Dalinda from your imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every time we read or ſpeak together?</p>

            <p>Here Madame de Clémire broke off for the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſent her children to reſt, who dreamt all night of nothing but walking pillars and enchanted caverns; they ſuppoſed that Madame de Clémire had told, by this time, every thing ſhe could collect that was marvellous and extraordinary; but ſhe aſſured them, what they had heard was little in compariſon to what ſhe ſhould relate, for ſhe had reſerved for the denoument incidents ſtill more ſurpriſing.

During the voyage, Alphonſo followed with ardour the plan Theliſmar had preſcribed for his ſtudies; but he had great difficulty to ſuppreſs his continual inclination to ſpeak of his paſſion, he was prevented only by the fear of offending Theliſmar; and ſtill he would occaſionally hazard ſome indirect alluſions, the true ſenſe of which Theliſmar would not underſtand.</p>
            <p>At laſt Alphonſo, unable longer to endure this conſtraint, imagined a means to break ſilence, which appeared to him ſublime. He preſerved the ſaſh of Dalinda, as a thing the moſt precious in his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; this, notwithſtanding the greatneſs of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, he determined to give back to Theliſmar; the ſuppoſition that he ſhould thus enjoy the pleaſure of ſpeaking of his paſſion, and of Dalinda, the hope that Theliſmar would conſider this act as proceeding from an eſtimable delicacy, and the poſſibility that he might therefore refuſe the ſaſh, were his induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Full of theſe ideas, Alphonſo entered one morning, with a triumphant air, the apartment of Theliſmar. I come, ſaid he, to make a confeſſion, which muſt be followed by a painful ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Of what nature?</p>
            <p>You muſt firſt give me your permiſſion—to ſpeak of her—I only aſk to accuſe myſelf, to repair my fault,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:020385_0079_0FAF0206821589F0"/>
Well, well, let us hear; explain, explain; though I dare engage the fault is not very important.</p>
            <p>In my eyes it is; feelings the moſt forcible, the moſt affectionate, on which the deſtiny of my life depend.</p>
            <p>Come to the point, what have you to tell me?</p>
            <p>You know to what exceſs I love Dalinda.</p>
            <p>Your preface diſpleaſes me, Alphonſo.</p>
            <p>But it is neceſſary; it leads to the confeſſion of my fault. The day on which I firſt faw Dalinda, on which I received a new exiſtence, after your cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el departure, overcome and loſt in grief, I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered like one diſtracted, ſeeking in vain ſome tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the celeſtial Being I had beheld: conducted at laſt by ſome ſecret charm, I returned, approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fountain of Love, where chance, or rather the God of the Fountain, moved by my deſpair, gave into my hands a pledge the deareſt, the moſt precious.</p>
            <p>Dalinda's ſaſh, you mean, interrupted Theliſmar, I recollect ſhe loſt it.</p>
            <p>Behold it here, cried Alphonſo, with emphaſis, drawing it from his pocket; behold that ſaſh, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ole conſolation of an unfortunate lover; I poſſeſſed it without your knowledge; it was wrong; I have not the happy right to keep it; a well founded de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy obliges me thus to ſurrender it.</p>
            <p>Your ſcruples are very juſt, replied Theliſmar; give it me, give it me, added he, taking the ſaſh; and I promiſe to return it, Alphonſo, the very firſt proof I ſhall receive from you of real ſincerity and confidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:020385_0080_0FAF0206A1CBBFA8"/>
How! cried Alphonſo, thunderſtruck, do you doubt my ſincerity?</p>
            <p>I have great right ſo to do, at the very moment you employ artifice.</p>
            <p>Artifice!</p>
            <p>You bluſh, Alphonſo, and well you may; but I dare hope, had you ſucceeded in deceiving me, your confuſion would have been ſtill greater; had you ſeen me delighted with your candour, your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy, your generoſity, tell me how you would have looked, how you would have behaved, while hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your own falſe prai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es?</p>
            <p>Alas! ſaid Alphonſo, and ſhed the tear of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, you know my heart better than I do my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: I own, I only ſought a pretext to ſpeak of Dalinda.</p>
            <p>And you hoped I ſhould be your dupe; hoped I ſhould return the ſaſh.</p>
            <p>I was deceived; convinced by falſe reaſoning.</p>
            <p>No; 'tis now you are deceived; you never were <hi>convinced;</hi> we cannot hide from ourſelves, what is in its own nature blameable: in vain would ſpecious reaſons gloze over actions, and call them noble, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, refined; the heart and the conſcience give ſuch reaſonings the lie!</p>
            <p>What have I done! Oh Theliſmar! has this fault, the whole extent of which I now perceive, has it deprived me of your eſteem without return?</p>
            <p>No; your ingenious manner of acknowledging it; the ſincerity of your repentance, the neglected education you have received, and your conſequent want of reflection, all plead in your excuſe. Did I
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:020385_0081_0FAF020753DCCEF0"/>
think cunning a part of your character, I ſhould then hold you paſt hope; but, notwithſtanding the unworthy ſubterfuge you have juſt been guilty of, I read frankneſs and candour in your boſom; and I am certain, Alphonſo, you will yet vanquiſh your defects.</p>
            <p>The concluding ſentence gave a little ſatisfaction to Alphonſo, who promiſed within himſelf to let no occaſion ſlip of demonſtrating his reformation to Theliſmar.</p>
            <p>Our travellers landed firſt at the iſland of Goree; from thence they went to Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ſco, and afterwards by land to Fort St. Louis, on the Senegal. They ſaw the Sereres, a Negroe nation, whoſe hoſpitality, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and gentleneſs, they admired; theſe virtues are undoubtedly the effect of their love of labour and agriculture, which particularly diſtinguiſhes them from moſt other ſavages, who are generally indolent, and diſdain to cultivate the earth.</p>
            <p>One night as Theliſmar and Alphonſo, with their guides and companions, were rambling in a ſandy and deſart place, they ſaw a miraculous tree, the height of which did not exceed ſixty or ſeventy feet, while its monſtrous trunk was above ninety in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; its lower branches projected almoſt horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, and as they were prodigiouſly large and long, their own weight bent them almoſt to the ground; inſomuch that they found beneath this ſingle tree, a vaſt and extenſive kind of grove, which might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily give ſhelter to three or four hundred men (25).</p>
            <p>After having admired this aſtoniſhing production of nature, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

few paces from the tree they beheld a lion, extended on the ground, and ſeemingly dead. Alphonſo was determined to examine the animal nearer, and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar followed. When they came up to him, they found he ſtill breathed, but was without power and motion, and apparently expiring; his jaws were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> open, full of piſmires, and bloody.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo pitied the creature, wiped away the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects that tormented him with his handkerchief, then taking a bottle of water from his pocket, poured it all down his throat, while Theliſmar held the end of a piſtol to the entrance of that terrible jaw, in caſe of a too ſudden recovery. The lion was greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the water, and ſeemed with his languiſhing eyes to thank, with great expreſſion and gratitude, the compaſſionate Alphonſo, who did not leave him till he had adminiſtered every ſuccour in his power.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo and Theliſmar rejoined their ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and followed a path that led through ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively high graſs. As Theliſmar was walking on before, at the end of the meadow he fell into a kind of pit, and ſuddenly diſappeared. Alphonſo ran and ſaw him ſitting in the pit. Theliſmar ſaid he had got a ſprain, and that it was impoſſible he ſhould riſe and walk without his aſſiſtance. As Alphonſo was going to deſcend and take him in his arms, he ſuddenly heard a dreadful hiſſing, and ſaw a monſtrous ſerpent, at leaſt twenty feet long, in the pit, with head erect, making towards Theliſmar, who, after an effort to riſe, fell helpleſs again among the graſs (26).</p>
            <p>Alphonſo inſtantly leaped into the pit, placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf between Theliſmar and the ſerpent, drew his

ſword, attacked the horrid reptile, and with a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and firm ſtroke, ſevered his head from his body; then turning to Theliſmar, he helped him up, and lifted him out of the pit.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar embraced Alphonſo; you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ave ſaved my life, ſaid he, I could neither defend myſelf nor fly; the ſerpent was coming to attack me, and his bite is mortal. I promiſe you, Dalinda ſhall be informed of this. Alphonſo was too much agitated to anſwer, but preſſed Theliſmar with tranſport to his boſom. Gently, ſaid Theliſmar, ſmiling, take care of my right arm, it is broken.</p>
            <p>Broken! cried Alphonſo; good God!</p>
            <p>Had it not, do you think I would not have defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf?</p>
            <p>And you have not uttered the leaſt ſymptom of complaint or pain!</p>
            <p>You, dear Alphonſo, have no right, at leaſt, to be ſurprized at the fortitude of others.</p>
            <p>Oh my father! replied Alphonſo, I want the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to ſee you ſuffer; come, let us join our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. He then raiſed Theliſmar gently on his ſhoulders, and, in ſpite of all he could ſay, carried him, without ſtopping, to where their companions were waiting.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar was obliged to remain in one of the Negro buts, where he was humanely received. He had a ſurgeon with him, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Theliſmar and his companions with great hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and propoſed they ſhould accompany him to the chace of a lion, which, within a few days, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted great ravages in his ſtates.</p>
            <p>The king, young, courageous, and deſirous to ſhew the company his valour and addreſs, ordered his followers and the ſtrangers to ſtop; and, mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on an excellent horſe, galloped to attack the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious animal, which, perceiving him, leaped to the combat. The Siratick let fly an arrow, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wounded, advanced with a dreadful bellow.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo now forgot the orders of the king; he darted like lightning, thinking him in danger, and flew to his ſuccour: he had drawn his ſword, and galloping with incredible ſwiftneſs, paſſed near a tree, againſt which, by accident, his ſword ſtruck, and ſnapped ſhort in two. Alphonſo himſelf, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the violence of the ſhock, could hardly keep his ſeat: his horſe fell, and the ſame inſtant, the lion ſeeing a new enemy coming armed, had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the Siratick, and ruſhed towards him; his dreadful claws were inſtantly buried in the ſides of the horſe, and Alphonſo, diſarmed, and without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, thought his death inevitable. The Negroes, fearing to kill him, durſt not ſhoot at the animal.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar, the ſame moment that Alphonſo had galloped to the combat, wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

What were his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when he ſaw the lion bounding to devour the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:020385_0085_0FAF020C202F0380"/>
overthrown Alphonſo? Oh! unhappy young man! cried he.</p>
            <p>But, oh! what ſurprize! Oh! joy unhoped!</p>
            <p>No ſooner had the lion beheld the face of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo, than all his rage was loſt; he crouched to him, and lifting up one of his bloody paws, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an arrow, laid it gently on the hand of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo, and ſeemed to ſhew him his hurt, and aſk his aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo ſhuddered, and remembering the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the dying lion, cried, Oh noble animal! I recollect thee: may thy example ever confound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and bring to ſhame thoſe who would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſe from their memory the good which others have done them!—Yes, ſince thou haſt ſo nobly granted me my life, I will ſave thine in my turn, and defend thee, be the conſequence what it will.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo then ſtaunched the blood of the wound, and tearing his handkerchief, made a bandage which he faſtened round the paw.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar and the ſavages beheld this ſpectacle with aſtoniſhment. His chirurgical operations ended, Alphonſo roſe; his horſe lay wounded and dying. The lion once more approached him, licked his feet, and careſſed him a thouſand times. Alphonſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated gently: the lion ſtopped, looked after him, then ſuddenly turned about, directed his courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a neighbouring foreſt, and diſappeared, leaving the ſpectators of this ſtrange adventure motionleſs with amazement (27).</p>
            <p>Theliſmar, after having preſſed Alphonſo to his boſom, after having embraced him with the dear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:020385_0086_0FAF020D0DA3BEB8"/>
of a father, reproached him for his temerity, and imprudence. Had you, ſaid he, aſked the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this chace, or rather, had you liſtened to the account which others gave of it, you would have known the Siratick was in no danger; but that, uſed to theſe kind of combats, he waited for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bury his javelin in his throat; that he would have afterwards leaped off his horſe, and ended him with his ſabre.</p>
            <p>I promiſe, my father, ſaid Alphonſo, I will be more attentive another time, and more prudent; at preſent I have ſaved the life of my lion, of my gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and noble animal, and I am happy.</p>
            <p>Yes, replied Theliſmar, but the Siratick is little pleaſed with your diſregard of his orders; and though your motive was his preſervation, he will not pardon you, for having robbed him of the honour of the victory; it will be therefore prudent not to ſtay long in his territories

            <p>Accordingly the next morning, Theliſmar, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo, and their followers, quitted Gihorel, and continued their paſſage up the Senegal, as far as the village of Embakana, near the frontiers of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Galam; they afterwards croſſed the Gambia, traverſed the States of Farim<note n="†" place="bottom">Or Saint Domingue.</note>, and, after having travelled a great extent of country, arrived at Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea.</p>

Would you believe, ſaid Theliſmar, that there are men ſo deprived of ſenſe, as to maintain we have no other advantage over infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior animals, than that of a more perfect conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and who have ſaid in expreſs terms, that if the horſe (that intelligent animal) had, inſtead of a hoof, a hand like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The parrot, the pye, the jay, and various other birds, have the faculty of ſpeech; that is, can learn a few words, but can neither comprehend their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor, conſequently, apply them juſtly: beſides, there are many exiſting animals, the conformation of which, both interior and exterior, is perfectly ſimilar to that of man; they walk like him, and have hands like his, and yet they neither build palaces nor huts; nay, they are even leſs induſtrious than many other animals.</p>
            <p>Monkies, you mean; in fact, they are very adroit. And pray what ſay thoſe authors to this, who deſire the horſe to have hands?</p>

They acknowledge that the monkey might, from his conformation, be capable of doing the ſame things as man, and that his natural petulance is an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that he is always in motion; and could you deprive him of that reſtleſſneſs, that vivacity, he would be man's equal

Your doubt, dear Alphonſo, proves how little you have read.</p>
            <p>Juſt as Theliſmar ſaid this, Alphonſo gave a ſtart of ſurprize, and jogging Theliſmar, cried ſoftly, Look, look—there—right before you; what ſtrange creature is that ſitting under the tree?</p>
            <p>Here let us break off, ſaid Madame de Clémire, interrupting her narrative, I feel myſelf a little hoarſe this evening.</p>

            <p>The next day, a quarter before nine, Madame de Clémire indulged the ardent curioſity of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by taking up her manuſcript and reading as follows:</p>

            <p>How you aſtoniſh me! but is this monkey, who was ſitting with ſo much tranquillity at the foot of a tree, as reſtleſs and precipitate in his motions as the ſmall monkies?</p>
            <p>No; <q>his walk is grave, his actions circumſpect, his temper gentle, and very different from that of other monkies<note n="‡" place="bottom">In ſpeaking of a monkey of another ſpecies, called Gibbon, M. de Buffon ſays, this monkey ſeems to us to <q>have natural tranquillity, and gentle manners; his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are neither too ſudden, nor too reſtleſs; he takes kindly whatever is given him to eat,</q> &amp;c.</note>;</q>—he has not the hoof of a horſe, he is higher than we are, formed as we are.—<q>The Creator would not form the body of a man abſolutely different from all other animals; but at the ſame time that he has given him a material body, a form ſimilar to that of the monkey, he has breathed his divine ſpirit into this body; had he done the ſame favour, I do not ſay to the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key, but to that ſpecies of beaſt which ſeems to us the moſt ill organized, ſuch ſpecies would ſoon have become the rival of man; quickened by his ſpirit it had excelled others, had thought, had ſpoken.

Alphonſo liſtened to this diſcourſe with admiration. At preſent, ſaid he, I am deſirous to learn how thoſe authors, who pretend that it is our form only which makes us ſuperior to other animals, will anſwer theſe arguments.</p>
            <p>They do not know the animal that we have juſt ſeen, nor many other ſpecies nearly like him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by all travellers; yet their works are modern, and, as I have ſaid, theſe are facts known to all the world.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar here fat down near a lake ſurrounded by rocks; their guide propoſed they ſhould wait for the reſt of the company, whom they had left at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance. He had ſeated himſelf under the ſhade of ſome trees, and taking two books from his pocket, gave one of them to Alphonſo, pointing out a chapter, which he de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ired him to read with great attention.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo promiſed he would; adding, that he would go farther off and ſit down, to be free from all diſturbance. This he accordingly did, and ſat down at about two hundred yards diſtance, on the banks of the lake.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of reading, he fell into a profound reverie: the murmurs of the water, the freſh verdure, the rocks, all retraced a ſcene which he had not the power to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh from his mind: it recalled to memory the Fountain of Love; the form of Dalinda was preſent, he could think of nothing but her, and at laſt could not refrain from repeating a name ſo dear.</p>
            <p>Certain that Theliſmar could not hear him, he ſang in an under voice a ſong he had made to her memory.
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:020385_0092_0FAF0211F13C3B98"/>
As he finiſhed the laſt line of his ſong, he heard foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, and turning his head, ſaw Theliſmar coming; he took up his book and was ſilent, but the inſtant he had done, a ſoft, though ſonorous, voice ſeemed to iſſue from the rocks, and again repeated the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet he had ſung.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar heard the name of Dalinda as he aproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his aſtoniſhment was exceſſive, when he found it was not Alphonſo who was ſinging. As soon as the air was ended, he was going to queſtion Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar concerning this prodigy, when another voice began the ſame couplet; ſcarce had this ſecond voice ceaſed ſinging, but a third, from the oppoſite ſide, again repeated the ſame words, and the ſame ſounds: ſilence then ſucceeded, and the concert ended (28).</p>
            <p>What enchantment is this? cried Alphonſo.</p>
            <p>We muſt confeſs, ſaid Theliſmar, ſmiling, the fawns and ſy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The ſmall caravan of travellers being on their march, Alphonſo was walking about two or three hundred yards before the reſt. They approached a large pond ſurrounded by the huts of ſavages; and Alphonſo looking forward thought he ſaw on the other ſide of the pond, a long brick wall built upon the border: not conceiving what could be the uſe of this wall, he haſtened forward to examine it; but as he drew near, perceived this imaginary wall had motion.</p>
            <p>He then thought, that inſtead of a wall, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed warriors clothed in red, and ranged in order of battle; he preſently after obſerved ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels ſtationed in advance, and ſoon ſaw he was diſcovered; for the moment the ſentinels perceived him, the alarm was given, and the air reſounded with a noiſe much like the ſound of a trumpet.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo ſtopped, and while he was deliberating whether he ſhould proceed or go back, he ſaw the army begin to move, riſe from the earth, and at laſt to fly away. Alphonſo then learned with extreme ſurprize, that this formidable ſquadron was nothing but enormous red birds, of ſo bright a colour, that when they took flight, their wings abſolutely ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inflamed.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo had a gun, and being deſirous of taking one of theſe extraordinary birds to Theliſmar, he fired at the flock and killed one. Several Negroes, on hearing the firing, immediately came out of their huts, which ſtood by the pond, haſtily running. As ſoon as they ſaw Alphonſo dragging away the bird he had killed, they ſent forth the moſt horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:020385_0094_0FAF02166E7A7BB8"/>
cries, when inſtantly all the other Negroes left their habitations, and came in crowds to attack Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo, who ſaw himſelf aſſaulted on all ſides by a ſhower of ſtones and darts.</p>
            <p>Had it not been for the arrival of Theliſmar and the other travellers, Alphonſo could not have eſcaped with life; but at ſight of them the ſavages fled, and he came off with a few ſlight wounds, and a ſevere reprimand from Theliſmar, who informed him, that the Negroes held the bird he had killed in ſuch ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, they would not ſuffer any one to do it the leaſt injury, but thought themſelves obliged in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to revenge the death of a creature which they held ſacred.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo learnt alſo from Theliſmar, that the noiſe which he had compared to the ſound of trump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, was nothing but the cry of the birds, which is ſo loud and ſhrill, that it is heard at more than a quarter of a league diſtance (29).</p>
            <p>Theliſmar continued his journey, only ſtopping occaſionally among various hordes of ſavages, whoſe manners he wiſhed to know. Of all the barbarous people of Africa, the nation which he thought moſt intereſting was that of the Hottentots: their virtues ſurpaſſed their vices: they fulfilled, in their whole extent, the duties of friendſhip and hoſpitality; and their love of juſtice, their courage, benevolence, and chaſtity, rendered them far ſuperior to other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages<note n="*" place="bottom">See l' Abrégé de l' Hiſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

It is remarkable, that among the Hottentots, the education of youth is committed to the mothers, till the age of eighteen, after which the males are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to the rank of manhood; but before that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, they have no communication with the men, not even with their own father<note n="†" place="bottom">See the ſame work, and the ſame volume.</note>.</p>
            <p>During their ſojourn among the Hottentots, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar was walking one day with Alphonſo: their guide carried a wallet with proviſions, it being their intention to dine during their walk. As they were croſſing the ruſtic bridge of a ſmall river, the guide let the wallet fall, and fearing probably the anger of of the travellers, took to his heels and diſappeared. This event was very diſagreeable to Alphonſo, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceedingly hungry.</p>
            <p>I am certain, ſaid Theliſmar, I can find my way; but before we walk any farther, let us reſt a little under the ſhade of theſe trees. They ſat down on the graſs, and Alphonſo continued to complain of having a great way to go, and nothing to eat, when Theliſmar cried ſilence, let us liſten. Alphonſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently heard a very ſhrill cry, which, to his great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment, Theliſmar anſwered in a graver tone: then riſing, ſaid, Since you are ſo very hungry, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo, come with me, and I'll give you a dinner.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar then uttered ſeveral ſucceſſive cries; and Alphonſo perceived a green and white bird, which hovered round them. Let us follow this new guide, ſaid Theliſmar, he will recompenſe us for the careleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the other who has run away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:020385_0096_0FAF0217D29BFE08"/>
Alphonſo knew not what to think, but walked ſilently, and looked attentively at the bird, which, in a few minutes went and reſted itſelf upon a large hollow tree: Stop, ſaid Theliſmar, the bird will come and ſeek us, if he has any thing good to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. As he ſaid, ſo it happened, the bird ſeeing they did not approach redoubled his cries, came back to them, then returned to his tree, where he fluttered and perched.</p>
            <p>Come, ſaid Theliſmar, he invites us to dinner with ſo good a grace we cannot refuſe him. So ſaying, he went to the tree, and, to the extreme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment of Alphonſo, found a bee-hive in it full of honey.</p>
            <p>While our travellers were eating the honey, the bird, having fled to a neighbouring buſh, appeared greatly intereſted at all that had paſſed; it is but juſt, ſaid Theliſmar, to give him his ſhare of the booty: Alphonſo, therefore, left a ſpoonful of honey upon a leaf, which as ſoon as they were gone from the tree, the bird came and eat. In the courſe of half an hour, the bird ſhewed them two other hives; and Alphonſo, ſatiated with honey, merrily conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his route (30).</p>
            <p>Theliſmar quitted the country of the Hottentots, and embarked for the iſland of Madagaſcar; after wards he journied through all the eaſtern coaſt of Africa; then quitted that part of the world, and after a ſhort ſtay in the iſland of Socotora, landed in Arabia Felix. He viſited Mecca (31), and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na (32), traverſed a part of the Deſart, entered Africa again by the Iſthmus of Suez, and came to

            <p>Theliſmar, within the laſt two months, had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times read over with Alphonſo tranſlations of the Iliad and Odyſſey. Alphonſo, joyfully leaving the burning and barbarous climates of Africa, was delighted to find himſelf once more in Europe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the azure ſkies of Greece, in places where all the pleaſant fictions of fable may be traced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong people whoſe manners Homer had deſcribed.</p>
            <p>Before they left Thera, Theliſmar and Alphonſo learnt that the Volcano, which is ſituated in that iſland, began to give great uneaſineſs to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, by appearing to re-kindle, ſmoke, and caſt forth ſtones.</p>
            <p>The next morning our travellers roſe with Auro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, and were conducted towards the Volcano; when they were at a league's diſtance their guide ſtopt, telling them he thought he heard a very uncommon noiſe; our travellers liſtened, and heard a kind of bellowing, which ſeemed to ariſe out of the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They proceeded, however, about a quarter of a league farther; in proportion as they approached the bellowing increaſed, and was ſoon accompanied with frightful hiſſings; at the ſame time they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:020385_0098_0FAF021966EFAE90"/>
that the ſmoke of the Volcano grew thicker, and became of a deeper red.</p>
            <p>Let us return, ſaid Teeliſmar.</p>
            <p>Scarcely had he ſpoken, before a horrible noiſe was heard; and as they turned their heads to look, while flying towards the ſea-coaſt, they ſaw the mountain all on fire, covered with flames, which roſe to the clouds, and caſting forth on all ſides vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of red hot ſtones, and blazing matter. The terrified guide, loſing all recollection, led them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, and took them a road which brought them back towards the Volcano.</p>
            <p>As they now ſtood fronting this fearful mountain, they ſaw, with horror, torrents of fire running im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſly down its ſides, and ſpreading over the plain: theſe deſtructive rivers burnt, and overthrew every thing that oppoſed their paſſage: at their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the herbs and flowers withered, the leaves grew inſtantly yellow, and dropt from the trees; the brooks diſappeared, the fountains were dried up, and the birds dropt breathleſs from the ſcorched branches.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time vaſt clouds of hot aſhes and cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, burnt white, obſcured the air, and fell like rain upon the earth, breaking the branches, rooting up trees, and rolling, with horrid din, from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the plains, echoing far and near among the reſounding rocks.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar and Alphonſo fled from theſe deſolate places, and after long wandering in unknown paths, came at length to the ſea ſide; they judged, when at a diſtance, by the roaring of the waves, that the ſea
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:020385_0099_0FAF00D4840A4D40"/>
was violently agitated. They judged rightly; it was dreadfully tempeſtuous, though the air was entirely calm.</p>
            <p>They were conſidering this phaenomenon with an aſtoniſhment, which was ſoon redoubled. Suddenly there appeared in the middle of the waves incredible volumes of flames, which, inſtantly ſpreading and diſſipating in the air, were ſucceded by an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity of burning rocks, that were projected from the deep abyſs of the ocean, and raiſed above the waters (35).</p>
            <p>The tempeſt after this decreaſed, the ſea was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, and ſome of the Iſlanders who paſſed that way, informed Theliſmar that the Volcano no longer vomited flames. When the eruption was ended, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo and Theliſmar returned to their lodgings, and two days after this memorable event left that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py iſland.</p>
            <p>From hence they went to the iſland of Policandro<note n="*" place="bottom">One of the Cyclades to the ſouth of Paros and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>aros.</note>, where they found a Swediſh traveller, a former friend of Theliſmar's, who offered to accompany and guide them in their walks through the iſland. He brought them to his houſe, which he would partake with them; and after ſupper, addreſſing himſelf to Alphonſo, ſaid, My dwelling you ſee is ſimple, devoid of ornaments; but if you love magnificence, I have the means of gratifying your taſte. I am ſo happy to ſee my old friend once more, that I have formed the project of giving him an entertainment in a palace, the richneſs and brilliancy of which may well ſurprize you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:020385_0100_0FAF00D4A3C257B8"/>
Frederic, for that was the name of Theliſmar's friend, then roſe, called his ſervants, who came with torches, and went forth with Alphonſo and Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar.</p>
            <p>They came in about half an hour to an enormous maſs of rocks. Behold my palace, ſaid Frederic: the aſpect, it's true, is a little wild, but we muſt not always judge from appearances. Stop here a moment, if you pleaſe, and let the ſervants enter firſt.</p>
            <p>The ſervants then diſtributed torches to about a dozen men who had followed them, each of whom lighted his flambeau, and proceeded forward. When Frederic ſaw them at a certain diſtance, he and his company began to follow.</p>
            <p>They had not gone above a hundred paces, before they perceived an immenſe arcade, and their eyes were immediately dazzled by the ſplendor of light. Come in, ſaid Frederic, this is the periſtyle of my pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ace; what think you of it?</p>
            <p>The queſtion was addreſſed to Alphonſo, but he was too buſy in conſidering the brilliant ſpectacle before him to reply. The walls of this vaſt periſtyle ſeemed covered with gold, rubies, and diamonds; the ceiling decorated with waving garlands, and pendant ornaments of chryſtal; nay, the very floor on which they trod, was paved with the ſame rich materials (36).</p>
            <p>Pardon me, my dear mamma, cried Caroline, for interrupting, but I can hold no longer. Were theſe pure diamonds?</p>
            <p>No; they only ſeemed ſuch; but the reſemblance
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:020385_0101_0FAF00D643128B78"/>
was ſo perfect, as to deceive the eye moſt accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſider ſuch objects.</p>
            <p>Well, that is very ſingular; and is it true, dear mamma, that ſuch a palace once exiſted?</p>
            <p>It exiſts ſtill.</p>
            <p>Oh dear, ſtill!</p>
            <p>Yes; in the iſland of Policandro.</p>
            <p>Oh the charming iſland! Will you ſhew it us to-morrow, mamma, in the map?</p>
            <p>Yes; willingly.</p>
            <p>Mamma, if you will permit me, my next geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical leſſon ſhall be to trace upon the maps all the travels of Alphonſo; for I can remember them all perfectly, and ſo I can all the extraordinary things he has ſeen.</p>
            <p>So be it: but in the mean time, let us continue our tale.</p>
            <p>Frederic ſhewed Alphonſo how extenſive this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perb palace was; and after having paſſed more than two hours in examining and contemplating the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders before them, they once more returned to the houſe of their hoſt. Alphonſo learnt from Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, that the pretended palace of Frederic was all the work of nature; and the knowledge of this encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his admiration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Theliſmar having formerly made the tour of Italy, had no intention of returning thither,; but his friend Frederic, who was going to Reggio, entreated his company; to which Theliſmar the more readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, becauſe it was the only part of Italy he had not ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="unknown:020385_0102_0FAF00D6E22D09E8"/>
Frederic, Alphonſo, and Theliſmar, left Polican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro, and ſailed for the Morea<note n="*" place="bottom">The large peninſula of ancient Attica.</note>. Here they beheld the ruins of Epidaurus and Lacedaemon. From the Morea they went to the iſland of Cephalonia, where, once more embarking, they ſailed for Reggio<note n="†" place="bottom">Appertaining to the kingdom of Naples, in Calabria Ulterior; there is another city of the ſame name in Italy, in Modena.</note>. The day after their arrival in that city, our three travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers brekfaſted in the chamber of Theliſmar, the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of which looked towards the ſea; their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was interrupted by a thouſand ſhouts of joy, heard from every part. Alphonſo ran out inſtantly, to know what was the reaſon of ſuch noiſy and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated acclamations: he aſked ſeveral paſſengers, who all anſwered, ſtill running as they ſpoke, We are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſea-ſide to ſee the <hi>Caſtles of the Fairy Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alphonſo returned, and gave an account of this ſtrange anſwer; our travellers, therefore, opened their windows, and beheld a ſight, the beauty and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of which ſurpaſſed every thing they had hitherto ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The ſea which bathes the coaſt of Sicily, began to ſwell and riſe by degrees; in a little while the huge waves formed a perfect repreſentation of an immenſe and dark chain of mountains; while the ſurges which waſhed the coaſts of Calabria, remained with a tranquil and ſmooth ſurface, like to a vaſt and ſhining mirror, gently inclining to the walls of Reggio. This prodigious looking-glaſs
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:020385_0103_0FAF00D795C02D20"/>
ſoon reflected a moſt miraculous picture; millions of pilaſters, of the moſt elegant proportion, and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the utmoſt ſymmetry, were diſtinctly ſeen, reflecting all the bright and varied colours of the rainbow; ſcarcely did they retain this form a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before theſe ſupberb pilaſters were bent and changed into majeſtic arcades, which likewiſe ſoon vaniſhed, and gave place to an innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of magnificent caſtles, all perfectly alike; while theſe palaces were ſucceeded by towers, colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades, and afterwards by trees and immenſe foreſts of the cypreſs and palm (37).</q>
            </p>
            <p>After this laſt decoration, the magic picture diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, the ſea reſumed its ordinary aſpect, and the people who ſtood upon the ſtrand, clapped their hands in tranſport, a thouſand times repeating with joyous ſhouts, the name of the Fairy Morgana.</p>
            <p>And ſo mamma, interrupted Pulcheria, we are at length come to our Fairy Tales again?</p>
            <p>Indeed we are not: this laſt Phaenomenon, as well as all the other, is taken from nature.</p>
            <p>But there is a Fairy called Morgana, you know, mamma.</p>
            <p>I have only told you what the people of Reggio ſay; who are generally ignorant and credulous, are fond of fables, and eaſily adopt them.</p>
            <p>But theſe magic pictures.</p>
            <p>Are produced by natural cauſes.</p>
            <p>I cannot conceive at preſent, why every body do not paſs their lives in travelling, reading, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring knowledge, in order to underſtand and ſee
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:020385_0104_0FAF00D857CCCDD0"/>
things ſo curious and intereſting; but dear mamma, be pleaſed to continue your recital.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo began to think like you; the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſo many extraordinary events continually raiſed, excited an ardent curioſity and ſtrong defire of obtaining knowledge; his trifling amuſements no longer pleaſed; he became thoughtful, ſpoke with reſerve, and liſtened with attention; but in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as his mind became enlightened, he diſcovered faults in his paſt conduct, every recollection of which made him bitterly repent.</p>
            <p>He could not now comprehend, how it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he ſhould have forſaken his father. The obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſilence of Don Ramirex grievouſly afflicted him; he ardently deſired to arrive at Conſtantinople, where he expected to find letters from Portugal: and though he had a paſſionate attachment to The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar, though he had almoſt a certainty of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hand of Dalinda, he yet determined to quit the former in Turkey, and return to Europe, there to ſacrifice his hopes and happineſs to filial duty, if he received no intelligence from his father.</p>
            <p>This reſolution plunged him into a ſtate of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, of which Theliſmar ſearched in vain the cauſe; which he even augmented, in wiſhing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate, by marks of the moſt tender affection. He often ſpoke to Frederic, in his preſence, of Dalin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, to drive away his dejection; while theſe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, far from ſoftening the ſecret pangs of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo, but embittered them the more. Theliſmar at laſt took leave of Frederic, quitted Reggio, and
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:020385_0105_0FAF00D911DC7AB0"/>
returned to Greece; and travelling through it, came to conſtantinople towards the end of April.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo found a letter at Conſtantinople from Portugal, which he received with inexpreſſible anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; it was not from Don Ramirez, but informed Alphonſo his father had returned to Portugal, had paſſed ſome time at Liſbon, and had left that city, declaring he was going to undertake a voyage of eighteen months. The letter added, that nobody doubted Don Ramirez had had ſeveral private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations with the King, and that the purpoſe of his voyage was ſome ſecret negociations; that they were in great expectations of ſeeing him once more in office, becauſe his ſucceſſor and enemy had been diſgraced, eight days after his departure.</p>
            <p>The gentleman, who wrote an account of all this, ended his letter by ſaying, he had not ſeen Don Ramirez, as Alphonſo had deſired him to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, being on a tour to France, he had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Liſbon till three weeks after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>From the date of this letter, Alphonſo calculated, that his father could not be in Portugal in leſs than fifteen or ſixteen months, he therefore abandoned his project of returning thither immediately: in fact, having no money, he had no means of ſubſiſtence in the abſence of Don Ramirez; and he was pretty certain his travels would be ended, and he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Europe in leſs than a year. The ſilence of his father deeply afflicted him; but the aſſurances of his health and ſafety were great conſolations, and he
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:020385_0106_0FAF00D9D62908E0"/>
did not doubt but time and his future conduct, might regain the affections of his father.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo, now leſs ſorrowful, leſs abſent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with Theliſmar as formerly; who appeared ſo ſatisfied with the change he had remarked in him, that Alphonſo thought he might venture to ſpeak of Dalinda. At firſt Theliſmar was ſatisfied with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly reminding him of his promiſe; and Alphonſo, emboldened by this indulgence, ſeveral times fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame error; till, at laſt, Theliſmar was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, and Alphonſo was obliged to be ſilent, though he ſtill ſought occaſions to ſpeak his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments indirectly, and to complain of the reſtraint impoſed upon him.</p>
            <p>Frederic had given Theliſmar letters of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to one of his friends, a Greek, who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed a charming houſe on the canal of the Black Sea; this Greek, whoſe name was Nicandor, was not then at Conſtantinople. Alphonſo and Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, therefore, in about a fortnight went to Buyuk-Dairai, a village eight miles from Conſtantinople<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſcite of this village is very pleaſant. Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and various others, have country-houſes there. <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age litteraire de la Greece,</hi> by M. Guys, Tom. 1.</note>, where Nicandor and his family paſt a part of the ſummer.</p>
            <p>It was the firſt of May, and ten in the morning, when our two travellers arrived at Buyuk-Dairai. As they entered, they ſaw the ſtreets full of young people, elegantly clothed, and crowned with gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, ſinging, and playing on various inſtruments; every houſe was decorated with flowers, feſtoons,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:020385_0107_0FAF00DACD31AB98"/>
and roſes, and adorned by a multitude of young Grecian beauties, ſurrounded by ſlaves magnificently clothed.</p>
            <p>This ſpectable delighted Alphonſo; and Thelif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, acquainted with the cuſtoms of Greece, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that it was thus they celebrated every firſt of May; that on this ſolemn day, young lovers fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed coronets of roſes over the doors where their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes dwelt, and ſung their praiſes under their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows (38).</p>
            <p>Alas! ſaid Alphonſo, they are happy, for they are heard. That favour, replied Theliſmar, is no proof of their happineſs.</p>
            <p>But what happens when two rivals meet under the ſame window, or at the ſame door?</p>
            <p>They faſten their coronets on each ſide, and ſing alternately.</p>
            <p>After our travellers had ſtopt ſome time in the firſt ſtreet, they continued their way; and Alphonſo, perceiving at a diſtance a houſe more ornamented with flowers than the reſt, ſaid, certainly that is the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſome celebrated beauty; he was confirmed in this opinion, when coming nearer, he beheld two charming young virgins ſtanding in a large balcony.</p>
            <p>The guide informed them this was the houſe of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candor, and they entered; the maſter came immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to receive them, and after having read the letter of Frederic, embraced them both affectionately, and teſtified the livelieſt hopes that they would remain with him ſome time. Nicandor and all his family ſpoke French tolerably well: Theliſmar underſtood that language perfectly, and Alphonſo knew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="unknown:020385_0108_0FAF00DBB4302350"/>
Nicandor called his ſlaves, who conducted the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers into a ſpacious hall, the walls of which were Parian marble, where a bath was prepared (39).</p>
            <p>After bathing, Nicandor came and conducted them into the apartment of his wife Glaphira; ſhe was ſeated upon a ſofa, with her two daughters, Glyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra and Zoë, and an old and venerable woman, the nurſe of Nicandor, who, according to the cuſtoms of the modern Greeks, the family called Paranama, a gentle epithet, expreſſive of gratitude, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſecond mother (40).</p>
            <p>The daughters were ſuperbly dreſſed, both had long floating robes, white veils, decorated with gold fringe, and girdles richly embroidered, faſtened with buckles of emeralds (41).</p>
            <p>Glaphira and Nicandor queſtioned Theliſmar, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his travels, and prevailed on him to recount ſome of his adventures. After which they ſat down to table, and their repaſt being ended, Zoë brought her lyre, and accompanied ſeveral duets which ſhe ſang with her ſiſter (42).</p>
            <p>This agreeable muſic being over, Nicandor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a walk to his gueſts, which they readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>

            <p>Zoë related the hiſtory of a young virgin on the eye of her marriage, quitting the paternal manſoon. She told her tale with equal truth and feeling, and painted the intereſting and deep grief of a tender and grateful daughter tearing herſelf from the arms

of her beloved family, Glycera liſtened to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail with extreme emotion; involuntary tearn then bathed her down<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, and held out her arms. Glyeera roſe, ran, and threw herſelf at her mother's knees melted in tenderneſs.</p>
            <p>The hiſtory is interrupted; Nicandor approaches Glycera, kiſſes her affectionately, claſps her to his boſom: the lovely Zoë quits her work, and flies to her ſiſter's arms: the ſlaves teſtify their feelings at this touching ſcene; and Nicandor, in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, taking Alphonſo and Theliſmar into another apartment, explained the cauſe of what they ſaw, by firſt telling them the ſubject of Zoë's fable, and then informing them, that Glycera was herſelf at the eye of marriage.</p>
            <p>The very ſame evening, the young man, choſen to be the ſpouſe of Glycera, ſent large baſkets mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently embelliſhed, containing ornaments and nuptial preſents for Glycera and the family. The next day the young Greek came, attended by his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and friends, to the houſe of Nicandor; the beauteous and affecting Glycera appeared; ſhe had on a ſilver robe, embroidered with gold and pearls, and faſtened with a girdle of diamonds; her treſſes floated upon her ſhoulders, and a Hymen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>al crown adorned her head while ſhe wept, and hid herſelf in her mother's arms.</p>
            <p>Glycera received the parental benediction kneeling, which Nicandor pronounced with great tenderneſs, but with a ſolemn and firm tone; while the feeling

mother, incapable of articulating a word, raiſed her ſwimming eyes to heaven, and preſſed between her trembling hands the hands of her daughter. After this moving ceremony, the two families, united and followed by all their ſlaves, walked to church; this ſuperb train was preceded by a band of vocal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental muſic: after them came the young virgin, ſupported by her father and mother; her pace was ſlow, timid, and trembling; her down-caſt eyes were evidently wet with tears ſhe vainly endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. According to the ancient uſage of Greece, the Torch of Hymen was carried before her, and her ſlaves, huſband, parents, and friends cloſed the proceſſion, in which order they arrived at church.</p>
            <p>After the ceremony, the bride and bridegroom were re-conducted in pomp to their houſe, the front of which was illuminated, and ornamented with flowers and foliage; cups of wine were given to all the gueſts, and the young people received noſegays bound with threads of gold, the perſon who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them ſaying, <hi>Go ye and marry alſo.</hi> Theſe words rouſed the attention of Alphonſo, who looked at Theliſmar. A banquet ſucceded, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing continued till midnight (45).</p>
            <p>Alphonſo left this feaſt in a ſorrowful mood; the remembrance of Dalinda, and the fear of never, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, taſting a happineſs ſuch as he had been a ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of, afflicted him deeply. This melancholy continued ſeveral days, but it was inſenſibly diſſipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the new and agreeable objects which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him, and eſpecially by the tenderneſs of Theliſmar.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:020385_0112_0FAF00DF10CF67E0"/>
Theliſmar and Alphonſo every day after their walk, went regularly to the embroidering room, whither Glycera, and the young friends of Zoë al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways came; Nicandor explained, in a whiſper, to the ſtrangers, the ſubjects of the tales related by theſe young Greeks; and when Zoë ſpoke, Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo became particularly attentive; he often would change places with Nicandor or Theliſmar, the better to ſee them embroider, and he remained longeſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at the frame of Zoë; he praiſed all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, but he only looked at that of Zoë; he once more undertook to deſign flowers, and offered every day a new pattern to Zoë for her embroidery; at laſt he began continually to vaunt of the manners and cuſtoms of Greece; and thought Buyuk-Dairai the moſt delightful place he had ever ſeen.</p>
            <p>One morning when he was alone with Theliſmar, the latter praiſed him highly for his conduct. I am quite enchanted with you, continued he, dear Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo; I ſee you begin to acquire a command over yourſelf.</p>
            <p>Do I?</p>
            <p>Yes; and I cannot conceal my ſatisfaction; for theſe three weeks paſt you have learnt to hide and overcome that melancholy, at which I was ſo uneaſy; you are obliging, amiable, and attentive in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and what muſt have coſt you more than all the reſt, you ſpeak no longer of Dalinda; be aſſured I feel the value of this effort.</p>
            <p>So ſaying, Theliſmar embraced Alphonſo, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his embrance with a cold and mournful air, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any reply; a moment's ſilence ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:020385_0113_0FAF00E0B78614B0"/>
Alphonſo walked thoughtfully about his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, then ſuddenly turning, No, Theliſmar, ſaid he, I muſt not deceive you; I ſhould be unworthy of your kindneſs, were I to leave you in an error—he ſtopt and bluſhed.</p>
            <p>What would you ſay? anſwered Theliſmar.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, exclaimed Alphonſo, I am going to ruin myſelf.</p>
            <p>Ruin yourſelf! what, by being ſincere! and to me, Alphonſo! Can you ſuppoſe it?</p>
            <p>Know then, that though my heart is always the ſame, though Dalinda alone has touched it, and though, were it not for the hope of becoming your ſon, life would be a burthen—yet—if I have ceaſed to ſpeak of her, if I have ſeemed chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, do not attibute this conduct to the efforts of reaſon, but on the contrary to—</p>
            <p>Come to my arms, interrupted Theliſmar, come noble and dear Alphonſo, this proof of thy candour and confidence juſtifies my affection for thee.</p>
            <p>Oh my father! Oh my indulgent friend! cried Alphonſo.—</p>
            <p>See, continued Theliſmar, how fleeting a ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion love is, dear Alphonſo, when not confirmed by an affectionate and ſolid friendſhip: two large black eyes, an ingenious countenance, a ſweet ſmile, and five or ſix ſtories which you did not underſtand, have made you, in three weeks, forget the object of that paſſion which you preſented was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> violent.</p>
            <p>It is true, that the young Zoë amuſed and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted are; it is true, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> my ſorrows from my mind, and that Dalinda was leſs frequently
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:020385_0114_0FAF00E1CDC26E30"/>
preſent to my imagination, but ſhe was ever in my heart.</p>
            <p>Do not deceive yourſelf, Alphonſo, you have yet no real attachment to Dalinda, becauſe, at preſent, you know nothing of her but her form.</p>
            <p>But that form proclaima a ſoul ſo pure, ſo ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or! Beſides, I know Dalinda by her letters, her acquirements, her tenderneſs for you! In a word, Dalinda is the daughter of Theliſmar, and is not that enough to make her paſſionately beloved?</p>
            <p>All that is not a ſufficient foundation for a deep and durable attachment, which cannot exiſt without mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſidence and friendſhip. But let me aſk you a queſtion concerning Zoë: how has it happened, that you have not perceived the impreſſion ſhe has made upon you?</p>
            <p>It muſt certainly be a want of reflection.</p>
            <p>Imagine then, for a moment, the conſequence of wanting ſuch reflection. I have more than once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that Nicandor and Glaphira do not approve your exceſſive reſpect for Zoë; ſo many attentions, a preference ſo marked, muſt ſoon injure the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the young virgin to whom they are paid. You have riſqued troubling the repoſe of, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorrow into a houſe, where their treatment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all our gratitude.</p>
            <p>Heavens! you make me ſhudder—but henceforth I will think, I will each day ſeverely examine my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, my ſenſations, and, what may be more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, I will every day conſult you, and never more will I conceal my thoughts from you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="unknown:020385_0115_0FAF00E216907570"/>
And now, ſaid Theliſmar, I muſt quit myſelf of a promiſe which I have not forgotten. So ſaying, he opened a caſket, took out the faſh of Dalinda, and gave it Alphonſo. It belongs to you, ſaid he, you have a right to it, ſince I promiſed it to you on the very firſt proof of your ſincerity.—</p>
            <p>Oh Theliſmar, ſaid Alphonſo, greatly affected, what a moment have you choſen! And am I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to receive a pledge ſo dear in this houſe!</p>
            <p>Yes; if it ſtill continues dear to you; if you have ſtill the ſame ſentiments.</p>
            <p>Then I dare accept it—Alphonſo threw himſelf at Theliſmar's feet, recceived the ſaſh of Dalinda kneeling, and kiſſed with tranſport the hand that gave it.</p>
            <p>Remember, Alphonſo, ſaid Theliſmar, this from a father, is no light, no trifling gift; from this moment our engagement is mutually ſacred. I have adopted you as a ſon; I promiſe you an amiable and virtuous companion for life; of whom you muſt become worthy, not by a romantic paſſion, but by a ſtable and uniform virtue. Continue to inform your mind, and improve your temper and underſtanding; it is thus you muſt prove your love for Dalinda, and ſhew your gratitude for my affection.</p>
            <p>Nicandor came and interrupted their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Alphonſo, too much moved to ſupport the preſence of a third perſon, retired: he wiſhed for ſolitude, that he might indulge, without conſtraint, the tranſports of his heart. It is needleſs to obſerve, that from that day forward he deſigned no more patterns for Zoë, paid her no other attentions than
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:020385_0116_0FAF00E2D50FC8E0"/>
ſuch as good breeding demanded, and avoided go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the embroidering room.</p>
            <p>The family of Nicandor, however, met an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected affliction; one of their friends, lately return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Iſle of Calki<note n="*" place="bottom">It is the ninth of the Propontis Iſlands, anciently called Daemoneri, or the Iſles of the Genii.

               </note>, to which he had made a ſhort voyage, fell ill and died in four days time. Nicandor related many intereſting particulars of the friend he had loſt; and told how he had renounced the riches and honours which he had a right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that he might yield himſelf, without controul, to the delights of friendſhip and ſtudy.</p>
            <p>This ſage, continued Nicandor, who had retired to a pleaſant houſe (46) near mine diſtributed the greater part of his income to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> he conſecrated the rest to the embelliſhment of his habitation: his heart was virtuous, and his temper ſimple; he cultivated his garden himſelf, watered his flowers, and bred birds, for which he made an extenſive aviary. Such were his innocent amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Beloved by his friends, adored by his ſlaves, he had a ſiſter worthy of himſelf, who lived with him, went with him every where, and who never can forget his loſs. To-morrow, continued Nicandor, we ſhall perform the laſt duties of friendſhip; his ſiſter will conduct the funeral rites.</p>
            <p>But how will ſhe have the fortitude? ſaid Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="unknown:020385_0117_0FAF00E39119D2A8"/>
You are a man, anſwered Nicandor, who wiſh to know our manners, to ſtudy nature; come and ſee this ſorrowful ceremony; you will there behold the workings of deſpair. Grief among us is never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, it is ſeen in all its energy.

            <p>This converſation excited the curioſity of Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, who did not fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and with the face uncovered, was laid in his coffin; the ſlaves were kneeling round, and venting their grief by tears and groans. Among them Theliſmar diſtinguiſhed an old man, ſtill more profoundly afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than the reſt, to whom Nicandor went and ſpoke.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar queſtioned Nicandor concerning this old man, who anſwered his name was Zaphiri. He was preſent at the birth of him we lament, ſaid Nicandor; he is almoſt paſt the uſe of his limbs, and the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of following the burial, adds to his grief: he has juſt told me, there is but one remaining pleaſure for him on earth, the feeding of the birds, and the culture of the flowers, which once were his dear maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's delight.</p>
            <p>Nicandor was ſpeaking, when Alphenſo and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſmar felt their blood run cold at the broken accents and dolorous cries they heard: it is the wretched Euphroſine, ſaid Nicandor. Immediately a woman

appeared, in long mourning garments, with diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hair, pale checks, and bathed in tears; ſhe was ſupported by two ſlaves, and ſeemed ſcarcely able to drag her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>low ſteps along; the auguſt and affecting picture of a grief ſo profound, made her natural beauty more ſtriking, more majeſtic; and her ſhrieks, her lamentable groans, were uttered in an accent ſo penetrating and ſo real, that it was impoſſible to hear them, and not at once feel aſtoniſhment, terror, and the moſt heart-rending pity.</p>
            <p>The Patrian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

After paſſing through the village, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding leſs than a mile into the country, they came to a place over-ſpread with cypreſs-trees, tombs, and ſepulchral-columns.</p>
            <p>Euphroſine ſhrieked, and hid her face in her veil, as ſoon as ſhe perceived at a diſtance the ſepulchre prepared for her brother.

and ſhuddered; it was the occupation of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed; ſhe ran towards the ſlave, what art thou doing Zaphiri, cried ſhe?</p>
            <p>Alas! I am tending the flowers my maſter loved ſo much.</p>
            <p>Miſerable old man, ſaid ſhe, ſeizing the hoe, thy maſter is no more: this place muſt be evermore the place of ſorrow, of deſolation; let all that embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es it die, be its pleaſures annihilated; open the nets; give liberty to thoſe birds, whoſe warbling and mirth diſtract my heart; and theſe flowers, nurtured by my brother's hand, let them periſh with him.</p>
            <p>So ſaying, Euphroſine wildly and rapidly ran, cutting down, and trampling on all the flowers in her path (47).</p>
            <p>This affecting ſcene made a ſtrong impreſſion on the heart of Alphonſo; tell me, ſaid he to Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, when they were got home, how does it happen that ideas ſo oppoſite, may be the reſult of the ſame feelings? Why does this old man delight to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the flowers of his maſter, while Euphroſine, on the contrary, finds a kind of conſolation in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?</p>
            <p>Which of theſe two actions do you prefer? aſked Theliſmar in his turn.</p>
            <p>That of the old man appeared moſt natural, and yet the other affected me more.</p>
            <p>Common feelings produce only common effects, while a deep ſenſibility naturally begets extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ideas and actions: thus, for example, if the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who has intereſted us ſo much, if Euphroſine had reaſon, taſte, and diſcernment, as well as ſuch
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:020385_0121_0FAF00E81A5397F0"/>
ſtrong paſſions, and if ſhe were then to write, her works would certainly poſſeſs originality, energy, feeling, and truth.</p>
            <p>And is it not the poſſeſſion of theſe qualities which conſtitutes genius?</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly! If genius did not originate in the ſoul, would it be a gift ſo precious, ſo deſirable, or could it ſo powerfully excite envy?</p>
            <p>Theliſmar and Alphonſo paſſed ſome few more days at Buyuk-Dairai; after which they took leave of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candor and his amiable family, quitted Greece, and entered Aſia by Natolia.

            <p>During this voyage Theliſmar and Alphonſo were one evening walking the deck, and converſing on the wonders of nature. I think at preſent, ſaid Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, I know them all.</p>
            <p>Dear Alphonſo, ſince you are ſo learned, replied Theliſmar, explain the meaning of the phaenomenon which at this moment appears; look this way on yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der waves.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo went to Theliſmar, and looking as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, beheld the veſſel encircled by fire, to which the total darkneſs of the night gave an additional
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:020385_0122_0FAF00E8D8016E78"/>
brilliancy; the ſurface of the ſea was entirely covered with ſmall ſparkling ſtars, and every wave, as it broke, caſt forth a ſhining light.</p>
            <p>The wake of the veſſel was of a luminous ſilver white, interſperſed with dazzling azure ſparks (49).</p>
            <p>In confeſs, ſaid Alphonſo, this is a glorious ſight, and abſolutely new to me.</p>
            <p>Come let us go to bed, replied Theliſmar; and ſhould you happen to awake in the night, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded you will make ſome ſolitary reflections on that preſumption which is but too natural to you, and which perſuades you of the extent of your knowledge, when every day proves the contrary.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo made no reply, but embraced Theliſmar, and went to bed.</p>
            <p>Scarcely had he been aſleep half an hour, before there was a noiſe in his cabin that awaked him: he had put out his light, and was frightened at opening his eyes, by perceiving fire on the partition oppoſite his bed; he roſe haſtily, and his ſurprize increaſed at beholding, in large legiable letters of ſire, theſe words written upon the boards:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Learned Alphonſo, your terror is ill ſounded, this fire burns not</hi> (50).</p>
            <p>Aſhamed and aſtoniſhed, Alphonſo put his hand upon theſe fiery characters, and felt no heat: Oh Theliſmar! cried he, what ſurprizes me the moſt is, that you have the art to render the leſſons which wound ſelf-love agreeable. Theliſmar immediately appeared, with a light in his hand, ſmiling; and after having explained to him the nature of this ſeeming fire, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and Alphonſo once more went to ſleep.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="unknown:020385_0123_0FAF00E9B5C2DF8"/>
It is alſo time that we ſhould go to ſleep, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Barronneſs, for the evening has been much longer than uſual.</p>
            <p>The next evening Madame de Clémire again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued her hiſtory of Alphonſo.</p>
            <p>Our travellers being arrived at Viſapour, viſited the diamond mines (51), and afterwards went to the Court of the great Mogul. Theliſmar having obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an audience of the Emperor, was permitted with Alphonſo to ſee the Palace. They paſſed through many apartments, and found, in all of them, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful women, in magnificent habits, armed with lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who formed the interior guard of the palace. They came to a vaſt and ſplendid hall, hung with gold brocade, where the Monarch was ſitting on a Throne of Mother of Pearl, entirely covered with rubies and emeralds; four Columns, all beſpread with diamonds, ſupported a canopy of ſilver, embroidered with ſapphires, and ornamented with feſtoons and pearls; a ſuperb trophy, compoſed of the Emperor's arms, his quiver, bow, and ſabre, garniſhed with jewels, and connected by a chain of topazes and diamonds, were ſuſpended to one of the columns; the Emperor himſelf was in cloth of gold, and in the centre of his turban was a diamond of prodigious brightneſs, and ſo large, that it extended almoſt over his whole front: various rows of fine pearl formed his bracelets and collar; and an infinity of precious ſtones, of various colours, enriched his girdle and his buſkins: before him was a table of maſſive gold, and all the great lords of his court, in moſt ſumptuous robes, were ſtanding ranged round his throne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="unknown:020385_0124_0FAF00EA54032370"/>
Theliſmar preſented to him ſeveral mathematical inſtruments, of which, by means of an interpreter, he explained the uſe. The Emperor ſeemed pleaſed with the preſents and converſation of Theliſmar; told him, it was his birth-day; that the whole empire ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated the feſtival, and invited Alphonſo and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar to ſpend the evening in his palace.</p>
            <p>Evening came; wine was brought in vaſes of rock chryſtal; every body was ſeated, fruits were ſerved in plated of gold; the muſicians entered, and the hall ſoon reſounded with cymbals and trumpets. The Emperor filled a goblet of wine, and ſent it to The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar; the goblet was of gold, enriched with the turquoiſe, the emerald, and the ruby. When he had drank, the Emperor deſired him to keep the cup and mark of his friendſhip.</p>
            <p>When the repaſt was almoſt ended, two large baſons of rubies were brought the Emperor, which he threw among the courtiers, who all ſcrambled for them. Soon after two other baſons were brought full of gold and ſilver almonds, which were thrown, and ſnatched with the ſame avidity.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar and Alphonſo, as you may well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſat ſtill, aſhamed of, and contemning the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs and meanneſs of the Mogul lords.</p>
            <p>The Emperor alſo diſtributed pieces of gold-ſtuff and rich girdles to ſeveral of the muſicians, and ſome of the courtiers; after which the drinking began. Theliſmar and Alphonſo were the only people who remained ſober; the Emperor, unable to ſit upright, hung his head and fell aſleep, and then every body retired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="unknown:020385_0125_0FAF00EB1F30D530"/>
When Alphonſo and Theliſmar were alone, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar ſaid to the former, What do you think of this Court?</p>
            <p>I think, replied Alphonſo, he is the richeſt and moſt magnificent Sovereign upon earth.</p>
            <p>And the happieſt, and moſt reſpectable likewiſe?</p>
            <p>I know not if he be happy, for I know not if he be loved, if his reign be peaceable and glorious: but I confeſs there is nothing auguſt in his perſon; nothing which enforces reverence. There is not a ſingle Prince in Europe, who has ſo little the air of majeſty.</p>
            <p>And yet there is no European Sovereign, who may be any way compared to him for pomp and ſhew. Gold, pearls, diamonds, and all the Aſiatic oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do not therefore of themſelves impreſs any real reſpect. What muſt we think then of thoſe frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Europeans, who affix ſo great and imaginary a value on thoſe ſhining trifles? I wiſh the European women, who are richeſt in ſuch poſſeſſions, and who are ſometimes properly enough, by way of deriſion, called queens of diamonds, I wiſh they could be tranſported here for twenty-four hours. What would one of them ſay, at ſeeing herſelf totally ſurpaſſed in ſuch bright ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bles, by the very ſlaves of the Emperors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ives.</p>
            <p>For my part, anſwered Alphonſo, bluſhing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, I ſhall no more mention the diamonds that my father loſt during the earthquake at Liſbon. But pray tell me how it happens, that the great Lords of this Court, who ſeem ſo rich, are yet ſo covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:020385_0126_0FAF00ECB0284EE0"/>
How meanly did they huſtle one another for the gold and jewels the Emperor threw.</p>
            <p>Their whole emulation is that of being more ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbly dreſt than others; they only ſeek to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh themſelves by ſilly outſide ſhew; and you ſee how much this kind of vanity, carried to exceſs, can make men capable of the moſt degrading acts. But to return to the Emperor: you ſay you are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant if he be happy; can you ſuppoſe a monarch ſo ignorant, ſo debaſed, happy.</p>
            <p>If he be good, he may be beloved.</p>
            <p>We do not love whom we deſpiſe; ought he not, for the good of his people, to be well informed, juſt, and eſtimable. Beſides, this Monarch has no ſubjects, they are only ſlaves, and he is a deſpot; he exerciſes a tyrannical power outwardly, while he is inwardly tormented by all the fears and terrors, which ever were the juſt puniſhment of tyrants. The homage paid him is forced; and while adulation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers him incenſe, hatred is ſecretly conſpiring his deſtruction; his life is paſt in ſuſpicion, or the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of traitors; he is in continual fear of all that approach him; and to complete his miſery, his very children are ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>The next day, Theliſmar and Alphonſo went early to the palace; the Mogul was then at war with the Sovereign of Decan, and was going to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the camp where his troops were aſſembled. His wives were mounted on elephants that waited at their doors: Theliſmar counted eighty of theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals all pompouſty equipped; the little towers they carried were plated with gold, and embelliſhed with
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:020385_0127_0FAF00ED99F16F08"/>
mother-of-pearl; the ſame metal too formed the bars of their grated windows; a canopy of cloth of ſilver, with taſſels hung with rubies, covered each tower.</p>
            <p>The Emperor was carried in a palanquin of gold and mother-of-pearl, ſet with pearls and precious ſtones: many other palanquins followed that of the Emperor, and a vaſt number of trumpets, drums, and other inſtruments, mixed among a crowd of officers, richly clothed, who carried rich canopies, and umbrellas, of brocaded gold, hung, with pearls, rubies, and diamonds, led the proceſſion.</p>
            <p>Our travellers, after having admired the ſplender of his camp, quitted the court of the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul (52), and went to the kingdom of Siam. Here they ſaw the famous white elephant ſo much revered in India: his apartment is magnificent, he is ſerved kneeling, and in veſſels of gold<note n="*" place="bottom">They have the ſame reſpect for white elephants at Laos, Pegu, &amp;c.</note>.

            </p>
            <p>There was now but one part of the world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to our travellers, America, for which they embarked, and came to California; from thence they went to mexico; and as they were on their route to the town of Tlaſcala, Theliſmar looking at his watch, ſtopt his carriage, and alighted; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:020385_0128_0FAF00EEA65508B8"/>
his ſervants to wait, and carefully look to the horſes; for, added he, night will ſuddenly overtake us.</p>
            <p>How! ſaid Alphonſo, laughing, night! not ſo ſuddenly, for it is only noon.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar made no reply, but ſeeking the ſhade, turned towards ſome trees at a little diſtance. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo, as he followed, perceived an animal, the extraordinary figure of which raiſed his attention; it was nineteen or twenty inches long, without rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning the tail, which was at leaſt twelve, and ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, like a ſerpent; its ears were like thoſe of the ſmall owl, and its hair erect.</p>
            <p>The animal ſtood ſtill, and Alphonſo wiſhed to examine it; he obſerved it was waiting for its young, which were running towards it; as they came up, it put them one after another into a bag or pouch beneath its belly, then ran towards the trees.</p>
            <p>Deſirous of obſerving ſo ſingular an animal nearer, and finding that it could not run faſt, Alphonſo purſued it; he had juſt overtaken it when it came to the foot of a tree, up which it ran with ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agility, and ſeizing the end of one of its high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt branches with its tail, twiſed it round, and there remained ſuſpended, apparently motionleſs (53).</p>
            <p>Alphonſo was going to mount the tree, when he heard on every ſide of him a loud crackling, which redoubling, ſeemed like the diſcharge of artillery; at the ſame inſtant he was covered with an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable multitude of ſmall black grains, darted on him from all parts (54). He haſtily drew back, and
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:020385_0129_0FAF00EED6324040"/>
hid his eyes with his hands, which were conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hurt by the grains that had ſtruck them.</p>
            <p>The pain was ſo great, that he was obliged to keep them ſhut for ſome minutes, at laſt he opened them, but no ſooner had he done ſo, than he cried out, Oh heaven! I am blind! Oh Theliſmar! Oh Dalinda! I ſhall never ſee you more.—Theliſmar, Theliſmar, where are you?—Do not abandon the unhappy Alphonſo.</p>
            <p>As he ſaid this, he heard pretty near him a burſt of laughter, and knew it was the voice of Theliſmar. What then, continued he, does Theliſmar inſult my miſery? No; it is not poſſible.</p>
            <p>He then recollected that Theliſmar, when he got out of his carriage, had told his ſervants that night approached; he began therefore to take courage, and doubt the truth of his blindneſs, nothwithſtanding the midnight darkneſs that ſurrounded him; he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ſound of Theliſmar's voice, till he found and ſeized him in his arms.</p>
            <p>I cannot at preſent, ſaid Theliſmar, ſerve you as a guide, Alphonſo, for I am as blind as you are.</p>
            <p>Thanks be to heaven, replied Alphonſo, that I am acquitted for the fright only; I find now, that the cauſe of my fear is nothing but an eclipſe of the ſun; but I did not think that eclipſes ever produced ſuch total darkneſs, nor can I conceive by what art you could foretell, with ſo much preciſion, the exact mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this phaenomenon.</p>
            <p>While Alphonſo was ſpeaking, the ſun, once more beginning to appear, diſſipated the fearful obſcurity that had blackened every object; the profound ſilence,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:020385_0130_0FAF00EF9E51A860"/>
the midnight calm, ſoon ceaſed, and nature ſeemed to revive; the birds, with freſh animation, thinking they ſang the return of Aurora, gave notice by their loud and lively warblings, of the birth of day (55).</p>
            <p>Theliſmar and Alphonſo now regained their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the eclipſe, the animal, and the ſtrange artillery, furniſhed our travellers with ſubjects for converſation, which were not exhauſted when they arrived at Tlaſcala.</p>
            <p>Quitting Mexico, Theliſmar and Alphonſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked for St. Domingo; here Alphonſo flattered himſelf he ſhould find a letter from his father; he was miſtaken, but he received news from Portugal, though ſuch as gave him great affliction.</p>
            <p>He learnt, that Don Ramirez had not returned to Portugal; that the public opinion was totally changed concerning his being again taken into favour, and ſent on an embaſſy; moſt people even ſuppoſed him exiled, but were totally ignorant to what part of the world he he was retired.</p>
            <p>This intelligence overwhelmed Alphonſo with grief; uncertain now of what might be his father's fate, his remorſe became more keen than ever.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar came to ſeek him, juſt as he was in the midſt of theſe melancholy thoughts. I come to tell you, ſaid Theliſmar, you will ſee Dalinda much ſooner than you hoped; ſhe is at Paris with her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they will wait for us there; to-morrow we will depart for Surinam, from thence we will embark for France, whith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> we ſhall go directly. But in the mean time, added Theliſmar, before you ſee Dalinda,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:020385_0131_0FAF00F055F58560"/>
I will ſhew you a preſent I have juſt received from her. Here, open this, do you recollect that form?</p>
            <p>Heavens! cried Alphonſo, it is the portrait of Dalinda! What a wonderful picture! What a ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likeneſs! How perfect is the painter's art!</p>
            <p>This picture will intereſt you ſtill more, when you know it is the work of Dalinda herſelf.</p>
            <p>Dalinda! Has ſhe then every talent as well as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very charm? Oh permit me once more to look on this precious painting.—Yes; behold her ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic features; look, there is her enchanting ſmile. How happy, Theliſmar, are you in the poſſeſſion of ſuch a treaſure!</p>
            <p>And yet I deſire another picture of her; I would have her paint herſelf once more, but with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band by her ſide; and when, Alphonſo, ſhe ſhall give me that, I promiſe you ſhall have this.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo only replied by tenderly preſſing the hands of Theliſmar, and watering them with his tears.</p>
            <p>Far from feeling a joy pure and unmixed, he looked upon it as his indiſpenſable duty to return to Portugal, hoping there to find ſome ſort of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning his father: he was unalterably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to declare his reſolution of going thither to Theliſmar; but this reſolution was too painful, not to cauſe the moſt violent agitations in his mind.</p>
            <p>He had never had the courage to confeſs a fault, for which he juſtly and bitterly reproached himſelf; he wanted the power to tell ſo dear à friend he had left Spain clandeſtinely, without his father's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and this firſt diſſimulation, had obliged him

to diſguiſe the truth in a thouſand other inſtances: at laſt, however, he firmly purpoſed to expiate all his wrongs by his ſincerity, without reſerve, and, if neceſſary, by the moſt painful ſacrifices; and in this diſpoſition left Saint Domingo. They arrived at Surinam<note n="*" place="bottom">Surinam is a Dutch colony, of about 30 leagues ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, along the river of Surinam, in Guiana.</note> about duſk, and were ſtruck by a moſt brilliant ſpectacle at their firſt entering that country. The coaſt ſeemed covered with an infinity of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliers, hung without order, at unequal diſtances. Theliſmar and Alphonſo were admiring this agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble illumination, when they perceived many of the lights were in motion, and advancing towards them.</p>
            <p>A moment after they plainly diſtinguiſhed eight or ten men who walked nimbly, though they ſeemed covered with ſmall lighted candles; ſome on their bonnets, ſome on their ſhoes, and ſome on their hands. This viſion greatly ſurprized Alphonſo, who wanted to come near theſe men; but they paſſed haſtily by, and, as Alphonſo did not underſtand the language of his guides, he could not ſatisfy his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.</p>
            <p>When they came to the houſe where they were to lodge, they were ſhewn into a pretty chamber, as clear as day; but, as Alphonſo remarked, that the lights were placed in two ſmall glaſs lanterns, he wiſhed to ſee them nearer: he then diſcovered, with aſtoniſhment, they were nothing but green flies, of a bright emerald colour, which gave all this light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="unknown:020385_0133_0FAF00F22B9418F0"/>
We have now an explanation of the thing we wanted, ſaid Theliſmar; the trees being in a conic form, are covered with theſe flies, and reſemble, at a diſtance, girandoles and chandeliers hung in the air; the men we met, had faſtened theſe ſhining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects on their bonnets and feet, and carried them in glaſs tubes in their hands.</p>
            <p>The very ſame eveing, Alphonſo learnt theſe beautiful flies were more than one way uſeful. When he was in bed, they were taken from their little lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns and let fly about the room, in which he was informed, they would kill the knats, which might otherwiſe diſturb his reſt (56).</p>
            <p>Alphonſo, however, a prey to inward grief and chagrin, could not cloſe his eyes the whole night; he roſe before day-break, determined no longer to defer opening his heart to Theliſmar, but to inform him of all his faults, and all his ſorrows.</p>
            <p>He went to walk upon the ſea-ſhore till Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar ſhould riſe, and after ſtraying a conſiderable time, ſat down at the foot of a tree, where he fell into a vague and painful reverie; preſently his eyes became heavy, he began to doze, and in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was aſleep. He was awaked by a piercing and ſorrowful cry, and opening his eyes, ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the arms of Theliſmar, who was bearing him away.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo endeavoured to ſpeak, but could only utter ſome broken and plaintive ſounds; pale and faint, he could not ſupport himſelf, he wanted even the power of thought. Theliſmar laid him down on the graſs, ran towards the ſea, filled his hat with
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:020385_0134_0FAF00F43438C258"/>
ſalt-water, and made Alphonſo drink it; after which, with the help of ſome ſervants, he raiſed and took him home.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo came to himſelf by degrees. Where am I, ſaid he, as he felt his ſtrength returning?</p>
            <p>Oh my ſon, ſaid Theliſmar, have I not ſpoken to you of this fatal tree? Have I not told you, that to ſleep beneath its perfidious ſhade is to die (57)?</p>
            <p>It is true, cried Alphonſo, with a languiſhing voice, I recollect it now.</p>
            <p>Providence be praiſed, you are out of danger; but had not my fears for you brought me where you lay, the very inſtant they did, I ſhould have loſt you, Alphonſo.</p>
            <p>And do you weep for me, my father? For me! Oh moſt affectionate of friends! beſt of benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors! wherefore have you ſnatched me from the arms of death? I had then been regretted by you. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar, while weeping for the miſerable Alphonſo, would then have been ignorant of his worſt errors.</p>
            <p>What do you mean, Alphonſo?</p>
            <p>I am overpowered by your favours, penetrated by your bounties; my affection for you is the reigning ſentiment of my heart, and yet I am the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate of men.</p>
            <p>Heavens! Which way? how?</p>
            <p>A ſingle word, Theliſmar, may make you judge of my ſituation; I cannot follow you to France!</p>
            <p>And why not?</p>
            <p>Sacred duty dictates my return to Portugal: Oh! that by this painful ſacrifice I could expiate my fault!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="unknown:020385_0135_0FAF00F50D9DE6A0"/>
What fearful remorſe is it that overwhelms you?—But—no—thou art incapable of wickedneſs or meaneſs; ſpeak, be confident, open thy heart to thy friend.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo ſhed tears of gratitude and joy at hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, was ſilent a few moments, then taking courage, owned, without reſerve, how he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Theliſmar, when he aſſured him that Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirez approved his travels; related the circumſtance of his flight, and painted, in the moſt moving man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, his remorſe, and uninterrupted inquietude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fate of his father.</p>
            <p>When he had finiſhed his recital, Theliſmar, with a ſoftened heart looked at him, and ſaid, No, I will not abandon thee; I myſelf will conduct thee to Portugal.</p>
            <p>Theſe words inſpired Alphonſo with gratitude ſo ſtrong, ſo paſſionate, he could only expreſs it by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the feet of his generous friend.</p>
            <p>Yes, continued Theliſmar, we will find this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy father; I will enjoy the pleaſure of giving thee again to his arms; for I dare aſſure him thou now wilt make him happy. We ſhall arrive ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what later in France, but Dalinda will ſee thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to heaven and thyſelf, and honoured with the paternal benediction, Don Ramirez will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conſent, without ſcruple, to your union with Dalinda. My fortune is not immenſe, but it is more than ſufficient; the ties which attached Don Rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez to Portugal, are all broken; it will be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing to engage him to look on Sweden as his country, and my houſe as his own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="unknown:020385_0136_0FAF00F5F50DB210"/>
This is too much, ſaid Alphonſo; Oh Theliſmar! let me breathe; my heart cannot expreſs its feelings towards a benefactor ſuch as you; gratitude becomes a paſſion; words are weak; I cannot tell you what I think.</p>
            <p>This converſation delivered Alphonſo from one part of his troubles; the indulgence and tenderneſs of Theliſmar aſſuaged the bitterneſs of remorſe, and gave birth to the ſweeteſt hopes.</p>
            <p>Before they quitted Surinam, Theliſmar and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo were invited on a fiſhing party, and roſe on the day appointed early in the morning. In their way to the ſea-ſide, they croſſed a marſh full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary trees; from their flexible branches, bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of filaments hung down, lay upon the ground, took root, grew, and formed other trees, as beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful as thoſe to which they were united, and of which they were only ſhoots, which again multiplied after the ſame manner; inſomuch that a ſingle tree might become the parent ſtock of a whole foreſt.</p>
            <p>But what moſt ſurprized Alphonſo was, that theſe trees were covered with ſhell-fiſh! A multitude of oyſters were fixed to their branches (58)</p>
            <p>Theliſmar was explaining the cauſe of theſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular things, when they arrived on the ſtrand; they went on board, the fiſhing began, the net was thrown, and the haul was a good one.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo ſeeing an exceeding large fiſh, very like an eel, went and touched it with a little ſwitch that he had in his hand; no ſooner had he done ſo, than he felt ſo great a pain in his arm and hand, that he gave a loud cry before he could recollect himſelf.
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:020385_0137_0FAF00F66025A128"/>
The fiſhermen all began to laugh: and Alphonſo, piqued and aſtoniſhed, remained motionleſs awhile.</p>
            <p>Recovering himſelf, he went again to the fiſh, and ſaid, I do not know how the touching this fiſh can cauſe ſo violent a ſhock; but I will ſhew you at leaſt, that though I may be ſurprized, I am not to be intimidated.</p>
            <p>So ſaying, he ſtooped down and touched the fiſh with his hand. He did not cry out this time; but he received ſo terrible a ſhock, that if Theliſmar had not ſtepped forward, and catched him in his arms, he would have fallen; and was ſo ſtunned by the violence of the ſtroke, that he almoſt loſt the uſe of his ſenſes.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was perfectly recovered, I will ſhew you, ſaid Theliſmar, a ſtill more aſtoniſhing effect produced by this fiſh. We are fourteen people in all, let us form a circle, and each hold the other by the hand: I will ſtand firſt, and you laſt; I will touch the fiſh with a ſtick, and, although ſeparated from me by twelve people, you ſhall yet feel the fame ſhock as I.</p>
            <p>The experiment was made, and confirmed all that Theliſmar had predicted (59).</p>
            <p>The day after this adventure, our travellers quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Surinam and America, and embarked for Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal. During the voyage, Theliſmar, in return for the confidence Alphonſo had placed in him, ſatisfied a curioſity he had long entertained. Alphonſo could not conceive how Theliſmar might reſolve to quit his country for four years, and tear himſelf from a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſo dear to him, for ſo long a time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="unknown:020385_0138_0FAF00F714F7A530"/>
Theliſmar informed him, that his Sovereign, being the protector of literature and learned men, had engaged him to make this ſacrifice: the favours of my King, continued he, my love of ſcience, and the particular delight I take in natural hiſtory, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined me to undertake an enterprize, the fatigues of which my friendſhip for you has made me chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſupport; the care of forming your heart, and enlightening your mind, together with the affection you have inſpired me with, alone could ſoften the uneaſineſs and chagrin I have often felt, and which are inſeparable from the feeling mind abſent from its native home.</p>
            <p>After a favourable voyage our travellers landed in Portugal, where all the information that Alphonſo could procure, relative to Don Ramirez, was very feeble and inſufficient. They aſſured him, that his father had not been ſeen there during the laſt two years, and, after an infinity of reſearches, Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was perſuaded Don Ramirez was either in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, or in Ruſſia. The intereſts of his family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Theliſmar ſhould go to England; this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo knew: therefore in quitting Portugal he had the conſolation to think he ſhould not ſtay in France, but follow Theliſmar and Dalinda to a land in which he hoped to find his father.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar, as they drew near to France, thought proper to make his young pupil promiſe carefully to conceal his love from Dalinda. You will travel with her, ſaid he; I have told you it is the wiſh of my heart to unite, by the moſt holy ties, two objects who are now almoſt equally dear to me; but you
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:020385_0139_0FAF00F7D73F5AE0"/>
cannot, Alphonſo, diſpoſe of yourſelf without a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's conſent: I have no doubt his conſent will be granted; yet there is a poſſibility it may be refuſed.</p>
            <p>Oh heavens! refuſed!</p>
            <p>Were I to preſent you to Dalinda, as her future huſband, ſhe would look upon you, beyond diſpute, with the eye of affection; and, uncertain as we are, would it be right to hazard troubling the repoſe of her life?</p>
            <p>I trouble her repoſe, or trouble your's! though but for a moment? No; let me rather never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her—but we are ſo certain of my father's conſent.</p>
            <p>And yet, ſuppoſe, through ſome unaccountable caprice, he ſhould refuſe.</p>
            <p>What, my father pronounce ſentence of death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me!</p>
            <p>Either Alphonſo, I have loſt the fruits of all my cares, or you will ſupport this miſfortune with forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Is it in the power of fate to make us miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble while we are virtuous, and while we poſſeſs a faithful friend?</p>
            <p>Oh Theliſmar! you ſhall for ever be the ſovereign arbitrator of my deſtiny. Do you not diſpoſe of my actions, my opinions, my feelings, as you pleaſe? Oh yes; and the aſcendency you have acquired you can never loſe; reaſon, virtue, gratitude, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip confirm your power. I will faithfully follow the law you impoſe—I will ſee Dalinda, and be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent—Yet what an effort! But ſhall I doubt my power to perform what you preſcribe?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="unknown:020385_0140_0FAF00F899526818"/>
Our travellers came to Bourdeaux, whence they immediately departed; and their carriage breaking down at the diſtance of thirty leagues from Paris, they were obliged to ſtop where the accident happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theliſmar wrote from this place to his wife, informing her he ſhould certainly be with her the next day by five in the afternoon at lateſt, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the letter to a courier, who departed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. Theliſmar and his pupil roſe before day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, got into their carriage, and departed for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</p>
            <p>What a charming morning! ſaid Alphonſo, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and embracing Theliſmar, as he beheld the riſing ſun; what a fine day! Before it is ended, I ſhall ſee Dalinda.</p>
            <p>Remember your promiſe, replied Theliſmar; I dread leſt you ſhould betray your feelings at this firſt interview.</p>
            <p>Oh, I am certain of myſelf.</p>
            <p>Do not be too ſure: take my advice; from this moment moderate thoſe tranſports; thoſe joys which in a few hours muſt be totally concealed; let us ſpeak of ſomething elſe.</p>
            <p>How is it poſſible?</p>
            <p>If you wiſh to acquire a command over your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, accuſtom yourſelf to regulate your imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at your pleaſure, and to baniſh any certain train of thoughts, when you wiſh ſo to do.</p>
            <p>But provided my conduct be always rational, will it matter what my thoughts are?</p>
            <p>How is it poſſible to give any marking proofs of fortitude, if we are habitually feeble? He who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:020385_0141_0FAF00F9909D2898"/>
his imagination to have dominion over him, can neither drive from his memory what is dangerous to recollect, nor reject thoughts he ought not to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and can ſuch a perſon always be ſuppoſed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional? The facutly of thinking ſhould be turned to the improvement of the heart and mind; but we pervert this noble faculty, when we ſuffer our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination to dwell upon objects beneath, unworthy of, or derogatory to ourſelves; therefore there is no doubt but the moſt ſecret thoughts of a wiſe man are far more pure and ſublime than his words.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo ſighed, and for a few moments remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſilent; then, by an effort over himſelf, entered again into converſation. Theliſmar ſpoke of their travels, and recapitulated whatever they had ſeen moſt remarkable; diſcourſed on the arts, chymiſtry, botany, and various ſubjects of natural hiſtory, while Alphonſo was inſenſibly drawn to liſten with pleaſure.</p>
            <p>How happy you are, ſaid Alphonſo to Theliſmar; how extenſive your knowledge, nothing can aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, nothing is new to you.</p>
            <p>How miſtaken <hi>you</hi> are, replied Theliſmar. The heaven and earth, the univerſe, all we ſee, all that environs us, is the work of an infinite Being; an eternal book, in which man, till the end of time, ſhall find ſecrets that are impenetrable, objects for ever new, and diſcover, through each ſucceeding age, myſteries the moſt ſublime, without ever know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all.</p>
            <p>Thus converſing, they drew near to Paris, when our travellers, almoſt equally moved, became thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:020385_0142_0FAF00FBBB91DCD8"/>
and ſilent; they remained ſo a conſiderable time. At laſt Alphonſo ſaid to Theliſmar, Will you not own that, at preſent, you do not chuſe your thoughts, but that you are obliged to accept thoſe which ſo forcibly, ſo naturally preſent themſelves?</p>
            <p>As Alphonſo was ſpeaking, the poſtillion told Theliſmar he ſaw ſomething which very much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized him in the air. Theliſmar looked out, and diſcovered, above the clouds, towards Paris, a ſmall round body, opaque and dark, which appeared in motion, and ſlowly approaching as it were, to meet them.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar aſtoniſhed, looked very attentively at this phaenomenon, and his aſtoniſhment increaſed at beholding the body become larger and luminous. He determined to deſcend the better to examine it, and the terrified poſtillion had already ſtopt his horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. They alighted in a charming meadow, adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Arpajon, ſix leagues from Paris; the lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons globe, however, ſeemed ſtill to increaſe in ſize.</p>
            <p>It is a meteor, ſaid Alphonſo, and much ſuch a one as I ſaw in Spain, when I was travelling to Loxe.</p>
            <p>It is no meteor, ſaid Theliſmar.</p>
            <p>What is it then?</p>
            <p>I cannot conceive: it approaches ſtill, and ſtill becomes brighter. Have you your pocket teleſcope about you?</p>
            <p>Yes.</p>
            <p>Lend it me—Theliſmar took the teleſcope that Alphonſo preſented him, and having adjuſted it, looked and cried, it is incredible: I can perceive
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:020385_0143_0FAF00FCAA71A960"/>
underneath this globe a kind of veſſel, a ſmall ſhip faſtened to it; this is certainly an illuſion—Here, take your turn to look.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo took the teleſcope, and preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, good God! I ſee a man!</p>
            <p>Theliſmar began to laugh; you have hit it, ſaid he, it is Abaris the Scythian<note n="*" place="bottom">Abaris was ſaid to have received an arrow from Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, on which he flew through the air.</note>.</p>
            <p>I am not ſurprized at your incredulity, ſaid Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo; for though I am certain I ſee it, I do not believe it—and yet—why what enchantment is this?—heavens!—I now ſee two people di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly!</p>
            <p>Alphonſo rubbed his eyes, and the teleſcope dropt from his hands; he looked at Theliſmar, who mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs and fixed in amazement, ſaid not a word! The globe ſtill kept approaching, and at laſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt over their heads. I can doubt no longer, cried Theliſmar: this globe of purple and gold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains living beings!—I ſee them!—Oh inconceivable prodigy! Oh happy triumph of auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious genius!</p>
            <p>While Theliſmar was ſpeaking, the globe hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over his head, majeſtically deſcended, and they ſaw in the veſſel, ſuſpended to the globe, two celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al figures; they were females: the one had the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and beauty of Juno or Minerva; the other clothed in white, and crowned with roſes, reſembled Aurora, or the charming goddeſs of ſpring-time and flowers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="unknown:020385_0144_0FAF00FDCA179A58"/>
Alphonſo flew towards the globe; he was ſtopt by a violent palpitation of the heart; no, cried he theſe raviſhing creatures cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e mortal—they approach—they come hand in hand—ſurely it is Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Virtue, deſcending from heaven to give back the golden age—but—good God—is it a new deluſion?—Oh, Dalinda, this young di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, the more to charm us, has taken thy form—I dare not believe my eyes, and yet my heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deceive me—Yes, it is ſhe, it is Dalinda herſelf!</p>
            <p>Alphonſo wildly called Theliſmar, juſt as the globe and its car touched the earth; while the latter, pale, trembling, petrified with ſurprize and doubt, looked on it, ſent forth a piercing cry, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with joy, ran, or rather flew towards them.</p>
            <p>The two divinities were not leſs eager<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſprang, they wept, they ſunk in his arms.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo, quite beſide himſelf, durſt not follow the dictates of his heart; he ſtopped, and the exceſs of his feelings obliged him to lean againſt a tree, for his trembling legs were unable to ſupport his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>In the firſt moments of joy, the magic globe, the car, the miracle, were totally forgotten. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar behold nothing but his wife and daughter, and his curioſity was ſuſpended, ſuperior to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all enchantment. Alphonſo, a witneſs of his happy meeting, did not taſte a joy unmixed; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated Dalinda with raviſhment; he enjoyed, with tranſport, the ſweet pleaſure of underſtanding her in her native language, while ſhe ſpoke every thing
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:020385_0145_0FAF00FDE92C5050"/>
that filial affection could inſpire to a dear and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der father. But this intereſting ſcene brought to memory Don Ramirez, and all his wrongs; and thus was one ſingle ſubject of remorſe ſufficient to poiſon all his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Reflection, after a while, having again given birth to ſurprize and curioſity, Dalinda and her mother were queſtioned concerning the miracle they had ſeen. They replied, they had not ventured themſelves paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers in <hi>the Air Balloon,</hi> had they not firſt ſeen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments which had aſſured them of its ſafety; that knowing the day and hour when Theliſmar would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, and having a favourable wind, they could not reſiſt their deſire of thus ſurprizing him, eſpecially when it would bring them ſooner to his arms; that living in the ſame houſe with a philoſopher, who had a globe ready prepared, they had ſeized ſo favourable an opportunity of flying to meet a huſband and father ſo dear; they added, as they were hovering over the meadow of Arpajon, they had diſtinguiſhed a carriage and horſes with their teleſcopes, and conſequently had deſcended.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar after this went to examine the globe, and his wife gave a ſhort account of the experiments which had been made at the Muette, and the Tuile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Theliſmar ſelf himſelf greatly moved, while ſhe deſcribed the general enthuſiaſm which theſe ſublime experiments had excited; and the univerſal admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with which the whole nation beheld the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal author of that diſcovery, and the two illuſtrious philoſophers, whoſe heroic daring had procured to France a ſpectacle ſ;o pompom, and ſo new.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="unknown:020385_0146_0FAF00FE98C94E70"/>
Theliſmar likewiſe heard with pleaſure, that all the truly learned partook in this well-founded national enthuſiaſm; and Alphonſo was aſtoniſhed to find, that envy wanted power to poiſon the triumph of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this brilliant diſcovery.</p>
            <p>A little reflection, ſaid Theliſmar, will rob you of your ſurprize; ſuch lights as may ſerve to guide men to the things they wiſh, are always received with tranſport. Suppoſe a chymiſt, by making a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, ſhould open a new career to the learned, and furniſh materials for an infinity intereſting ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and a multitude of new ideas: would he not thus afford them new means of diſtinguiſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and acquiring glory? From one diſcovery a thouſand others may ariſe, while each philoſopher is only buſied in bringing it to perfection, and thence deducing new lights and further fame: thus, far from endeavouring to diminiſh the merit of the firſt inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, each employs his talents and his genius to make it more uſeful, conſequently more glorious.</p>
            <p>You give me infinite pleaſure, ſaid Alphonſo; there exiſts then a way, in which men may run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſame goal, may overtake and outſtrip, yet not hate each other. Oh noble triumph, in which the victor is crowned by the vanquiſhed; where the' excellence of an individul is the delight of the whole and becomes to them an inexhuſtible ſource of fame and freſh ſucceſs. Oh that men of wit would follow this ſublime example!</p>
            <p>You wiſh a thing impoſſible, anſwered Theliſmar facts cannot be denied: a diſcovery proved by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, is beyond criticiſm, above cenſure; but ſo
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:020385_0147_0FAF00FF5F515968"/>
are not works of imagination. An author who writes to the fancy, may ardently deſire to prove his work is good, but cannot do it geometrically; it is in vain that he may affirm it a hundred different ways in his preface, when whoſoever pleaſes can affirm the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: thus when he has compoſed a <hi>Chef-d' oeuvre,</hi> ill taſte and malignity may deny his merit, Hence ariſe diſputes, unjuſt criticiſms, and enmities which diſhonour literature. The philoſopher can write no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which deſcribes new facts that is not uſeful to all other philoſophers; while the wit and talents of the man of polite literature are ſubſervient only to his own individual fame.</p>
            <p>After this converſation, they took a turn in the meadows, then entered their carriages, and went for Paris, where they arrived in the evening.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar made no ſtay in this city, but departed with his family and Alphonſo for England. They paſſed ſome time at London; but not being able to learn any tidings of Don Ramirez they left it, and went to Buxton in Derbyſhire.</p>
            <p>I will conduct you, ſaid Theliſmar, as they were walking out, to a fountain, which, from the fabulous virtues attributed to it, would be much better placed in Sicily or Greece than England. It is pretended, that the ſpring only flows for conſtant hearts; and that any lover, capable of the leaſt infidelity, cannot drink of its waters, becauſe they ſtop at his approach. It is long ſince I heard this old tale, added Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, the gallantry of which recals to memory the fountain Acadine and the ſtory of Argyra (60).</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="unknown:020385_0148_0FAF01002B316B38"/>
The guides now ſpoke to Theliſmar in Engliſh, which language Alphonſo did not underſtand: they tell me, ſaid Theliſmar, we are not an hundred yards from the fountain; but as the road is full of ſtones and brambles, they and our ſervants will go before and clear the way. Let us ſit down under theſe trees a moment till they call. So ſaying, Theliſmar ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf between his wife and daughter, where they had not ſat long, before the guides returned, and conducted them to the fountain.</p>
            <p>I am going, ſaid Theliſmar, ſmiling, to his wife, to prove a fidelity, of which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> you have never doubted; beſides, this clear and abundant ſpring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites me to drink; I therefore willingly conſent to ſubmit to this proof of perfect conſtancy.</p>
            <p>So ſaying, he approached the ſpring and drank two or three times. Who, continued he, will, after this, pretend that men are inconſtant! You ſee—But come, Alphonſo, are not you thirſty?</p>
            <p>No, replied Alphonſo, laughing: however I will drink.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo drew near, but Theliſmar ſtopped him, as he was going to ſtoop, and whiſpered, What, have you the audacity to expoſe yourſelf to this proof; have you forgot Greece, and the black-eyed youthful Zoë?</p>
            <p>Nay, Theliſmar, now you are cruel.</p>
            <p>Well, well, ſince you have engaged with ſo much temerity, you muſt go through with it now; you muſt drink.</p>
            <p>While this dialogue was paſſing, Dalinda drew near, and Alphonſo fearing ſhe might overhear The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar's
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:020385_0149_0FAF0100DF876940"/>
jokes, ſtooped towards the fountain; but as his lips drew near the ſtream, it inſtantly ceaſed to flow. Alphonſo, abaſhed and aſtoniſhed, felt his heart violently beat, and ſtood like the ſtatue of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. Dalinda bluſhed and ſmiled, though with an air of ſome conſtraint, while Theliſmar ſilently, with miſchievous pleaſure, looked on; at laſt, A way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane mortal, ſaid he, in a tragic tone, depart from theſe ſacred haunts.</p>
            <p>Certainly, ſaid Alphonſo, this cannot be a real fountain.</p>
            <p>I proteſt, ſaid Theliſmar, it is.</p>
            <p>I own it has all the appearance of one. And can you, who poſſeſs ſo many other wonderful ſecrets, forbid the fountain to flow?</p>
            <p>That would indeed be a wonderful ſecret.</p>
            <p>Yet I have ſeen you do things as ſurprizing.</p>
            <p>This, however, ſurpaſſes my power; I aſſure you I have no influence over this fountain; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy at which you ſeem ſo much aſtoniſhed, is entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the work of nature. I will endeavour this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to explain the phaenomenon; in the mean time, Alphonſo, cede your place to me, for as I have a clear conſcience, I dare ſupply it, unterrified by your diſgrace; look, and you ſhall ſee the ſtream flow once more.</p>
            <p>As Theliſmar approached the ſpring, it began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain impetuouſly to bubble forth its waters; and when the had enjoyed his triumph for a moment, Theliſmar took Alphonſo under the arm, and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this miraculous fountain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="unknown:020385_0150_0FAF0101A2025838"/>
Alphonſo was not ignorant enough to believe the fountain was enchanted; and after ſome reflection, he nearly divined the cauſe of an effect ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; but Theliſmar's pleaſantry had ſo diſconcerted him, that he could not recover himſelf during the whole walk.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar departed from Buxton, and conducted his wife and daughter to the frontiers of Scotland (61), where they left him to go to Edinburgh. The wife of Theliſmar had an ancient relation and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor who lived in that city, and who was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſee her once again; while, therefore, they went to Scotland, it was determined that Alphonſo and Theliſmar ſhould make a tour to Iceland.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo at parting from Dalinda, acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a fortitude that even ſurpaſſed the hopes of Theliſmar; fearing he ſhould betray himſelf, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined ſcarcely to look at her, and pronounced no other kind of farewell but ſuch as mere politeneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was alone with his friend, he uttered his tender plaints, but the praiſes of Theliſmar ſoon ſoftened his chagrin. They embarked and arrived in Iceland, at Skalhot, whence they went to Geizer. The firſt thing they admired in this wild place, was a caſcade of prodigious height; but another, and a newer ſpectacle, ſoon drew all their attention: look this way, ſaid Theliſmar, behold the ſupberb columns of ruby, ivory and cryſtal, which cover that immenſe plain.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo turned, and over a vaſt extent of ground, among rocks and gulfs, he ſaw thrown up into the
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:020385_0151_0FAF0103CDBAA218"/>
air, at equal heights and diſtances, innumerable ſpouts of water, as from prodigious fountains, and of various colours; ſome of a bright red, ſome of a dazzling white, others of pure and limpid water, but almoſt reaching to the very clouds (62).</p>
            <p>Alphonſo and Theliſmar could not be tired with ſo beautiful, ſo brilliant a ſight. They admired ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other phaenomena in the ſame iſland, equally cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and, after having ſeen every thing it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of intereſting and uncommon, they re-embarked, and again returned for England, where Alphonſo once more ſaw Dalinda, when the pains of abſence were forgotten, though the neceſſity of hiding it conſiderably abated his joy.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar left England with inexpreſſible ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and at laſt embarked for Sweden. After ſo many travels, ſo many perilous voyages, to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his own country, in the midſt of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and friends, was a delight not eaſily to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
            <p>Here he had the pleaſure to find once more the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Zulaſki, with whom he had lodged at the Azore Iſlands, and whoſe houſe was miraculouſly thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſea. Theliſmar learnt with joy, that the filial piety of this young man had made him the object of public admiration; that his ſovereign had heaped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits upon him; that he had found his miſtreſs faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and that he was married, and the happieſt of men.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar wiſhed to contemplate him in the boſom of his family; he there ſaw Zulaſki, with his father on one ſide of him, his wife on the other, and his
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:020385_0152_0FAF0103ED7E2610"/>
child, a beautiful boy, not two years old, on his knees. Oh Zulaſki! ſaid Theliſmar, where is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that may be compared to your's? The wife you doat on, the child you love, your wealth, your reputation, your pleaſures, your felicity, your glory, all, all the effects of your virtues. And your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is ſtill the more pure, ſince it is too intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to incite envy. Thoſe qualities which are only brilliant, have ever more enemies than admirers; but thoſe which are the offspring of the heart, obtain the ſuffrages of all. You cannot outſhine other men, without wounding their pride; whilſt you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh them, you often irritate: and whenever you are perſonal, you are aſſuming. Your ſon too, that tender object of your deareſt hopes, what may you not expect from him: ſince, to make him worthy of yourſelf, to make him feel how extenſive are the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred duties of nature, you have only to relate your own ſtory.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo, more than ever a prey to diſquietude, concerning the fate of his father, and cheriſhing ſtill the fond hope of finding him in Ruſſia, told Theliſmar he was determined to go to Peterſburgh. Eaſily imagining what Alphonſo's afflictions muſt be, ſhould he not find Don Ramirez there, Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar determined not to abandon, but go with him.</p>
            <p>At Peterſburgh they found Frederic, the old friend of Theliſmar, whom they had met in the iſland of Policandro: I am deſtined, ſaid Frederic, to ſhew you, and ſee in your company, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things; follow me, and you ſhall behold a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of chryſtal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="unknown:020385_0153_0FAF0104CA77EE80"/>
We know, ſaid Alphonſo, that you call a cavern formed by nature a palace. For this time, however, replied Frederic, it is no play of words, but a real palace, built by men, according to the moſt regular rules of architecture.</p>
            <p>This aſſurance ſcarcely could perſuade Alphonſo; therefore, to cure him of his incredulity, Frederic im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately took him to the marvellous palace. As ſoon as they came in ſight of it, Alphonſo uttered an exclamation of ſurprize! He ſaw a real tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent palace, of beautiful architecture, apparently built of various coloured chryſtal.</p>
            <p>Go on, ſaid Frederic, and your amazement will be doubled: look at yonder battery.</p>
            <p>What do I behold, cried Alphonſo: Cannon too of chryſtal.</p>
            <p>The concert is going to begin in this inchanted caſtle, continued Frederic, you may go in, if you dare enter a palace which muſt at leaſt be the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fairies.</p>
            <p>I am too much accuſtomed to them now, ſaid Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo, to ſtand in fear of enchantments.</p>
            <p>So ſaying, he paſſed beneath the brilliant porticoes of the palace; and, led by celeſtial harmony, came to a magnificent hall, the walls and columns of which, built of the ſame materials with the reſt, were, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ornamented with garlands and feſtoons of roſes; the girandoles of chryſtal, which were placed in the angles of the hall, were filled with an infinite number of wax-lights, which being reflected on every ſide, produced a moſt dazzling brightneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="unknown:020385_0154_0FAF010557BA6EB0"/>
But what ſtruck Alphonſo moſt, was the beauty of the women, which he found aſſembled in this magic palace. He was in no danger of taking them for fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they were clothed nearly as Calypſo, or the nymphs of Diana are painted; ſomething like Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſa, or the beauteous Atalanta; their robes were the ſpoils of animals, run down, or vanquiſhed at the chace; their mantles, made of the ſkins of the ermine and the fox, hung from their ſhoulders, faſtened with diamond claſps; and, in theſe ſupberb habits, their charms effaced the brightneſs of the habitation.</p>
            <p>Quitting this palace, Alphonſo was informed of the nature of the materials with which it was built; it was the ice taken from the river Neva (63).</p>
            <p>What, mamma, cried Caeſar, a palace of ice!</p>
            <p>Nothing is more certain!</p>
            <p>Filled with burning candles too, and yet not melt! How is it poſſible to find<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ice thick enough for ſuch a building? Beſides, you ſaid the palace was of various colours.</p>
            <p>My notes will anſwer all theſe queſtions.</p>
            <p>Oh dear, cried Pulcheria, how I long to read theſe notes!</p>
            <p>You had reaſon, mamma, to tell us that Fairy Tales are not ſo miraculous as your's! but pray, dear mamma, continue your ſtory, we will not interrupt you any more.</p>
            <p>It is too late, ſaid Madame de Clémire, you ſhall hear the reſt to-morrow.</p>
            <p>The following evening Madame de Clémire thus continued the Hiſtory of Alphonſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="unknown:020385_0155_0FAF010619E63BD8"/>
All the enquiries of Alphonſo, relative to his father, were as fruitleſs in Ruſſia, as they had been in England: overwhelmed with grief, he found, in the affections of a generous benefactor, the ſole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations he was capable of receiving. Neither duty nor the laws, ſaid Theliſmar, permit you to marry, without the conſent of your father; you muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, dear Alphonſo, ſubmit to your fate; all that depended upon you, have you done to find him; now then you muſt wait with reſignation, till the age that you are allowed to diſpoſe of yourſelf; you muſt henceforth be ſeparated from Dalinda, and ſee her no more till you receive her hand. You ſhall paſs this time in Sweden, in a houſe that appertains to me, and in which I lived before my travels; I will conduct you there, and leave you alone, while I go to Stockholm and join my family. We ſhall be ſeparated, but we ſhall inhabit the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> country, and with the certitude of being for ever united in two years.</p>
            <p>Alas! ſaid Alphonſo, how cruel an exile, how ſevere a ſeparation will this be to me!—If Dalinda only knew my love—might I but hope her pity—but I ſubmit to my fate; and oh! may the pangs I ſhall ſuffer expiate my guilt; may heaven, moved by my repentance, give me back a father who has cauſed me ſo many tears!</p>

<pb n="157" facs="unknown:020385_0156_0FAF0106D8D289B8"/>
cutting remembrance of my father and my faults, I might ſupport this rigorous exile with fortitude, but remorſe now will be my only companion.</p>
            <p>Always preſerve, ſaid Theliſmar, this juſt remorſe; but be not vanquiſhed by it: induſtriouſly employ yourſelf in bringing that knowledge, the elements of which I have given you, to perfection. I formerly promiſed you a treaſure, the value of which you are now capable of knowing; behold thoſe ſhelves, thoſe books; behold there, my dear Alphonſo, an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal work, which will more extenſively inſtruct you in the ſecrets of nature. I will ſtay with you a few days, and ſhew you the neighbourhood; in theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage environs you will find objects worthy to excite your curioſity.</p>
            <p>The next morning Theliſmar and the melancholy Alphonſo, were in their carriage by day-break. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar promiſed to ſhew him ſomething curious, but Alphonſo was too deeply penſive to hope that any thing might divert his ſadneſs. After they had rode about three miles, they came to a wild deſolate place, ſurrounded on all ſides by enormous moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
            <p>Here let us ſtop, ſaid Theliſmar. If I had not known your courage, Alphonſo, I would not have brought you to this deſert, for our enterprize will be very perilous. Look here—do you perceive various gulphs on the other ſide of thoſe rocks?—Into the abyſs they lead to we muſt deſcend.</p>
            <p>As Theliſmar ſpoke, two men of a fearful aſpect approached; they were wrapped in long diſmal
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:020385_0157_0FAF01079C301080"/>
garments, with naked arms, and lighted torches in their hands.</p>
            <p>Theſe are our guides, ſaid Theliſmar; here we muſt ſeparate; we ſhall ſoon meet again.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he went with one of the men, and Alphonſo followed the other, who walked ſilently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. When they had gone a little way, Alphonſo found himſelf on the brink of a pit; he ſtopt, and ſaw in the mouth of this abyſs, a kind of ſmall bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel or baſket, ſuſpended in the air; into this bark the guide leapt, and Alphonſo followed; after which the guide, ſtill keeping the lighted torch in his hand, made his deep hollow voice reverberate down the gulph; and while its ſides ſtill ſhook with the ſound, their vehicle began to deſcend, and an inviſible hand ſeemed to precipitate them into the deep bowels of the earth. Alphonſo looked upwards at the infinite firmament of heaven, which was an imperceptible point; this point itſelf preſently vaniſhed, and he only ſaw his ſtrange attendant, who ſeemed the very counterpart of the ferocious ferryman of hell.</p>
            <p>After travelling thus about a quarter of an hour, Alphonſo began to be aſtoniſhed at the length of the way, and the immenſe depth they had deſcended; when ſuddenly he heard a noiſe, which he preſently found to be impetuous torrents, daſhing and roaring round him, unſeen, on all ſides, and recalling to his imagination the fearful and tumultuous ſtreams of Tartarus.</p>
            <p>At laſt the vehicle ſtopped, he jumped out; The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar came running again to join him, and after walking a little way, Alphonſo was ſurprized by
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:020385_0158_0FAF010B47A49AA0"/>
the ſudden appearance of light. He advanced, but not far; he ſtood motionleſs with amazement: he found himſelf in the midſt of a vaſt and magnificent hall of ſilver, ſuſtained by pillars of the ſame metal, round which were four ſpacious galleries: a brook of limpid water croſſed this hall and theſe galleries, while the ſumptuous edifice was lighted by an infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of lamps and flambeaux. All is ſhining, all daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles in theſe ſubterranean regions; the lights are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected and multiplied by the ſilver walls and vaults, and the chryſtal waters, which wind along the hall.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo and Theliſmar entered the galleries, where they found crowds of people variouſly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; farther on Alphonſo diſcovered houſes, ſaw horſes and carriages paſs and repaſs; and, moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to his inconceivable aſtoniſhment, perceived a windmill.</p>
            <p>What! mamma, interrupted Caroline, a ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean town of ſilver, and in that town horſes, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and a windmill!</p>
            <p>The town exiſts at this moment, exactly as I have deſcribed: but let me finiſh my tale, my dear, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther interruption.</p>
            <p>While Theliſmar and Alphonſo were beholding theſe wonders, Theliſmar ſhuddered, on remarking the lights began to burn blue. He looked up, and ſaw above his head a kind of whitiſh veil: he inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took Alphonſo by the arm, dragged him down, and forced him to lie with his face upon the floor; at the ſame moment, a terrible and univerſal ſhriek reſounded through the vaults; the lamps were all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

ſucceeded darkneſs the moſt horrid, which was yet augmented by a profound and utter ſilence.</p>
            <p>At laſt, in a few ſeconds, a noiſe was heard like the diſcharge of a cannon, when inſtantly every body roſe, and cried the danger is over; the lamps were re-lighted, and Theliſmar turning towards Alphonſo, ſaid, death has paſſed over our heads. Such is the fearful peril to which men are often expoſed, in theſe profound deeps which avarice has dug. Alas! theſe unhappy people deprived of the cheerful light of day, enjoy not the riches they wreſt from the boſom of the earth: miſery buries them in theſe tombs of terror, and, inſtead of enjoying the riches that paſs through their hands, they have ſcarce enough to buy them food; their days are conſecrated to the moſt painful labours; their health is deſtroyed, and their term of wretchedneſs is ſhortened (64).</p>
            <p>How much, cried Alphonſo, you intereſt me in favour of theſe unfortunate victims! Poor unhappy creatures! But look, added Alphonſo, what is the matter yonder, where that crowd is aſſembled!</p>
            <p>Alphonſo ran towards the other end of the gallery, and Theliſmar followed: they were told, that one of the workmen, not having put out his light quick e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough when the mephitic vapour diſcharged itſelf, was wounded, and that they were endeavouring to give him aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Let us run, ſaid Theliſmar, I have a bottle in my pocket, which may be of ſervice to him perhaps.</p>
            <p>They made their way through the crowd with all the haſte they could; the unfortunate man was laying ſenſeleſs extended upon the ground; he is dead, ſaid
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:020385_0160_0FAF010C46B51E08"/>
one of his comrades, ſeeing Theliſmar advance. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo, with a compaſſionate heart, drew near; his eyes, dim by tears, were caſt towards the mournful object—He ſhuddered! ſtarted back!—ſprang again towards him!—beheld him with diſtraction in his countenance! his blood froze in his veins! his hair ſtood an end; and, as if a thunderbolt had ſtruck him, he fell ſpeechleſs and lifeleſs to the earth.</p>
            <p>Theliſmar flew to the ſuccour of Alphonſo; he gave orders to the people who ſurrounded the ſuppoſed dead man, and then had Alphonſo carried into another gallery; in about half a quarter of an hour Alphonſo gave ſome ſigns of life, and ſome time after came more to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Then it was, that the moſt horrible deſpair was ſeen in his looks, and disfigured his features—It is my father, cried he! 'tis he himſelf! it is my father!—Barbarians, give me my father! conduct me to him! let me ſee him! let me die by his ſide!—in what place! Oh God! in what dreadful ſtate have I found him!—But he is dead! and do I exiſt!—have I enjoyed the light of heaven, while my father has uttered groans in this place of death and terrors!—Leave me, continued he, puſhing Theliſmar from him, with wild ferocity in his eyes; fly a monſter unworthy to reviſit the day. I renounce happineſs, the world, and the bleſſed ſun. This cave ſhall be my tomb, as it is, alas! that of my moſt wretched father; in death at leaſt we ſhall be united.</p>
            <p>During this ſcene of diſtraction, Alphonſo in vain endeavoured to eſcape from the arms of his friend: hold, cried Theliſmar, hold Alphonſo; knoweſt thou
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:020385_0161_0FAF010CD6FA2420"/>
me not? ſeeſt thou me not? heareſt thou not my voice?</p>
            <p>I ſee nobody but my father: I hear no voice but the voice of nature, whoſe cries rend my very heart.</p>
            <p>Yet be calm; yet hear me: if you are certain you are not deceived, if it be your father, you yet may hope.</p>
            <p>Almighty Providence! is he—is he alive?</p>
            <p>His hurt is not mortal?</p>
            <p>Eternal Father of mercies, cried Alphonſo, falling on his knees, and raiſing his claſped hands to heaven, Oh God of boundleſs pity, hear me! have compaſſion on my pangs, my remorſe, my deſpair, and give me back my father.</p>
            <p>Compoſe your ſpirits, Alphonſo.</p>
            <p>Oh let us run; deign Theliſmar, to guide my ſteps; let us fly.</p>
            <p>No; at preſent it is improper; ſuch an interview might be fatal.</p>
            <p>But is he alive?—Do you aſſure me he lives?</p>
            <p>I do—I am certain, that though apparently, he is not really dead. I gave orders they ſhould carry him out of the pits into the air, and he is gone.</p>
            <p>Has he revived? Has he ſpoken? Oh Theliſmar, do not deceive me.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo! Is not my word ſacred!—I have ſent him to my houſe, and muſt follow to aſſiſt.</p>
            <p>To your houſe! My father at the houſe of Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, and alive!</p>
            <p>I have ordered them to carry him in our carriage.</p>
            <p>Oh! let us fly!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="unknown:020385_0162_0FAF010DAB8192C0"/>
Theliſmar and Alphonſo immediately left the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, called their guides, and were drawn out of the pit: they were obliged to return on foot, but they were met half way by the horſes and ſervants of Theliſmar. Alphonſo eagerly queſtioned the dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtics concerning his father, but received only vague and unſatisfactory anſwers; his doubts and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions again revived, till his fears became inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>At laſt they got home, and Alphonſo in vain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to follow Theliſmar into the ſick man's chamber. You are not ſufficiently maſter of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaid Theliſmar; if the ſtranger is your father, you ſhall ſee him to-morrow; but give me leave to inform him properly firſt, and prevent the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which elſe might ſucceed.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo, obliged to ſubmit, paſſed the day in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety and trouble too violent to be deſcribed. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, however, any longer to ſupport his incertitude, he reſolved to hide his intentions from Theliſmar, and viſit his father when every body was gone to reſt. Accordingly, about midnight, he went to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> door of the ſick perſon, and knowing the bed was placed ſo that he might enter the chamber with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſeen, he ſoftly opened the door. With trembling ſteps he entered the room, and as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, heard the voice of Don Ramirez; his ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſo ſtrong he could ſcarcely ſupport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: but, alas! what were his feelings at hearing his father's diſcourſe, who was raving in a fit of delirium.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="unknown:020385_0163_0FAF010E5367B278"/>
Alvarez! Alvarez! cried aloud the wretched Don Ramirez, come!—come Alvarez, and drag me from this abyſs of terrors into which thou haſt plunged me; pity my pangs; look, behold my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. But how may thy eyes penetrate from the heights of heaven to the bowels of the earth? How dreary is this gulph, it contains the tomb of thy wife and ſon—There!—Ay, there they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſee their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>le ſhades! behold how they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace. See, ſee, how they purſue me!—and muſt it be for ever thus?—But look; mercy, what do I ſee! thy ſon, Alvarez, arms Alphonſo with a poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard; behold! he is going to revenge thee; now he ſtrikes, now he pierces my heart—Stop, my ſon, is it for thee to puniſh a father? Wilt thou kill me firſt, and then abandon me? Ah, come at leaſt and receive my laſt ſigh, take my bleſſing ere I go.</p>
            <p>Alphonſo, unable longer to contain, was going to caſt himſelf in his father's arms: but the watchful Theliſmar appeared, caught hold of him, and in ſpite of his cries and reſiſtance, tore him from the chamber.</p>
            <p>A phyſician, whom Theliſmar had ſent for, came; at firſt he was doubtful; but in a few hours Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirez became more calm, his delirium was gone, and the phyſician pronounced him out of danger: the tranſports of Alphonſo's joy could now be only equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his late exceſs of grief; and as ſoon as his hopes for his father were confirmed, his tenderneſs and obedience to Theliſmar returned. During the laſt few hours, Theliſmar, for the firſt time, had found him unjuſt, obſtinate, and headſtrong; but no
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:020385_0164_0FAF010F12013CD8"/>
ſooner was he aſſured of his father's ſafety, than he became more ſubmiſſive, reaſonable, and tender than ever, towards his benefactor.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Don Ramirez heard he was at the houſe of Theliſmar, he inſtantly aſked, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of ſurprize, for Alphonſo; and it was now impoſſible any longer to defer the interview: Theliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar therefore ſought for, and brought him into the chamber of Don Ramirez. Alphonſo agitated, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fearing, bathed in tears, ran and fell on his knees by his father's bed-ſide, whoſe arms were extended to receive him.</p>
            <p>Oh my father! cried Alphonſo, dear author of my being! Are you given back to me at laſt? and will you receive your guilty ſon again? Ah! ſurely you read my heart, or you could not: you there behold my repentance, my remorſe, my love!—Yes, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my life hereafter ſhall be conſecrated to you. I wiſh exiſtence only, to repair my faults, to obey, to make you happy.—Oh ſpeak to me, my father, let me hear the ſound of a voice ſo revered; confirm my pardon with your lips; and oh! may it give me back the repoſe I had loſt, and which I never could have enjoyed without you.</p>
            <p>Is it not an illuſion? at laſt, ſaid Don Ramirez, Is it Alphonſo? is it my ſon that I preſs to my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom?—I accuſe thee not of thy errors and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, both were equally mine: but heaven is appeaſed, and we are again united; again I ſee thee, and all my ſufferings are repaid.</p>
            <p>The weakneſs of Don Ramirez would not ſuffer him to ſpeak any more: he became pale, and his
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:020385_0165_0FAF010FD0543CA0"/>
head, heavy and helpleſs, dropped on the cheek of his ſon. Alphonſo, terrified, inſtantly ran for the phyſician, who brought Don Ramirez to himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but forbade any more ſuch converſations for the preſent.</p>
            <p>This meeting did not forward the recovery of Don Ramirez. However, in a few days he was capable of ſitting up, and Alphonſo then related to him all his adventures. Don Ramirez gave a thouſand teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials of his gratitude to Theliſmar, and as ſoon as he was quite well, he alſo would relate his hiſtory. He confeſſed all his faults without reſervation, and the whole circumſtance of the hiſtory of Alvarez, the virtuous Portugueſe hermit, whom he had met with on Mont-Serrat.</p>
            <p>When he came to the epocha of the flight of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo, he thus continued his tale:</p>
            <q>
               <p>The departure of my ſon grieved me ſo much the more, inaſmuch as it was impoſſible not to look upon it as a juſt puniſhment inflicted by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the effect of the imprecations before pronounced againſt me by a wretched father. Alas! ſaid I, how equitable are the decrees of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence! I made an ill uſe of power and fortune, and heaven has deprived me of both. My deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ambition robbed the unhappy Alvarez of a wife and ſon; and the wrath divine has, at laſt, ſtripped me of the only comfort which could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of the reſt; my ſon, my ſole hope, Alphonſo abandons me; and though thus arrived at the height of my miſery, I have not a right
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:020385_0166_0FAF0112205AA378"/>
even to complain; Fate has done me no wrong; it is all my own work.</p>
               <p>Thus did I weep over my deſtiny, and thus was I obliged to admire Omnipotent Juſtice by which I was purſued.</p>
               <p>I learnt, after diligent enquiries, my ſon had taken the rout to Cadiz. I could not, however, follow him immediately, as was my intention and deſire; detained at Grenada by a violent fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I was obliged there to remain for ſix weeks.</p>
               <p>Though I could not hope to find my ſon at Cadiz, I ſtill preſiſted in my deſign of going there, from a ſuppoſition that I might get farther intelligence. When I came to Loxe I put up at an inn, where, after the deſcription I gave of my ſon, and the anſwers of the inn-keeper, I could not doubt of his having paſſed ſome hours in the ſame place.</p>
               <p>Fatherly fondneſs made me deſirous of ſleeping in his chamber; every part of which I examined with great care and anxiety. I perceived ſome Portugueſe characters cut on the glaſs; I could not miſtake the hand of Alphonſo, and in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle couplet, I ſaw the name of Dalinda three times repeated. The ſame name was written too upon the walls; the circumſtance ſtruck <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> I entered it in my tablets.</p>
               <p>When I came to Cadiz, I enquired both for Alphonſo and Dalinda; but they were names totally unknown to every body that heard them. At laſt, however, I heard a young Portugueſe, who had carefully concealed his name and birth,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:020385_0167_0FAF01131071FDD0"/>
had paſſed ten days at Cadiz with a young lady, whom it was ſuſpected he had run off with, and that the two fugitives were gone to France, there, as it was ſuppoſed, to reſide.</p>
               <p>I did not doubt but my ſon was the Portugueſe in queſtion, and that the young lady was Dalinda, with whom I had diſcovered Alphonſo was in love; I reſolved, therefore, to go to France; but it was firſt neceſſary that I ſhould viſit Liſbon, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the money due upon my penſion, and I then departed for Paris.</p>
               <p>After much time and many pains ſpent in ſearching, I traced at laſt the fugitives, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom I had heard at Cadiz; and the reſult of all my cares and diſcoveries was, I found two perſons to whom I was abſolutely unknown. I had hitherto been ſupported by the hope of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſon; and when I loſt a hope ſo dear to my heart, I drooped and fell into the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſtate of deſpair. Totally detached from the world, I formed the project of quitting it, never to return, and burying myſelf in the ſame ſolitude which the virtuous Alvarez had choſen.</p>
               <p>Arrived at Mont-Serrat, I went immediately to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>

                  </gap>k of the grave.</p>
               <p>He received me, however, with that unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bounty by which his actions were characteriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I told him my misfortunes, and he liſtened with tenderneſs to the recital. Mayſt thou find, ſaid he, in this peaceable aſylum, comforts that
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:020385_0168_0FAF011439B8F270"/>
ſhall aſſuage thy griefs; if thou wilt remain in this grotto, thou wilt ſoon enjoy it without a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; and oh! in abandoning it to thee, would to heaven I could leave thee alſo the tranquillity I enjoy.</p>
               <p>Such was my reception with Alvarez. With new aſtoniſhment I viewed a virtue ſo perfect; far from finding that his preſence augmented my uneaſineſs and remorſe, I found myſelf leſs agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his company, received an inexpreſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in liſtening to, looking at, and aſſiſting him, my affection for him was every inſtant redoubled, and I would willingly have prolonged his life at the expence of my own.</p>
               <p>I had not at firſt related to him the particulars of my misfortunes; I had only told him, that my ſon had run from me; that I knew not what was become of him, and that, from ſome miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en imformations, I had vainly ſought for him in France. Alvarez afterwards begged me to be more preciſe; and I then mentioned, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, the two Portugueſe verſes I had found on the window of the inn, at Loxe.</p>

                  <pb n="170" facs="unknown:020385_0169_0FAF01145CCEAA10"/>
This twentieth of June, I have received a viſit from a Swediſh family; the father ſpeaks tolerable Portugueſe, has charmed me by his knowledge and ſimplicity of manners; he is going to Spain, embarks at Cadiz for Africa, and his name is The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar: his daughter is remarkable for her beauty and modeſty. Her father deſired her to ſhew me ſome landſcapes of her own drawing, and ſhe took a book from her pocket, in which were ſeveral, all deſigned after nature, except one, which ſhe had done from memory, and which was certainly the beſt and prettieſt among them: it was a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Fountain of Love, in the Province of Beira. The name of this young lady is Dalin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</p>
               <p>This note cleared up all my doubts, and gave me the firſt joyous ſenſation I had felt ſince I re-returned from France; for though I had ſtill cauſe enough to be very uneaſy, I now had diſcovered ſome certain intelligence, by the help of which I might hope to find my ſon.</p>
               <p>Alvarez farther informed me, Theliſmar had ſaid he intended to travel four years, before he re-returned to Sweden; for which reaſon, ſaid Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ger 'ere you ſee him again; nor can you hope to hear any thing of Alphonſo, except by going to Sweden.</p>
               <p>No, Alvarez, ſaid I, I will not now abandon you in helpleſs age; you offered an aſylum to your perſecutor, adviſed him, conſoled, and deigned to accept his little ſervices: ſuch magnanimity, while
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:020385_0170_0FAF01151A712658"/>
it doubles my repentance, diminiſhes the dreadful terrors of my guilt: when Alvarez is no longer angry with me, I hope the avenging God, who purſues me, will be appeaſed—And yet, alas! I am indebted to religion only for this forgiveneſs: could your heart be reconciled, and become a part of mine, I ſhould then hope for heaven's protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>My eyes were filled with tears as I ſpoke; and Alvarez, with a look of moſt affectionate tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, anſwered, And is it poſſible that my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould ſoften thy chagrin, and calm the cruel agitation of thy ſoul!—W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll—be ſatisfied—I accept thy hand, thy friendly ſuccours; yes, the hand of Don Ramirez ſhall cloſe the eyes of Alvarez.</p>
               <p>The virtuous old man could no longer retain his tears, while I but too forcibly felt what the cutting remembrance muſt be, which then offered itſelf to his imagination: at the very moment he aſſured me of his friendſhip, the unfortunate old man wept for his ſon.</p>
               <p>The night after this converſation, Alvarez feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf more oppreſſed than uſual, wiſhed to riſe; he leaned on my arm, and went into his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: he ſat down, the moon's rays ſhone upon his countenance; and while their ſilver light increaſed his paleneſs, they gave him a mild, an affecting, an auguſt ſerenity; he raiſed his eyes and hands to heaven, and for a few moments, ſeemed abſorbed in a kind of trance; then afterwards turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="unknown:020385_0171_0FAF0115D1E84250"/>
Oh thou, ſaid he, who for three months paſt haſt paid me every attention, performed every of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of filial piety, receive in theſe my laſt moments the little I have to leave, receive the paternal bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of a father.</p>
               <p>Oh my father! cried I, bowing at his feet, my revered, my venerable father, what is it you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce?</p>
               <p>Yes, replied Alvarez, with a feeble voice, thou ſoon ſhalt looſe a father whom religion hath given thee; in an inſtant, my ſon, I ſhall appear in the preſence of that eternal Being, in whom clemency and benevolence are the ſublimeſt attributes—Oh God! continued Alvarez, dropping on his fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knees beſide me—God, my Creator and my Judge! the awful moment approaches in which the moſt virtuous of men ought to dread thy juſtice—yet I dare rely upon thy mercy—I have a heart to pardon—behold in whoſe arms I expire—behold for whom my tears now flow, for whom I implore thy pity; hear, Oh God! the groans of Don Ramirez; his ſoul is not hardened in ſin, it feels, it repents, it is able to elevate itſelf even to thee—finiſh the purification of his heart, remove the ſilm from his eyes, give back his ſon, reſtore him to happineſs and peace.—Oh deign to hear the laſt prayer of Alvarez!</p>

               <p>This duty fulfilled, my firſt wiſh was to depart for Sweden; but money was neceſſary to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſo long a voyage; and I wrote to Portugal to inform them I was ſtill in exiſtence, and was obliged to travel to the north; begging they would ſo far favour me, as to pay my penſion two years in advance; my petition was accordingly granted. I went for the laſt time to the ſhade of Olives, where ſlept the peaceful bones of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez, watered the graſs with my tears, and wept over the flowers that grew around his tomb. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which I quitted Mont-Serrat and Spain, and took the route to Sweden.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I came to Stockholm, my firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was to know if Theliſmar had returned: I learnt he was not expected in leſs than a year, that his wife and daughter were not with him, and that they reſided at a country-houſe near Salſeberiſt. I was preparing to go thither, when I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:020385_0173_0FAF011750C9AB20"/>
a perſon named Frederic, an intimate friend of Theliſmar's, who had travelled with him, was every day expected at Stockholm.</p>
               <p>Determined, as ſoon as I heard this, to ſee the perſon thus deſcribed, I continued ſome few months longer at Stockholm: at laſt he arrived, I ſaw him, ſpoke to him without making myſelf known, queſtioned him concerning Theliſmar, and learnt, beyond a doubt, Alphonſo ſtill exiſted, and that Providence had graciouſly placed him under the ſafeguard of Religion and Virtue.</p>
               <p>Convinced my ſon was ſtill alive, I felt more forcibly than ever the unhappineſs of having been thus abandoned: alas! I knew not his repentance, his grief: I was ignorant of his having written to me. Having been only a moment as it were at Liſbon, ſince his departure, and not having once returned to the province of Beira, I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived none of his letters, which are now moſt probably loſt.</p>
               <p>Frederic not being able to tell me where The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmar then was, I determined to go to Salſebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt; but I found neither the charming Dalinda, whom I deſired ſo much to ſee, nor her mother there: I was informed they were gone abroad, and were to return to Salſeberiſt, with Theliſmar. I went to the houſe, and enquired of the ſervants, who aſſured me Theliſmar had always inhabited that ſolitary manſion; that they were in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his arrival, which they ſuppoſed would be ſome time within three months. I therefore determined to remain at Salſeberiſt.</p>

I lived here entirely unknown, my project being to wait my ſon's arrival, throw myſelf unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly in his way, and ſee what effect this firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view would produce. If his heart was not in ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with mine, it was my reſolution entirely to leave him, and end my ſorrowful days at the tomb of Alvarez,</p>
               <p>Theliſmar, however, did not arrive; above a year had glided away in expectations which every day became more and more inſupportable. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to write to Portugal, and make known the place to which I was retired, as well as to aſk payment of my penſion, when I fell ill; a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fever deprived me for ſeveral days of the uſe of reaſon, during which time a diſhoneſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant robbed me, and carried off all the money and clothes I poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>The man where I lodged, had the humanity to conceal this affair from me, till ſuch time as my health was entirely re-eſtabliſhed, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Don Ramirez ended, and Alphonſo, whoſe tears had more than once interrupted the ſorrowful tale, threw himſelf at his father's feet with every expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, every mark of repentance, gratitude, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which the beſt and nobleſt mind could feel. Don Ramirez, at the height of happineſs, claſped his ſon in his arms, and bathed him with his tears, while Theliſmar, in a rapture of ſilence, beheld the moving ſcene.</p>
            <p>At laſt Alphonſo, Don Ramirez, and Theliſmar, departed for Stockholm. Alphonſo now ſaw the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Dalinda, and made himſelf large amends, for the painful ſilence to which he had been ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: and Dalinda, in learning that ſhe had been five years beloved, learnt alſo the power which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and gratitude had over her lover. Then it was, that Alphonſo applauded himſelf for having ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept his word: by this virtuous effort he had entirely gained the friendſhip and heart of Dalinda.</p>
            <p>The happy Alphonſo received the hand of Dalin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, and by his virtues and conduct juſtified the choice and affection of the generous Theliſmar; the wrongs he had done his father he expiated by an unbounded attachment and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſubmiſſion, and the moſt tender attentions. They lived always in the ſame houſe, and it became his glory and felicity to fulfil the extenſive duties of nature, gratitude, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Thus did he conſtitute the happineſs of his father, his benefactor, and his dear Dalinda.</p>

And the converſation of this evening, as well as the ſtory, anſwered Madame de Clémire, as ſhe roſe from her ſeat.</p>
            <p>Oh, what a pity!—but the notes?</p>
            <p>We will begin to read them to-morrow.</p>
            <p>How I <hi>do</hi> long to ſee theſe notes!</p>
            <p>Well you may, they are much more intereſting than my tale; but at preſent bed is the propereſt place.</p>
            <p>The next day Madame de Clémire aſked her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whether they thought ſhe had fulfilled her promiſe, to write a ſtory as miraculous as a Fairy Tale, the marvellous of which ſhould yet be true.</p>
            <p>Oh yes, mamma, replied Caroline; and ſince there are ſo many extraordinary and curious things in nature, you may be certain we ſhall not ſeek the miracles we delight to hear of in Fairy Tales any more.</p>
            <p>By reading books which ſhall inſtruct you, ſaid Madame de Clémire, you will learn many other things as ſurprizing as thoſe I have ſelected. Had I uſed all the extracts I have made, the hiſtory of Alphonſo would have been in two volumes, and a better work; for, in order to abridge it, I was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to omit incidents which would have better connected the different parts, as well as an infinity of curious phaenomena. Yet my extracts contain nothing but well avouched facts. I have rejected not only ſuch as appeared fabulous, but even doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Had I been leſs ſcrupulous, I ſhould have told you of a village where all the inhabitants became i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diots

I might have deſcribed a thing much better atteſted, and much leſs fabulous; ſuch as Theliſmar on the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ocean, commanding the elements, and calming the tempeſt (66). But I had no need to adopt any thing doubtful, ſince I have been obliged to leave out a multitude of the miracles of nature, all inconteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: add to which, there is yet a multitude of which I am ignorant. Judge, therefore, what pleaſure a tale of this kind would have given had it been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a very learned perſon.</p>
            <p>It ſeems, for example, ſaid the Abbé to Madame de Clémire, you might have made ſomething more of the phaenomena electricity affords, either in the courſe of the ſtory, or in the notes.</p>
            <p>I could do nothing better in that reſpect, I aſſure you, anſwered Madame de Clémire; and that for a very good reaſon: I am ignorant of experimental philoſophy, a courſe of which I have gone through, like many others, and, like many others, am not much the wifer.</p>
            <p>But, replied the Abbé, had you judged me capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I ſhould have undertaken this part of the notes with pleaſure.</p>

My dear Abbé, anſwered Madame de Clémire, a woman ought never to ſuffer a man to add a ſingle word to her writings; if ſhe does, the man ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, let him be who he may, will always paſs for the original inventor, and ſhe will be accuſed of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her name to the works of others. One may be a very good woman, yet a very bad writer, but not were one to take the credit of other people's labours; one ought, therefore, carefully to avoid whatever might give room to ſo injurious an accuſation. Scarcely has there been one woman ſucceſsful in her writings, and not accuſed of this kind of baſeneſs. Mademoiſelle de Luſſan had three aſſiſting friends. <hi>Laſſere</hi>

Theſe, and many other ſimilar examples, ought, in my opinion, to prevent women from conſulting men concerning their works, and from forming any inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate connections with men of letters.</p>

               <pb n="183" facs="unknown:020385_0182_0FAF011EF931C4F8"/>
Nay, mamma, I aſſure you I have never ſeen any ſuch thing—Pray tell us what it is called.</p>
            <p>A ſpider<note n="*" place="bottom">The domeſtic ſpider.</note> (67).</p>
            <p>A ſpider! I ſhould never have thought of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. How can a ſpider have eight eyes, a moiſt ſponge between its claws, and pincers at the ſide of its mouth?</p>
            <p>Had you ever examined a ſpider with a micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope, you would have perfectly diſtinguiſhed all theſe particulars, and you may ſee them even with the naked eye on a large ſpider.</p>
            <p>I will aſk Auguſtin to bring me large ſpiders, for I muſt ſee their ſponges, pincers, and eight eyes.</p>
            <p>And I will read you the natural hiſtory of ſpiders, which I am ſure will very much amuſe you, and in which you will find many extraordinary circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>And what is the name of the other creature, mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, which multiples by being divided?</p>
            <p>The freſh water polypus (68).</p>
            <p>Oh! I do not know that; it is not to be found in this country; and I think it is much more curious than the ſpider.</p>
            <p>Since you are ſo deſirous to ſee this prodigy, I will procure you that pleaſure.</p>
            <p>What, mamma, will you ſend for them from abroad? I am ſure you are very good.</p>
            <p>You ſhall have them to-morrow—the ponds of Champcery are full of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="unknown:020385_0183_0FAF011F8FECFEF0"/>
Why, is it poſſible? and we not know the name of ſo extraordinary a creature!</p>
            <p>Nature every where abounds with moſt ſurprizing phaenomena; ignorance is deprived of the pleaſure of knowing, of admiring them, while the philoſopher finds, at every ſtep, objects worthy to excite, and to ſatisfy his curioſity.</p>
            <p>Oh dear mamma! we will aſk, we will read, we will buy microſcopes, and examine all the inſects of Champcery, and at leaſt become acquainted with the curious things around us.</p>
            <p>The Abbé who had been a little vexed with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for not knowing the ſpider, at laſt broke ſilence. As your mamma has judiciouſly obſerved, ſaid he, the tale of Alphonſo contains but a ſmall part of the phaenomena of nature: thus, for example, ſhe has neither mentioned beavers nor elephants.</p>
            <p>Perhaps that is, becauſe mamma knew we were acquainted with the hiſtory of thoſe animals, ſaid Caeſar,</p>
            <p>But, continued Madame de Clémire, I have ſaid nothing of numerous other animals, as ſingular and much leſs known, ſuch as the toucan (69) the ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>michi (70) bats (71), &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Abbé, who was ranſacking his memory to find ſomething miraculous, which Madame de Clé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire had forgot in her tale, proceeded thus. It is certain, ſaid he, that beſides animals, the vegetable and mineral regions preſent a crowd of phaenomena, concerning which your mamma could not ſpeak in ſo ſhort a work. I think, however, ſhe might have found an advantageous opportunity of mentioning
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:020385_0184_0FAF0121E71DBBA0"/>
the wax-tree (72), the ſenſitive-plant (73), fraxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella (74), and the amianthus (75).</p>
            <p>After having run over this catalogue with great gravity, the Abbé roſe and left the room, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly well fatisfied with his memory. Pulcheria began to laugh. It is my opinion, ſaid ſhe, mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, M. Frémont is a little vexed with you.</p>
            <p>And if he be, replied Madame de Clémire, why ſhould you remind me of it? Though he may be too ſuſceptible, too liable to be out of humour, he is the more excuſable, becauſe he has never lived among the great; where, while people acquire a ſupple temper, and a refinement which teaches them to hide their own pretenſions, and the little ridiculous exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſelf-love, they often loſe ſincerity, the firſt of virtues. I have more than once reminded you of what you owe to the preceptor of your brother. I have often repeated too, that we are not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to make (even confidentially) malignant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on thoſe with whom we live in intimacy, but that we ought alſo to baniſh the remembrance of their defects, and reject ſuch thoughts as would make us recollect their errors.</p>
            <p>Pulcheria was greatly affected by this leſſon; but as ſhe had only ſaid a raſh word for want of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſhe wept without ſullenneſs, and as ſhe tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repented of her fault, ſhe ſoon obtained her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and reſumed her gaiety.</p>
            <p>Eight or ten evenings were ſpent in reading the notes to the hiſtory of Alphonſo. When they were ended, Caeſar obſerved there was one of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:020385_0185_0FAF0122CA561670"/>
yet unexplained. In the Canary iſlands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, after the adventure of the cavern and the Guanches, Alphonſo wandered to the borders of a lake, where he ſaw the miraculous pillar, and the ſtrange hail-ſtorm: but what was more ſtrange, when he returned home, be found Theliſmar knew every thing that had happened to him at the lake; nay, that he ſaw him there, though he was on his own terrace, at two leagues diſtance.</p>
            <p>True, replied Madame de Clémire, I have not explained this latter miracle in my notes; but come and breakfaſt to-morrow morning in the little belvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere at the high end of the meadow, and I will ſhew you Theliſmar's ſecret.</p>
            <p>This propoſition was joyfully accepted by the young family, and the next morning every body aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at the place appointed before eight o'clock. Here the children found a large machine, which greatly excited their curioſity: they aſked its name, and were told it was a teleſcope.</p>
            <p>Sit down on that chair, Caroline, ſaid Madame de Clémire, and look into this end of the inſtrument through that glaſs.</p>
            <p>Dear! dear! what do I ſee! cried Caroline; a large houſe not two ſteps off!</p>
            <p>And yet it is a league diſtant, ſaid Madame de Clémire; it is the chateau of M. de Luſanne.</p>
            <p>Well, that ſeems incredible! I can perfectly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh all the people who paſs and repaſs in the court-yard. There! now I ſee a ſervant feeding the fowls—and now a cow leading to graſs—and now a poor woman begging—and now—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="unknown:020385_0186_0FAF0123581BF770"/>
Nay, nay, interrupted Pulcheria, impatiently, you muſt let me ſee a little too, my dear ſiſter.</p>
            <p>Scarcely had Pulcheria taken her ſeat, before a joyous exclamation broke forth. O mamma, ſaid ſhe, I ſee Sidonia; I am ſure it is her, ſhe ſpeaks to the ſervants—I will warrant ſhe has the charge of the court-yard, for ſhe ſeems to give orders. Oh! that is charming at her age; I wiſh I was as old that I might do the ſame!—There, now ſhe ſtoops—now ſhe riſes—now ſhe ſtoops again.—Oh! ſhe is ſurely collecting the eggs—ay it is ſo, for ſomebody gives her a baſket—and now ſhe turns towards the poor beggar-woman.—Pray Caeſar, continued Pulcheria, permit me to look a little long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er—Sidonia goes to the old woman—ſpeaks to her—makes her come into the court-yard, and ſit down on a bench—Sidonia leaves her baſket with her, and runs—</p>
            <p>Every one in their turn ſiſter, ſaid Caeſar.</p>
            <p>Nay, one moment brother—Sidonia comes back, but very gently—ſhe holds a large bowl in her hands—I fancy it is milk—There! ſhe gives it to the old woman!—Oh how I love that good Sidonia!</p>
            <p>So ſaying, Pulcheria roſe, and Caeſar took her place. Sidonia had left the court-yard, and nothing intereſting was going forward; but he comprehended which way Theliſmar might diſtinctly ſee Alphonſo from his terrace, notwithſtanding the diſtance by which they were ſeparated.</p>
            <p>They ſpoke of nothing all day, but the teleſcope and Sidonia. Pulcheria admired the ſingular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:020385_0187_0FAF012421181390"/>
in which ſhe had diſovered the benevolent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of that young lady. She did not ſuppoſe, continued Pulcheria, that we could ſee all that was paſſing in the court-yard.</p>
            <p>Chance, added Madame de Clémire, and an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of unforeſeen circumſtances, every day diſcover actions much more ſecretly performed. The beſt way, therefore, is to act as if all the world looked on; for not only does the Almighty ſee and judge every incident of our lives, but accident, curioſity, the indiſcretion of ſervants, and the treachery of falſe friends, unceaſingly expoſe to open day our moſt hidden ſecrets.</p>

            <p n="1">(1) A FAMOUS Floriſt in Holland, told me he had given 6800 livres (265l.) for a root; adding, that he had ſeen others far dearer. Many Amateurs will not allow there are more than ſix ſpecies of flowers worthy the care of cultivation: theſe are the Hyacinth, the Tulip, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricula, the Carnation, the Ranunculus, and the Anemony: the Hyacinth is one of the moſt beautiful, but leaſt various in its colours; it is leſs common too than the other. The Ranunculus is ſaid to have been brought from Syria, during the time of the Cruſades; the Anemony was tranſported from America in the laſt century, by M. Bachelier; and they pretend, that the Hyacinth is a native of the Cape of Good Hope; the moſt beautiful Hyacinth is the Ophyr; it is yellow, with purple ſpots on the inſide.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) The earthquake which happened is Sicily 1692-3; the hiſtory of which is given by Mr. Hartop, Father Aleſſandro Burgos, and Vin Bonajutus, is one of the moſt terrible ones in all hiſtory: it ſhook the whole iſland; and not only that, but Naples and Malta ſhared in the ſhock. It was of the ſecond kind mentioned by Ariſtotle and Pliny, <abbr>viz.</abbr> a perpendicular pulſation or ſucceſſion. It was impoſſible, ſaid the noble Bonajutus, for any body in this country to keep on their legs on the dancing earth; nay,

            <p n="3">(3) The greateſt part of Liſbon was, in fact, deſtroyed by incendiaries; who, during this dreadful diſaſter, ſet fire to the houſes that they might pillage them with more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The unfortunate inhabitants, who were the victims of this unheard of wickedneſs, found relief in the humanity of a generous nation. No ſooner were the Engliſh informed of this terrible event, than they haſtened to ſend them every ſuccour of which they ſtood in need. This benevolent act coſt the Engliſh ſix millions, but it gave them new claims to the eſteem of all Europe.</p>

The principal men of the devoted family were, under ſome pretence or other, ſummoned one one by one, to attend the King in the Court of Lions. No ſooner was each unhappy victim admitted within the walls, than he was ſeized by the Zegris, led to a large alabaſter baſon in one of the adjoining halls, and there beheaded.

In hopes of rouzing their noble ſpirits to action, ſhe diſpatched a truſty meſſenger with a letter to Don Juan de Chacon, Lord of Carthagena, entreating him to eſpouſe her cauſe; and like a true Knight, bring with him three brave warriors, to ſtand her friends on the day appointed. Chacon returned for anſwer, that he ſet too high a price upon that honour, not to be punctual to the hour of trial. The fatal day arrived, and all Grenada was buried in the deepeſt affliction, to find that their beloved Queen had been ſo remiſs as not to have named one of her defenders. Muſa, Azarque, and Almoradi, the judges of the combat, preſſed, her in vain, to accept of their ſwords, or thoſe of ſeveral other warriors willing to aſſert the juſtneſs of her cauſe.

At length it burſt, ſhedding a vaſt number of luminous particles like the <hi>Brilliants</hi> in fire-works.</p>
               <p>The 12th of November, 1761, M. le Baron des A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dretz, one league from Ville Franche, in Beaujolois, ſaw a bright globe of fire, which ſeemed ſwiftly falling and increaſing in ſize as it fell. A train of fire marked its route; after it had traverſed nearly an eighth of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizen, it ſeemed as large as an exceeding large tun, cut horizontally in half—It turned upſide down, and out of it came a prodigious quantity of flaming ſparks, like the largeſt of thoſe ſeen in fire-works.</p>

            <p>
               <q>The Ancients, ſays M. de Bomare, knew the loadſtone would attract iron; and if Pliny may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, it was found out by a ſhepherd, who felt that the nails of his ſhoes, and the ferrule of his ſtaff, ſtuck to ae rock of load-ſtone over which he paſſed; but they knew not its polar direction,</q>
            </p>
            <p>Alphonſo, full of ignorance and remorſe, and already terrified at the meteor he had ſeen, feeling himſelf fixed to the rock, believed it proceeded from the wrath of heaven, as a puniſhment for his flight. This idea redoubled his terror, rendered him motionleſs, and aided the effects of nature.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The load-ſtone is ferruginous, and is found in iron-mines; its colour varies with the country where it is found; it has five remarkable properties: 1. That of attracting iron, called <hi>Attraction.</hi> 2. That of tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting its virtue—<hi>Communication.</hi> 3. That of turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the poles of the earth—<hi>Direction.</hi> 4. Its varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, called <hi>Declination.</hi> 5. Its dipping as it approaches either pole—<hi>Inclination.</hi> All theſe ſingular properties, the effects of the nature of the load-ſtone, are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by ſome general property hitherto unknown. It is ſuppoſed there is a kind of atmoſphere round the load-ſtone, which forms an active vortex, and is ſenſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by its contrary effects, the one of attracting, the other of repelling iron. The attractive force of the load-ſtone, juſt taken from the mine, is not great, for which reaſon it is obliged to be armed to augment its power. It may be remarked, that the ruſt of iron has ſometimes the effect of the load-ſtone.</q>

            <p n="17">(17) Poiſon known to ſome hordes of ſavages, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineers of Peru, was brought to Europe in 1746, by M. de la Condamine, which was the moſt ſubtil and mortal. Its effect is ſo prompt, that monkies or parrots pricked to the quick by ſmall arrows, which the Savages ſhoot from Sarba canes, immediately drop. M. de Reamur had a bear of two years old, which, becoming miſchievous, he determined to kill. The effect of the poiſon was tried on this animal; the point of a dart, proper to ſhoot from a Sarba cane, was ſteeped in it, and the bear received the firſt dart above the ſhoulder, but without being apparently wounded; a ſecond was ſhot, and the animal made a bound, was convulſed, trembled, foamed, and fell dead in about a minute and a half. It muſt be remarked, that the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies and parrots killed by this poiſon, which are eaten in Peru, without any precaution, contract no pernicious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Sugar is the moſt certain antidote to this powerful venom, and which, given to dogs and cats a quarter of an hour before they have been wounded, has prevented all its effects.</p>

The boabab, adds M. de Bomare, is probably the largeſt of known vegetables; though there are accounts, in the works of different naturaliſts, of well known trees ſo prodigious, as to be reckoned vegetable monſters. Ray cites the account of travellers, who have ſeen a tree in Brazil 120 feet round, and there are ſtill trees more marvellous, mentioned in late hiſtories of China; one of which is in the province of Suchu, near the town of Kian; it is called Sieunich, that is to ſay, the tree of a thouſand years: and is ſo vaſt, that one of its branches only will afford ſhelter to 200 ſheep. Another tree, in the province of Chekianga, is nearly four hundred feet in circumference.</p>

               <p>I might cite a number of particular facts, in which I own I have found ſome exaggeration; but which are ſufficiently eſtabliſhed to prove, at leaſt by their union, that his anger is noble, his courage magnanimous, and his heart feeling. Often has he been ſeen to diſdain weak enemies, deſpiſe their inſults, and pardon their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive liberties. When reduced to captivity, though weary, he is not peeviſh; but, on the contrary, becomes habitually gentle, obeys his maſter, flatters the hand that feeds him; ſometimes grants life to animals given him as a prey, and, as if attached to them by this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous act, continues afterwards the ſame protection; lives peaceably with them, gives them part of his ſubſiſtence, lets them ſometimes take it all, and would rather ſuffer hunger, than loſe the fruit of his firſt benefit.</p>

            <p n="29">(29) This bird is called flamingo, or phenicopetra, or becharu; which ſecond name among the Greeks, ſignified the bird of flaming wing, becauſe when it flies againſt the ſun, it appears like a firebrand. The plumage, when young, is roſe coloured, and at ten months old, the colour of fire. <q>Its beak, ſays M. de Buffon, is of a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary form, its legs exceſſively high, its neck long and dented; its body ſtands higher, though it is leſs than the ſtork's; and its form, ſomewhat odd, makes it diſtinguiſhable from that of every other fiſhing bird.</q>

            </p>
            <p>The flamingo is certainly a bird of paſſage, and are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous at St. Domingo and the Antilles; they fly in ſociety, and naturally form themſelves into a line, ſo that at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſtance they reſemble a brick wall, and, ſomewhat nearer, ſoldiers arranged in rank and file. They place ſentinels, which give the alarm by a very ſhrill cry, like the ſound of a trumpet, at which they all take flight. Their fleſh is much admired as food, and ancient Epicures were very fond of their tongues.</p>

When it is ſeen, it flies and hovers over a hollow-tree, that contains a hive; and if the hunters do not come, it redoubles its cries, flies back, returns to the tree, and points out the prey in the moſt marking manner; forgetting nothing to excite them to profit by the treaſure it has diſcovered, and which probably it could not enjoy without the aid of man; either becauſe the entrance to the hive is too ſmall, or from other circumſtances which the relater has not told us. While the honey is procuring, it flies to ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, intereſtingly obſerving all that paſſes, and waiting ſor its part of the ſpoil; which the hunters never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to leave, though not enough to ſatiate the bird, conſequently not to deſtroy his ardour for this kind of chaſe.</q>

            <p n="40">(40) <q>Now, as anciently, the nurſe of the maſter or miſtreſs, in all reſpectable Grecian houſes, is conſidered as one of the family. Of old, a woman who had nurſed a child, never quitted it, not even after marriage: and among the moderns, as well as the ancients, the nurſe is generally a ſlave, purchaſed when the time of delivery draws near.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>The attachment of nurſes to the children they have ſuckled, is ſo ſtrongly interwoven with their manners, that the modern name for nurſe is <hi>Paramana,</hi> a moſt kind word, and even more expreſſive than the ancient appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince it ſignifies <hi>second mother.</hi> The nurſe is always lodged in the houſe, when ſhe has ſuckled a child, and from that moment is in a manner incorporated in the family.</p>
               <p>Female ſlaves, now, as well as anciently, are treated with much kindneſs and humanity by the Greeks, and, after a certain time, are freed; ſome are adopted while young, and theſe are called <hi>Daughters of their ſouls.</hi>

(41) <q>The Grecian ladies have always delighted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn themſelves with jewels; they enrich their girdles, neck-laces, and bracelets, with them; and while their heads are decked with the moſt beautiful flowers of the ſpring, the diamond is ſeen ſparkling beſide the jeſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and roſe; they dreſs themſelves thus when going abroad, or without an intention of being ſeen.</q>

               <p>Theſe ornaments are only ſacrificed to ſome ſtrong cauſe for grief.—Almoſt all the Grecian women for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to wear them in the abſence of their huſbands.—At preſent when they go any diſtance, unwilling to walk through the ſtreets with their jewels, they have them carried, put them on before they enter the houſe they are going to, and take them off when they return: this likewiſe is a very ancient cuſtom.</p>

               <q>Apologues, Tales, Romances, owe their origin to Greece.

Formerly the bride was bought by real ſervices done the father. This was afterwards reduced to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and, to this time, that cuſtom is continued, tho' the preſents are arbitrary. The man is not obliged to purchaſe the woman he marries, but, on the contrary, receives a portion with her equal to her condition.</q>

               <p>The ſame pomp, proceſſion, and muſic, are ſtill in uſe. Dancers, muſicians, and ſingers, who chant the Epithalamium go before; the bride, loaded with orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, her eyes down-caſt, and herſelf ſuſtained by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or two near relations, walks extremely ſlow, &amp;c.—Formerly the bride wore a red or yellow veil; the Armenians do ſo ſtill. This was to hide the bluſh of modeſty, the embarraſſment and tears of the young vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</p>
               <p>The bright torch of Hymen is not forgotten among the modern Greeks; it is carried before the new married couple into the nuptial chamber where it burns till it is conſumed; and it would be an ill omen, were it by any accident extinguiſhed; wherefore it is watched with as much care, as was of old the ſacred fire of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>
               <p>Arrived at the church, the bride and bridegroom each wear a crown, which, during the ceremony, the prieſt changes, by giving the crown of the bridegroom to the bride, and that of the bride to the bridegroom; which cuſtom alſo is derived from the ancients.—I muſt not forget an eſſential ceremony which the Greeks have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, which is the cup of wine given to the bridegroom, in token of adoption; it was the ſymbol of contract and alliance; the bride drank from the ſame cup, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards paſſed round to the relations and gueſts.</p>
               <p>They dance and ſing ſtill all night, but the companions of the bride are excluded; they feaſt among themſelves, in ſeparate apartments, far from the tumult of the nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials.

               <p>The young bride, richly dreſſed, wearing long treſſes of threads of gold, interwoven with her beautiful hair, after the manner of the Greeks, deſcended from her apartment; ſhe eagerly advanced to kiſs her father and mother, who waited to receive her, at the head of ten children.—Who, among us, could behold with dry eyes, a tender and reſpectable mother, unable to detach herſelf from a daughter, whom ſhe preſſed in her arms,

and whom ſhe bedewed with tears, which an exceſs of joy and affection cauſed abundantly to flow on her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal boſom?—The father wept alſo, but, with eyes raiſed to heaven, pronounced, with a firm tone, a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal benediction on his daughter, and vows for the happineſs of her and her huſband.—At their return, noſegays woven with threads of gold, were given to the young men, ſaying, Go you and marry alſo.</p>

            <p>M.

When the Patriarch has embraced the corpſe, the relations, and thoſe who walk in the proceſſion, do the ſame. This ſcene, which the idea of an enternal adieu rendered but too affecting, became more ſo, when the ſiſter, with ſtreaming eyes, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to her cauſe of grief, rent her garments, and tore her hair up by the root, to ſtrew over the coffin of a brother, whom ſhe was ſoon no more to ſee.

<pb n="221" facs="unknown:020385_0220_0FAF09D3DA6EC8E0"/>
end whereof is faſtened to the ſide of the bark. The ſack is intended for the reception of the oyſters gathered from the rock, and the cord is to pull up the diver when his bag is full, or when he wants air. In this equipage he preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates himſelf above 60 feet under water. As he has no time to loſe there, he is no ſooner arrived at the bottom, than he begins to run from ſide to ſide, ſometimes on ſand, ſometimes on a clay earth, and ſometimes among the points of rocks, tearing off the oyſters he meets with, and cramming them into his budget.</p>
            <p>At whatever depth the divers be, the light is ſo great, that they eaſily behold what paſſes in the ſea, with the ſame clearneſs as on land; and, to their conſternation, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſee monſtrous fiſhes, from which all their addreſs in mudding the water, &amp;c. will not always ſave them, but they become their prey; and of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the perils of fiſhery, this is one of the greateſt and moſt uſual.</p>
            <p>The beſt divers will keep under water half an hour, the reſt do not ſtay leſs than a quarter; during which time they hold their breath, without the uſe of oils, or any other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, only acquiring the habit by long practice. When they find themſelves ſtraightened, they pull the rope by which the bag is faſtened, and hold faſt by it with both hands; the people in the bark take the ſignal, and heave them up into the air, and unload them of their fiſh, which is ſometimes 500 oyſters, and ſometimes not above 50.</p>
            <p>Some of the divers need a moment's reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They unload their barks on ſhore, and lay their oyſters in an infinite number of little pits, dug four or five feet ſquare; then raiſe heaps of ſand over them to the height of a man, which, at a diſtance, looks like an army ranged in battle. In this condition they are left, till the rain, wind and ſun obliges them to open, which ſoon kills them; upon this the fleſh rots and dries, and the pearls, thus diſengaged, tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into the pit, upon taking the oyſters out.</p>
            <p>After clearing the pits of the groſſer filth, they ſift the ſand ſeveral times to ſeparate the pearls; but what care ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they take herein, they always looſe a great many.

When the quantity is too great, they put out their lights, fall with their bellies to the ground, and, by their cries, advertize their comrades to do the ſame; by which means the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed matter paſſes over them, and hurts only thoſe who have no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

and though the reality of it cannot be denid, the relation will be thought to require good authentication.</p>
            <p>As a full-grown Kraken has never been ſeen in all its parts and dimenſions, an accurate ſurvey of which muſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſome time, and not a little motion, it is impoſſible to give a complete deſcription of one. Nevertheleſs, we ſhall ſubmit the probability of its exiſtence, on the beſt informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our author could collect, which ſeems to have fixed his own belief of it; though, at the ſame time, he acknowledges the account is very defective, and ſuppoſes a farther infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation concerning the creature may be reſerved for poſterity.</p>
            <p>Our Fiſhermen, ſays the author, unanimouſly and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably affirm, that, when they are ſeveral miles from the land, particularly in the hot ſummer days, and by their diſtance, and the bearings of ſome points of land, expect from eighty to a hundred fathoms deep, and do not find but from twenty to thirty, and more eſpecially if they find a more than uſual quantity of cod and ling, they judge that the Kraken is at the bottom; but if they find, by their lines, that the water in the ſame place ſtill ſhallows on them, they know he is riſing to the ſurface, and row off with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt expedition, till they come into the uſual ſoundings of the place; when, lying on their oars, in a few minutes the monſter emerges, and ſhews himſelf ſufficiently, though his whole body does not appear. Its back, or upper part, which ſeems an Engliſh mile and an half in circumference, (ſome have affirmed more) looks at firſt like a number of ſmall iſlands, ſurrounded with ſomething that floats like ſea-weeds. At laſt, ſeveral bright points, or horns, appear, which grow thicker, the higher they emerge, and ſometimes ſtand up as high and large as the maſts of middle-ſized veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. In a ſhort time it ſlowly ſinks, which is thought as dangerous as its riſing; as it cauſes ſuch a ſwell and whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool, as draws every thing down with it, like that of Male-ſtrom. The Biſhop juſtly regrets the omiſſion of, probably, the only opportunity that ever has, or may be preſented, of ſurveying it alive, or ſeeing it entire when dead. This, he informs us, once did occur, on the credit of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Mr. Friis, Miniſter at Nordland, and Vicar of the College for promoting Chriſtian Kowledge; who informed him, that in 1680, a Kraken, (perhaps a young and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs one, as they generally keep ſeveral leagues from land) came into the waters that run between the rocks and cliffs near Alſtahong; where, in turning about, ſome of its long

horns caught hold of ſome adjoining trees, which it might eaſily have torn up, but that it was alſo entangled in ſome clifts of the rocks, whence it could not extricate itſelf, but putrefied on the ſpot. Our author has heard of no perſon deſtroyed by the Monſter, but relates a report of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of two fiſhermen, who came upon a part of the water, full of the creature's thick ſlimy excrements (which he voids for ſome months, as he feeds for ſome others); they immediately rowed off, but were not quick enough, in turning, to ſave the boat from one of the Kraken's horns, which ſo cruſhed the head of it, that it was with difficulty they ſaved their lives on the wreck, though the weather was perfectly calm; the Monſter never appearing at other times. His excrement is ſaid to be attractive of other fiſh, on which he feeds; which expedient was probably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, on account of his ſlow unwieldy motion, to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence; as this ſlow motion again may be neceſſary to the ſecurity of ſhips of the greateſt force and burthen, which muſt be overwhelmed on encountering ſuch an immenſe animal, if his velocity was equal to his weight; the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wegians ſuppoſing, that if his arms, on which he moves, and with which he take his food, were to lay hold of the largeſt man of war, they would pull it down to the bottom.</p>
            <p>In confirmation of the reality of this animal, our learned author cites Debe's deſcription of Faroe, for the exiſtence of certain iſlands, which ſuddenly appear, and as ſuddenly vaniſh. Many ſeafaring men, he adds, give accounts of ſuch, particularly the North-Sea; which their ſuperſtition has either attributed to the deluſion of the Devil, or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as inhabited by evil ſpirits. But our honeſt hiſtorian, who is not for wronging the devil himſelf, ſuppoſes ſuch miſtaken iſlands to be nothing but the Kraken, called by ſome, the <hi>Sea Trolden</hi> or <hi>Sea Miſchief;</hi> in which opinion he was greatly confirmed, by the following quotation of Dr. Hierne, a learned Swede, from Baron Grippen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hielm; and which is certainly a very remarkable paſſage, <abbr>viz.</abbr>

ſomething like three points of land in the ſea, which ſurprized me a little, and I thought I had inadvertently paſſed them over before. Upon this I called to a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, to enquire for <hi>Gummars Ore;</hi> but when he came we could ſee nothing of it: upon which the peaſant ſaid, all was well, and that this prognoſticated a ſtorm, or a great quantity of fiſh.</q> To which our author ſubjoins, <q>Who cannot diſcover that this <hi>Gummars Ore,</hi> with its points, and prognoſtications of fiſh, was the Kraken, miſtaken by Buraeus for an iſland, who may keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about that ſpot where he riſes.</q> He takes the Kra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, doubtleſs, from his numerous <hi>tentaculi,</hi> which ſerve him as feet, to be of the polype kind; and the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of its enormous bulk, led him to adopt a paſſage from Eccleſ. xliii. 31, 32, to it. Whether it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Dragon that is in the ſea, mentioned Iſaiah xxvii. 1. we refer to the conjecture of the reader. After paying but a juſt reſpect to the moral character, the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend function, and deligent inveſtigations of our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, we muſt admit the poſſibility of its exiſtence, as it Implies no contradiction; though it ſeems to encounter a general prepoſſeſſion of the Whale's being the largeſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal on, or in, our globe; and the eradication of any long prepoſſeſſion is attended with ſomething irkſome to us.

            <p n="66">(66) Pliny has mentioned an extraordinary effect of oil, in ſtilling the ſurface of the water, when it is agitated with waves; and the uſe made of it, by the Divers, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Dr. Franklin was led, by an accidental obſervation made at ſea, in 1757, to attend particularly to Pliny's account; and the various information which he afterwards received relating to it, induced him to try ſome experiments on the ſubject. Standing on the windward ſide of a large pond, the ſurface of which was rendered very rough with the wind, he poured a tea-ſpoonful of oil on the water. This ſmall quantity produced an inſtant calm over a ſpace of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral yards ſquare, which ſpread amazingly, and extended itſelf gradually, till it reached the Ice-ſide, making all that quarter of the pond, perhaps half an acre, as ſmooth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ſpreading of a drop of oil on the face of the water, which, he adds, "I do not know that any body has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered."</p>
            <p>When a drop of oil is put on a looking-glaſs, or poliſhed marble, it ſpreads very little; but on water it inſtantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pands into a circle, extending ſeveral feet in diameter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſo thin as to produce the priſmatic colours, for a conſiderable ſpace, and beyond them ſo much thinner as to be inviſible, except in its effects of ſmoothing the waves at a much greater diſtance. <q>It ſeems ſays Dr. Frahklin, as if a mutual repulſion between its particles took place as ſoon as it touched the water, and a repulſion ſo ſtrong as to act on other bodies, ſwimming on the ſurface, as ſtraws, leaves, &amp;c. forcing them to recede every way from the drop, as from a centre, leaving a large clear ſpace.</q> The quantity of this force, and the diſtance to which it will operate, the author ſays, he has not yet aſcertained; but he thinks it a curious enquiry, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to underſtand whence it ariſes.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, there is great room to ſuppoſe, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the partial failure of an experiment made at Portſmouth, by Dr. Franklin, and others) that ſeafaring people may derive advantages from uſing oil, on particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occaſions, in order to moderate the violence of the waves, or to leſſen the ſurf, which ſometimes renders the landing on a lee-ſhore dangerous or impracticable.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe we are informed, that the captain of a Dutch Eaſt-India ſhip, being overtaken by a ſtorm, found himſelf obliged, for greater ſafety in wearing the ſhip, to pour oil into the ſea, to prevent the waves breaking over her, which had an excellent effect, and ſucceeded in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving her.—<bibl>

            <p n="67">(67) Spider, a genus of the optera order of inſects. The characters of which are, that they have eight feet and eight eyes; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he mouth is furniſhed with two claws; the two palpi are articulated; and the anus is provided with papillae, or nipples, for weaving. Linnaeus enumerates 47 ſpecies.</p>
            <p>Of the Spider, we have a great number of ſpecies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among us, which all agree in the general marks and characters.</p>
            <p>They all have weapons iſſuing out of the mouth; but theſe are of two kinds, according to the two principal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions of the Spiders. They conſiſt, in ſome, of two ſpicula, in the manner of a forked hook; this is their ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:020385_0236_0FAF09E3E301C2F0"/>
in all the kinds which have eight eyes. In others they are compoſed of two forcipated arms, or are divided into two claws, in the manner of the legs of a crab; theſe are the weapons of all thoſe Spiders which have only two eyes.</p>
            <p>The belly of the Spider is remarkably divided from the head and ſhoulders, ſo as to adhere only by a thread: this is the caſe in all except the two-eyed kinds; and in the different ſpecies the body is variouſly painted.</p>
            <p>Spiders frequently caſt their ſkins, which may be found in the webs, perfectly dry and tranſparent; and from ſuch ſkins the forceps, or claws, for they are always ſhed with the ſkins, may eaſier be ſeparated, and examined with much greater exactneſs, than in the common Spider, while living.</p>
            <p>The Spider's manner of weaving its web is very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The creature has five little teats, or nipples, near the extremity of the tail: from theſe there proceeds a gummy liquor, which adheres to every thing it is preſſed againſt; and being drawn out, hardens inſtantly in the air, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a ſtring or thread ſtrong enough to bear five or ſix times the weight of the Spider's body. This thread is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſeveral finer ones, which are drawn out ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but unite together at two or three hair-breadths diſtance from the creature's body. Theſe threads are finer or coar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, according to the bigneſs of the Spider that ſpins them. Mr. Leuwenhoeck has computed, that a hundred of the ſingle threads of a full-grown Spider, are not equal to the diameter of the hair of his beard; and, conſequently, if the threads and hair be both round, ten thouſand ſuch threads are not bigger than ſuch a hair. He calculates farther, that when young Spiders firſt begin to ſpin, four hundred of them are not larger than one which is of a full growth; allowing which, four millions of a young Spider's threads are not ſo big as the ſingle hair of a man's beard.—<bibl>

one iſſues from the ſide of its parent, in form of a ſmall pimple or protuberance, which lengthening and enlarging every hour, becomes, in about two days, a perfect animal, and drops from off its parent to ſhift for itſelf: but before it does this, it has often another growing from its ſide; and ſometimes a third from it, even before the firſt is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from its parent.</p>
            <p>If the method of this little animal's producing its young be very amazing, its reproduction of the ſeveral parts, when cut off, is much more ſo. The diſcovery of this was perfectly accidental; for M. Trembley, who had often met with the creature in the water, and from its fixed reſidence in one place, and ſome other obſervations, not being able to determine whether it were an animal or a vegetable, made the trial by cutting it aſunder, when, to his amazement, he found, that in a few days each of thoſe pieces was become a perfect animal, the head part having ſhot forth a tail, and the tail a head.</p>
            <p>A thouſand other trials, by cutting the animal in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manners, firſt by M. Trembley, and afterwards, at his requeſt, by M. Reaumur, and Bernard de Juſſie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Surinam Toad is well known to produce its young, not in the ordinary way, but in cells upon its back. Mr. Sherwood has, very lately, diſcovered the ſmall eels in ſour paſte, to be each, without exception, full of living young ones. And as to the moſt amazing of all its properties, the reproduction of its parts, we know the crab and lobſter, if a leg be broken off, always produce a new one: and M. Bonet, M.
