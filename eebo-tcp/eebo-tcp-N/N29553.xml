            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

When, God knows, your time is of the least.</p>
            <p>There are these Live things more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this second Head, which will include you to make haste. To delay not one hour longer.

            <p n="1">1. Thou hast a great Work to do, and therefore should not lose one <hi>Minute</hi> of <hi>time</hi> for the doing of it. Thou hast many
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:039357_0030_1013FEC30C665CB8"/>

               </gap> state hereafter: Many a Prayer to make Many an hour to be spent in searching of thy Heart, and trying of thy State. And is not all the time that thou half before thee if thou begin to day, little enough to do this great Work, that God lays upon thee to do?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Work enjoyned by God it is difficult Work, and hard Work too. The more difficult your Work is, if you be wise, the more time you will take for the doing of it. Is not to set thy heart and thy love upon God, to love him above all, and to please him before all? is not think you, this hard and difficult Work, when the heart of a sinner natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally loves any thing better than God? To have thy will to bow to Christ, and submit to Christ, and accept of Christ, when it is rebellious and stubborn? Is not this hard Work, to change thy heart to break thy hard and stony heart? To reform thy Life, is not this hard and difficult Work? And all commanded by
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:039357_0031_1013FEC7D51293B8"/>
God. If this Work be not hard, why is it not done? If it be hard why do you not go about it? Consider then that it is difficult work that you have to do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The work that you have to do, in order to another World, it is necessary work: It is work that must be done, or thy <hi>Soul</hi> will be <hi>undone,</hi> and that for ever. And wilt thou yet delay, and wilt thou yet stand dallying, and putting it off, whether thou hadst best do it or not! If the work were indifferent, whether to be done, or left undone, I could not blame you for making no more haste; but this is not the Case; this is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessery than <hi>Food,</hi> when thou art an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, more necessary than Physick, when thou art sick. Beloved people, you must be holy, or you must never see God, but to your Eternal Terrour; you must turn from sin, or burn in Hell! you must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or you cannot be saved; so great a Necessity there is for the doing of the work, that God Commands you to do: Is it an indifferent thing, whether thou escape the Damnation of Hell, or no! If not, behold <hi>holiness</hi> is the way to <hi>Heaven! Faith</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> is the way to <hi>Heaven!</hi> This must be done, or thy Soul must not
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:039357_0032_1013FECCD92BF458"/>
saved, Sirs, if there be any business in this World, that lies upon our hands that is necessary to be done, this is it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Work that God Commands you to do, it is a Soul work: And I am sure that <hi>soul work</hi> should not be delayed: <hi>Soul-work</hi> should be done with all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble speed O that you would resolve and say, <hi>It is my Soul that must be Dammed or Saved; therefore I will make haste! It is my Soul that must go to Heaven or Hell therefore I will make haste to look after the Salvation of my Soul.</hi> Thou hast but one Soul, one only soul: Wilt thou make haste to feed thy Body, when hungry? Wilt thou make haste to quench thy Thirst, when dry? And to send for a Physician, when in danger of Death, and to cry out to those about thee, <hi>O stay not, make haste, bring him away quickly</hi> and yet in the <hi>mean</hi> while never think of thy soul? Is thy Body better then thy Soul? Is not thy Soul far the Better? Wilt thou take care to feed and cloath the Body, and delay the getting an Interest in Christ to save thy Soul? Why so careful for a dying body, that within a little while shall be nothing but a lump of lifeless dust? I do not you know that e're long men shall
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:039357_0033_1013FECE5D5FE5C0"/>
carry your bodies on their shoulders to the grave, and lay them in the dust, to have them rotten? What! will you take such care to make provision for a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Body, and yet neglect your Souls! What mean you, Sirs! What mean you! What ails men, that they dally thus with themselves? Are they besides their Wits!</p>
            <p n="5">5. And lastly, if you think nothing that has been said is worth regarding, yet I pray consider the work that God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you to mind in this World, it is a Work for Eternity! And wilt thou put it off for another year, Month, or Week! Do you think, Sirs, that a short <hi>Life</hi> upon <hi>Earth</hi> is not time little <hi>enough</hi> to prepare for an eternal life, for <hi>an endless</hi> eternity! is a few years too much to be spent with all diligence, that thou mayest be ready for an everlasting State, to which thou art a hastning. Beloved Hearers, you and I are all before God this day, but how soon, we may be in a <hi>unalterable</hi> estate is unknown to us; you are now in Time, to morow you may be in <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> you may be in an everlasting state What, and yet make no more haste! Death is at your backs, Heaven and <hi>Hell</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:039357_0034_1013FECFE212BF70"/>
before you, what! and yet delay! What! At the brink of <hi>an Everlasting State,</hi> and make no more <hi>haste</hi> to do what <hi>God</hi> has <hi>Commanded</hi> thee! Remember man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, it is <hi>Heaven</hi> that must be <hi>lost</hi> or <hi>won</hi> for ever! It is Eternal Joy, that thou must have, or go without when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you shall leave this World! It is Everlasting Torments or Everlasting Blessedness that you must enter into, when you leave this World: Yet will you not make haste to do that Work, that God Commands you to do! Arise Sinner in the Name of God, Awake, be up and doing, as thou lovest thy Soul: Make haste, Sinner, make haste, begin to day, before to morrow: Begin this hour, before the next, to do the Work that God Commands thee; for all the time that is before thee, is little enough to do it in.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Work, Sirs, that God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you to do, must be now done, or never. What, and yet sit still, and yet daily! It must be now, or never. Sirs, it you will Repent, you must how Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or never to any purpose; if you will make your Peace with God, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

in this World to make preparation for another. God has set us in this Life, that we may make ready for another. We are in this world upon tryal, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we behave our selves and mind our work, or let it alone, so it must be with us for ever. This World is the place, this Life the time, when work for Heaven must be done or never be done. <hi>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou goest,</hi> Eccles 9 10. O that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Trifler in the matters of his God, and of his Soul, would write that verse upon his Chamber Door; in which you may mind these three thing, <abbr>

2. In the Grave there is no work to be done; no Preaching there, nor no Means nor helps there. Of which more hereafter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Therefore it follows, that what now thou hast to do, it should be done with all thy might, and with all haste and possible speed. What thou hast in <hi>thy hand to do, do it with all thy might, for there is no work to do in the Grave to which thou art a going.</hi> Jesus Christ did work the more because his Time was but short, <hi>I must work the work of him that sent me, whilst it is day; for the night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wherein no man can work.</hi> Behold your day is passing away!

1. After Death there shall be no offers of Mercy, nor tenders of Pardon to all Eternity, therefore now, or never You must <hi>now</hi> do what God Commands, or not at all. Now God he calls and Christ he calls, and the Spirit he calls, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters they call, <hi>That thou wouldest leave thy Sin:</hi> But if thou stop thine ears and harden thy heart till death, after death none of these shall call to thee for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more! God did never send to Damned Souls; What say you now, will you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Mercy now, will you have a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour now, and hearken to God now? No, God never took this course as yet, and God will never do it.</p>

When Death hath shut thine Eyes, and separated thy Soul from thy Body, if thou diest an Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, thou never afterwards shalt have Faith. If thou diest Impenitent, thou never afterwards shalt Repent. Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Damned Souls may Repent in Hell that they did not Repent upon Earth; but Repentance in Hell, is but the <hi>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation</hi> of their Misery, it being fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Repentance.

            <p n="3">3. The Soul after Death enters into an everlasting State, where there shall be no alteration for ever; therefore what you do for your Souls, must be done Now, or Never. The Soul, when gone into another World, where is first takes its Lodgings, it will be for ever. There once damn'd, and for ever damned!

thy youth.</hi> So you young Ones perhaps may say, you do, and yet stay longer, yet a year or two; but mark, there is one word more, <hi>Remember</hi> Now <hi>thy Creator in the days of thy youth,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 2. <hi>Now is the appointed time: Now is the day of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Sirs, there is not one of you all can say to morrow is the day of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the next week, or the next Year shall be the day of Salvation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and the Righteousness thereof.</hi> How contrary is the Commandment of God to the Practice of men? First for an <hi>Estate,</hi> then for Holiness, as I was told, was a saying of one that I was lately with, that lies under horrible Distress of <hi>Soul</hi> that was eagerly bent to get an Estate, quickly; and after he had done he cryed, <hi>God for give me, Heb</hi> 3. 7, 8. Wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith, <hi>To dry of ye will hear his Voice, harden not your hearts, as in the Provocation, in the day of Temptation in the Wilderness,</hi> Heb 4 7. Again, he limiteth a certain day, saving, <hi>today if you will hear his Voice, harden not your hearts.</hi> Now seriously ponder this, then tell me. If there be any room so your delays.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The last reason is this, There is no room for your <hi>Deliberation</hi> in this cause,

whether you will obey the <hi>Commands</hi> of God or no, and <hi>consequently</hi> there can be no room for delay; there is no time to be spent, whether you should keep Gods Command or no. <q>There are some things that do not come under mens delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to spend any time to deliberate whether we are to do them or no.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As for Instance, which of you do deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate <hi>whether</hi> you shall <hi>Eat</hi> or <hi>Drink</hi> or no: No man <hi>would,</hi> but for quantity or quality, you may <hi>deliberate,</hi> but whether <hi>Eat</hi> or <hi>Drink</hi> at all, you must not delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. So the <hi>Ultimate</hi> End of man comes not under mans deliberation. No man deliberates whether he shall be happy or no. Now such is your obedience to the Commandments of God. 'Doing that which he <hi>Commands</hi> you to do, will your spend time to deliberate whether the blessed God should be beloved or no: Will you spend time to <hi>deliberate</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> shall be believed on or no?

in all this time! O you that are Young, for you are my hopes! I profess that I have more hope of you, than of those that are Old &amp; Wicked. I take it to be my great advantage, that I Preach to so many that are young; think of what has been said to you, &amp; what has been spoken to you, and when you come home, consider, you have heard Ten Things, that there is no room for loyter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and you that are Old, if you are not past feeling, O would to God you were not. This is the Mischief, when People are young, then they think it is too soon; and when they are old, then they say, they have been of this Opinion ever since they were born, and change now they will not. Well, think what you will, change you must, or you must be Condemned. You would think it much to wait upon a Fellow Creature a Day, or Week; yet this Blessed God has waited upon you so many Years, O make haste and come unto God, and do not delay any longer.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Then to you that are of a strong and a healthful Constitution, do you make haste and not delay to do what God commands you, though you are
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:039357_0091_1013FF5C40D326B0"/>
strong and healthful, yet make haste &amp; do not delay; you have need of this Advice, because being strong, and in perfect health, you are apt to put away the day of Death from you, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance too, and Christ too; and the making of your Peace with God, be cause you are not full of Pain, and God does not often cast you upon Beds of Sickness, therefore you think there is no need for you to make haste.</p>
            <p>First of all, As strong and as stout as thou thinkest thou art, many have been cut off in a Weeks time, and less; therefore do thou make haste; as strong as thou art; when Death comes it will make thee cry out, <hi>O I am Sick, I am Sick; I am Pained, I am Pained!</hi> O it will make thee to Tremble: You see often times that Crazy Persons do out live those that are of a Healthful Constitution; therefore do not venture your Soul Eternal State upon it because you are strong.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Tell me, Who is it that giveth thee thy strength? Is it God, or Satan? If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> God that gave thee thy strength; What a disingenious sinner art thou to God, that because God does not fill thy

Body with pain, therefore thou wilt fill thy Body with Sin? What does God give thee Health for, and give thee Strength for? Does God make thee strong, that thou mayest be strong to sin, and spend thy days in sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Consider, which is the fittest time for you to Repent, and to make your Peace with God, now when you are well and strong, or when you shall be sick and near Death? Alas! How oft have I seen people on their sick-Beds unfit to be discoursed with, that put off their Repentance till the last, till they were sick; then sickness brought its Burthen with it, its Excessive Pain with it that they had no mind to Discourse of any such Things. That is the Third Sort; to those that are strong.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. My Exhortation also is to such of you as are sickly and of a weak Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that the often sick, and often ill. It is time for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

thee over the Grave? How oft hast thou been in that case upon thy sick bed, that Men could not tell, whether thou shouldst Live or Die? And now God has restored thee, yet thou art weak still and sick still. Is it not time for you to make haste? Behold! The Voice of every Sickness is, <hi>Sinner, make haste;</hi> The Voice of every Affliction is, <hi>Sinner, make haste.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. And Lastly, My Advice is to such as have been Sick, and now are Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; do you make haste &amp; not delay to do what God has commanded you to do; Will you sin again as you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Will you slight <hi>Christ</hi> again, as you did before? and neglect <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> as before?

neglect Prayer no more, I will prophane Gods Holy Day no more!</hi> These were thy Promises; God has restored thee again, and hast thou so soon forgot what thou didst Promise unto God, and dost thou delay as much as before? O consider, and for Gods sake lay it to Heart. Didst thou tell a Lye to God, when upon thy sick Bed: and didst thou play the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite with God, when thou didst not know whether thou shouldst live or die?

            <p>Now it may be thought, that I have said enough upon this Subject; but, alas, I think I have never said enough upon any Subject, till I have gained your Hearts to do what I have Preached up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when consider, how slothful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="82" facs="unknown:039357_0095_1013FF66A06040F8"/>
to Answer these following Questions, and let Conscience answer as we go along.</p>
            <p>First of all, Tell me, Sinner, Who is it that does wait upon thee, while thou dost delay? Is it not the Blessed, and Glorious, and Eternal God? Is it not he that the Angels of Glory make all possible speed to do his commands? Is it not he, Sinner, that might have Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thee long ago, and cast thee down into Eternal Torments, and thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est this day have been among Damned Devils? Dost thou do well to make him carry for thee? Is it not he, that Died for thee, that is infinite in Mercy to save thee, if thou comest in; that is Infinite in Power to Damn thee, if thou refuse? Is it not he, that is infinitely thy Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Judge? Now, if it be reason for thee to loyter any longer, do if thou darest; do I say at thy Peril.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Who, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> thou, Trifler, that this Blessed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> should wait thus upon thee? If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> consider thee as thou a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Creature, or as thou art <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, why should God so wait upon thee one year after another? As thou art a Creature, is not thy Body
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:039357_0096_1013FF682446ED20"/>
made of dust, and must not thy Body e're long be turned into dust? What art thou, but the better sort of Clay? Dost not thou carry every day a very Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill about thee, and must the Blessed God wait upon thee? Besides, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider thee, as thou art a <hi>Sinner;</hi> Art not thou a Hell-deserving <hi>Sinner!</hi> May not <hi>God</hi> cast thee this day into Hell if he will, and into Torments, even this very hour if he will? Canst thou be happy without his Favour, and enter into Heaven without his Son, and be saved without his Mercy? Therefore delay any longer at thy Peril.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What is it for, that this God thus waits upon thee? Consider I pray you, What does God give you so much time for, one Week after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one Month after another, Year after year? Is it not to make your selves Rich in this World? O no, it is about a greater Matter that God waits and stays? Is it not to see if thou wilt mind thy escaping Eternal Damnation! God gives thee thy time for this, that thou mavest escape an Eternity of Torments: is it not for this that God waits, think you?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:039357_0097_1013FF6AB9FA1638"/>
2. That God stays so long, Is it not that thou mayest mind the Everlasting Salvation of thy Soul in Glory, that thou mayst get a Title to his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that thou mayst get an Interest in his Son, that thou mayst hereafter dwell with him, with his Son, and with his Spirit, with his Angels and Saints, when thou shalt be taken out of this World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it not that God stavs, that thou mayst be Justified, Sanctified, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned? O Sinner, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God had not stayed for this, he might have Sentenced thee down to Eternal Torments, many years ago.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is it not that God does stay, that of a Captive to Satan, and to Sin, thou mayst be made free?</p>
            <p n="5">5. That thou mayst be cured of thy Soul distemper, and of those sinful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies that are upon thy Soul; Is it not for this, I say for this, that God waits upon thee.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Tell me, who shall have the worst of it, or who shall be the Sufferer it thou still delayest &amp; dost not make haste to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, Believe and be Holy? Or who will be the better it that thou make haste to be Holy and Repent? Whose will

the Profit be, and the Advantage be? If thou dost not, Will not the harm be thy own, and will not the wrong be thy own? Sinner, dost thou think that, <hi>God</hi> thus waits upon thee, because he cannot be happy without thee? Flatter not thy self with this; for this God was happy before thou wast, and if thou art Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, this God will be infinitely happy and blessed without thee, <hi>Job</hi> 22 <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>Can a Man be profitable to God, as he that is Wise, is profitable to himself: Is it any Pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art Blessed, or is it any gain that thou makest thy self happy?</hi> Job 35 6, 7, 8. <hi>If thou sinnest, What dost thou against him? Or if thy transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be Multiplied, What dost thou to him! Or if thou art Righteous, What dost thou give unto him? Thy Unrighteousness may prejudice a Man as thou art, &amp; thy Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness may profit him.</hi> It is a matter of Admiration, that the Blessed God should so long wait upon Sinners, or that the foolish Sinner should so long delay to come to God.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Tell me, is it not <hi>life</hi>

If Men will make haste in any thing it will be where their Lives are concerned; then they think it is time for them to make haste; there is no room for loiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then: When thou art sick, how dost thou expect that all about thee should make haste?

               <pb n="92" facs="unknown:039357_0105_1013FF81C0960640"/>
First of all, Tell me, poor trifling Sinner, tell me, Dost thou purpose in thy Heart, to obey God at all, or dost thou not? Dost thou intend to do the Duty that God enjoyns thee to do, or dost thou not? Say in thy Heart, Ay or No. I am content to stay till thou weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est the <hi>Question;</hi> but I think it is a Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is so plain, that there is not a Man that dares to have the Face to say, that he does not purpose to turn to God. Well then, Is it thy purpose to Repent of sin, &amp; turn to God, or is it not? If it be not so much as thy purpose, the God of <hi>Heaven</hi> pity thee, &amp; shew mercy to thee before it is too late. For, art not thou a <hi>Wretch</hi> indeed, that hast not so much as a purpose in thy Heart to turn to God? If thou sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, Yes, I do purpose to do what God commands; then tell me, Why dost thou purpose? Thou art a Rational Creature, why dost thou pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to obey God, and forsake thy Sin? Is it because thou judgest this to be thy safest course? Is it because thou thinkest thou must be Damned if thou dost not? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> because thou thinkest thou canst <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> be saved? Is it because that <hi>God</hi> com <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

hold! All the while that thou dost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, thou art sinning against thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and thy Reason: For, thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science tells thee, it is thy safest way to forsake thy sin, &amp; to look after Christ. Well, if it be so, that it be best to leave thy sin, and turn to God, why then dost not thou do it? If it be not best, why dost thou purpose to do it?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Art thou Purposed to do what God commands, to obey what he enjoyns? What is it that thou stavest for, and dost not do it then? Dost thou stay, Sinner, to see if God will make new Laws for thee? Dost thou stay to see if God will chalk thee out a more easie way to Heaven, and Salvation, than he has done already in his Word? Dost thou Stay to see if God will make such Laws as shall be pleasing to thee, that thou <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>t</hi> keep thy Sins and go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven too? Flatter not thy self, he will never do it; If thou <hi>stayest</hi> forty Years longer, the Laws of God will be the same then, as now, the Commands of <hi>God</hi> will be the same then as now. If thou <hi>stayed</hi> Forty Years longer, thou <hi>must</hi> Repent at <hi>last,</hi> or thou must be damned at <hi>last;</hi> thou <hi>must</hi> believe at <hi>last,</hi> or thou <hi>must</hi> go to
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:039357_0107_1013FF85AD697D00"/>
Hell at last: It is the same way that we are saved now, that <hi>Adam</hi> was saved by, and that <hi>Noah, Abraham, David,</hi> &amp; <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and all that are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were saved by, that is, the way of <hi>Holiness,</hi> and the way of <hi>Faith in Christ,</hi> Obedience to the Commandments of God, being sanctified, loving God above all. You must not think to dally with <hi>God,</hi> as with <hi>Men</hi> in the Market. In the Morning you will not buy, nor at Noon, putting it off till Evening, thinking then that the Prices will all towards the close of the Market. O do no think that <hi>God</hi> will come to lower Terms at the end of the World, or towards the end of thy Life. You may see, that God has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed the same all along, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 53. 7, 8. <hi>Let the wicked forsake his way Pov</hi> 28. 13 <hi>He that covereth his sins shall not pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but be that forsaketh his Sins shall find Mercy.</hi> See, there must be a forsaking of Sin, according to the old way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18 31, <hi>Cast away all your Transgressions and turn from your Sins, so Inquiry shall not be your Ruine.</hi> So <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Christ's time, <hi>Matthew</hi> 3 8, 9. <hi>John</hi> 3 16. So in the Apostles time, I <hi>Corinth</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11. So it is still,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:039357_0108_1013FF8836DE8DF8"/>
and so it will be to the end of this World.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Consider this too, and let thy Conscience reply whether thou dost well or no. Tell me, while thou dost delay, dost not thou do worse with the Blessed God, than thou dost with Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Devils? I say, deal worse with God. Do you loiter thus when the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> calls? Do you delay thus, when the Devil Tempts you; Hast not thou the very same day that the Temptation has been laid before thee, yielded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it without delay, and hearkened to the voice of the Tempter? When didst thou say to the Devil as thou hast said to God a hundred times; and yet if God has called thee to Repent, thou hast said in thy Heart, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> yet? God has called thee to Believe, thou hast said, not yet, Lord; God has called thee, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Believe on Christ, thou hast said, not yet Lord; but when did the Devil call thee, and tempt thee to Sin, and thou saidst not yet?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Tell me, you that do de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> do not Repent, yet tell me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="96" facs="unknown:039357_0109_1013FF8ACC2B6310"/>
And will you deal worse with God, than you would have others to deal with you? You Fathers and Mothers, if you command your Children to do something for you quickly, would you take it well, if they should say, I will not do it yet this Twelve Months, yet this Ten Years? If you that are Masters, command a Servant to do something, and suppose the lawfulness of the thing, would you be contented, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the first place, this is the Wise Man, Behold, God is the best good, thy Soul is the best part, the way of Holiness is the best way, means appointed by God to get to Heaven, are the only means. But on the contrary, to neglect these it is a sign of the greatest Folly? Wilt thou do it still? Venture on at thy Peril.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Tell me, Do not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays of People greatly discourage the Faithful Ministers of the Gospel? Does not your delaying weaken our Hands, and discourage our Hearts, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

in our Faces? do you think, that we can Preach with Life, when we see no Fruit of our Works? I profess, were it not for some of you, you would even tempt me to Preach no more to you, were it not the Command of God to continue my duty. You see, <hi>Isa 49 4 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, and have spent my strength for nought and in vain;</hi> When he could not see the fruit of his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So Ministers may say, <q>Lord, we have laboured in vain, and have spent our strength for nought, and in vain.</q> 
               <hi>Jerem</hi> 20 8, 9 <hi>For since I spake, I cried out, I cried Violence and Spoil, because the Word of the Lord was made a Reproach unto me: Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his Name.</hi> And by your delaying, when we come Year after Year, and Preach Month after Month, and see many of you in your Sins still, and walk in your wicked ways; Do you think that this is not a great Discouragement unto Ministers? And do you think, that God will not lay this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Tenthly, and Lastly, Dost not thou think, O delaying Trifler! Dost not thou know, that every thing that thou settest thy Heart upon, is hastening from thee, and every thing thou lovest is hastening away, and yet, wilt not thou make haste to get something that thou mayst need, when all that now thou lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est will leave thee? Sinner, Dost not thou know, that thy time is a going, thy Health is a going, and that thy Life is a going; and yet wilt not thou make haste? Know, I say, know if thou dost not hasten unto Christ the sooner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, thou shalt e're long be Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without delay.</p>
            <p>Thus you see, I have given you Ten Questions more; Has this done the Work? Are you now resolved to go home, and enter into Covenant so be the Lords? Are you now resolved to forsake your Sins &amp; to let go your Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities? I doubt you are not; some of you will keep your Sins still, and will not come to God. Possibly, there are Two Things secret in thy Heart, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

delay. Possibly thou thinkest, Why Sir, why such haste? Is not God a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God, a long suffering God? Is not God ready to forgive, and has he not promised so to do? And if I repent hereafter, God will Pardon me hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Why such haste then? I answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is true, Sinner, that God is a merciful God, else Wo would have been thy Case long ago. It is true, God is a Patient God, a long suffering God, else thou wouldst not have been hearing of a Sermon now, but have been amongst Devils and Damned Souls at this time: But what if it be so, and thou misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? But I Answer particularly: Tell me,</p>
            <p>First, Art thou sure that thou shalt see that time, when thou dost purpose to Repent? If so be that the Devil, or thine own Heart would delude thee, now thou art young, to Repent when thou art a Man, Art thou sure to live till thou become a man? If not, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thy Soul be then? Is it not then bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Repent now without delay?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="unknown:039357_0118_1013FFA133C4EA18"/>
Secondly, Art thou sure to have the same means of Grace then as now?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Art thou sure that the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of God will strive upon thy Heart, and move upon thy Heart then, as now he does? If thou art not sure, be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for though God be patient, yet he may cut in two the Thread of thy Life, before thou seest those days where in thou purposedst to Repent.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I suppose all to be true, that thou may if live longer, and thou mayst Repent at last, and God Pardon thy sin at last? What then? Is this thy Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, to Sin against God now, because thou hopest that God will be gracious and Merciful to thee hereafter? I thought, thou hadst been a more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Person: Wouldst thou deal thus with a Friend, with a Man? But you say, what need such haste? Some Repent at the Eleventh Hour; all do not Repent while Young. To this I Answer.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If some are then brought in, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it is not all that do stand out till then?
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:039357_0119_1013FFA3AB45F120"/>
No, it is but very few; it is a very rare thing to see Persons Converted, and brought home to Christ at the Eleventh Hour. Sometimes God may do this, and truly, it is but sometimes. Pray, how many is it that you know, that were Converted when they were Old, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ate under the means of Grace while they were Young? I suppose you can tell but of very few. It is but now and then, and wilt thou put it to a Hazard, whether God will make thee such an Example? I could never find it Recorded in the Scripture, but of one Man, that was Converted at last, and that was the Thief upon the Cross? I do not say, there was no more, but no more Recorded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 6, 7. You Object, that some came in at the Eleventh Hour; I pray view that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is, Those that came in at the Eleventh Hour, they were not Called till the Eleventh Hour; Those that were called the Third Hour, came in the Third Hour; And those that were Called the Sixth Hour, came in the Sixth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="107" facs="unknown:039357_0120_1013FFA6F8107678"/>
but those that came in at the Eleventh hour, they were not called at the Third, nor Sixth, nor Ninth, but at the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth hour. Now, what is this to you, that have been Called an Hundred Times over, that have had Call after Call, and Invitation after Invitation? For when Men are called at the Third and Sixth Hours and do not come in, they seldom come in at the Eleventh Hour. What say you beloved Hearers, shall I, after these Sermons, and after al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most an hundred things spoken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> then a little more to move you.</p>

               <pb n="108" facs="unknown:039357_0121_1013FFA9A84F8CB0"/>
First of all, If thou wouldst make haste and now keep God's Commandments thou shouldest be Blessed now, thou shouldest be happy now, and will not this make you to make haste? Tell me, Sirs, Have you a mind to go home Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, to go home with the Love of God? Oh! If you would go Home Happy, Men and Women make haste, delay no longer to keep the <hi>Commandments</hi> of your God. Christ himself pronounceth you Blessed, if you will but do this, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 27, 28. <hi>It came to pass as he spoke these things, a certain Woman of the company lift up her Voice to him</hi> (that is, to Christ) <hi>Blessed is the Womb that bare thee, &amp; the Pap that gave thee Suck.</hi> Ah says she, What a Blessed Woman was that, which bore this Man! But says <hi>Christ, Yea, rather bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are they which hear the Word of God &amp; keep it;</hi> that hear God's Commands, &amp; keep them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This keeping of God'<hi>s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> would be an Evidence to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of your Love to God: Wouldest thou know that thou lovest God? Wouldest thou know this? Then do
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:039357_0122_1013FFAB30E8C850"/>
what <hi>God</hi> Commands: Keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, Obey his Precepts, hereby thou maist know, that thou lovest him, <hi>John</hi> 14. 21. <hi>He that hath my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; keepeth them, he it is that loveth me,</hi> I Joh. 5. 3, 4. <hi>This is the Love of God, that we keep his Commandments. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Christ'</hi>s <hi>Person, and keeping of</hi> Christ's <hi>Commandments,</hi> they usually go together. In the Second, <hi>Those that love me, and keep my Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you will but make haste to keep Gods Commandments, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve when he Commands, and close with Christ when he Commands, God will make haste, and hear thy Prayer? when thou pourest out thy Prayer to God, <hi>O Lord make haste, &amp; do not tarry;</hi> then God will make haste, &amp; hear thy Prayer. Whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by doing those things that are pleasing in his sight, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24 28. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have called, and ye have refused.</hi> Remember me, Sirs, that if you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="110" facs="unknown:039357_0123_1013FFADA5A53CD0"/>
a dying, when your Soul is departing, should call to God to save it, yet he would not hear your Prayer: If you neglect to keep the Commandments of God, and for God to neglect to hear the Prayers of a dying Man, What a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful case is this?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you make haste to keep the Commandments of God, he will make haste actually to keep thee when in Trouble and Temptation. Sirs, if You would make haste to keep the Commandments of God, God would make haste, and would not stay beyond that Hour that Deliverance should be for thy good.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If you would make haste to keep God's Commandments, it would be the readiest way that you could do, to have a Blessing upon your outward Enjoyments, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26 throughout.</p>
            <p>Lastly, If thou wilt do this, thou shalt be saved when thou diest; What dost thou desire more? <hi>John 1. Verily, Verily, I say unto you, if any man keep my Sayings,

            </p>
            <p>In hopes that you will, I shall lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you Ten Things, that will be the Joy of Angels, the Rejoycing of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and the Content of the Heart of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>First of all, It is a Blessed and Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sight unto Angels, &amp; to men, to see an <hi>Offering God,</hi> and a <hi>Receiving Sinner;</hi> to see a <hi>Tendring God,</hi> and a <hi>Receiving Sinner.</hi> In the Covenant of Grace, you may see God making Offers unto poor Souls, making Tenders unto poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; yea, making great Offers and Tenders of needful things to the Souls of Men. In the Covenant, God offers thee Grace, God offers thee Peace, God offer thee his Spirit, God offers thee his Son, God offers thee his Kingdom, God offers thee Himself: What shall <hi>I</hi>

say? <hi>God</hi> offers thee all that thou need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, &amp; <hi>God</hi> offers thee all that thou canst desire. Oh, by this you may see on God's part, an offering and a Tendring God: Ay, but let us see on the other side also, a Receiving and Accepting Sinner. Methinks, Sirs, that you should heartily receive what God offers you in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace;</hi> Methinks you should say, O Lord, dost thou offer Grace to me? Ah to me dost thou offer no less than thy Self, and thy Son and Spirit? Dost thou offer to me? O Lord I could never believe that thou wouldst offer any such offers unto me, except I had sound it in thy Word: O Lord, I will prostrate my self down at thy foot, thy Spirit I will gladly accept of, and thy Kingdom to be my Portion; but some will and some will not, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 11, 12. Jesus Christ, <hi>He came unto his own</hi> (offering himself unto them) <hi>but his own received him not, but to as many as did receive him, to them gave he power to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Sons of God, to as many as believed on his Name.</hi>

What shall we have? There is Wine and Milk; Milk for the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and every thing necessary for you. But in the second Verse, you have a Pleading God: <hi>Wherefore do you spend Money for that which is not Bread, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Thus in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> you see an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting, pleading God; O that now, in the <hi>Congregation,</hi> we could see a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and a Praying Sinner?

on the way of Sin: No, these Sights are too common; but a Sinner hastning towards God, and towards Jesus Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 4. 5. Jesus Christ passed by, and looked up to <hi>Zacheus</hi> on the Tree, and bade him to come down; and it is said, That <hi>he made haste and came down,</hi> and followed Christ; God has not only given thee a Call, Sinner, but he has stood waiting and knocking at the Door of thy Heart; but how long hast thou delayed?

            <p>Fourthly, it would be a joyful sight to Angels and Men, to see a Promising God, and a Believing Sinner: If this were done, the <hi>Covenant</hi> were made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and thy Soul; if as God does Promise, so thou dost believe the Promises, then God would be thy God;

and then thou shouldest be one of his People in the Covenant of Grace.

Thus it was with <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God came to make the Covenant with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 1, 2, &amp;c <hi>And when</hi> Abram <hi>was Ninety Years Old and Nine, the Lord appeared to</hi> Abram, <hi>and said unto him, I am the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, walk before me, and be thou perfect. And I will make my Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and thee, and will Multiply thee exceedingly And</hi> Abram <hi>fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying, As for me, Behold my Covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a Father of many Nations: Neither shall thy Name any more be called</hi> Abram, <hi>but thy Name shall be called Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>for a Father of many Nations have I made thee; &amp; I will make thee exceeding Fruitful, &amp; I will make Nations of thee, and Kings shall come out of thee.

thee and me, and thy seed after thee, in their Generation, for an Everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; to be a God unto thee, &amp; unto thy seed after thee. And God said unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore, thou and thy seed after thee, in their Generation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You read there of <hi>God's</hi> coming to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and says he, <hi>I make my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with thee; &amp; in thy seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be blessed.</hi> This was a Promise made to <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was Ninety and Nine Years Old; as there was a Promising God, so there was a Believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4 18, 19, 20. <hi>Who against hope, believed in hope that he might become the Father of many Nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy Seed be.

            <p>Fifthly, In order to your becoming a Covenant People, and God your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant God, It would be a joyful fight to Men and Angels, to see a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and an obeying Sinner. In the Covenant there are Commands as well as Promises, therefore they must be performed as a Duty, as well as participated of as a Priviledge, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 13 <hi>He declared unto you his Covenant that he commanded you to perform.</hi> This God comes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sixthly, To see a Threatning God, and a Trembling Sinner; is: very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful fight. Not in it self indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable, but in order to your dosing with God upon Covenant terms; for as God does invite a Sinner to take him for his God, and does wait upon him, and does Promise him Heaven, if he will? and as God commands him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

is there any likelihood that a Sinner will take God for his God till he does tremble before this Threatning God; Thy Conscience is sear'd, thou makest nothing to come up to Covenant terms; but where God Threatens, and the Soul Trembles, then it is a sign that that Man will be brought into <hi>Covenant</hi> with God.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, It is a Blessed Sight; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing Angels and Men, to see a Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ, and a Weeping Sinner. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the Covenant of Works.

            <p>O methinks, I am loth to leave you, till I see some or other strict Covenant with God and say, O I see I must take God for my God, or else, I am lost and undone, and that for ever; I am accursed by the Covenant of Works, and by the Covenant of Grace, the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e for not Obeying, and the other for not Believing. It is in vain for us to flatter you, you must have this God for your Covenant God, or else, you will come under the Power of the Second Death: Temporal Death, were nothing, if Death Eternal did not follow. See what follows Death, <hi>Revel</hi> 6 8 <hi>I looked and behold, a Pale Horse; and his Name that sate on him, was Death, and Hell followed with him.</hi> Ah there it is! There is the Thing that makes Death Terrible! Indeed,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:039357_0144_1013FFE2968EEAE8"/>
Sinner, Death e're long will get upon his pale <hi>Horse,</hi> and will be Riding swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards thee; Ay, but <hi>Hell</hi> follows after; Were it not for this, Death were nothing; but Damnation follows after Death; and it will be the case of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that will not take God for their God.</p>
            <p>Let us a little Consider what is in this <hi>Eternal Death,</hi> before you take <hi>God</hi> to be your God. I hope I shall work upon some of your Hearts.</p>
            <p>Consider, therefore, There are Two Things in this <hi>Eternal Death,</hi> and both of them exceeding Dreadful.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Exclusion from the Blessed God. Ah Sinner, as sure as thou hearest my Voice, wilt thou be shut out, and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Blessed <hi>God,</hi> and Blessed <hi>Christ,</hi> and Blessed <hi>Angels,</hi> and Blessed <hi>Saints,</hi> if thou dost not take God for thy <hi>God,</hi> Matth. 25. 41. <hi>Depart from me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="132" facs="unknown:039357_0145_1013FFE44A62A548"/>
packing away from the Blessed Jesus, This is the Punishment of Loss; but if it were the loss of thy Pleasures only, and the loss of thy Friends only, this were nothing: Ah, but what things wilt thou lose, if thou diest before God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thy Soul agree? It will be the loss of a Loving God, the loss of a Blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; This will be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and thou hadst better lose Ten Thousand Worlds than this one God. And if thou art not in Covenant with God, then</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou wilt lose thy Soul. The loss of a Soul, <hi>What shall it profit a Man, if he gain the whole world, &amp; lose his own Soul?</hi> It is not a small matter that thou maift lose, if God gain not thy consent, but it is a Soul.</p>
            <p>Consider, It is thy own Soul, Sinner, that will be lost, if thou wilt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to take God for thy God. I would not be guilty of the Damnation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Soul for all the World. Tell me Sinner, wouldst thou ruine another Man's Soul? Then, why wilt thou ruine Thine own? Whose Soul wilt thou mind, if not thine own? And whose Soul wilt thou take care of, if not thy own?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="133" facs="unknown:039357_0146_1013FFE8804F9318"/>
3. If so be, thou dost not take <hi>God</hi> for thy God, thou wilt lose thy only Soul. Ah poor Sinner, Hast thou but one only Soul that must be Damned or Saved, and wilt not thou take care for thy own Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Oh take care and see to it, it is thy only Soul. Sirs, God has given to us eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one but one only Soul, lose that, and thou losest all; if that be Damn'd all is Damn'd. Methinks, the thoughts of this should move thee to remember thy Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to remember thy only Soul, that when thou hast but one, thou mayst se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the happiness of that one. In the Body God gives us many parts by pairs, Two Eyes, that if we lose one, we may see by the other; Two Ears, Two Hands, two Feet, that if we lose one, we may have the benefit of the other; but God has given Men but one only Soul.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It will be the loss of thy precious and immortal Soul. Were it the loss of a mortal Soul that should die, &amp; cease to be, it could not be so much; but when it shall be the loss of an Immortal Soul, that cannot die, that cannot cease to be, thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> makes your Punishment the more, that will not come up to the terms of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. That is the first.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="134" facs="unknown:039357_0147_1013FFEA04EA2208"/>
II. In the Eternal Death, is the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of Sense. All manner of Pain and Torments that a just and Angry <hi>God</hi> can lay upon thee to all Eternity. If you are willing to take this <hi>God</hi> upon <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant terms,</hi> he will make you happy; But if you will not, know to your Faces, this Day. That the Eternal God will Plague you for ever, will be thy Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Punisher for ever. Consider the Names by which that Place is called, where all that die without <hi>God,</hi> must be cast into, I will name but four or five of them, and those briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If thou diest without <hi>God</hi> being thy <hi>God</hi> thou must to Prison, as sure as thou standest here; so this Place is called, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. There by the Prison you read of, is meant the Place of <hi>Hell,</hi> and the Place of the Damned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every one that Dies before God is his <hi>Covenant God,</hi> must be cast into a place of <hi>Darkness,</hi> into a place of utter <hi>Darkness, Matth</hi> 8 12. <hi>The Children of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Kingdom shall be cast into utter Darkness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Every Soul that goes out of this World before <hi>God</hi> be <hi>his God, shall be cast into a Lake of burning Brimstone,</hi> Rev 21 8.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Every Soul that leaves this World
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:039357_0148_1013FFEC975F75A0"/>
before God be his God in <hi>Covenant</hi> will be <hi>cast into a Furnace of Fire,</hi> Matth. 13. 42. Where you see Hell is set forth by a <hi>Furnace of Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Lastly, It is indeed a Place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 28. Says the Rich Man there, <hi>O send to my Brethren, and tell them what I endure, that they may not come to this place of Torment.</hi> O have mercy on me, for I am Tormented Day and Night. Now what is this, for which you must be cast into such Torments? What for, For refusing of God?</p>
            <p>Why art thou so loth, Sinner, why, to take this God for thy God? Why, will he do thee any hart? Besides, I might have shewn how, that Four Things will make your case exceeding woful? for fain I would prevail, though it were but with. One or Two, to come over to God, and that will say, O Sir, I come with all my heart, to take this God for my God.</p>
            <p>First of all, If thou wilt not, thy Pains will be Universal Pains, all over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Body, and all over thy Soul, no part of thy Body free, no part of thy Soul free; hereafter in <hi>Hell Eyes,</hi> and <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Heart,</hi> and all the Pains of <hi>Hell</hi> shall be
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:039357_0149_1013D72D6EEE2518"/>
Universal, every part sinned, and every part shall Suffer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They shall be extream too, Sinner. If thou wilt refuse this God to be thy God, he will inflict upon thee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Pain: Now to have Pain all over, and to be all over in extremity, what a sad case is this?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Then they must be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, without intermission; not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Pain, and sometimes at ease; No, no, this is not the case of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; no, there is no intermission, not for an hour, not for one moment in Hell: If so be you have a pain on your Body for an hour or two, or in the night, and in the morning you have ease, what a refreshment is that? But for a Person to lie under the pain of <hi>Gout</hi> and <hi>Stone,</hi> and Night and Day cryeth out, no ease, no mitigation, not an hours rest all Night long: O consider, what it will be, not to have an hours rest to all Eternity, not the least intermission!</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As it shall have no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, so it shall have no cessation. If it were Pain to continue for a Thousand Years, without an Hours Rest between, yea a thousand to that, &amp; a thousand to
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:039357_0150_1013FFF02D9D3348"/>
that, it would be happy Tidings; but those that will not have God for their God, they must have Pain without ease, and without intermission, and that for ever.</p>
            <p>But for one Thing more. Besides all this, Sirs, if you will not have this God for your God, your Covenant <hi>God,</hi> you will have something to Torment you in Hell, that Thousands of others never shall.</p>
            <p>Shall I tell you, Beloved Hearers, shall I tell you, you will have something to Torment you, that Devils shall not have. I say, something lie heavier on you than upon Devils; something to Torment you, that the Heathens have not to Torment them: What is that? O it is the gnawings of a never dying Worm, for the refusing of an offered Christ, of Mercy, while Mercy may be had. When you shall lie in Hell, it God does not prevent you, what will be the gnawings of thy Conscience?</p>
            <p>Methinks, I hear poor Damn'd <hi>wretches</hi> that have sat under the Gospel, accusing themselves alter this manner; <hi>It was for the breach of the</hi> Covenant of <hi>Works that I am in this place; but I might have had
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:039357_0151_1013FFF2967B9998"/>
help in the Covenant of Grace; God was offered unto me, and Christ was offered unto me, Ministers Pleaded with me day after day; but said Conscience, this thou wouldst not do, thou said No, to thy dying day. Had I accepted of Mercy, while Mercy might have been had, I need not have come into this place of Torment: But alas, wo is me, the Devils above me, never slighted such Mercy as I have done! Wo is me, the Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of Heathens that are above me, never slighted such Mercy as I have done! A Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was never offered to Devils; a Saviour was never Preached to the Heathens; But I like a miserable Wretch now, like a Damned Wretch now, might have had mercy, but would not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I might have escaped this Place, but would not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wo is me now I am lost for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver! Wo is me now, I am Damned for ever! My Praying time is gone over! I might have had God to have been my God once, but now he will never be offered to me any more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus look to it, it will be worse with you than with Devils &amp; with Heathens if you refuse to take <hi>God</hi> for your <hi>God,</hi> and you give not up your selves to be his People.</p>
