            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <dateline>Crichoff, in White Ruſſia, <date>Jan. 1787,</date>
                  </dateline>
               </opener>
               <p>AMONG the various ſpecies or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications of liberty, of which on different occaſions we have heard ſo much in England, I do not recollect ever ſeeing any thing yet offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in behalf of the <hi>liberty of making one's own terms in money bargains.</hi> From ſo general and univerſal a neglect, it is an old notion of mine, as you well know, that this meek and unaſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030057_0005_0FE41AE62984EFD0"/>ſpecies of liberty has been ſuffering much injuſtice.</p>
               <p>A fancy has taken me, juſt now, to trouble you with my reaſons: which, if you think them capable of anſwering any good purpoſe, you may forward to the preſs; or, in the other caſe, what will give you leſs trouble, to the ſire.</p>
               <p>In a word, the propoſition I have been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to lay down to myſelf on this ſubject, is the following one, viz. that <hi>no man of ripe years and of ſound mind, acting freely, and with his eyes open, ought to be hindered, with a view to his advantage, from making ſuch bargain, in the way of obtaining money, as he thinks fit; nor,</hi> (what is a neceſſary conſequence) <hi>any body hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from ſupplying him, upon any terms he thinks proper to accede to.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This propoſition, were it to be received, would level, you ſee, at one ſtroke, all the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers which law, either ſtatute or common, have in their united wiſdom ſet up, either againſt the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030057_0006_0FE41AEA41A0F248"/>crying ſin of Uſury, or againſt the hard-named and little-heard-of practice of Champerty; to which we muſt alſo add a portion of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farious, and as little-heard-of offence, of Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
               <p>On this occaſion, were it any individual anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt I had to deal with, my part would be a ſmooth and eaſy one. <q>You, who fetter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, you who lay reſtraints on the liberty of man, it is for you</q> (I ſhould ſay) <q>to aſſign a reaſon for your doing ſo.</q> That contracts in general ought to be obſerved, is a rule, the propriety of which, no man was ever yet found wrongheaded enough to deny; if this caſe is one of the exceptions (for ſome doubtleſs there are) which the ſafety and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of every ſociety require ſhould be taken out of that general rule, in this caſe, as in all thoſe others, it lies upon him, who alleges the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the exception, to produce a reaſon for it.</p>
               <p>This, I ſay would be a ſhort and very eaſy method with an individual: but as the world
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030057_0007_0FE41AEBE74FE378"/>has no mouth of its own to plead by, no certain attorney by which it can <q>come and defend this force and injury,</q> I muſt even find argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for it at a venture, and ranſack my own imagination for ſuch phantoms as I can find to fight with.</p>
               <p>In favour of the reſtraints oppoſed to the ſpecies of liberty I contend for, I can imagine but five arguments.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Prevention of uſury.</item>
                  <item>2. Prevention of prodigality.</item>

                  <item>5. Protection of ſimplicity againſt impoſition.</item>

               <head>LETTER II. <hi>Reaſons for Reſtraints.—Prevention of Uſury.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I WILL begin with the <hi>prevention</hi> of <hi>uſury:</hi> becauſe in the ſound of the word <hi>uſury</hi> lies, I take it, the main ſtrength of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: or, to ſpeak ſtrictly, of what is of more importance than all argument, of the hold which the opinion I am combating has obtained on the imaginations and paſſions of mankind.</p>
               <p>'Uſury is a bad thing, and as ſuch ought to be prevented: uſurers are a bad ſort of men, a very bad ſort of men, and as ſuch ought to be puniſhed and ſuppreſſed.' Theſe are among the ſtring of propoſitions which every man finds handed down to him from his progenitors: which moſt men are diſpoſed to accede to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examination, and indeed not unnaturally nor even unreaſonably diſpoſed; for it is impoſſible
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030057_0009_0FE41AEFE0F7F8D0"/>the bulk of mankind ſhould find leiſure, had they the ability, to examine into the grounds of an hundredth part of the rules and maxims, which they find themſelves obliged to act upon. Very good apology this for John Trot: but a little more inquiſitiveneſs may be required of legiſlators.</p>
               <p>You, my friend, by whom the true force of words is ſo well underſtood, have, I am ſure, gone before me in perceiving, that to ſay uſury is a thing to be prevented, is neither more or leſs than begging the matter in queſtion. I know of but two definitions that can poſſibly be given of uſury; one is, the taking of a greater intereſt than the law allows: this may be ſtiled the <hi>political</hi> or <hi>legal</hi> definition. The other is the taking of a greater intereſt than it is uſual for men to give and take; this may be ſtiled the <hi>moral</hi> one: and this, where the law has not interfered, is plainly enough the only one. It is plain, that in order for uſury to be prohibited by law, a poſitive deſcription muſt have been found for it by law, fixing, or rather ſuperſeding, the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030057_0010_0FE41AF3AF937568"/>moral one. To ſay, then, that uſury is a thing that ought to be prevented, is ſaying neither more nor leſs, than that the utmoſt rate of intereſt which ſhall be taken ought to be fixed; and that fixation enforced by penalties, or ſuch other means, if any, as may anſwer the purpoſe of preventing the breach of it. A law puniſhing uſury ſuppoſes, therefore, a law fixing the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed legal rate of intereſt; and the propriety of the penal law muſt depend upon the propriety of the ſimply-prohibitive, or, if you pleaſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory one.</p>
               <p>One thing then is plain; that, antecedently to cuſtom growing from convention, there can be no ſuch thing as uſury: for what rate of intereſt is there that can naturally be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than another? what natural fixed price can there be for the uſe of money more than for the uſe of any other thing? Were it not then for cuſtom, uſury, conſidered in a moral view, would not ſo much as admit of a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo far from having exiſtence, it would not ſo much as be conceivable: nor therefore could
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030057_0011_0FE41ACC5953DB30"/>the law, in the definition it took upon itſelf to give of ſuch offence, have ſo much as a guide to ſteer by. Cuſtom therefore is the ſole baſis, which, either the moraliſt in his rules and precepts, or the legiſlator in his injunctions, can have to build upon. But what baſis can be more weak or unwarrantable, as a ground for coercive meaſures, than cuſtom reſulting from free choice? My neighbours, being at liberty, have happened to concur among themſelves in dealing at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rate of intereſt. I, who have money to lend, and Titius, who wants to borrow it of me, would be glad, the one of us to accept, the other to give, an intereſt ſomewhat higher than theirs: why is the liberty they exerciſe to be made a pretence for depriving me and Titius of ours?</p>
               <p>Nor has blind cuſtom, thus made the ſole and arbitrary guide, any thing of ſteadineſs or uniformity in its deciſions: it has varied, from age to age, in the ſame country: it varies from country to country, in the ſame age: and the legal rate has varied along with it: and indeed,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030057_0012_0FE41AF5947E7D90"/>with regard to times paſt, it is from the legal rate, more readily than from any other ſource, that we collect the cuſtomary. Among the Romans, till the time of Juſtinian, we find it as high as twelve per cent.: in England, ſo late as the time of Henry VIII. we find it at ten per cent. Succeeding ſtatutes reduced it to eight, then to ſix, and laſtly to five, where it ſtands at preſent. Even at preſent in Ireland it is at ſix per cent.; and in the Weſt-Indies at eight per cent.; and in Hindoſtan, where there is no rate limited by law, the loweſt cuſtomary rate is ten or twelve. At Conſtantinople, in certain caſes, as I have been well informed, thirty per cent. is a common rate. Now, of all theſe widely different rates, what one is there that is intrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally more proper than another? What is it that evidences this propriety in each inſtance? what but the mutual convenience of the parties, as manifeſted by their conſent? It is convenience, then, that has produced whatever there has been of cuſtom in the matter: What can there then be in cuſtom, to make it a better guide than the convenience which gave it birth? and what is
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030057_0013_0FE41AF790EA0460"/>there in convenience, that ſhould make it a worſe guide in one caſe than in another? It would be convenience to me to give ſix per cent. for money: I wiſh to do ſo. "No," (ſays the law) "you ſhan't."—Why ſo? "Becauſe it is not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to your neighbour to give above five for it." Can any thing be more abſurd than ſuch a reaſon?</p>
               <p>Much has not been done, I think, by legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators as yet, in the way of fixing the price of other commodities: and, in what little has been done, the probity of the intention has, I believe, in general, been rather more unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable than the rectitude of the principle, or the felicity of the reſult. Putting money out at intereſt, is exchanging preſent money for future: but why a policy, which, as applied to exchanges in general, would be generally deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abſurd and miſchievous, ſhould be deemed neceſſary in the inſtance of this particular kind of exchange, mankind are as yet to learn. For him who takes as much as he can get for the uſe of any other ſort of thing, an houſe for inſtance,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030057_0014_0FE41AF98F31EC50"/>there is no particular appellation, nor any mark of diſrepute: nobody is aſhamed of doing ſo, nor is it uſual ſo much as to profeſs to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Why a man, who takes as much as he can get, be it ſix, or ſeven, or eight, or ten per cent. for the uſe of a ſum of money, ſhould be called uſurer, ſhould be loaded with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious name, any more than if he had bought a houſe with it, and made a proportionable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the houſe, is more than I can ſee.</p>
               <p>Another thing I would alſo wiſh to learn, is, why the legiſlator ſhould be more anxious to limit the rate of intereſt one way, than the other? why he ſhould ſet his face againſt the owners of that ſpecies of property more than of any other? why he ſhould make it his buſineſs to prevent their getting <hi>more</hi> than a certain price for the uſe of it, rather than to prevent their getting <hi>leſs?</hi> why, in ſhort, he ſhould not take means for making it penal to offer leſs, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, than five per cent. as well as to accept more? Let any one that can, find an anſwer to theſe queſtions; it is more than I can do: I
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030057_0015_0FE41AFCB7513970"/>except always the diſtant and imperceptible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, of ſinking the price of goods of all kinds; and in that remote way, multiplying the future enjoyment of individuals. But this was a conſideration by far too diſtant and refined, to have been the original ground for confining the limitation to this ſide.</p>

               <head>LETTER III. <hi>Reaſons for Reſtraint—Prevention of Prodigality.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAVING done with ſounds, I come gladly to propoſitions; which, as far as they are true in point of fact, may deſerve the name of reaſons. And firſt, as to the efficacy of ſuch reſtrictive laws with regard to the <hi>prevention of prodigality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That prodigality is a bad thing, and that the prevention of it is a proper object for the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator to propoſe to himſelf, ſo long as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines himſelf to, what I look upon as, proper meaſures, I have no objection to allow, at leaſt for the purpoſe of argument; though, were this the principal queſtion, I ſhould look upon it as incumbent on me to place in a fair light the reaſons there may be for doubting, how far,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030057_0017_0FE41B007387E8E8"/>with regard to a perſon arrived at the age of diſcretion, third perſons may be competent judges, which of two pains may be of greater force and value to him, the preſent pain of reſtraining his preſent deſires, or the future contingent pain he may be expoſed to ſuffer from the want to which the expence of gratifying theſe deſires may hereafter have reduced him. To prevent our doing miſchief to one another, it is but too neceſſary to put bridles into all our mouths: it is neceſſary to the tranquillity and very being of ſociety: but that the tacking of leading-ſtrings upon the backs of grown perſons, in order to prevent their doing themſelves miſchief, is not neceſſary either to the being or tranquillity of ſociety, however conducive to its well-being, I think cannot be diſputed. Such paternal, or, if you pleaſe, maternal care, may be a good work, but it certainly is but a work of ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation.</p>
               <p>For my own part, I muſt confeſs, that ſo long as ſuch methods only are employed as to me appear proper ones; and ſuch there are, I
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030057_0018_0FE41B8AD833A9D8"/>ſhould not feel myſelf diſinclined to ſee ſome meaſures taken for the reſtraining of prodigality: but this I cannot look upon as being of the number. My reaſons I will now endeavour to lay before you.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, I take it, that it is neither natural nor uſual for prodigals, as ſuch, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to this method, I mean, that of giving a rate of intereſt above the ordinary one, to ſupply their wants.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, no man, I hope you will allow, prodigal or not prodigal, ever thinks of borrowing money to ſpend, ſo long as he has ready money of his own, or effects which he can turn into ready money without loſs. And this deduction ſtrikes off what, I ſuppoſe, you will look upon as the greateſt proportion of the perſons ſubject, at any given time, to the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of prodigality.</p>
               <p>In the next place, no man, in ſuch a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as Great Britain at leaſt, has occaſion, nor
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030057_0019_0FE41B026DB4BAB8"/>is at all likely, to take up money at an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rate of intereſt, who has ſecurity to give, equal to that upon which money is commonly to be had at the higheſt ordinary rate. While ſo many advertiſe, as are to be ſeen every day advertiſing, money to be lent at five per cent. what ſhould poſſeſs a man, who has any thing to offer that can be called a ſecurity, to give, for example, ſix per cent. is more than I can conceive.</p>
               <p>Yon may ſay, perhaps, that a man who wiſhes to lend his money out upon ſecurity, wiſhes to have his intereſt punctually, and that without the expence, and hazard, and trouble, and odium of going to law; and that, on this account, it is better to have a ſober man to deal with, than a prodigal. So far I allow you; but were you to add, that on this account it would be neceſſery for a prodigal to offer more than another man, there I ſhould diſagree with you. In the firſt place, it is not ſo eaſy a thing, nor, I take it, a common thing, for the lender upon
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030057_0020_0FE41AC8429072C8"/>ſecurity to be able to judge, or even to form any attempt to judge, whether the conduct of one who offers to borrow his money is, or is not of ſuch a caſt, as to bring him under this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The queſtion, prodigal or not prodigal, depends upon two pieces of information; neither of which, in general, is very eaſy to come at: on the one hand, the amount of his means and reaſonable expectations; on the other hand, the amount of his expenditure. The goodneſs or badneſs of the ſecurity is a queſtion of a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature: upon this head, every man has a known and ready means of obtaining that ſort of information, which is the moſt ſatisfactory the nature of things affords, by going to his lawyer. It is, accordingly, I take it, on their lawyers' opinion, that lenders in general found their determination in theſe caſes, and not upon any calculations they may have formed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the receipt and expenditure of the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower. But even ſuppoſing a man's diſpoſition to prodigality to be ever ſo well known, I take it there are always enough to be found, to whom
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030057_0021_0FE41ACEA1CBEAA0"/>ſuch a diſpoſition would be rather an induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than an objection, ſo long as they were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the ſecurity. Every body knows the advantage to be made in caſe of mortgage, by forecloſing or forcing a ſale: and that this advantage is not uncommonly looked out for, will, I believe, hardly be doubted by any one, who has had any occaſion to obſerve the courſe of buſineſs in the court of Chancery.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, ſo long as a prodigal has any thing to pledge, or to diſpoſe of, whether in poſſeſſion, or even in reverſion, whether of a certain or even of a contingent nature, I ſee not, how he can receive the ſmalleſt benefit, from any laws that are, or can be made to fix the rate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. For, ſuppoſe the law to be efficacious as far as it goes, and that the prodigal can find none of thoſe monſters called uſurers to deal with him, does he lie quiet? No ſuch thing: he goes on and gets the money he wants, by felling his intereſt inſtead of borrowing. He goes on, I ſay: for if he has prudence enough to ſtop him any where, he is not that ſort of man,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030057_0022_0FE41B07ED539788"/>whom it can be worth while for the law to attempt ſtopping by ſuch means. It is plain enough then, I conclude, that to a prodigal thus circumſtanced, the law cannot be of any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; on the contrary, it may, and in many caſes muſt, be of diſſervice to him, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him the option of a reſource which, how diſadvantageous ſoever, could not well have proved more ſo, but would naturally have proved leſs ſo, than thoſe which it leaves ſtill open to him. But of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>I now come to the only remaining claſs of prodigals, viz. thoſe who have nothing that can be called a ſecurity to offer. Theſe, certainly, are not more likely to get money upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary rate of intereſt, than an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary one. Perſons who either feel, or find rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for pretending to feel, a friendſhip for the borrower, cannot take of him more than the ordinary rate of intereſt: perſons, who have no ſuch motives for lending him, will not lend him at all. If they know him for what he is, that will prevent them of courſe: and even
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030057_0023_0FE41B0995C253E8"/>though they ſhould know nothing of him by any other circumſtance, the very circumſtance of his not being able to find a friend to truſt him at the higheſt ordinary rate, will be ſufficient reaſon to a ſtranger for looking upon him as a man, who, in the judgment of his friends, is not likely to pay.</p>
               <p>The way that prodigals run into debt, after they have ſpent their ſubſtance, is, I take it, by borrowing of their friends and acquaintance, at ordinary intereſt, or more commonly at no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ſmall ſums, ſuch as each man may be content to loſe, or be aſhamed to aſk real ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for; and as prodigals have generally an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive acquaintance (extenſive acquaintance being at once the cauſe and effect of prodigality) the ſum total of the money a man may thus find means to ſquander, may be conſiderable, though each ſum borrowed may, relatively to the circumſtances of the lender, have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable. This I believe to be the race which prodigals, who have ſpent their all, run at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, under the actual ſyſtem of reſtraining
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030057_0024_0FE41B0B92862C18"/>laws: and this, and no other, I take it, would be the race they would run, were thoſe laws out of the way.</p>
               <p>Another conſideration there is, I think, which will complete your conviction, if it was not complete before, of the inefficacy of theſe laws, as to the putting any ſort of reſtraint upon prodigality. This is, that there is another ſet of people from whom prodigals get what they want, and always will get it, ſo long as credit laſts, in ſpite of all laws againſt high intereſt; and, ſhould they find it neceſſary, at an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence more than equal to any exceſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt they might otherwiſe have to give.— I mean the tradeſmen who deal in the goods they want. Every body knows it is much eaſier to get goods than money. People truſt goods upon much ſlenderer ſecurity than they do money: it is very natural they ſhould do ſo: ordinary profit upon the whole capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal employed in a man's trade, even after the expence of warehouſe rent, journeymen's wages, and other ſuch general charges, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030057_0025_0FE41B0F1B3145F0"/>in to the account, and ſet againſt it, is at leaſt equal to double intereſt; ſay ten per cent. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary profit upon any particular parcel of goods muſt therefore be a great deal more, ſay at leaſt triple intereſt, fifteen per cent.: in the way of trading, then, a man can afford to be at leaſt three times as adventurous, as he can, in the way of lending, and with equal prudence. So long, then, as a man is looked upon as one who will pay, he can much eaſier get the goods be wants, than he could the money to buy them with, though he were content to give for it twice, or even thrice the ordinary rate of intereſt.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing any body, for the ſake of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gain, to be willing to run the riſk of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying him, although he did not look upon his perſonal ſecurity to be equal to that of another man, and for the ſake of the extraordinary profit to run the extraordinary riſk; in the trader, in ſhort in every ſort of trader whom he was accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to deal with in his ſolvent days, he ſees a perſon who may accept of any rate of profit, without the ſmalleſt danger from any laws that
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030057_0026_0FE41B10C881F2B0"/>are, or can be made againſt uſury. How idle, then, to think of ſtopping a man from making ſix, or ſeven, or eight per cent. intereſt, when, if he chooſes to run a riſk proportionable, he may in this way make thirty or forty per cent. or any rate you pleaſe! And as to the prodigal, if he cannot get what he wants upon theſe terms, what chance is there of his getting it upon any terms, ſuppoſing the laws againſt uſury to be away? This then is another way, in which, inſtead of ſerving, it injures him, by narrowing his option, and driving him from a market which might have proved leſs diſadvantageous, to a more diſadvantageous one.</p>
               <p>As far as prodigality, then, is concerned, I muſt confeſs, I cannot ſee the uſe of ſtopping the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of expenditure in this way at the foſſet, when there are ſo many unpreventable ways of letting it run out at the bung-hole.</p>
               <p>Whether any harm is done to ſociety, upon the whole, by letting ſo much money drop at once out of the pockets of the prodigal, who
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030057_0027_0FE41B12C286F518"/>would have gone on waſting it, into the till of the frugal tradeſman, who will lay it up, is not worth the enquiry for the preſent purpoſe: what is plain is, that, ſo far as the ſaving the prodigal from paying at an extraordinary rate for what he gets to ſpend, is the object of the law, that object is not at all promoted, by fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rate of intereſt upon money borrowed. On the contrary, if the law has any effect, it runs counter to that object: ſince, were he to borrow, it would only be, in as far as he could borrow at a rate inferior to that at which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would be obliged to buy. Preventing his borrowing at an extra rate, may have the effect of increaſing his diſtreſs, but cannot have the effect of leſſening it: allowing his borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ſuch a rate, might have the effect of leſſening his diſtreſs, but could not have the effect of increaſing it.</p>
               <p>To put a ſtop to prodigality, if indeed it be worth while, I know but of one effectual courſe that can be taken, in addition to the incomplete and inſufficient courſes at preſent practicable,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030057_0028_0FE41B14C58E9798"/>and that is, to put the convicted prodigal under an <hi>interdict,</hi> as was practiſed formerly among the Romans, and is ſtill practiſed among the French, and other nations who have taken the Roman law for the ground work of their own. But to diſcuſs the expediency, or ſketch out the details, of ſuch an inſtitution, belongs not to the preſent purpoſe.</p>

               <head>LETTER IV. <hi>Reaſons for Reſtraint—Protection of Indigence.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BESIDES prodigals, there are three other claſſes of perſons, and but three, for whoſe ſecurity I can conceive theſe reſtrictive laws to have been deſigned—I mean the indigent, the raſhly enterprizing, and the ſimple: thoſe whoſe pecuniary neceſſities may diſpoſe them to give an intereſt above the ordinary rate, rather than not have it, and thoſe who, from raſhneſs, may be diſpoſed to venture upon giving ſuch a rate, or from careleſſneſs, combined with ignorance, may be diſpoſed to acquieſce in it.</p>
               <p>In ſpeaking of theſe three different claſſes of perſons, I muſt beg leave to conſider one of them at a time: and accordingly, in ſpeaking of the indigent, I muſt conſider indigence, in the firſt
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030057_0030_0FE41B1964CEBEA8"/>place as untinctured with ſimplicity. On this occaſion, I may ſuppoſe, and ought to ſuppoſe, no particular defect in a man's judgment, or his temper, that ſhould miſlead him, more than the ordinary run of men. He knows what is his intereſt as well as they do, and is as well diſpoſed and able to purſue it as they are.</p>
               <p>I have already intimated, what I think is undeniable, that there are no one or two or other limited number of rates of intereſt, that can be equally ſuited to the unlimited number of ſituations, in reſpect of the degree of <hi>exigency,</hi> in which a man is liable to find himſelf: inſomuch, that to the ſituation of a man, who, by the uſe of money can make, for example, eleven per cent. ſix per cent. is as well adapted, as five per cent. is to the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of him who can make but ten; to that of him who can make twelve per cent. ſeven, and ſo on. So, in the caſe of his wanting it to ſave himſelf from a loſs, (which is what is moſt likely to be in view under the name of <hi>exigency</hi>)
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030057_0031_0FE41B1B63E72980"/>if that loſs would amount to eleven per cent. ſix per cent. is as well adapted to his ſituation, as five per cent. would be to the ſituation of him, who had but a loſs amounting to ten per cent. to ſave himſelf from by the like means. And in any caſe, though, in proportion to the amount of the loſs, the rate of intereſt were even ſo great, as the clear ſaving ſhould not amount to more than one per cent. or any fraction per cent.; yet ſo long as it amounted to any thing, he would be juſt ſo much the better for borrowing, even on ſuch comparatively diſadvantageous terms. If, inſtead of gain, we put any other kind of benefit or advantage—if, inſtead of loſs, we put any other kind of miſchief or inconvenience, of equal value, the reſult will be the ſame.</p>
               <p>A man is in one of theſe ſituations, ſuppoſe, in which it would be for his advantage to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. But his circumſtances are ſuch, that it would not be worth any body's while to lend him, at the higheſt rate which it is propoſed the law ſhould allow; in ſhort, he cannot get it at
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030057_0032_0FE41B1D0F59FA38"/>that rate. If he thought he <hi>could</hi> get it at that rate, moſt ſurely he would not give a higher; he may be truſted for that: for by the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he has nothing defective in his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But the fact is, he cannot get it at that lower rate. At a higher rate, however, he could get it: and at that rate, though higher, it would be worth his while to get it: ſo he judges, who has nothing to hinder him from judging right; who has every motive and every means for forming a right judgment; who has every motive and every means for inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf of the circumſtances, upon which rectitude of judgment, in the caſe in queſtion, depends. The legiſlator, who knows nothing, nor can know any thing, of any one of all theſe circumſtances, who knows nothing at all about the matter, comes and ſays to him—<q>It ſignifies nothing; you ſhall not have the money: for it would be a miſchief to you to borrow it upon ſuch terms.</q>—And this out of prudence and loving-kindneſs!—There may be worſe cruelty: but can there be greater folly?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:030057_0033_0FE41B209D2EAC30"/>
The folly of thoſe who perſiſt, as is ſuppoſed, without reaſon, in not taking advice, has been much expatiated upon. But the folly of thoſe who perſiſt, without reaſon, in forcing their advice upon others, has been but little dwelt upon, though it is, perhaps, the more frequent, and the more flagrant of the two. It is not often that one man is a better judge for another, than that other is for himſelf, even in caſes where the adviſer will take the trouble to make himſelf maſter of as many of the materials for judging, as are within the reach of the perſon to be adviſed. But the legiſlator is not, cannot be, in the poſſeſſion of any one of theſe mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials.—What private, can be equal to ſuch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic folly?</p>
               <p>I ſhould now ſpeak of the enterprizing claſs of borrowers: thoſe, who, when characterized by a ſingle term, are diſtinguiſhed by the unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable appellation of <hi>projectors:</hi> but in what I ſhall have to ſay of them, Dr. Smith, I begin to foreſee, will bear ſo material a part, that

               </head>
               <p>I COME, laſtly, to the caſe of the ſimple. Here, in the firſt place, I think I am by this time entitled to obſerve, that no ſimplicity, ſhort of abſolute idiotiſm, can cauſe the individual to make a more groundleſs judgment, than the legiſlator, who, in the circumſtances above ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhould pretend to confine him to any given rate of intereſt, would have made for him.</p>
               <p>Another conſideration, equally concluſive, is, that were the legiſlator's judgment ever ſo much ſuperior to the individual's, how weak ſoever that may be, the exertion of it on this occaſion can never be any otherwiſe than uſeleſs, ſo long as there are ſo many ſimilar occaſions, as there ever muſt be, where the ſimplicity of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual is equally liable to make him a ſufferer,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030057_0036_0FE41B2644F5B6E0"/>and on which the legiſlator cannot interpoſe with effect, nor has ever ſo much as thought of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing.</p>
               <p>Buying goods with money, or upon credit, is the buſineſs of every day: borrowing money is the buſineſs, only, of ſome particular exigency, which, in compariſon, can occur but ſeldom. Regulating the prices of goods in general would be an endleſs taſk; and no legiſlator has ever been weak enough to think of attempting it. And ſuppoſing he were to regulate the prices, what would that ſignify for the protection of ſimplicity, unleſs he were to regulate alſo the quantum of what each man ſhould buy? Such quantum is, indeed, regulated, or rather means are taken to prevent buying altogether; but in what caſes? in thoſe only where the weakneſs is adjudged to have arrived at ſuch a pitch, as to render a man utterly unqualified for the management of his affairs: in ſhort, when it has arrived at the length of idiocy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:030057_0037_0FE41B29603D8270"/>
But in what degree ſoever a man's weakneſs may expoſe him to impoſition, he ſtands much more expoſed to it, in the way of buying goods, than in the way of borrowing money. To be informed, beforehand, of the ordinary prices of all ſorts of things, a man may have occaſion to buy, may be a taſk of conſiderable variety and extent. To be informed of the ordinary rate of intereſt, is to be informed of one ſingle fact, too intereſting not to have attracted attention, and too ſimple to have eſcaped the memory. A few per cent. enhancement upon the price of goods, is a matter that may eaſily enough paſs unheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but a ſingle per cent. beyond the ordinary intereſt of money, is a ſtride more conſpicuous and ſtartling, than many per cent. upon the price of any kind of goods.</p>
               <p>Even in regard to ſubjects, which, by their importance, would, if any, juſtify a regulation of their price, ſuch as, for inſtance, land, I queſtion whether there ever was an inſtance where, without ſome ſuch ground as, on the one ſide fraud, or ſuppreſſion of facts neceſſary to
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030057_0038_0FE41B2B0C090E00"/>form a judgment of the value, or at leaſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſuch facts, on the other, a bargain was reſcinded, merely becauſe a man had ſold too cheap, or bought too dear. Were I to take a fancy to give a hundred years purchaſe inſtead of thirty, for a piece of land, rather than not have it, I do not think there is any court in England, or indeed any where elſe, that would interpoſe to hinder me, much leſs to puniſh the ſeller with the loſs of three times the purchaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money, as in the caſe of uſury. Yet when I had got my piece of land, and paid my money, repentance, were the law ever ſo well diſpoſed to aſſiſt me, might be unavailing: for the ſeller might have ſpent the money, or gone off with it. But, in the caſe of borrowing money, it is the borrower always, who, according to the indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, or ſhort term for which money is lent, is on the ſafe ſide: any imprudence he may have committed with regard to the rate of intereſt, may be corrected at any time: if I find I have given too high an intereſt to one man, I have no more to do than to borrow of another at a lower rate, and pay off the firſt: If I cannot
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030057_0039_0FE41B2D0C768D40"/>find any body to lend me at a lower, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a more certain proof, that the firſt was not in reality too high. But of this hereafter.</p>

               <head>LETTER VI. <hi>Miſchiefs of the anti-uſurious Laws.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the preceding letters, I have examined all the modes I can think of, in which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, impoſed by the laws againſt uſury, can have been fancied to be of ſervice.</p>
               <p>I hope it appears by this time, that there are no ways in which thoſe laws can do any good. But there are ſeveral, in which they cannot but do miſchief.</p>
               <p>The firſt, I ſhall mention, is that of preclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many people, altogether, from the getting the money they ſtand in need of, to anſwer their reſpective exigencies. Think what a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs it would produce, were the liberty of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing denied to every body; denied to thoſe who have ſuch ſecurity to offer, as renders the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030057_0041_0FE41B32D1D258F0"/>rate of intereſt, they have to offer, a ſufficient inducement, for a man who has money, to truſt them with it. Juſt that ſame ſort of diſtreſs is produced, by denying that liberty to ſo many people, whoſe ſecurity, though, if they were permitted to add ſomething to that rate, it would be ſufficient, is rendered inſufficient by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing denied that liberty. Why the misfortune, of not being poſſeſſed of that arbitrarily exacted degree of ſecurity, ſhould be made a ground for ſubjecting a man to a hardſhip, which is not impoſed on thoſe who are free from that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, is more than I can ſee. To diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the former claſs from the latter, I can ſee but this one circumſtance, viz. that their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is greater. This it is by the very ſuppoſition: for were it not, they could not be, what they are ſuppoſed to be, willing to give more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from it. In this point of view, then, the ſole tendency of the law is, to heap diſtreſs upon diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>A ſecond miſchief is that of rendering the terms ſo much the worſe, to a multitude of thoſe,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030057_0042_0FE41AD04C079700"/>whoſe circumſtances exempt them from being precluded altogether from getting the money they have occaſion for. In this caſe, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, though neceſſarily leſs intenſe than in the other, is much more palpable and conſpicuous. Thoſe who cannot borrow, may get what they want, ſo long as they have any thing to ſell. But while out of loving kindneſs, or whatſoever other motive, the law precludes a man from <hi>borrowing,</hi> upon terms which it deems too diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous, it does not preclude him from <hi>ſelling,</hi> upon any terms, however diſadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Every body knows, that forced ſales are attended with loſs: and to this loſs, what would be deemed a moſt extravagant intereſt bears in general no proportion. When a man's movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are taken in execution, they are, I believe, pretty well ſold, if, after all expences paid, the produce amounts to two thirds of what it would coſt to replace them. In this way the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and loving-kindneſs of the law coſts him thirty-three per cent. and no more, ſuppoſing, what isſeldom the caſe, that no more of the effects are taken than what is barely neceſſary to make up
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030057_0043_0FE41AD25091D628"/>the money due. If, in her negligence and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe were to ſuffer him to offer eleven per cent. per ann. for forbearance, it would be three years before he paid what he is charged with, in the firſt inſtance, by her wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Such being the kindneſs done by the law to the owner of moveables, let us ſee how it fares with him who has an intereſt in immoveables. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the late war, thirty years' purchaſe for land might be reckoned, I think it is pretty well agreed, a medium price. During the diſtreſs produced by the war, lands which it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſhould be ſold, were ſold at twenty, eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, nay, I believe, in ſome inſtances, even ſo low as fifteen years' purchaſe. If I do not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recollect, I remember inſtances of lands put up to public auction, for which no body bid ſo high as fifteen. In many inſtances, villas, which had been bought before the war, or at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it, and, in the interval, had been improved, rather than impaired, ſold for leſs than half, or even the quarter, of what they had been bought for. I dare not here for my part pretend to be exact: but
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030057_0044_0FE41AD764A55900"/>on this paſſage, were it worth their notice, Mr. Skinner, or Mr. Chriſtie, could furniſh very inſtructive notes. Twenty years' purchaſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of thirty, I may be allowed to take, at leaſt for illuſtration. An eſtate then of 100<abbr>l.</abbr> a year, clear of taxes, was deviſed to a man, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſuppoſe, with 1500<abbr>l.</abbr> with intereſt till the money ſhould be paid. Five per cent. intereſt, the utmoſt which could be accepted from the owner, did not anſwer the incumbrancer's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: he choſe to have the money. But ſix per cent. perhaps, would have anſwered his purpoſe; if not, moſt certainly it would have anſwered the purpoſe of ſomebody elſe: for multitudes there all along were, whoſe purpoſes were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by five per cent. The war laſted, I think, ſeven years: the depreciation of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of land did not take place immediately: but as, on the other hand, neither did it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately recover its former price upon the peace, if indeed it has even yet recovered it, we may put ſeven years for the time, during which it would be more advantageous to pay this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rate of intereſt than ſell the land, and during which, accordingly, this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030057_0045_0FE41B34799EBF68"/>rate of intereſt would have had to run. One per cent. for ſeven years, is not quite of equal worth to ſeven per cent. the firſt year: ſay, however, that it is. The eſtate, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the war was worth thirty years' purchaſe, that is 3000<abbr>l.</abbr> and which the deviſor had given to the deviſee for that value, being put up to ſale, ſold for but twenty years' purchaſe, 2000<abbr>l.</abbr> At the end of that period it would have ſold for its original value, 3000<abbr>l.</abbr> Compare, then, the ſituation of the deviſee at the ſeven years' end, under the law, with what it would have been, without the law. In the former caſe, the land ſelling for 20 years' purchaſe, i. e. 2000<abbr>l.</abbr> what he would have after paying the 1500<abbr>l.</abbr> is 500<abbr>l.</abbr>; which, with the intereſt of that ſum, at five per cent. for ſeven years, viz. 175<abbr>l.</abbr> makes, at the end of that ſeven years, 675<abbr>l.</abbr> In the other caſe, paying ſix per cent. on the 1500<abbr>l.</abbr> that is 90<abbr>l.</abbr> a year, and receiving all that time the rent of the land, viz. 100<abbr>l.</abbr> he would have had, at the ſeven years' end, the amount of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten pounds during that period, that is 70<abbr>l.</abbr> in addition to his 1000<abbr>l.</abbr>—675<abbr>l.</abbr> ſubtracted from 1070<abbr>l.</abbr> leaves 395<abbr>l.</abbr> This 395<abbr>l.</abbr> then, is what
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030057_0046_0FE41B368424A758"/>he loſes out of 1070<abbr>l.</abbr> almoſt 37 per cent. of his capital, by the loving kindneſs of the law. Make the calculations, and you will find, that, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting him from borrowing the money at ſix per cent. intereſt, it makes him nearly as much a ſufferer as if he had borrowed it at ten.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid hitherto, is confined to the caſe of thoſe who have preſent value to give, for the money they ſtand in need of. If they have no ſuch value, then, if they ſucceed in purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing aſſiſtance upon any terms, it muſt be a breach of the law; their lenders expoſing themſelves to its vengeance: for I ſpeak not here of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental caſe, of its being ſo conſtructed as to be liable to evaſion. But, even in this caſe, the miſchievous influence of the law ſtill purſues them; aggravating the very miſchief it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to remedy. Though it be inefficacious in the way in which the legiſlator wiſhes to ſee it efficacious, it is efficacious in the way oppoſite to that in which he would wiſh to ſee it ſo. The effect of it is, to raiſe the rate of intereſt, higher than it would be otherwiſe, and that in two ways.
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030057_0047_0FE41B38291EC778"/>In the firſt place, a man muſt, in common pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as Dr. Smith obſerves, make a point of being indemnified, not only for whatſoever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary riſk it is that he runs independently of the law, but for the very riſk occaſioned by the law: he muſt be <hi>inſured,</hi> as it were, againſt the law. This cauſe would operate, were there even as many perſons ready to lend upon the illegal rate, as upon the legal. But this is not the caſe: a great number of perſons are, of courſe, driven out of this competition, by the danger of the buſineſs; and another great number, by the diſrepute which, under cover of theſe prohibitory laws or otherwiſe, has faſtened itſelf upon the name of uſurer. So many perſons, therefore, being driven out of the trade, it happens in this branch, as it muſt neceſſarily in every other, that thoſe who remain have the leſs to withhold them from advancing their terms; and without confederating, (for it muſt be allowed that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy in ſuch a caſe is plainly impoſſible) each one will find it eaſier to puſh his advantage up to any given degree of exorbitancy, than he would,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030057_0048_0FE41B3B03D73720"/>if there were a greater number of perſons of the ſame ſtamp to refer to.</p>
               <p>As to the caſe, where the law is ſo worded as to be liable to be evaded, in this caſe it is partly inefficacious and nugatory, and partly miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous. It is nugatory, as to all ſuch, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of its being ſo is perfect: it is miſchievous, as before, in regard to all ſuch who fail of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing that perfect confidence. If the borrower can find nobody at all who has confidence enough to take advantage of the flaw, he ſtands precluded from all aſſiſtance, as before: and, though he ſhould, yet the lender's terms muſt neceſſarily run the higher, in proportion to what his confidence wants of being perfect. It is not likely that it ſhould be perfect: it is ſtill leſs likely that he ſhould acknowledge it ſo to be: it is not likely, at leaſt as matters ſtand in England, that the worſt-penned law made for this purpoſe ſhould be altogether deſtitute of effect: and while it has any, that effect, we ſee, muſt be in one way or other miſchievous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:030057_0049_0FE3F1D9D55AE370"/>
I have already hinted at the diſrepute, the ignominy, the reproach, which prejudice, the cauſe and the effect of theſe reſtrictive laws, has heaped upon that perfectly innocent and even meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious claſs of men, who, not more for their own advantage than to the relief of the diſtreſſes of their neighbour, may have ventured to break through theſe reſtraints. It is certainly not a matter of indifference, that a claſs of perſons, who, in every point of view in which their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct can be placed, whether in relation to their own intereſt, or in relation to that of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom they have to deal with, as well on the ſcore of prudence, as on that of beneficence, (and of what uſe is even benevolence, but in as far as it is productive of beneficence?) deſerve praiſe rather than cenſure, ſhould be claſſed with the abandoned and profligate, and loaded with a degree of infamy, which is due to thoſe only whoſe conduct is in its tendency the moſt oppoſite to their own.</p>
               <p>"This ſuffering," it may be ſaid, "having already been taken account of, is not to be
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030057_0050_0FE41AD91145A568"/>brought to account a ſecond time: they are aware, as you yourſelf obſerve, of this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, and have taken care to get ſuch amends for it, as they themſelves look upon as ſufficient." True: but is it ſure that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, ſuch as it is, will always, in the event, have proved a ſufficient one? Is there no room here for miſcalculation? May there not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, unlooked-for incidents, ſufficient to turn into bitterneſs the utmoſt ſatisfaction which the difference of pecuniary emolument could afford? For who can ſee to the end of that inexhauſtible train of conſequences that are liable to enſue from the loſs of reputation? Who can fathom the abyſs of infamy? At any rate, this article of miſchief, if not an addition in its quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity to the others above noticed, is at leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from them in its nature, and as ſuch ought not to be overlooked.</p>
               <p>Nor is the event of the execution of the law by any means an unexampled one: ſeveral ſuch, at different times, have fallen within my notice. Then comes abſolute perdition; loſs of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030057_0051_0FE41B3D51F18180"/>and forfeiture, not of three times the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſt, which formed the profit of the offence, but of three times the principal, which gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to it.</p>
               <p>The laſt article I have to mention in the account of miſchief, is, the corruptive influence, exerciſed by theſe laws, on the morals of the people; by the pains they take, and cannot but take, to give birth to treachery and ingratitude. To purchaſe a poſſibility of being enforced, the law neither has found, nor, what is very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, muſt it ever hope to find, in this caſe, any other expedient, than that of hiring a man to break his engagement, and to cruſh the hand that has been reached out to help him. In the caſe of informers in general, there has been no troth plighted, nor benefit received. In the caſe of real criminals invited by rewards to inform againſt accomplices, it is by ſuch <hi>breach</hi> of faith that ſociety is held together, as in other caſes by the <hi>obſervance</hi> of it. In the caſe of real crimes, in proportion as their miſchievouſneſs is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, what cannot but be manifeſt, even to the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030057_0052_0FE41B3F4EAA6500"/>criminal, is, that it is by the adherence to his engagement that he would do an injury to ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and, that by the breach of ſuch engagement, inſtead of doing miſchief, he is doing good: in the caſe of uſury, this is what no man can know, and what one can ſcarcely think it poſſible for any man, who, in the character of the borrower, has been concerned in ſuch a tranſaction, to imagine. He knew, that, even in his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the engagement was a beneficial one to himſelf, or he would not have entered into it: and no body elſe but the lender is affected by it.</p>

               <head>LETTER VII. <hi>Inefficacy of anti-uſurious Laws.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BEFORE I quit altogether the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the caſe in which a law, made for the purpoſe of limiting the rate of intereſt, may be inefficacious with regard to that end, I cannot forbear taking ſome further notice of a paſſage already alluded to, of Dr. Smith's: becauſe, to my apprehenſion, that paſſage ſeems to throw upon the ſubject a degree of obſcurity, which I could wiſh to ſee cleared up, in a future edition of that valuable work.</p>
               <p>"No law," (ſays he, b. ii. ch. 10. vol. ii. p. 45. edit. 8vo. 1784,) <q>can reduce the common rate of intereſt below the loweſt ordinary market rate, at the time when that law was made. Notwithſtanding the edict of 1766, by which the French king attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030057_0054_0FE41B44CC69E6F8"/>the rate of intereſt from five to four per cent. money continued to be lent in France at five per cent. the law being evaded in ſeveral different ways.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to the general poſition, if ſo it be, ſo much, according to me, the better: but I muſt cenfeſs I do not ſee why this ſhould be the caſe. It is for the purpoſe of proving the truth of this general poſition, that the fact of the inefficacy of this attempt ſeems to be adduced: for no other proof is adduced but this. But, taking the fact for granted, I do not ſee how it can be ſufficient to ſupport the inference. The law, we are told at the ſame time, was evaded: but we are not told how it came to be open to evaſion. It might be owing to a particular defect in the penning of that particular law; or, what comes to the ſame thing, in the proviſions made for carrying it into execution. In either caſe, it affords no ſupport to the general poſition: nor can that poſition be a juſt one, unleſs it were ſo in the caſe where every proviſion had been made, that could be made, for giving efficacy to the law.
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030057_0055_0FE41B46BABE96E8"/>For the poſition to be true, the caſe muſt be, that the law would ſtill be broken, even after every means of what can properly be called <hi>evaſion</hi> had been removed. True or untrue, the poſition is certainly not ſelf-evident enough to be received without proof: yet nothing is adduced in proof of it, but the fact above no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, which, we ſee, amounts to no ſuch thing. What is more, I ſhould not expect to find it capable of proof. I do not ſee what it is, that ſhould render the law incapable of "reducing the common rate of intereſt below the loweſt ordinary market rate," but ſuch a ſtate of things, ſuch a combination of circumſtances, as ſhould afford obſtacles equally powerful, or nearly ſo, to the efficacy of the law againſt all higher rates. For deſtroying the efficacy of the law altogether, I know nothing that could ſerve, but a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the part of all perſons any way privy not to inform: but by ſuch a reſolution any higher rate is juſt as effectually protected as any lower one. Suppoſe it, ſtrictly ſpeaking, univerſal, and the law muſt, in all inſtances, be equally inefficacious; all rates of intereſt are equally
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030057_0056_0FE41B48BA3513C8"/>free; and the ſtate of men's dealings in this way juſt what it would be, were there no law at all upon the ſubject. But in this caſe, the poſition, in as far as it limits the inefficacy of the law to thoſe rates which are below the "loweſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary market rate," is not true. For my part, I cannot conceive how any ſuch univerſal reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution could have been maintained, or could ever be maintained, without an open concert, and as open a rebellion againſt government; nothing of which ſort appears to have taken place: and, as to any particular confederacies, they are as capable of protecting any higher rates againſt the prohibition, as any lower ones.</p>
               <p>Thus much indeed muſt be admitted, that the low rate in queſtion, viz. that which was the loweſt ordinary market rate immediately before the making of the law, is likely to come in for the protection of the public againſt the law, more frequently than any other rate. That muſt be the caſe on two accounts: firſt, becauſe, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the number of the ordinary rates, it was, by the ſuppoſition, more frequent than any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030057_0057_0FE41B4A66E3EEC0"/>ones: ſecondly, becauſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repute annexed to the idea of uſury, a force which might have more or leſs efficacy in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, from the protection above ſpoken of, ſuch extraordinary rates, cannot well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to apply itſelf, or at leaſt not in equal degree, to this low and ordinary rate. A lender has certainly leſs to ſtop him from taking a rate, which may be taken without diſrepute, than from taking one, which a man could not take without ſubjecting himſelf to that inconvenience: nor is it likely, that men's imaginations and ſentiments ſhould teſtify ſo ſudden an obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to the law, as to ſtamp diſrepute to-day, upon a rate of intereſt, to which no ſuch accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniment had ſtood annexed the day before.</p>
               <p>Were I to be aſked how I imagined the caſe ſtood in the particular inſtance referred to by Dr. Smith; judging from his account of it, aſſiſted by general probabilities, I ſhould anſwer thus:—The law, I ſhould ſuppoſe, was not ſo penned as to be altogether proof againſt evaſion. In many inſtances, of which it is impoſſible any
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030057_0058_0FE41B4E1C2D8040"/>account ſhould have been taken, it was indeed conformed to: in ſome of thoſe inſtances, people who would have lent otherwiſe, abſtained from lending altogether; in others of thoſe inſtances, people lent their money at the reduced legal rate. In other inſtances again, the law was broken: the lenders truſting, partly to expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients recurred to for evading it, partly to the good faith and honour of thoſe whom they had to deal with: in this claſs of inſtances it was natural for the two reaſons above ſuggeſted, that thoſe where the old legal rate was adhered to, ſhould have been the moſt numerous. From the circumſtance not only of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but of their more direct repugnancy to the particular recent law in queſtion, they would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be the moſt taken notice of. And this, probably, was the foundation in point of fact for the Doctor's general poſition above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that "no law <hi>can</hi> reduce the common rate of intereſt below the loweſt ordinary mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket rate, at the time when that law was made."</p>

In England, as far as I can truſt my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and imperfect general recollection of the purport of the laws relative to this matter, I ſhould not ſuppoſe that the above poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would prove true. That there is no ſuch thing as any palpable and univerſally notorious, as well as univerſally practicable receipt for that purpoſe, is manifeſt from the examples, which, as I have already mentioned, every now and then occur, of convictions upon theſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. Two ſuch receipts, indeed, I ſhall have occaſion to touch upon preſently: but they are either not obvious enough in their nature, or too troubleſome or not extenſive enough in their application, to have deſpoiled the law altogether of its terrors or of its preventive efficacy.</p>
               <p>In the country in which I am writing, the whole ſyſtem of laws on this ſubject is perfectly, and very happily, inefficacious. The rate fixed by law is five per cent.: many people lend money; and nobody at that rate: the loweſt ordinary rate, upon the very beſt real ſecurity, is eight per cent.: nine, and even ten, upon ſuch ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>are common. Six or ſeven may have place, now and then, between relations or other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friends: becauſe, now and then, a man may chooſe to make a preſent of one or two per cent. to a perſon whom he means to favour. The contract is renewed from year to year: for a thouſand roubles, the borrower in his written contract, obliges himſelf to pay at the end of the year one thouſand and fifty. Before wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, he receives his thouſand roubles: and, without witneſſes, he immediately pays back his thirty roubles, or his forty roubles, or whatever the ſum may be, that is neceſſary to bring the real rate of intereſt to the rate verbally agreed on.</p>
               <p>This contrivance, I take it, would not do in England: but why it would not, is a queſtion which it would be in vain for me to pretend, at this diſtance from all authorities, to diſcuſs.</p>

               <head>LETTER VIII. <hi>Virtual Uſury allowed.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAVING proved, as I hope, by this time, the utter impropriety of the law's limiting the rate of intereſt, in every caſe that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, it may be rather a matter of curioſity, than any thing elſe, to enquire, how far the law, on this head, is conſiſtent with itſelf, and with any principles upon which it can have built.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Drawing and re-drawing</hi> is a practice, which it will be ſufficient here to hint at. It is perfectly well known to all merchants, and may be ſo to all who are not merchants, by conſulting Dr. Smith. In this way he was ſhewn how money may be, and has been, taken up, at ſo high a rate, as thirteen or fourteen per cent. a rate nearly three times as high as the utmoſt which the law profeſſes to allow. The extra
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030057_0062_0FE41B537B5C8C68"/>intereſt is in this caſe maſked under the names of <hi>commiſſion,</hi> and price of <hi>exchange.</hi> The commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is but ſmall upon each loan, not more, I think, than one half per cent.: cuſtom having ſtretched ſo far, but no farther, it might be thought dangerous, perhaps, to venture upon any higher allowance under that name. The charge, being repeated a number of times in the courſe of the year, makes up in frequency what it wants in weight. The tranſaction is by this ſhift rendered more troubleſome, indeed, but not leſs practicable, to ſuch parties as are agreed about it. But if uſury is good for merchants, I do not very well ſee what ſhould make it bad for every body elſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. At this diſtance from all the fountains of legal knowledge, I will not pretend to ſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the practice of <hi>ſelling accepted bills</hi> at an under value, would hold good againſt all attacks. It ſtrikes my recollection as a pretty common one, and I think it could not be brought under any of the penal ſtatutes againſt uſury. The adequateneſs of the conſideration might, for
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030057_0063_0FE41B565FA32AB8"/>aught I know, be attacked with ſucceſs, in a court of equity; or, perhaps, if there were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence (which the agreement of the parties might eaſily prevent) by an action at common law, for money had and received. If the practice be really proof againſt all attacks, it ſeems to afford an effectual, and pretty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious method of evading the reſtrictive laws. The only reſtraint is, that it requires the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a third perſon, a friend of the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's; as, for inſtance: B, the real borrower, wants 100<abbr>l.</abbr> and finds U, a uſurer, who is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to lend it to him, at ten per cent. B. has F, a friend, who has not the money himſelf to lend him, but is willing to ſtand ſecurity for him, to that amount. B. therefore, draws upon F, and F. accepts a bill of 100<abbr>l.</abbr> at five per cent. intereſt, payable at the end of a twelve-month from the date. F. draws a like bill upon B.: each ſells his bill to U. for fifty pounds; and it is endorſed to U. accordingly. The 50<abbr>l.</abbr> that F. receives, he delivers over without any conſideration to B. This tranſaction, if it be a valid one, and if a man can find ſuch a friend,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030057_0064_0FE41B58692543A0"/>is evidently much leſs troubleſome than the practice of drawing and re-drawing. And this, if it be practicable at all, may be practiſed by perſons of any deſcription, concerned or not in trade. Should the effect of this page be to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt an expedient, and that a ſafe and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious one, for evading the laws againſt uſury, to ſome, to whom ſuch an expedient might not otherwiſe have occurred, it will not lie very heavy upon my conſcience. The prayers of uſurers, whatever efficacy they may have in lightening the burden, I hope I may lay ſome claim to. And I think you will not now won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at my ſaying, that in the efficacy of ſuch prayers I have not a whit leſs confidence, than in that of the prayers of any other claſs of men.</p>
               <p>One apology I ſhall have to plead at any rate, that in pointing out theſe ſlaws, to the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual who may be diſpoſed to creep out at them, I point them out at the ſame time to the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator, in whoſe power it is to ſtop them up, if in his opinion they require it. If, notwithſtanding ſuch opinion, he ſhould omit to do ſo, the blame
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030057_0065_0FE41B5A65842FE0"/>will lie, not on my induſtry, but on his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p>Theſe, it may be ſaid, ſhould they even be ſecure and effectual evaſions, are ſtill but eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and, if chargeable upon the law at all, are chargeable not as inconſiſtencies but as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights. Be it ſo. Setting theſe aſide, then, as expedients practiſed or practicable, only behind its back, I will beg leave to remind you of two others, practiſed from time to time, under its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and before its face.</p>
               <p>The firſt I ſhall mention is <hi>pawn-broking.</hi> In this caſe there is the leſs pretence for more than ordinary intereſt, inaſmuch as the ſecurity is, in this caſe, not only equal to, but better than, what it can be in any other: to wit, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſion of a moveable thing, of eaſy ſale, on which the creditor has the power, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly does not want the inclination, to ſet ſuch price as is moſt for his advantage. If there be a caſe in which the allowing of ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary intereſt is attended with more danger than
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030057_0066_0FE41B5C0F608218"/>another, it muſt be this; which is ſo particularly adapted to the ſituation of the loweſt poor, that is, of thoſe who, on the ſcore of indigence or ſimplicity, or both, are moſt open to impoſition. This trade, however, the law, by regulating, avowedly protects. What the rate of intereſt is, which it allows to be taken in this way, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take upon me to remember: but I am much deceived, if it amounts to leſs than twelve per cent. in the year, and I believe it amounts to a good deal more. Whether it were twelve per cent. or twelve hundred, I believe would make in practice but little difference. What <hi>commiſſion</hi> is in the buſineſs of drawing and re-drawing, <hi>ware-houſe room</hi> is, in that of pawnbrok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Whatever limits then are ſet to the profits of this trade, are ſet, perhaps, not by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy of the law, but, as in the caſe of other trades, by the competition amongſt the traders. Of the other regulations contained in the acts relative to this ſubject I recollect no reaſon to doubt the uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:030057_0067_0FE41B601C589F50"/>
The other inſtance is that of <hi>bottomry</hi> and <hi>reſpondentia:</hi> for the two tranſactions, being ſo nearly related, may be ſpoken of together. Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomry is the uſury of pawnbroking: reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia is uſury at large, but combined in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with inſurance, and employed in the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a trade carried on by ſea. If any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of uſury is to be condemned, I ſee not on what grounds this particular ſpecies can be ſcreen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the condemnation. "O but" (ſays Sir William Blackſtone, or any body elſe who takes upon himſelf the taſk of finding a reaſon for the law) "this is a maritime country, and the trade, which it carries on by ſea, is the great bulwark of its defence." It is not neceſſary I ſhould here enquire, whether that branch, which, as Dr. Smith has ſhewn, is, in every view, but the mere one of defence, leſs beneficial to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than two others out of the four branches which comprehend all trade, has any claim to be preferred to them in this or any other way. I admit, that the liberty which this branch of trade enjoys, is no more than what it is perfectly right it ſhould enjoy. What I want to know is,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030057_0068_0FE41B61C8543F78"/>what there is in the claſs of men, embarked in this trade, that ſhould render beneficial to them, a liberty, which would be ruinous to every body elſe. Is it that ſea adventures have leſs hazard in them than land adventures? or that the ſea teaches thoſe, who have to deal with it, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of forecaſt and reflection which has been denied to landmen?</p>
               <p>It were eaſy enough to give farther and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extenſion to this charge of inconſiſtency, by bringing under it the liberty given to inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in all its branches, to the purchaſe and ſale of annuities, and of <hi>poſt-obits,</hi> in a word, to all caſes where a man is permitted to take upon himſelf an unlimited degree of riſk, receiving, for ſo doing, an unlimited compenſation. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I know not where the want of inſtances would ſtop me: for in what part of the maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine of events, about which human tranſactions are converſant, is certainty to be found? But to this head of argument, this argument <hi>ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem,</hi> as it may be called, the uſe of which is
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030057_0069_0FE41B63DA00CCA0"/>but ſubſidiary, and which has more of confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it than of perſuaſion or inſtruction, I willingly put an end.</p>

               <head>LETTER IX. <hi>Blackſtone conſidered.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I HOPE you are, by this time, at leaſt, pretty much of my opinion, that there is juſt the ſame ſort of harm, and no other, in making the beſt terms one can for one's ſelf in a money loan, as there is in any other ſort of bargain. If you are not, Blackſtone, however, is, whoſe opinion I hope you will allow to be worth ſomething. In ſpeaking of the rate of intereſt, (b. ii. ch. 13.) he ſtarts a parallel between a bargain for the loan of money, and a bargain about a horſe, and pronounces, without heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the harm of making too good a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, is juſt as great in the one caſe, as in the other. As money-lending, and not horſe-deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was, what you lawyers call, the <hi>principal caſe,</hi> he drops the horſe buſineſs, as ſoon as it has anſwered the purpoſe of illuſtration, which
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030057_0071_0FE41B698BD0CF90"/>it was brought to ſerve. But as, in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as well the reaſoning by which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the deciſion, as that by which any body elſe could have ſupported it, is juſt as applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the one ſort of bargain as to the other, I will carry on the parallel a little farther, and give the ſame extent to the reaſoning, as to the poſition which it is made uſe of to ſupport. This extenſion will not be without its uſe: for if the poſition, when thus extended, ſhould be ſound juſt, a practical inference will ariſe; which is, that the benefits of theſe reſtraints ought to be extended from the money-trade to the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade. That my own opinion is not favourable to ſuch reſtraints in either caſe, has been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared; but if more reſpectable opinions than mine are ſtill to prevail, they will not be leſs reſpectable for being conſiſtent.</p>
               <p>The ſort of bargain which the learned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator has happened to pitch upon for the illuſtration, is, indeed, in the caſe illuſtrating, as in the caſe illuſtrated, a loan: but as, to my apprchenſion, loan or ſale makes, in point of
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030057_0072_0FE41B6B32757B00"/>reaſoning, no ſort of difference; and as the uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the concluſion will, in the latter caſe, be more extenſive, I ſhall adapt the reaſoning to the more important buſineſs of ſelling horſes, inſtead of the leſs important one of lending them.</p>
               <p>A circumſtance that would render the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe reſtraints to the horſe trade more ſmooth and eaſy, is, that in the one track, as well as in the other, the public has already got the length of calling names. <hi>Jockey-ſhip,</hi> a term of reproach not leſs frequently applied to the arts of thoſe who ſell horſes than to the arts of thoſe who ride them, ſounds, I take it, to the ear of many a worthy gentleman, nearly as had as <hi>uſury:</hi> and it is well known to all thoſe who put their truſt in proverbs, and not leſs to thoſe who put their truſt in party, that when we have got a dog to hang who is troubleſome and keeps us at bay, whoever can contrive to faſten a bad name to his tail, has gained more than half the battle. I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with my application. The words in <hi>Italics</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="unknown:030057_0073_0FE41B6D316A19C8"/>are my own: all the reſt are Sir William Blackſtone's: and I reſtore, (in parentheſes) the words I was obliged to diſcard, in order to make room for mine.</p>
               <p>"To demand an exorbitant price is equally contrary to conſcience, for the loan of a horſe, or for the loan of a ſum of money: but a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable equivalent for the temporary inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which the owner may feel by the want of it, and for the hazard of his loſing it entirely, is not more immoral in one caſe, than in the other. * * * *</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"As to ſelling horſes,</hi> a capital diſtinction muſt be made, between a moderate and an exorbitant profit: to the former of which we give the name of <hi>horſe dealing,</hi> (intereſt) to the latter the truly odious appellation of <hi>jockey-ſhip,</hi> (uſury): the former is neceſſary in every civil ſtate, if it were but to exclude the latter. For, as the whole of this matter is well ſummed up by Grotius, if the compenſation allowed by law does not exceed the proportion of the <hi>inconvenience which it is to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030057_0074_0FE41B6EDA84C5C8"/>the ſeller of the horſe to part with it,</hi> (hazard run) or the want <hi>which the buyer has of it,</hi> (felt by the loan) its allowance is neither repugnant to the revealed law, nor to the natural law: but if it exceeds theſe bounds, it is then an oppreſſive <hi>jockey ſhip,</hi> (uſury): and though the municipal laws may give it impunity, they never can make it juſt.</p>
               <p>"We ſee that the exorbitance or moderation of <hi>the price given for a horſe</hi> (intereſt for the money lent) depends upon two circumſtances: upon the inconvenience of parting with <hi>the horſe one has,</hi> (it for the preſent) and the hazard of <hi>not being able to meet with ſuch another</hi> (loſing it entirely). The inconvenience to individual <hi>ſellers of horſes</hi> (lenders), can never be eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by laws; the <hi>general price for horſes,</hi> (rate of general intereſt) muſt depend therefore upon the uſual or general inconvenience. This reſults entirely from the quantity of <hi>horſes</hi> (money) in the kingdom: for the more <hi>horſes</hi> (ſpecie) there are <hi>running about</hi> (circulating) in any nation, the greater ſuperfluity there will be beyond what is
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030057_0075_0FE41B740E560F28"/>neceſſary to carry on the buſineſs of <hi>the mail coaches</hi> (exchange) and the common concerns of life. In every nation or public community, there is a certain quantity of <hi>horſes</hi> (money) then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, which a perſon well ſkilled in political arithmetic might, perhaps, calculate as exactly as a private <hi>horſe dealer</hi> (banker) can the demand for the running <hi>horſes in his own ſtables</hi> (caſh in his own ſhop): all above this neceſſary quantity may be ſpared, or lent, <hi>or ſold,</hi> without much inconvenience to the reſpective lenders <hi>or ſellers:</hi> and the greater the national ſuperfluity is, the more numerous will be the <hi>ſellers</hi> (lenders), and the lower ought <hi>the national price of horſe fleſh</hi> (the rate of the national intereſt) to be: but where there are not enough, or barely enough <hi>ſpare horſes</hi> (circulating caſh) to anſwer the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary uſes of the public, <hi>horſe fleſh</hi> (intereſt) will be proportionably high: for <hi>ſellers</hi> (lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) will be but few, as few can ſubmit to the inconvenience of <hi>ſelling"</hi> (lending).—So far the learned commentator.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="unknown:030057_0076_0FE41B75EC8AADF0"/>
I hope, by this time, you are worked up to a proper pitch of indignation, at the neglect and inconſiſtency betrayed by the law, in not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing this ſpecies of jockey-ſhip, which it would be ſo eaſy to do, only by fixing the price of horſes. Nobody is leſs diſpoſed than I am to be uncharitable: but when one thinks of the 1500<abbr>l.</abbr> taken for Eclipſe, and 2000<abbr>l.</abbr> for Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham, and ſo on, who can avoid being ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to think how little regard thoſe who took ſuch enormous prices muſt have had for "the law of revelation and the law of nature?" Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is that is to move for the municipal law, not long ago talked of, for reducing the rate of intereſt, whenever that motion is made, then would be the time for one of the Yorkſhire members to get up, and move, by way of addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for a clauſe for fixing and reducing the price of horſes. I need not expatiate on the utility of that valuable ſpecies of cattle, which might have been as cheap as aſſes before now, if our lawgivers had been as mindful of their duty in the ſuppreſſion of <hi>jockey-ſhip,</hi> as they have been in the ſuppreſſion of <hi>uſury.</hi>

               <p>IT is one thing, to find reaſons why it is <hi>fit</hi> a law <hi>ſhould</hi> have been made: it is another, to find the reaſons why it <hi>was</hi> made: in other words, it is one thing to juſtify a law: it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to account for its exiſtence. In the preſent inſtance, the former taſk, if the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations I have been troubling you with are juſt, is an impoſſible one. The other, though not neceſſary for conviction, may contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perhaps in the way of ſatisfaction. To trace an error to its fountain head, ſays Lord Coke, is to refute it; and many men there are, who, till they have received this ſatisfaction, be the error what it may, cannot prevail upon themſelves ro part with it. "If our anceſtors have been all along under a miſtake, how came they to have fallen into it?" is a queſtion that
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030057_0079_0FE41B7DB6269450"/>naturally preſents itſelf upon ſuch occaſions. The caſe is, that in matters of law more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſuch is the dominion of authority over our minds, and ſuch the prejudice it creates in favour of whatever inſtitution it has taken under its wing, that, after all manner of reaſons that can be thought of, in favour of the inſtitution, have been ſhewn to be inſufficient, we ſtill cannot forbear looking to ſome unaſſignable and latent reaſon for its efficient cauſe. But if, inſtead of any ſuch reaſon, we can find a cauſe for it in ſome notion, of the erroneouſneſs of which we are already ſatisfied, then at laſt we are content to give it up without further ſtruggle; and then, and not till then, our ſatisfaction is compleat.</p>
               <p>In the conceptions of the more conſiderable part of thoſe through whom our religion has been handed down to us, virtue, or rather godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which was an improved ſubſtitute for vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, conſiſted in ſelf-denial: not in ſelf-denial for the ſake of ſociety, but of ſelf-denial for its own ſake. One pretty general rule ſerved for moſt occaſions: not to do what you had a mind
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030057_0080_0FE41B7F61107A40"/>to do; or, in other words, not to do what would be for your advantage. By this, of courſe, was meant temporal advantage: to which ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual advantage was underſtood to be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and diametrical oppoſition. For, the proof of a reſolution, on the part of a being of perfect power and benevolence, to make his few favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites happy in a ſtate in which they <hi>were to be,</hi> was his determined pleaſure, that they ſhould keep themſelves as much ſtrangers to happineſs as poſſible, in a ſtate in which they <hi>were.</hi> Now to get money is what moſt men have a mind to do: becauſe he who has money, gets, as far as it goes, moſt other things that he has a mind for. Of courſe, nobody was to get money: indeed, why ſhould he, when he was not ſo much as to keep what he had got already? To lend money at intereſt, is to get money, or at leaſt to try to get it: of courſe, it was a bad thing to lend money upon ſuch terms. The better the terms, the worſe it was to lend upon them: but it was bad to lend upon any terms, by which any thing could be got. What made it much the worſe was, that it was acting like a Jew: for
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:030057_0081_0FE41B8186BA1B60"/>though all Chriſtians at firſt were Jews, and continued to do as Jews did, after they had become Chriſtians, yet, in proceſs of time, it came to be diſcovered, that the diſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the mother and the daughter church, could not be too wide.</p>
               <p>By degrees, as old conceits gave place to new, nature ſo far prevailed, that the objections to getting money in general, were pretty well over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled: but ſtill this Jewiſh way of getting it, was too odious to be endured. Chriſtians were too intent upon plaguing Jews, to liſten to the ſuggeſtion of doing as Jews did, even though money were to be got by it. Indeed the eaſier method, and a method pretty much in vogue, was, to let the Jews get the money any how they could, and then ſqueeze it out of them as it was wanted.</p>
               <p>In proceſs of time, as queſtions of all ſorts came under diſcuſſion, and this, not the leaſt intereſting, among the reſt, the anti-Jewiſh ſide of it found no unopportune ſupport in a paſſage
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030057_0082_0FE41B832CBA16A8"/>of Ariſtotle: that celebrated heathen, who, in all matters wherein heatheniſm did not deſtroy his competence, had eſtabliſhed a deſpotic em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire over the Chriſtian world. As fate would have it, that great philoſopher, with all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and all his penetration, notwithſtanding the great number of pieces of money that had paſſed through his hands (more perhaps than ever paſſed through the hands of a philoſopher before or ſince), and notwithſtanding the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pains he had beſtowed on the ſubject of generation, had never been able to diſcover, in any one piece of money, any organs for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating any other ſuch piece. Emboldened by ſo ſtrong a body of negative proof, he ventured at laſt to uſher into the world the reſult of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, in the form of an univerſal propoſition, that <hi>all money is in its nature barren.</hi> You, my friend, to whoſe caſt of mind ſound reaſon is much more congenial than ancient philoſophy, you have, I dare to ſay, gone before me in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking, that the practical inference from this ſhrewd obſervation, if it afforded any, ſhould have been, that it would be to no purpoſe for
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:030057_0083_0FE41B87306AAF10"/>man to try to get five per cent, out of money— not, that if he could contrive to get ſo much, there would be any harm in it. But the ſages of thoſe days did not view the matter in that light.</p>
               <p>A conſideration that did not happen to preſent itſelf to that great philoſopher, but which, had it happened to preſent itſelf, might not have been altogether unworthy of his notice, is, that though a <hi>daric</hi> would not beget another daric, any more than it would a ram, or an ewe, yet for a daric which a man borrowed, he might get a ram and a couple of ewes, and that the ewes, were the ram left with them a certain time, would probably not be barren. That then, at the end of the end of the year, he would find himſelf maſter of his three ſheep, together with two, if not three, lambs; and that, if he ſold his ſheep again to pay back his daric, and gave one of his lambs for the uſe of it in the mean time, he would be two lambs, or at leaſt one lamb, richer, than if he had made no ſuch bargain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:030057_0084_0FE41B88D9797C00"/>
Theſe theological and philoſophical conceits, the offspring of the day, were not ill ſeconded by principles of a more permanent complexion.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs of a money-lender, though only among Chriſtians, and in Chriſtian times, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed profeſſion, has no where, nor at any time, been a popular one. Thoſe who have the reſolution to ſacrifice the preſent to the future, are natural objects of envy to thoſe who have ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed the future to the preſent. The children who have eat their cake, are the natural enemies of the children who have theirs. While the money is hoped for, and for a ſhort time after it has been received, he who lends it is a friend and benefactor: by the time the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is ſpent, and the evil hour of reckoning is come, the benefactor is found to have changed his nature, and to have put on the tyrant and the oppreſſor. It is an oppreſſion for a man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his own money: it is none to keep it from him. Among the inconſiderate, that is, among the great maſs of mankind, ſelfiſh affections conſpire with the ſocial in treaſuring up all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:030057_0085_0FE41B9338771018"/>for the man of diſſipation, and in refuſing juſtice to the man of thrift who has ſupplied him. In ſome ſhape or other, that favour attends the choſen object of it, through every ſtage of his career. But, in no ſtage of <hi>his</hi> career, can the man of thrift come in for any ſhare of it. It is the general intereſt of thoſe with whom a man lives, that his expence ſhould be at leaſt as great as his circumſtances will bear: becauſe there are few expences which a man can launch into, but what the benefit of them is ſhared, in ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion or other, by thoſe with whom he lives. In that circle originates a ſtanding law, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding every man, on pain of infamy, to confine his expences within what is adjudged to be the meaſure of his means, ſaving always the power of exceeding that limit, as much as he thinks proper: and the means aſſigned him by that law may be ever ſo much beyond his real means, but are ſure never to fall ſhort of them. So cloſe is the combination thus formed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the idea of merit and the idea of expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diture, that a diſpoſition to ſpend finds favour in the eyes even of thoſe who know that a man's
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030057_0086_0FE41B9535848BD8"/>circumſtances do not entitle him to the means: and an upſtart, whoſe chief recommendation is this diſpoſition, ſhall find himſelf to have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a permanent fund of reſpect, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the very perſons at whoſe expence he has been gratifying his appetites and his pride. The luſtre, which the diſplay of borrowed wealth has diffuſed over his character, awes men, during the ſeaſon of his proſperity, into a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his inſolence: and when the hand of adverſity has overtaken him at laſt, the recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the height, from which he is fallen, throws the veil of compaſſion over his injuſtice.</p>
               <p>The condition of the man of thrift, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. His laſting opulence procures him a ſhare, at leaſt, of the ſame envy, that attends the prodigal's tranſient diſplay: but the uſe he makes of it, procures him no part of the favour which attends the prodigal. In the ſatisfactions he derives from that uſe, the pleaſure of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and the idea of enjoying, at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant period, which may never arrive, nobody comes in for any ſhare. In the midſt of his opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030057_0087_0FE41B9904122128"/>he is regarded as a kind of inſolvent, who refuſes to honour the bills, which their rapacity would draw upon him, and who is by ſo much the more criminal than other inſolvents, as not having the plea of inability for an excuſe.</p>
               <p>Could there be any doubt of the disfavour, which attends the cauſe of the money-lender, in his competition with the borrower, and of the diſpoſition of the public judgment to ſacrifice the intereſt of the former to that of the latter, the ſtage would afford a compendious, but a pretty concluſive proof of it. It is the buſineſs of the dramatiſt to ſtudy, and to conform to, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and paſſions of thoſe, on the pleaſing of whom he depends for his ſucceſs: it is the courſe which reflection muſt ſuggeſt to every man, and which a man would naturally fall into, though he were not to think about it. He may, and very frequently does, make magnificent preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of giving the law to them: but woe be to him that attempts to give them any other law than what they are diſpoſed already to receive. If he would attempt to lead them one inch, it
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:030057_0088_0FE41B9B061995A0"/>muſt be with great caution, and not without ſuffering himſelf to be led by them at leaſt a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen. Now, I queſtion, whether, among all the inſtances in which a borrower and a lender of money have been brought together upon the ſtage, from the days of Theſpis to the preſent, there ever was one, in which the former was not recommended to favour, in ſome ſhape or other, either to admiration, or to love, or to pity, or to all three; and the other, the man of thrift, conſigned to infamy.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that, in reviewing and adjuſting the intereſts of theſe apparently rival parties, the advantage made by the borrower is ſo apt to ſlip out of ſight, and that made by the lender to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in ſo exaggerated a point of view. Hence it is, that though prejudice is ſo far ſoftened, as to acquieſce in the lender's making ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, leſt the borrower ſhould loſe altogether the beneſit of his aſſiſtance, yet ſtill the borrower is to have all the favour, and the lender's advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is forever to be clipped, and pared down, as low as it will bear. Firſt it was to be confined to
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:030057_0089_0FE41B9CAE291BB0"/>ten percent. then to eight, then to ſix, then to five, and now lately there was a report of its being to be brought down to four; with conſtant liberty to ſink as much lower as it would. The burden of theſe reſtraints, of courſe, has been intended excluſively for the lender: in reality, as I think you have ſeen, it preſſes much more heavily upon the borrower: I mean him who either becomes, or in vain wiſhes to become ſo. But the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents directed by prejudice, Dr. Smith will tell us, are not always delivered according to their addreſs. It was thus that the mill-ſtone deſigned for the necks of thoſe vermin, as they have been called, the dealers in corn, was found to fall upon the heads of the conſumers. It is thus—but further examples would lead me further from the purpoſe.</p>

               <head>LETTER XI. <hi>Compound Intereſt.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A WORD or two I muſt trouble you with, concerning <hi>compound intereſt;</hi> for compound intereſt is diſcountenanced by the law; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as a ſort of uſury. That, without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſtipulation, the law never gives it, I well remember: whether, in caſe of an expreſs ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the law allows it to be taken, I am not abſolutely certain. I ſhould ſuppoſe it might: remembering covenants in mortgages that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhould become principal. At any rate, I think the law cannot well puniſh it under the name of uſury.</p>
               <p>If the diſcountenance ſhewn to this arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be grounded on the horror of the ſin of uſury, the impropriety of ſuch diſcountenance
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030057_0091_0FE41BA1C16D6EC8"/>follows of courſe, from the arguments which ſhew the unſinfulneſs of that ſin.</p>
               <p>Other argument againſt it, I believe, was never attempted, unleſs it were the giving to ſuch an arrangement the epithet of a <hi>hard</hi> one: in doing which, ſomething more like a reaſon is given, than one gets in ordinary from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law.</p>
               <p>If that conſiſtency were to be found in the common law, which has never yet been found in man's conduct, and which perhaps is hardly in man's nature, compound intereſt never could have been denied.</p>
               <p>The views which ſuggeſted this denial, were, I dare to ſay, very good: the effects of it are, I am certain, very pernicious.</p>
               <p>If the borrower pays the intereſt at the day, if he performs his engagement, that very engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to which the law pretends to oblige him to conform, the lender, who receives that intereſt,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:030057_0092_0FE41BA3CC3C0CB0"/>makes compound intereſt of courſe, by lending it out again, unleſs he chooſes rather to expend it: he expects to receive it at the day, or what meant the engagement? if he fails of receiving it, he is by ſo much a loſer: the borrower by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it at the day is no loſer: if he does not pay it at the day, he is by ſo much a gainer: a pain of diſappointment takes place in the caſe of the one, while no ſuch pain takes place in the caſe of the other. The cauſe of him whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is to <hi>catch a gain,</hi> is thus preferred to that of him whoſe contention is to avoid a loſs: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the reaſonable and uſeful maxim of that branch of the common law which has acquired the name of equity. The gain, which the law in its tenderneſs thus beſtows on the defaulter, is an encouragement, a reward, which it holds out for breach of faith, for iniquity, for indolence, for negligence.</p>
               <p>The loſs, which it thus throws upon the forbearing lender, is a puniſhment which it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts on him for his forbearance: the power which it gives him of avoiding that loſs, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030057_0093_0FE41BA57327D728"/>the borrower upon the inſtant of failure, is thus converted into a reward which it holds out to him for his hard-heartedneſs and rigour. Man is not quite ſo good as it were to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he were; but he would be bad indeed, were he bad on all the occaſions where the law, as far as depends on her, has made it his intereſt ſo to be.</p>
               <p>It may be impoſſible, ſay you, it often is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, for the borrower to pay the intereſt at the day: and you ſay truly. What is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? That the creditor ſhould <hi>not</hi> have it in his power to ruin the debtor for not paying at the day, and that he <hi>ſhould</hi> receive a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for the loſs occaſioned by ſuch failure.— He has it in his power to ruin him, and he has it not in his power to obtain ſuch compenſation. The judge, were it poſſible for an arreſted debtor to find his way into a judge's chamber inſtead of a ſpunging-houſe, might award a proper reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite, ſuited to the circumſtances of the parties. It is not poſſible: but a reſpite is purchaſed, proper or not proper, perhaps at ten times, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030057_0094_0FE41BA7849AE8C8"/>at a hundred times the expence of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound intereſt, by putting in bail, and fighting the creditor through all the windings of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and unneceſſary delay. Of the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction due either for the original failure, or for the ſubſequent vexation by which it has been aggravated, no part is ever received by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured creditor: but the inſtruments of the law receive, perhaps at his expence, perhaps at the debtor's, perhaps ten times, perhaps a hundred times the amount of that ſatisfaction. Such is the reſult of this tenderneſs of the law.</p>
               <p>It is in conſequence of ſuch tenderneſs, that on ſo many occaſions, a man, though ever ſo able, would find himſelf a loſer by paying his juſt debts: thoſe very debts of which the law has recognized the juſtice. The man who obeys the dictates of common honeſty, the man who does what the law pretends to bid him, is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himſelf. Hence your regular and ſecurely profitable writs of error in the houſe of lords: hence your random and vindictive coſts of one hundred pounds, and two hundred pounds, now
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030057_0095_0FE41BACD03742A8"/>and then given in that houſe. It is natural, and it is ſomething, to find, in a company of lords, a zeal for juſtice: it is not natural, to find, in ſuch a company, a diſpoſition to bend down to the toil of calculation.</p>

               <head>LETTER XII. <hi>Maintenance and Champerty.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAVING, in the preceding letters, had occaſion to lay down, and, as I flatter myſelf, to make good, the general principle, that <hi>no man of ripe years, and of ſound mind, ought, out of loving-kindeſs to him, to be hindered from mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a bargain, in the way of obtaining mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as, acting with his eyes open, he deems condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to his intereſt;</hi> I will take your leave for puſhing it a little farther, and extending the application of it to another claſs of regulations ſtill leſs defenſible. I mean the antique laws againſt what are called Maintenance and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
               <p>To the head of <hi>Maintenance,</hi> I think you refer, beſides other offences which are not to the preſent purpoſe, that of purchaſing, upon any
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:030057_0097_0FE41BB0B12F7DE0"/>terms, any claim, which it requires a ſuit at law, or in equity, to enforce.</p>
               <p>Champerty, which is but a particular modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this ſin of Maintenance, is, I think, the furniſhing a man who has ſuch a claim, with regard to a real eſtate, ſuch money as he may have occaſion for, to carry on ſuch claim, upon the terms of receiving a part of the eſtate in caſe of ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>What the penalties are for theſe offences, I do not recollect; nor do I think it worth while hunting for them, though I have Blackſtone at my elbow. They are, at any rate, ſufficiently ſevere to anſwer the purpoſe, the rather as the bargain is made void.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate the miſchievouſneſs of the laws by which they have been created, give me leave to tell you a ſtory, which is but too true a one, which happened to fall within my own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="unknown:030057_0098_0FE41BB25CB24870"/>
A gentleman of my acquaintance had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, during his minority, to an eſtate of about 3000<abbr>l.</abbr> a year; I will not ſay where.— His guardian, concealing from him the value of the eſtate, which circumſtances rendered it eaſy for him to do, got a conveyance of it from him, during his non-age, for a trifle. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon the ward's coming of age, the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, keeping him ſtill in darkneſs, found means to get the conveyance confirmed. Some years afterwards, the ward diſcovered the value of the inheritance he had been throwing away. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate repreſentations proving, as it may be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, ineffectual, he applied to a court of equity. The ſuit was in ſome forwardneſs: the opinion of the ableſt counſel highly encouraging: but money there remained none. We all know but too well, that, in ſpite of the unimpeachable integrity of the bench, that branch of juſtice, which is particularly dignified with the name of equity, is only for thoſe who can afford to throw away one fortune for the chance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering another. Two perſons, however, were found, who, between them, were content to
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:030057_0099_0FE41BB6C7BD3F38"/>defray the expence of the ticket for this lottery, on condition of receiving half the prize. The proſpect now became encouraging: when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately one of the adventurers, in exploring the receſſes of the bottomleſs pit, happened to dig up one of the old ſtatutes againſt Champerty. This blew up the whole project: however, the defendant, underſtanding that, ſome how or other, his antagoniſt had found ſupport, had thought fit in the mean time to propoſe terms, which the plaintiff, after his ſupport had thus dropped from under him, was very glad to cloſe with. He received, I think it was, 3000<abbr>l.</abbr>; and for that he gave up the eſtate, which was worth about as much yearly, together with the arrears, which were worth about as much as the eſtate.</p>
               <p>Whether, in the barbarous age which gave birth to theſe barbarous precautions, whether, even under the zenith of feudal anarchy, ſuch fettering regulations could have had reaſon on their ſide, is a queſtion of curioſity rather than uſe. My notion is, that there never was a time,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030057_0100_0FE41BB86CEEE630"/>that there never could have been, or can be a time, when the puſhing of ſuitors away from court with one hand, while they are beckoned into it with another, would not be a policy equally faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, inconſiſtent, and abſurd. But, what every body muſt acknowledge, is, that, to the times which called forth theſe laws, and in which alone they could have ſtarted up, the preſent are as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite as light to darkneſs. A miſchief, in thoſe times, it ſeems, but too common, though a miſchief not to be cured by ſuch laws, was, that a man would buy a weak claim, in hopes that power might convert it into a ſtrong one, and that the ſword of a baron, ſtalking into court with a rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of retainers at his heels, might ſtrike terror into the eyes of a judge upon the bench. At preſent, what cares an Engliſh judge for the ſwords of an hundred barons? Neither fearing nor hoping, hating nor loving, the judge of our days is ready with equal phlegm to adminiſter, upon all occaſions, that ſyſtem, whatever it be, of juſtice, or injuſtice, which the law has put in his hands. A diſpoſition ſo conſonant to duty, could not have then been hoped for: one
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:030057_0101_0FE41B8FDEAEDBC0"/>more conſonant is hardly to be wiſhed. Wealth has, indeed, the monopoly of juſtice againſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty: and ſuch monopoly it is the direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and neceſſary effect of regulations like theſe to ſtrengthen and confirm. But with this monopoly no judge that lives now, is at all chargeable. The law created this monopoly: the law, whenever it pleaſes, may diſſolve it.</p>
               <p>I will not, however, ſo far wander from my ſubject as to enquire what meaſure might have been neceſſary to afford a full relief to the caſe of that unfortunate gentleman, any more than to the caſes of ſo many other gentlemen who might be found, as unfortunate as he. I will not inſiſt upon ſo ſtrange and ſo inconceivable an arrangement, as that of the judge's ſeeing both parties face to face in the firſt inſtance, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving what the facts are in diſpute, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that as the facts ſhould turn out this way or that way, ſuch or ſuch would be his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. At preſent, I confine myſelf to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of ſuch part of the miſchief, as may ariſe from the general conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, of keeping men out of
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:030057_0102_0FE41B918FE2B238"/>difficulties, by cutting them off from ſuch means of relief as each man's ſituation may afford. A ſpunge in this, as in ſo many other caſes, is the only needful, and only availing remedy: one ſtroke of it for the muſty laws againſt mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and champerty: another for the more recent ones againſt uſury. Conſider, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what would have reſpectively been the effect of two ſuch ſtrokes, in the caſe of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate gentleman I have been ſpeaking of. By the firſt, if what is called equity has any claim to confidence, he would have got, even after pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off his champerty-uſurers, 1500<abbr>l.</abbr> a year in land, and about as much in money: inſtead of getting, and that only by an accident, 3000<abbr>l.</abbr> once told. By the other, there is no ſaying to what a degree he might have been benefited.— May I be allowed to ſtretch ſo far in favour of the law as to ſuppoſe, that ſo ſmall a ſum as 500<abbr>l.</abbr> would have carried him through his ſuit, in the courſe of about three years? I am ſenſible, that may be thought but a ſhort ſum, and this but a ſhort term, for a ſuit in equity: but, for the purpoſe of illuſtration, it may ſerve as well
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:030057_0103_0FE41BBA17742298"/>as a longer. Suppoſe he had ſought this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſum in the way of borrowing; and had been ſo fortunate, or, as the laws againſt the ſin of uſury would ſtile it, ſo unfortunate, as to get it at 200 per cent. He would then have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed his 6000<abbr>l.</abbr> a year at the price of half as much once paid, viz. 3000<abbr>l.</abbr>; inſtead of ſelling it at that price. Whether, if no ſuch laws againſt uſury had been in being, he could have got the money, even at that rate, I will not pretend to ſay: perhaps he might not have got it under ten times that rate, perhaps he might have got it at the tenth part of that rate. Thus far, I think, we may ſay, that he might, and probably would, have been the better for the repeal of thoſe laws: but thus far we muſt ſay, that it is impoſſible he ſhould have been the worſe. The terms, upon which he met with adventurers willing to relieve him, though they come not within that ſcanty field, which the law, in the narrowneſs of its views, calls uſury, do, in the preſent caſe, at twenty years' purchaſe of the 3000<abbr>l.</abbr> a year he was content to have ſacrificed for ſuch aſſiſtance, amount, in effect, to 4000
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:030057_0104_0FE41BBC17D3EA20"/>per cent. Whether it was likely that any man, who was diſpoſed to venture his money at all, upon ſuch a chance, would have thought of inſiſting upon ſuch a rate of intereſt, I will leave you to imagine: but thus much may be ſaid with confidence, becauſe the fact demonſtrates it, that at a rate not exceeding this, the ſum actually would have been ſupplied. Whatever becomes, then, of the laws againſt maintenance and champerty, the example in queſtion, when applied to the laws againſt uſury, ought, I think, to be ſufficient to convince us, that ſo long as the expence of ſeeking relief at law ſtands on its preſent footing, the purpoſe of ſeeking that relief will, of itſelf, independently of every other, afford a ſufficient ground for allowing any man, or every man, to borrow money on any terms he can obtain it.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I FORGET what ſon of controverſy it was, among the Greeks, who, having put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſchool, to a profeſſor of eminence, to learn what, in thoſe days, went by the name of wiſdom, choſe an attack upon his maſter for the firſt public ſpecimen of his proficiency. This ſpecimen, whatever entertainment it might have afforded to the audience, afforded, it may be ſuppoſed, no great ſatisfaction to the maſter: for the theſis was, that the pupil owed him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his pains. For my part, being about to ſhew myſelf in one reſpect as ungrateful as the Greek, it may be a matter of prudence for me to look out for ſomething like candour by way of covering to my ingratitude. Inſtead, therefore, of pretending to owe you nothing, I ſhall begin
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:030057_0106_0FE41BC24C8E1C80"/>with acknowledging, that, as far as your track coincides with mine, I ſhould come much nearer the truth, were I to ſay I owed you every thing. Should it be my fortune to gain any advantage over you, it muſt be with weapons which you have taught me to wield, and with which you yourſelf have furniſhed me; for, as all the great ſtandards of truth, which can be appealed to in this line, owe, as far I can underſtand, their eſtabliſhment to you, I can ſee ſearce any other way of convicting you of any error or overſight, than by judging you out of your own mouth.</p>
               <p>In the ſeries of letters to which this will form a ſequel, I had travelled nearly thus far in my reſearches into the policy of the laws fixing the rate of intereſt, combating ſuch arguments as fancy rather than obſervation had ſuggeſted to my views, when, on a ſudden, recollection pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me with your formidable image, beſtrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ground over which I was travelling pretty much at my eaſe, and oppoſing the ſhield of your authority to any arguments I could produce.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="unknown:030057_0107_0FE41BC447236480"/>
It was a reflection mentioned by Cicero as affording him ſome comfort, that the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his talents, till that time, had met with, had been chiefly on the defending ſide. How little ſoever bleſt, on any occaſion, with any portion of his eloquence, I may, on the preſent occaſion, however, indulge myſelf with a portion of what conſtituted his comfort: for, if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to contend with you, it is only in deſence of what I look upon as, not only an innocent, but a moſt meritorious race of men, who are ſo unfortunate as to have fallen under the rod of your diſpleaſure. I mean <hi>projectors:</hi> under which invidious name I underſtand you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, in particular, all ſuch perſons as, in the purſuit of wealth, ſtrike out into any new chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and more eſpecially into any channel of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
               <p>It is with the profeſſed view of checking, or rather of cruſhing, theſe adventurous ſpirits, whom you rank with "prodigals," that you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the laws which limit the rate of intereſt, grounding yourſelf on the tendency, they appear
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030057_0108_0FE41BC649A5E110"/>to you to have, to keep the capital of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try out of two ſuch different ſets of hands.</p>
               <p>The paſſage, I am ſpeaking of, is in the fourth chapter of your ſecond book, volume the ſecond of the 8vo. edition of 1784. "The legal rate" (you ſay) "it is to be obſerved, though it ought to be ſomewhat above, ought not to be much above, the loweſt market rate. If the legal rate of intereſt in Great Britain, for example, was fixed ſo high as eight or ten per cent. the greater part of the money which was to be lent, would be lent to prodigals and projectors, who alone would be willing to give this high intereſt. Sober people, who will give for the uſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney no more than a part of what they are likely to make by the uſe of it, would not venture into the competition. A great part of the capital of the country would thus be kept out of the hands which were moſt likely to make a profitable and advantageous uſe of it, and thrown into thoſe which were moſt likely to waſte and deſtroy it. Where the legal intereſt, on the contrary, is fixed but a very little above the loweſt market
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030057_0109_0FE41BC945D93CF8"/>rate, ſober people are univerſally preferred as borrowers, to prodigals and projectors. The perſon who lends money, gets nearly as much intereſt from the former, as he dares to take from the latter, and his money is much ſafer in the hands of the one ſet of people than in thoſe of the other. A great part of the capital of the country is thus thrown into the hands in which it is moſt likely to be employed with advantage."</p>
               <p>It happens fortunately for the ſide you appear to have taken, and as unfortunately for mine, that the appellative, which the cuſtom of the language has authorized you, and which the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and perverſity of the language has, in a manner, forced you to make uſe of, is one, which, along with the idea of the ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in queſtion, conveys the idea of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as indiſcriminately and deſervedly applied to them. With what juſtice or conſiſtency, or by the influence of what cauſes, this ſtamp of indiſcriminate reprobation has been thus affixed, it is not immediately neceſſary to enquire. But,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030057_0110_0FE41BCB1765DE40"/>that it does ſtand thus affixed, you and every body elſe, I imagine, will be ready enough to allow. This being the caſe, the queſtion ſtands already decided, in the firſt inſtance at leaſt, if not irrevocably, in the judgments of all thoſe, who, unable or unwilling to be at the pains of analyſing their ideas, ſuffer their minds to be led captive by the tyranny of ſounds: that is, I doubt, of by far the greater proportion of thoſe whom we are likely to have to judge us. In the conceptions of all ſuch perſons, to aſk whether it be ſit to reſtrain projects, and projectors, will be as much as to aſk, whether it be fit to reſtrain raſhneſs, and folly, and abſurdity, and knavery, and waſte.</p>
               <p>Of prodigals I ſhall ſay no more at preſent. I have already ſtated my reaſons for thinking, that it is not among them that we are to look for the natural cuſtomers for money at high rates of intereſt. As far as thoſe reaſons are conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, it will follow, that, of the two ſorts of men you mention as proper objects of the burden of theſe reſtraints, prodigals and projectors, that
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030057_0111_0FE41BCD145C6700"/>burden falls excluſively on the latter. As to theſe, what your definition is of projectors, and what deſcriptions of perſons you meant to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude under the cenſure conveyed by that name, might be material for the purpoſe of judging of the propriety of that cenſure, but makes no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in judging of the propriety of the law, which that cenſure is employed to juſtify. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you yourſelf, were the ſeveral claſſes of perſons made to paſs before you in review, would be diſpoſed to pick out this or that claſs, or this and that individual, in order to exempt them from ſuch cenſure, is what, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we have no need to enquire. The law, it is certain, makes no ſuch diſtinctions; it falls with equal weight, and with all its weight, upon all thoſe perſons, without diſtinction, to whom the term <hi>projectors,</hi> in the moſt impartial and extenſive ſignification of which it is capable, can be applied. It falls, at any rate, (to repeat ſome of the words of my former definition) upon all ſuch perſons, as, in the purſuit of wealth, or even of any other object, endeavour, by the aſſiſtance of wealth, to ſtrike into any channel
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030057_0112_0FE41BCEBB924E20"/>of invention. It falls upon all ſuch perſons, as, in the cultivation of any of thoſe arts which have been, by way of eminence, termed <hi>uſeful,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their endeavours to any of thoſe depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in which their utility ſhines moſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous and induibitable; upon all ſuch perſons as, in the line of any of their purſuits, aim at any thing that can be called <hi>improvement;</hi> whether it conſiſt in the production of any new article adapted to man's uſe, or in the meliorating the quality, or diminiſhing the expence, of any of thoſe which are already known to us. It falls, in ſhort, upon every application of the human powers, in which ingenuity ſtands in need of wealth for its aſſiſtant.</p>
               <p>High and extraordinary rates of intereſt, how little ſoever adapted to the ſituation of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, are certainly, as you very juſtly obſerve, particularly adapted to the ſituation of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector: not however to that of the imprudent projector only, nor even to his caſe more than another's, but to that of the prudent and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded projector, if the exiſtence of ſuch a
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030057_0113_0FE41BD2632AA7B0"/>being were to be ſuppoſed. Whatever be the prudence or other qualities of the project, in whatever circumſtance the novelty of it may lie, it has this circumſtance againſt it, viz. that it is new. But the rates of intereſt, the higheſt rates allowed, are, as you expreſsly ſay they are, and as you would have them to be, adjuſted to the ſituation which the ſort of trader is in, whoſe trade runs in the old channels, and to the beſt ſecurity which ſuch channels can afford. But, in the nature of things, no new trade, no trade carried on in any new channel, can afford a ſecurity equal to that which may be afforded by a trade carried on in any of the old ones: in whatever light the matter might appear to perfect intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, in the eye of every prudent perſon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting the beſt powers of judging which the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible condition of the human faculties affords, the novelty of any commercial adventure will oppoſe a chance of ill ſucceſs, ſuperadded to every one which could attend the ſame, or any other adventure, already tried, and proved to be profitable by experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="unknown:030057_0114_0FE41BD469F5DDF8"/>
The limitation of the profit that is to be made, by lending money to perſons embarked in trade, will render the monied man more anxious, you may ſay, about the goodneſs of his ſecurity, and accordingly more anxious to ſatisfy himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the prudence of a project, in the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of which the money is to be employed, than he would be otherwiſe: and in this way it may be thought that theſe laws <hi>have</hi> a tendency to pick out the good projects from the bad, and favour the former at the expence of the latter. The firſt of theſe poſitions I admit: but I can never admit the conſequence to follow. A prudent man, (I mean nothing more than a man of ordinary prudence) a prudent man acting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſole governance of prudential motives, I ſtill ſay will not, in theſe circumſtances, pick out the good projects from the bad, for he will not meddle with projects at all. He will pick out old-eſtabliſhed trades from all ſorts of projects, good and bad; for with a new project, be it ever ſo promiſing, he never will have any thing to do. By every man that has money, five per cent. or whatever be the higheſt legal rate, is at all
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030057_0115_0FE41BD66BB2C868"/>times, and always will be, to be had upon the very beſt ſecurity, that the beſt and moſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous old-eſtabliſhed trade can afford. Traders in general, I believe, it is commonly underſtood, are well enough inclined to enlarge their capital, as far as all the money they can borrow at the higheſt legal rate, while that rate is ſo low as five per cent. will enlarge it. How it is poſſible, therefore, for a project, be it ever ſo promiſing, to afford, to a lender at any ſuch rate of intereſt, terms equally advantageous, upon the whole, with thoſe he might be ſure of obtaining from an old-eſtabliſhed buſineſs, is more than I can conceive. Loans of money may certainly chance, now and then, to find their way into the pockets of projectors as well as of other men: but when this happens it muſt be through incautiouſneſs, or friendſhip, or the expectation of ſome collateral benefit, and not through any idea of the advantageouſneſs of the tranſaction, in the light of a pecuniary bargain.</p>
               <p>I ſhould not expect to ſee it alleged, that there is any thing, that ſhould render the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:030057_0116_0FE41BD816D8F408"/>of well-grounded projects, in compariſon of the ill-grounded, leſs in time future, than it has been in time paſt. I am ſure, at leaſt, that I know of no reaſons why it ſhould be ſo, though I know of ſome reaſons, which I ſhall beg leave to ſubmit to you by and by, which appear to me pretty good ones, why the advantage ſhould be on the ſide of futurity. But, unleſs the ſtock of well-grounded projects is already ſpent, and the whole ſtock of ill-grounded projects that ever were poſſible, are to be looked for excluſively in the time to come, the cenſure you have paſſed on projectors, meaſuring ſtill the extent of it by that of the operation of the laws in the defence of which it is employed, looks as far backward as forward: it condemns as raſh and ill-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all thoſe projects, by which our ſpecies have been ſucceſſively advanced from that ſtate in which acorns were their food, and raw hides their cloathing, to the ſtate in which it ſtands at preſent: for think, Sir, let me beg of you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whatever is now the <hi>routine</hi> of trade was not, at its commencement, <hi>project?</hi> whether
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:030057_0117_0FE41BDC161AB100"/>whatever is now <hi>eſtabliſhment,</hi> was not, at one time, innovation?</p>
               <p>How it is that the tribe of well-grounded projects, and of prudent projectors (if by this time I may have your leave for applying this epithet to ſome, at leaſt, among the projectors of time paſt), have managed to ſtruggle through the obſtacles which the laws in queſtion have been holding in their way, it is neither eaſy to know, nor neceſſary to enquire. Manifeſt enough, I think, it muſt be by this time, that difficulties, and thoſe not inconſiderable ones, thoſe laws muſt have been holding in the way of projects of all ſorts of improvement (if I may ſay ſo) in every line, ſo long as they have had exiſtence: reaſonable, therefore, it muſt be to conclude, that, had it not been for theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, projects of all ſorts, well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſucceſsful ones, as well as others, would have been more numerous than they have been: and that accordingly, on the other hand, as ſoon, if ever, as theſe diſcouragements ſhall be removed, projects of all ſorts, and among the
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:030057_0118_0FE41BDDF9160B50"/>reſt, well-grounded and ſucceſsful ones, will be more numerous than they would otherwiſe have been: in ſhort, that, as, without theſe diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, the progreſs of mankind, in the career of proſperity, would have been greater than it has been under them in time paſt, ſo, were they to be removed, it would be at leaſt proportionably greater in time future.</p>
               <p>That I have done you no injuſtice, in aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your idea of projectors ſo great a latitude, and that the unfavourable opinion you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to entertain of them is not confined to the above paſſage, might be made, I think, pretty apparent, if it be material, by another paſſage in the tenth chapter of your firſt book, (edit. 1784, 8vo. p. 177.) "The eſtabliſhment of any new manufacture, of any new branch of commerce, or of any new practice in agriculture," all theſe you comprehend by name under the liſt of <hi>"projects:"</hi> of every one of them you obſerve, that "it is a ſpeculation from which the <hi>projector</hi> promiſes himſelf extraordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. Theſe profits (you add) are ſometimes
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:030057_0119_0FE41BDFF8CAE508"/>
                  <hi>very great,</hi> and ſometimes, <hi>more frequently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,</hi> they are <hi>quite otherwiſe:</hi> but in general they bear no regular proportion to thoſe of other trades in the neighbourhood. If the project ſucceeds, they are commonly at firſt very high. When the trade or practice becomes thoroughly eſtabliſhed and well known, the competition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces them to the level of other trades." But on this head I forbear to inſiſt: nor ſhould I have taken this liberty of giving you back your own words, but in the hope of ſeeing ſome alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation made in them in your next edition, ſhould I be fortunate enough to find my ſentiments confirmed by your's. In other reſpects, what is eſſential to the public, is, what the error is in the ſentiments entertained, not who it is that entertains them.</p>
               <p>I know not whether the obſervations which I have been troubling you with, will be thought to need, or whether they will be thought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, any additional ſupport from thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable poſitions, of which you have made ſuch frequent uſe, concerning the conſtant tendency
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030057_0120_0FE41BE1A275B760"/>of mankind to get forward in the career of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, the prevalence of prudence over im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, in the ſum of private conduct at leaſt, and the ſuperior fitneſs of individuals for manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own pecuniary concerns, of which they know the particulars and the circumſtances, in compariſon of the legiſlator, who can have no ſuch knowledge. I will make the experiment: for, ſo long as I have the mortification to ſee you on the oppoſite ſide, I can never think the ground I have taken ſtrong enough, while any thing remains that appears capable of rendering it ſtill ſtronger.</p>
               <p>"With regard to miſconduct, the number of prudent and ſucceſsful undertakings" (you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, b. II. ch. iii. edit. 8vo. 1784, vol. ii. p. 20.) "is every where much greater than that of injudicious and unſucceſsful ones. After all our complaints of the frequency of bankruptcies, the unhappy men who fall into this misfortune, make but a very ſmall part of the whole number engaged in trade, and all other ſorts of buſineſs;
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030057_0121_0FE41BE536819D00"/>not much more perhaps than one in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand."</p>
               <p>It is in ſupport of this poſition, that you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to hiſtory for the conſtant and uninterrupted progreſs of mankind, in our iſland at leaſt, in the career of proſperity: calling upon any one who ſhould entertain a doubt of the fact, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the hiſtory into any number of periods, from the time of Caeſar's viſit down to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: propoſing, for inſtance, the reſpective aeras of the Reſtoration, the Acceſſion of Elizabeth, that of Henry VII. the Norman Conqueſt, and the Heptarchy, and putting it to the ſceptic to find out, if he can, among all theſe periods, any one at which the condition of the country was not more proſperous than at the period immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately preceding it; in ſpite of ſo many wars, and ſires, and plagues, and all other public ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, with which it has been at different times afflicted, whether by the hand of God, or by the miſconduct of the ſovereign. No very eaſy taſk, I believe: the fact is too manifeſt for the moſt jaundiced eye to eſcape ſeeing it: but
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:030057_0122_0FE41BE6E3946DD0"/>what and whom are we to thank for it, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and projectors?</p>
               <p>"No," I think I hear you ſaying, "I will not thank projectors for it; I will rather thank the laws, which, by fixing the rates of intereſt, have been exerciſing their vigilance in repreſſing the temerity of projectors, and preventing their imprudence from making thoſe defalcations from the ſum of national proſperity which it would not have failed to make, had it been left free. If, during all theſe periods, that adventurous race of men had been left at liberty by the laws to give full ſcope to their raſh enterprizes, the increaſe of national proſperity during theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiods might have afforded ſome ground for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding them in a more favourable point of view. But the fact is, that their activity has had theſe laws to check it: without which checks you muſt give me leave to ſuppoſe, that the current of proſperity, if not totally ſtopt, or turned the other way, would, at any rate, have been more or leſs retarded. Here then," (you conclude) "lies the difference between us: what you look
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030057_0123_0FE41BE8E466E4B8"/>upon as the cauſe of the increaſe about which we are both agreed, I look upon as an obſtacle to it: and what you look upon as the obſtacle, I look upon as the cauſe."</p>
               <p>Inſtead of ſtating this as a ſort of plea that might be urged by you, I ought, perhaps, rather to have mentioned it as what might be urged by ſome people in your place: for, as I do not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine your penetration would ſuffer you to reſt ſatisſied with it, ſtill leſs can I ſuppoſe that, if you were not, your candour would allow you to make uſe of it as if you were.</p>
               <p>To prevent your reſting ſatisfied with it, the following conſiderations would, I think, be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, of the ſeven periods which you have pitched upon, as ſo many ſtages for the eye to reſt at in viewing the progreſs of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it is only during the three laſt, that the country has had the benefit, if ſuch we are to
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:030057_0124_0FE41BEA8F8D3380"/>call it, of theſe laws: for it is to the reign of Henry VIII. that we owe the firſt of them.</p>
               <p>Here a multitude of queſtions might be ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Whether the curbing of projectors formed any part of the deſign of that firſt ſtatute, or whether the views of it were not wholly confined to the reducing the gains of that obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and envied claſs of men, the money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenders? Whether projectors have been moſt abundant before that ſtatute, or ſince that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute? And whether the nation has ſuffered, as you might ſay—benefited, as I ſhould ſay, moſt by them, upon the whole, during the former period or the latter? All theſe diſcuſſions, and many more that might be ſlarted, I decline engaging in, as more likely to retard, than to forward, our coming to any agreement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the main queſtion.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I muſt here take the liberty of referring you to the proof, which I think I have already given, of the propoſition, that the reſtraints in queſtion could never have had the
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:030057_0125_0FE41BEF6D444990"/>effect, in any degree, of leſſening the proportion of bad projects to good ones, but only of dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing, as far as their influence may have extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the total number of projects, good and bad together. Whatever, therefore, was the general tendency of the projecting ſpirit previouſly to the firſt of theſe laws, ſuch it muſt have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ever ſince, for any effect which they could have had in purifying and correcting it.</p>
               <p>But what may appear more ſatisfactory, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, than both the above conſiderations, and may afford us the beſt help towards extricating our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the perplexity, which the plea I have been combating (and which I thought it neceſſary to bring to view, as the beſt that could be urged) ſeems much better calculated to plunge us into, than bring us out of, is, the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſmall effect which the greateſt waſte that can be conceived to have been made within any compaſs of time, by injudicious projects, can have had on the ſum of proſperity, even in the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe whoſe opinion is moſt unfavourable to projectors, in compariſon of the effect which,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:030057_0126_0FE41BF11B0CE570"/>within the ſame compaſs of time, muſt have been produced by <hi>prodigality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the two cauſes, and only two cauſes, which you mention, as contributing to retard the accumulation of national wealth, as far as the conduct of individuals is concerned, projecting, as I obſerved before, is the one, and prodigality is the other: but the detriment, which ſociety can receive even from the concurrent efficacy of both theſe cauſes, you repreſent, on ſeveral oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, as inconſiderable; and if I do not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehend you, too inconſiderable, either to need, or to warrant, the interpoſition of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to oppoſe it. Be this as it may with regard to projecting and prodigality taken together, with regard to prodigality at leaſt, I am certain I do not miſapprehend you. On this ſubject you ride triumphant, and chaſtiſe the "imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence and preſumption of kings and miniſters," with a tone of authority, which it required a courage like yours to venture upon, and a genius like yours to warrant a man to aſſume (b. II. ch. iii. vol. ii. p. 27. edit. 8vo. 1784.) After
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:030057_0127_0FE41BF31670A8D0"/>drawing the parallel between private thrift and public profuſion, "It is" (you conclude) "the higheſt impertinence and preſumption, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in kings and miniſters <hi>to pretend to watch over the economy of private people,</hi> and to reſtrain their expence, either by ſumptuary laws, or by prohibiting the importation of foreign luxuries. They are themſelves always, and without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the greateſt ſpendthrifts in the ſociety. Let them look well after their own expence, and they may ſafely truſt private people with theirs. If their own extravagance does not ruin the ſtate, that of their ſubjects never will."</p>
               <p>That the employing the expedients you mention for reſtraining prodigality, is indeed generally, perhaps even without exception, improper, and in many caſes even ridiculous, I agree with you; nor will I here ſtep aſide from my ſubject to defend, from that imputation, another mode ſuggeſted in a former part of theſe papers. But however preſumptuous and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent it may be for the ſovereign to attempt in any way to check, by legal reſtraints, the <hi>prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:030057_0128_0FE41BF4BB835230"/>of individuals; to attempt to check their <hi>bad management</hi> by ſuch reſtraints ſeems abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more ſo. To err in the way of prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality is the lot, though, as you well obſerve, not of <hi>many</hi> men, in compariſon of the whole maſs of mankind, yet at leaſt of <hi>any</hi> man: the ſtuff fit to make a prodigal of is to be found in every ale-houſe, and under every hedge. But even to <hi>err</hi> in the way of projecting is the lot only of the privileged few. Prodigality, though not ſo common as to make any very material drain from the general maſs of wealth, is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, too common to be regarded as a mark of diſtinction, or as a ſingularity. But the ſtepping aſide from any of the beaten paths of traffic, <hi>is</hi> regarded as a ſingularity, as ſerving to diſtinguiſh a man from other men. Even where it requires no genius, no peculiarity of talent, as where it conſiſts in nothing more than the finding out a new market to buy or ſell in, it requires, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at leaſt, a degree of courage, which is not to be found in the common herd of men. What ſhall we ſay of it, where, in addition to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar quality of courage, it requires the rare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030057_0129_0FE41BF891211220"/>of genius, as in the inſtance of all thoſe ſucceſſive enterprizes by which arts and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures have been brought from their original nothing to their preſent ſplendor? Think how ſmall a part of the community theſe muſt make, in compariſon of the race of prodigals; of that very race, which, were it only on account of the ſmallneſs of its number, would appear too inconſiderable to you to deſerve attention. Yet prodigality is eſſentially and neceſſarily hurtful, as far as it goes, to the opulence of the ſtate: projecting, only by accident. Every prodigal without exception, impairs—by the very ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion impairs—if he does not annihilate, his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But it certainly is not every projector that impairs his: it is not every projector that would have done ſo, had there been none of thoſe wiſe laws to hinder him: for the fabric of national opulence, that fabric of which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, with ſo generous an exultation, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual increaſe, that fabric, in every apartment of which, innumerable as they are, it required the reprobated hand of a projector to lay the firſt ſtone, has required ſome hands at leaſt to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:030057_0130_0FE41BC0A13B56E8"/>and that ſucceſsfully employed. When in compariſon of the number of prodigals, which is too inconſiderable to deſerve notice, the number of projectors of all kinds is ſo much more inconſiderable—and when from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable number, muſt be deducted, the not inconſiderable proportion of ſucceſsful projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors—and from this remainder again, all thoſe who can carry on their projects without need of borrowing—think whether it is poſſible, that this laſt remainder could afford a multitude, the reducing of which would be an object, deſciv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the interpoſition of government by its mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, even taking for granted that it were an object proper in its nature?</p>
               <p>If it be ſtill a queſtion, whether it be worth while for government, by its <hi>reaſon,</hi> to attempt to controul the conduct of men viſibly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably under the dominion of <hi>paſſon,</hi> and acting, under that dominion, contrary to the dictates of their own reaſon: in ſhort, to effect what is acknowledged to be their better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, againſt what every body, even themſelves,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:030057_0131_0FE41BFA82B63AA8"/>would acknowledge to be their worſe; is it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durable that the legiſlator ſhould by violence ſubſtitute his own pretended reaſon, the reſult of a momentary and ſcornful glance, the offspring of wantonneſs and arrogance, much rather than of ſocial anxiety and ſtudy, in the place of the humble reaſon of individuals, bending itſelf with all its force to that very object which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to have in view? Nor let it be forgotten, that, on the ſide of the individual in this ſtrange competition, there is the moſt perfect and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute knowledge and information, which intereſt, the whole intereſt of a man's reputation and fortune, can enſure; on the ſide of the legiſlator, the moſt perfect ignorance. All that he knows, all that he can know, is, that the enterprize is a <hi>project,</hi> which, merely becauſe it is ſuſceptible of that obnoxious name, he looks upon as a ſort of cock; for him, in childiſh wantonneſs, to ſhy at.—Shall the blind lead the blind? is a queſtion that has been put, of old, to indicate the height of folly: but what then ſhall we ſay of him who, being neceſſarily blind, inſiſts on leading, in paths he never trod, thoſe who can ſee?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="unknown:030057_0132_0FE41BFC79F9C048"/>
It muſt be by ſome diſtinction too fine for my conception, if you clear yourſelf from the having taken, on another occaſion, but on the very point in queſtion, the ſide, on which it would be my ambition to ſee you fix.</p>
               <p>"What is the ſpecies of domeſtic induſtry which his capital can employ, and of which the produce is likely to be of the greateſt value, every individual, (you ſay) it is evident, can, in his local ſituation, judge much better than any ſtateſman or lawgiver can do for him. The ſtateſman, who ſhould attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, would not only load himſelf with a moſt unneceſſary attention, but aſſume an authority which could ſafely be truſted, not only to no ſingle perſon, but to no council or ſenate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, and which would no where be ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and preſumption enough to fancy himſelf ſit to exerciſe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="unknown:030057_0133_0FE41BFE772E9A28"/>
"To give the monopoly of the home market to the produce of domeſtic induſtry, in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular art or manufacture, is in ſome meaſure to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, and muſt in almoſt all caſes, be either a uſeleſs or a hurtful regulation." —Thus far you: and I add, to limit the legal intereſt to a rate at which the carriers on of the oldeſt, and beſt eſtabliſhed, and leaſt hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous trades are always glad to borrow, is to give the monopoly of the money market to thoſe traders, againſt the projectors of new ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined trades, not one of which but were it only from the circumſtances of its novelty, muſt, as I have already obſerved, appear more hazardous than the old.</p>
               <p>Theſe, in compariſon, are but inconcluſive topics. I touched upon them merely as afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what appeared to me the only ſhadow of a plea, that could be brought, in defence of the policy I am contending againſt. I come back, therefore, to my firſt ground, and beg you once more to conſider, whether, of all that
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030057_0134_0FE41C01F9CBCAA8"/>hoſt of manufactures, which we both exult in as the cauſes and ingredients of national proſperity, there be a ſingle one, that could have exiſted at firſt but in the ſhape of a project. But, if a regulation, the tendency and effect of which is merely to check projects, in as far as they are projects, without any ſort of tendency, as I have ſhewn, to weed out the bad ones, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible in its preſent ſtate of imperfect efficacy, it ſhould not only have been defenſible, but much more worthy of our approbation, could the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of it have been ſo far ſtrengthened and compleated as to have oppoſed, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, an unſurmountable bar to all ſorts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects whatſoever: that is to ſay, if, ſtretching forth its hand over the rudiments of ſociety, it had confined us, from the beginning, to mud for our habitations, to ſkins for our cloathing, and to acorns for our food.</p>
               <p>I hope you may by this time be diſpoſed to allow me, that we have not been ill ſerved by the projects of time paſt. I have already intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that I could not ſee any reaſon why we
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:030057_0135_0FE41C03DD0A47C8"/>ſhould apprehend our being worſe ſerved by the projects of time future. I will now venture to add, that I think I do ſee reaſon, why we ſhould expect to be ſtill better and better ſerved by theſe projects, than by thoſe. I mean better upon the whole, in virtue of the reduction which experience, if experience be worth any thing, ſhould make in the proportion of the number of the ill-grounded and unſucceſful, to that of the well-grounded and ſucceſsful ones.</p>
               <p>The career of art, the great road which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the footſteps of projectors, may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a vaſt, and perhaps unbounded, plain, beſtrewed with gulfs, ſuch as Curtius was ſwallowed up in. Each requires an human vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim to fall into it 'ere it can cloſe; but when it once cloſes, it cloſes to open no more, and ſo much of the path is ſafe to thoſe who follow. To tie men neck and heels, and throw them into the gulfs I have been ſpeaking of, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether out of the queſtion: but if, at every gulf, a Curtius ſtands mounted and capariſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ready to take the leap, is it for the legiſlator,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:030057_0136_0FE41C05DC8F37E0"/>in a fit of old womaniſh tenderneſs, to pull him away? Laying even public intereſt out of the queſtion, and conſidering nothing but the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of individuals, a legiſlator would ſcarcely do ſo, who knew the value of hope, "the moſt precious gift of heaven."</p>
               <p>Conſider, Sir, that it is not with the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-lottery (that great branch of the project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lottery, for the ſake of which I am deſending the whole, and muſt continue ſo to do until you or ſomebody elſe can ſhew me how to defend it on better terms), it is not, I ſay, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention-lottery, as with the mine-lottery, the privateering lottery, and ſo many other lotteries, which you ſpeak of, and in no inſtance, I think, very much to their advantage. In theſe lines ſucceſs does not, as in this, ariſe out of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ill ſucceſs, and thence propagate itſelf, by a happy contagion, perhaps to all eternity. Let Titius have found a mine, it is not the more eaſy, but by ſo much the leſs eaſy, for Sempro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius to find one too: Let Titius have made a capture, it is not the more eaſy, but by ſo much
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:030057_0137_0FE41C07D52B47F0"/>the leſs eaſy, for Sempronius to do the like. But let Titius have found out a new dye, more bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant or more durable than thoſe in uſe, let him have invented a new and more convenient ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, or a new and more profitable mode of huſbandry, a thouſand dyers, ten thouſand me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanics, a hundred thouſand huſbandmen, may repeat and multiply his ſucceſs: and then, what is it to the public, though the fortune of Titius, or of his uſurer, ſhould have ſunk under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment?</p>
               <p>Birmingham and Sheffield are pitched upon by you as examples, the one of a projecting town, the other of an unprojecting one, (b. I. ch. x. vol. i. p. 176, edit. 8vo. 1784.) Can you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give my ſaying, I rather wonder that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of your own chooſing, did not ſuggeſt ſome ſuſpicions of the juſtice of the conceptions you had taken up, to the diſadvantage of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors. Sheſſield is an old oak: Birmingham, but a muſhroom. What if we ſhould find the muſhroom ſtill vaſter and more vigorous than the oak? Not but the one as well as the other,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:030057_0138_0FE41C0B693174B8"/>at what time ſoever planted, muſt equally have been planted by projectors: for though Tubal Cain himſelf were to be brought poſt from Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia to England to plant Sheffield, Tubal Cain himſelf was as arrant a projector in his day, as ever Sir Thomas Lombe was, or biſhop Blaiſe: but Birmingham, it ſeems, claims, in common parlance, the title of a projecting town, to the excluſion of the other, becauſe, being but of yeſterday, the ſpirit of project ſmells freſher and ſtronger there than elſewhere.</p>
               <p>When the odious ſound of the word <hi>projector</hi> no longer tingles in your ears, the race of men thus ſtigmatized do not always find you their enemy. Projects, even under the name of "dangerous and expenſive experiments," are repreſented as not unfit to be encouraged, even though monopoly be the means: and the mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly is defended in that inſtance, by its ſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the other inſtances, in which the like means are employed to the like purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="unknown:030057_0139_0FE41C0D4C64A738"/>
"When a company of merchants undertake at their own riſk and expence to eſtabliſh a new trade, with ſome remote and barbarous nation, it may not be unreaſonable (you obſerve) to incorporate them into a joint ſtock company, and to grant them, in caſe of their ſucceſs, a monopoly of the trade for a certain number of years. It is the eaſieſt and moſt natural way, in which the ſtate can recompenſe them, for hazarding a dangerous and expenſive experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which the public is afterwards to reap the benefit. A temporary monopoly of this kind may be vindicated, upon the ſame principles, upon which a like monopoly of a new machine is granted to its inventor, and that of a new book to its author."</p>
               <p>I have ſometimes been tempted to think that were it in the power of laws to put <hi>words</hi> under proſcription, as it is to put <hi>men,</hi> the cauſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive induſtry might, perhaps, derive ſcarcely leſs aſſiſtance from a bill of attainder againſt the words <hi>project</hi> and <hi>projectors,</hi> than it has derived from the act authorizing the grant of patents.
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030057_0140_0FE41C0F4D31BB38"/>I ſhould add, however, for a time: for even then the envy, and vanity, and wounded pride, of the uningenious herd, would, ſooner or later, infuſe their venom into ſome other word, and ſet it up as a new tyrant, to hover, like its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, over the birth of infant genius, and cruſh it in its cradle.</p>
               <p>You have defended againſt unmerited oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy two claſſes of men, the one innocent at leaſt, the other highly uſeful; the ſpreaders of Engliſh arts in foreign climes, (b. IV. ch. 8. vol. ii. p. 514. <hi>et alibi,</hi> edit. 8vo. 1784.) and thoſe whoſe induſtry exerts itſelf in diſtributing that neceſſary commodity, which is called by the way of eminence, the ſtaff of life. May I flatter myſelf with having ſucceeded at laſt in my endeavours, to recommend to the ſame powerful protection, two other highly uſeful and equally perſecuted ſets of men, uſurers and projectors.—Yes—I will, for the moment at leaſt, indulge ſo flattering an idea: and, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of it, leaving uſurers, for whom I have ſaid enough already, I will conſider myſelf as
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:030057_0141_0FE41C114BD2F658"/>joined now with you in the ſame commiſſion, and thinking with you of the beſt means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the projector from the load of diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement laid on him by theſe laws, in ſo far as the preſſure of them falls particularly upon him. In my own view of the matter, indeed, no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, no middle courſe, is either neceſſary or proper: the only perfectly effectual, is the only perfectly proper remedy,—a ſpunge. But, as nothing is more common with mankind, than to give oppoſite receptions, to concluſions flowing with equal neceſſity from the ſame principle, let us accommodate our views to that contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</p>
               <p>According to this idea, the object, as far as confined to the preſent caſe, ſhould be, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, in favour of projectors only, a diſpenſation from the rigour of the anti-uſurious laws: ſuch, for inſtance, as is enjoyed by perſons engaged in the carrying trade, in virtue of the indulgence given to loans made on the footing of <hi>reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia</hi> or bottomry. As to abuſe, I ſee not why the danger of it ſhould be greater in this
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:030057_0142_0FE41C13C2ABAB88"/>caſe than in thoſe. Whether a ſum of money be embarked, or not embarked, in ſuch or ſuch a new manufacture on land, ſhould not, in its own nature, be a fact much more difficult to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, than whether it be embarked, or not embarked, in ſuch or ſuch a trading adventure by ſea: and, in the one caſe as in the other, the payment of the intereſt, as well as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment of the principal, might be made to depend upon the ſucceſs of the adventure.</p>
               <p>If the leading-ſtring is not yet thought tight enough, boards of controul might be inſtituted to draw it tighter. Then opens a ſcene of vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and intrigue: waſte of time conſumed in courting the favour of the members of the board: waſte of time, in opening their underſtandings, clenched, perhaps, by ignorance, at any rate, by diſdain and ſelf-ſufficiency, and vanity, and pride: the favour (for pride will make it a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) granted to ſkill in the arts of ſelf-recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and cabal, devoid of inventive merit, and refuſed to naked merit unadorned by prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in thoſe arts: waſte of time on the part of
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:030057_0143_0FE41C15C384C5A8"/>the perſons themſelves engaged in this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent inquiry: waſte of ſomebody's money in paying them for this waſte of time. All theſe may be neceſſary evils, where the money to be beſtowed is public money: how idle, where it is the party's own! I will not plague you, nor myſelf, with enquiring of whom ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this board of nurſes to grown gentlemen: were it only to cut the matter ſhort, one might name at once the Committee of the Society of Arts. There you have a body of men ready trained in the conduct of enquiries, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble that in queſtion, in every circumſtance, but that which renders it ridiculous: the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or repreſentatives of this democratic body would be as likely, I take it, to diſcharge ſuch a truſt with fidelity and ſkill, as any ariſtocracy that could be ſubſtituted in their room.</p>
