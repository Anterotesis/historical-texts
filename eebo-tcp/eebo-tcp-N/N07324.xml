            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ADDRESS To the Principal INHABITANTS of the BRITISH NORTH-AMERICAN Colonies. On Occaſion of the PEACE.</head>
            <p>SIRS, As the long-deſired Time is at length arrived, when the Bleſſings of Peace are happily reſtored, and his Majeſty's American Dominions inlarged and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; give me leave (ſo far as relates to my particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) to lay before you ſome Obſervations, which may tend to the continued Security of the Colonies which you inhabit; as well as to the proper Improvement and Progreſs of true Chriſtianity, in the ſeveral Diſtricts of Britiſh America.</p>
            <p>The general Truths, relative to theſe important Subjects, are delivered in the following Diſcourſe. The Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which I beg Leave to offer in this Addreſs, are ſuch as more particularly relate to yourſelves. And as you are the firſt great Barrier, on which your Mother-Country muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend for the Security of her Colonies, every Conſideration which can add new Motives to your well-directed Zeal, though they more immediately affect Yourſelves, yet in the End they muſt touch the Intereſts of our common Country.</p>
            <p>As true Chriſtianity cannot be either propagated or eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, but on the Principles of Chriſtian Liberty; let me firſt, with all due Reſpect and Freedom lay before you the peculiar Reaſons, on which You, above all the Inhabitants of the Earth, ought to be zealous in eſtabliſhing the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Principles of religious Freedom.</p>
            <p>In the following Diſcourſe you will ſee a general Sketch of the gradual Decline of religious Liberty, from that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which it juſtly boaſted in the firſt Ages of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This Decline ended in it's total Extinction; which was in Time followed by its imperfect Revival, in the Days of LUTHER. In Europe, the Conſequence of theſe Events hath been, that the ſeveral Sects of Chriſtians diſſenting from the eſtabliſhed Religion of their reſpective Countries, aroſe in ſmall Numbers of Men: Hence, although mutual Diſlike hath been too general among the ſeveral Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Chriſtians; yet the naſcent Sects have been but ſeldom of Force to controul the leading Spirit of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Religion; which hath generally been of Power to
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:009356_0003_103214D4B7306B00"/>
overbear them by its legal Eſtabliſhment. Thus, both the public Peace, and many good Effects of Religion (though even in ſome Degree intolerant) have been in Part main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, though the true Spirit of religious Freedom hath been but little attended to. The Religion of the Country though imperfect, hath ſtill been able to co-operate with the Wiſdom of the State; and hence, at leaſt a canſiſtent Syſtem of Policy hath ariſen.</p>
            <p>But on the Continent of Britiſh AMERICA, the Matter hath been quite otherwiſe. For here, the ſeveral Colonies, though united under one common King and Country, were from their very firſt Eſtabliſhment inhabited by Chriſtians of various Denominations, divided in Principle and Opinion; ſome of them driven from their Country by this very Want of Religious Freedom; and all of them but too much taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame intolerant Spirit which they ſo juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in others; on an Equality with Reſpect to Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Power; and too generally poſſeſſed, I fear, with ſuch a mutual Diſlike and Jealouſy, as muſt ever retard many pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Meaſures which may reſpect the common Good of All; unleſs the genuine Spirit of Chriſtian Liberty ſhall at length unite them in the perfect Bonds of Charity and mutual Love. Hence, then, ariſes a peculiar Argument, on which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the American Colonies ſhould zealouſly adopt the generous Principles of Religious Freedom; becauſe that uncharitable Diſunion and Diſlike, which, in the European Countries, may not affect the public Meaſures, muſt inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, in the American Colonies, where the contending reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Intereſts are nearly equal, be attended with Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which are bad; may poſſibly be attended with Conſequences that are fatal.</p>
            <p>Hence then ariſes a powerful Argument for your putting on the Spirit of Moderation, and the Adoption of religious Liberty; without which, even the temporal Intereſts of the Colonies muſt be often obſtructed; without which, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and out-lying Parts of the Britiſh Settlements muſt be doomed to live in Ignorance and Error; and without which the native Indians muſt either continue in their preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable State of Idolatry, Cruelty and Vice; or muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your moſt dangerous Enemies, by the Adoption of the Principles of Popery.</p>
            <p>And this naturally leads me to lay before you the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Circumſtances which attend your Situation with reſpect to the Popiſh Settlements which lie contiguous to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:009356_0004_103214D63A9A4220"/>
ones; and to point out the Dangers that may and muſt ariſe from that Quarter, unleſs a true Spirit of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Liberty and Zeal unite and animate you to the effectual Civilization and Converſion of your native Indian Allies.</p>
            <p>And here, you will firſt pardon me, if I obſerve, that though a narrow, intolerant, and perſecuting Spirit hath too frequently been found among the ſeveral Proteſtant Churches; yet this falſe Zeal is not attended with the ſame Eagerneſs for the Converſion of others, as is found in the Roman Church. The Reaſon of this Difference lies here: That the Principle of Intolerance and Perſecution ariſes in the Church of Rome from a conſiſtent Principle and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that there is no Salvation beyond the Pale of their Communion. This Principle no Proteſtant holds: and therefore the falſe Zeal of a perſecuting or intolerant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant hath not the ſame Foundation, nor is therefore at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the ſame ſteady Conſequences, with that which is built on the Popiſh Faith. The perſecuting Zeal of the Papiſt is founded in Principle; and therefore urges on to Converſion from a Motive of Charity: The perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Zeal of a Proteſtant is only founded in Paſſion; and therefore goes no farther than as it is urged by the Motive of Diſlike<note n="†" place="bottom">As this may be thought not altogether conſiſtant with what is ſaid in p. 15 of the following Diſcourſe; it may be proper to obſerve, that the Principle of Perſecution there mentioned, is called "the ſame" with that of Popery, with Reſpect to ſuch Conſequences only as ariſe from Diſlike.</note> Hence the Popiſh Colonies will always out-do the Proteſtant, in the Converſion of Idolators; unleſs theſe laſt be ſtrongly united by the Principles of Chriſtian Liberty, and animated by a generous Zeal for the real Welfare of Mankind.</p>
            <p>In Support of theſe Truths, I have formerly appealed to the State of Popery and Proteſtantiſm on the Continent of America. <q>There the different Genius of theſe two Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems operates with Univerſality and Power. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are zealous, watchful and aſſiduous; the Proteſtants are cold, indifferent and neglectful. The Spaniards, in Courſe of Time, will have converted one half of the vaſt ſouthern Continent, and murdered the other. The French joyn Policy to Zeal; or rather, make Zeal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to Policy. They reaſon, they perſuade, they cajole, they terrify the poor Indian Nations; and by every Means of Truth and Falſehood, draw them over to their Party. The Conduct of the Engliſh is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:009356_0005_103214D835BF79C8"/>
of all this. Doubtleſs, many of our Miſſionaries are worthy Men: But it muſt be acknowledged, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Effect and Defect of the Proteſtant Syſtem, that they are not generally impelled by Zeal, but compelled by Neceſſity, to viſit theſe remote and inhoſpitable Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In the mean Time, the Inhabitants of our Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are, like ourſelves, too generally given up to Views of Gain and Pleaſure: Thus Popery advances with dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Strides, while Proteſtantiſm lies immerſed in Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Sleep<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſtimate, &amp;c. Vol. II. p. 143.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Leſt this ſhould be regarded as an aggravated Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; give me leave to ſubjoin a ſtrong Confirmation of the whole, contained in a Letter from an Officer in North-America, directed to Mr. Davis, Bookſeller, in Holbourne; and dated December 1758.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>"I Have read two Volumes, intituled, an Eſtimate of the Manners and Principles of the Times; and as I think I have received Improvement by them. I offer the Author my grateful Acknowledgments. But this is not the chief Motive which leads me to trouble you with this Letter. In Vol. II. Part II. Section 4. this Writer ſeems to me to have developed this Subject with ſo much Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, and ſound Reaſoning, and thrown ſo alarming a Light upon it, that if it has not, or ſhould not rouſe the Attention of his Countrymen in general, and of thoſe in particular who ſuperintend the public Welfare, it will be a melancholy Demonſtration, that he hath not coloured his Picture up to the Life. As my Abſence from my native Country for ſome Years has deprived me of the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of knowing many Facts this Writer aſſerts, though from a Credibility of his Evidence, and a Variety of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, my Faith is not a wavering one; ſo my Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Situation in this Part of the World hath enabled me to ſtrengthen the Proof of his Subject in the above Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I mean with regard to the Growth and Influence of Popery over the North American Indians: and it is the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Fact, and the very important Conſequences of it, which prevailed upon me to offer to this excellent Author, additional Evidence to the Truth and Weight of his Reaſoning. Throughout North America the Engliſh have but one Chapel, and but one Miſſionary amongſt the Indians. The former is ſeldom opened, and the Zeal of
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:009356_0006_103214DA50BC5CE0"/>
the latter ſeems confined to his Penſion or Salary, from the Society in London. The French have many Indian Chapels, and a great Number of very able and zealous Miſſionaries. Our Indian Intereſt hath been for Years de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſing—The French increaſing. Though on our Side the Want of a religious Attention to the Indians, or in other Words, of a religiouſly-politic Conduct towards them, has not been the only Inſtance of our Miſconduct: yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it hath been the moſt fatal Inſtance. To the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly-politic Meaſures of the French towards the Indians, is the Increaſe of their Intereſt among them almoſt owing. Without a Superiority of Indian Intereſt, the French could neither have extended nor maintained thoſe Encroachments in this Part of the World, which occaſioned the preſent War. A conſiderable Number of the Indians are attached to the Intereſt of the French by the Ties of Religion only; and this to ſuch a Degree, that they are themſelves Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries amongſt other Indians. Theſe Papiſt Indians have catched the perſecuting and intolerant Spirit of Popery, and wage War againſt the Engliſh upon the inveterate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of that blood-ſhedding Perſuaſion, which is kept up and heightened by the infernal Applauſe of their Prieſts. The ſuperſtitious and diabolical Spirit of Popery, by the unrighteous Acts and indefatigable Zeal of their Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is extending itſelf amongſt the Indians in general, and is, I fear, too powerful for any merely political Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ours towards thoſe People to reſiſt. Without a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Indian Intereſt to the French, the Britiſh Colonies, though they were environed by the ancient Wall of China, and their numerous Troops, may poſſibly be penetrated and ſubdued by theſe American Taters<note n="‡" place="bottom">Taters ſignifies Rovers.</note>; and the Event, under the Influence of French Ambition and Popiſh perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Principles, would be infinitely more fatal. The Start Popery hath got over the Indians, and its peculiar Advantages, eſpecially with reſpect to theſe Savages, over the utmoſt Efforts of Proteſtantiſm, renders it very dubious, whether a religiouſly-politic Conduct in the Engliſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe People will be able to throw the Ballance of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Intereſt into our Scale. Hence a Queſtion ariſes, Whether any Thing leſs than an abſolute Conqueſt of the French in North-America can ſecure the Britiſh Dominions there? Some Papers have been tranſmitted to England, which may probably be offered to the Peruſal of the Public.

Moſt of theſe Strictures, with ſome others, would have had Place in thoſe Papers, but the Author thought they did not come within his Plan: if Leiſure and other Circumſtances ſhould conſpire, thoſe may make a Part of ſome future Publication.

            <p>As this Gentleman hints at ſome further Publications on this important Subject, it were much to be wiſhed, that he would fulfil his ſalutary Purpoſe; and if this Addreſs ſhould be ſo fortunate as to reach his Notice, whether in Europe or America, I beg Leave to call upon him, in the Name of his Country, to do this public Service; which may tend ſtill farther to open the Eyes of every Briton, on a Subject upon which the future Security of our North-American Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and therefore of Great-Britain herſelf will depend.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, till more enlarged Evidences may ariſe, it happens to be in my Power to corroborate this Gentleman's Obſervations, by the concurrent Teſtimony of Captain Schomberg, another Officer, now in England.</p>
            <p>It appears, by authentic Letters which I have ſeen in this Gentleman's Poſſeſſion, that, at the Beginning of the late War, the French had eſtabliſhed an able Miſſionary, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur MAILLARD, in Acadia, with the Title of Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car. This Perſon, after making himſelf Maſter of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and aſſimilating his Manners to thoſe of the Natives, preached the Roman Catholic Faith among them; and by removing his Habitation from one Place to another, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Maſs and adminiſtered the Sacrament to more than ten Tribes of Indians, whom by theſe Means he had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abſolutely over to his Command. His Influence among them was ſo great, that in Reality he ſtood in the Place of his Maſter, the French King: a Circumſtance which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confirmed by the following Fact; that Captain Schomberg (then Lieutenant in the 40th Regiment) having been ſent into Acadia by General Whitmore, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Language of the Country, gained Mr. Mail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard to the Intereſts of Great-Britain; and ſolely through his Influence and Authority brought over theſe numerous Tribes of Savages, from being the Enemies, to be the Friends of our Country<note n="*" place="bottom">The Author with Pleaſure lays hold of this Opportunity of doing a Piece of Juſtice to Captain Schomberg; who with a Zeal uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in a young Officer, brought over theſe Indian Tribes to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Great-Britain, at a Time when they were our moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Enemies. This he effected at a conſiderable Expence, as well as Fatigue and Hazard, to himſelf. Yet, through the Death of General Whitmore, and ſome other unfortunate Incidents, he never hath been re-imburſed; nor hath ever had any Acknowledgment, for this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice done to his Country. This Fact is made public, not with a View of blaming any one; but ſolely in Hope, that ſome noble-minded Perſon, who may have Power and Inclination, may alſo have the Opportunity or redreſſing ſo uncommon a Grievance,</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="unknown:009356_0008_103214DE26F08950"/>
From theſe inconteſtable Facts, then, it appears, what a zealous and active Enemy you have to oppoſe, in the Papiſt Miſſionaries who have been long and powerfully diſperſed among the Indian Tribes; and who, you may depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, will continue their unweary'd Endeavours, to bring them over to the Principles of the Roman Church.</p>
            <p>Let me now conclude with another Circumſtance of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which muſt not be omitted here. Before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the late War, the Principles and Miniſters of Popery, though near, yet were not mixed with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of Great-Britain. But by the Terms of Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both at Quebec and Montreal, the Roman Catholic Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is tolerated in the ſeveral Settlements conquered from the Crown of France. The Conſequence of this muſt be, a frequent Intercourſe and Communication of Proteſtants with Bapiſts; a Circumſtance ſo pregnant with Danger, ſuppoſing Zeal on the one Part, and Remiſſneſs on the other, that I think it were needleſs to enlarge upon it, in order to rouze you into Caution.</p>
            <p>What, then, is the proper Part for the Inhabitants of our Colonies to act, under Circumſtances ſo delicate and important? Extirpation, or even Perſecution, the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our Excellent Religion, as well as the Humanity of our Manners, and the good Faith of our Politics, do abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely fobid: Nothing therefore is left for you to do, but to combat falſe Zeal with Zeal which is according to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: to be united and firm in maintaining, in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, in eſtabliſhing the great and eſſential Principles of Chriſtianity, throwing off the Sin which may ſo eaſily beſet you, that of too great Eagerneſs and unchriſtian Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, about thoſe ſecondary and incidental Differences of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which ſeem to divide you into various Sects, while you all rejoyce in one common Day, which the glorious Light of the Goſpel hath ſpread over the Britiſh Dominions.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſalutary, great, and glorious Purpoſes, the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Colleges in America can alone thoroughly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:009356_0009_103214DFAAEDE228"/>
For in the firſt Place, the frequent Communication and Intercourſe, which this Eſtabliſhment will naturally create among Proteſtants of every Denomination in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, will of Courſe tend to wear off that mutual Diſlike, which often ariſes, and is always increaſed, by that Diſtance and Reſerve which different Sects of Religion commonly maintain towards each other. By theſe Means you will often find your Principles the ſame, where you before thought they had differed: By theſe Means, you will often find you have wiſhed each other well, when both Parties ſuſpected the contrary.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, the ſtrong and powerful Eſtabliſhment of American Colleges can alone effectually produce the ſecond great End above explained; I mean the counter-working the Deſigns of Popery, and the Civilization and Converſion of the ſavage Indians. While Things remain in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Situation, there is no Probability that ever a ſufficient Number of able and zealous Labourers will inliſt in this diſcouraging Vineyard. Men bred up in the diſtant and alluring Climate of Great-Britain, will never be fond of quitting their native Country, in queſt of unknown and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Service: But when Seminaries ſhall be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Spot, for this important Purpoſe; the youthful Minds, there formed to this End, will take their bent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: They will be early taught to regard this as their peculiar Province and Deſtination; and hence, with due Encouragements given, will proceed with Zeal to their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Taſk; and in the End, where the rank Weeds of Violence and Idolatry now abound, will plant and reap a noble Harveſt of true Religion and Virtue.</p>
            <p>Pleaſe to accept theſe Obſervations, as a ſincere though imperfect Teſtimony of that Reſpect with which</p>
