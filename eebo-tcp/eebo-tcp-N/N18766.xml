            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I. Chriſt has great love for little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. He takes as much notice of them, and has as much kindneſs for them, as for any. How kindly and lovingly did he treat theſe children who were brought to him. He did not chide them for coming. He would not let them go, till he had taken them up into his arms, put his hands upon them, prayed for them, and given them his bleſſing. His words and his actions towards them were full of love and tenderneſs.</p>
            <p>Among the Jews, good men uſed to put their hands upon the heads of their children,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024390_0005_0FC704C42A6F4BE8"/>
and upon others who deſired their bleſſing, and to pray for them. And it has alſo been a pious cuſtom, among chriſtians, for children to aſk their parents bleſſing, and to receive it, kneeling. And though it may not be much practiſed at preſent, yet it ſeems to have been a fit means of cheriſhing, in parents &amp; children, a ſenſe of their duty towards each other. I mention this, that you may better underſtand why theſe children were brought to Chriſt. It was, that he might put his hands upon them and bleſs them.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt's diſciples would have hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their coming, it greatly diſpleaſed him. Such was his love for children that he could not bear to have them ſlighted, or rebuked, when they were coming to him. And he is as much diſpleaſed now with thoſe who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage children from ſeeking the bleſſings of his grace. No man ever had, or ſhewed ſo much love to little children as Chriſt. You have heard what kind words he ſpoke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven. If you had heard him ſpeak theſe words, and then ſeen him take them up in his arms to bleſs them, would it not have affected you? Could you ever have forgotten ſuch expreſſions of love?</p>
            <p>It was for the love he had for children, as well as others, that Chriſt came into the world, and went through much labour and hardſhip, and at laſt died upon the croſs. All this he did to ſave them from the pains of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlaſting
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024390_0006_0FC704C546314420"/>
death, to which they were expoſed, beacuſe of ſin. For alas! we are all ſinners, and have offended God our maker. Our hearts incline to be wicked. We often do, what we ought not, and neglect to do what God has commanded. We are full of evil thoughts. We often ſpeak and act amiſs.—Now, ſin diſpleaſes God, who is angry with the wicked; and the word of God aſſures us, that "The wages of ſin are death." Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as well as others, are ſinners, and ſo muſt be in a ſad condition, unleſs they be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and reconciled to God.</p>
            <p>Though God be merciful and willing to forgive ſinners, upon their repentance, yet none can be delivered from ſin and death without a Saviour. God, in his great mercy, appointed Chriſt, his eternal ſon, to be the ſaviour of men. And ſo great was the love of Chriſt, that he was willing to be the ſaviour, to come into the world, and become a man, to live a life of affliction, and ſuffer the pains of death, for our ſalvation. This ſhews the greatneſs of his love to us. And remember, that Chriſt has done and ſuffered all this for children, as well as others, that they might be ſaved. Parents have great love for their children. You cannot conceive the tender concern they feel for you, when you are in trouble, or in danger. But no parents ever had ſo much love for their deareſt children, or were willing to do and ſuffer ſo much for them, as Chriſt has done.</p>
            <p>When he took fleſh upon him, he ſhewed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024390_0007_0FC704C949A31638"/>
his great love to children, by becoming a child himſelf. He had a deſign herein of ſpecial kindneſs; that he might, from his own experience, have a fellow feeling of the afflictions and infirmities of that tender age; that children might be the more encouraged to carry all their complaints to him, who knows how to pity and comfort them; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering, that himſelf was once a child. Another deſign which Chriſt had, in becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a child like you, was to teach children, by his example, how they ſhould behave.—When you read, that Jeſus increaſed in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and in favour with God and man, this ſhould teach you, that children muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to learn every thing that is good, and behave ſo well, that God and all good men may love them. They ſhould be dutiful and obedient to their parents, as Chriſt was.—They ſhould attend religious duties, in the houſe of God, as well as in private, as the child Jeſus went up to the temple to worſhip with his parents. All this ſhews the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar love of Chriſt to children.</p>
            <p>And though he has left this world, and gone up to heaven, where he reigns over all, upon a glorious throne, he has now the ſame love for children. He does not forget you, though you are ſo apt to forget him. He ſees and takes notice of you by day and night.—He keeps you alive, and in health. He feeds and cloaths you, and gives you all your good things. If he ſend affliction upon you, he means it for your good; as parents, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024390_0008_0FC704CEF7619108"/>
correct children, when they are wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in hopes it will do them good. When your friends are kind to you, it <hi>is Chriſt, who puts it into their hearts.</hi> He alſo takes care, that you have all the good inſtruction you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the word of God, from good books, and from your friends, that you may know what you muſt do to be ſaved. And if you get good by the inſtructions, which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, if ever you feel any deſire to forſake ſin, and become religious, it is Chriſt, who by his grace, has given this turn to your minds, and made you ſenſible of the wiſdom and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of remembering your creator, in the days of your youth. And now Chriſt is in heaven, he is preparing a place, for thoſe little ones, who belong to him, who love, and obey him.</p>
            <p>Ought you not, then, dear children, to give Chriſt your hearts and endeavor to pleaſe him? When children are wicked, they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſe Chriſt. But when they love him, and ſtrive to do, as he commands, to learn that which is good, to obey their parents, to worſhip God, and behave themſelves, as Chriſt did, when he was a child; and if they offend are ſorry for it, beg forgivneſs for Chriſt's ſake, and are careful to do ſo no more, this is pleaſing to him, and he loves them the more. If Chriſt were here in the world, would you not wiſh to go to him, to ſee him, to hear him ſpeak, to be acquainted with him, inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, and become his diſciples?—I have then ſomething to tell you, which you
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024390_0009_0FC704D029EC2998"/>
have great reaſon to hearken to with joy and thankfulneſs: And that is,</p>
            <p>II. <hi>That Chriſt would have little children come to him.</hi> This you may remember was the <hi>ſecond obſervation</hi> on the text.</p>
            <p>You have heard that Chriſt was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with his diſciples, when they would have hindred thoſe little children who were coming to him. 'Let them come,' ſays he, 'and forbid them not.' And it is now his will, that children ſhould come to him, and he is as free as ever to receive and bleſs them. He would have parents <hi>bring</hi> their little babes who cannot come themſelves. Theſe he would have brought, and given to him in baptiſm. It is his will, that children come, and give <hi>themſelves</hi> to him, as ſoon as they are capable. Parents ſhould teach and encourage their children, lead and guide them to Chriſt, that they may know him, become acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, and receive his bleſſing. Chriſt now invites you all to come, and would receive you as gladly as ever a kind parent took up his little child, that went to him.</p>
            <p>But it may be aſked, how ſhall we come to Chriſt, now he is in heaven, and we upon earth?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, though our bodies cannot come to his body, now he is in heaven, and we upon earth, yet we may go to him with our minds, and hearts, by thinking of him, believing on him, loving him, ſeeking inſtruction from his word, conſenting, heartily, to have him for
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024390_0010_0FC704D284687AA0"/>
our Saviour, to obey his commands, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his diſpoſal; truſting in his promiſes, and hoping for pardon and the favor of God, only, for the ſake of his merits. If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is ſuch a perſon as the ſcriptures declare him to be, if you deſire and ſeek Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from him, as he encourages and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects you; this is coming to him with <hi>your hearts,</hi> this is what he calls and invites you to do. And he is willing to ſave every one of you, from ſin and ruin, if you thus look to him for it.</p>
            <p>But that you may underſtand what it is to come to Chriſt in a right manner, and as he would have you do, I will endeavor to inſtruct <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ou, as plainly as I can in a few words.</p>
            <p>You muſt be ſenſible that you are ſinners, that as ſuch the great God is very angry with you, and you muſt be forever undone, if you die without being forgiven, and reconciled to him.</p>
            <p>You muſt be convinced, that Chriſt <hi>only</hi> can ſave you from ſin, and everlaſting deſtruction, and make your peace with God, that he is <hi>able</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to ſave all, who deſire and ſeek Salvation from him, as it is offered in the goſpel.</p>
            <p>You muſt be ſenſible, that you can <hi>do noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for which you can <hi>deſerve,</hi> that God ſhould ſhew you mercy, pardon your ſins, and ſave your ſouls, that you are not <hi>able</hi> of <hi>yourſelves</hi> to change your wicked hearts, and make your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good—that if you are pardoned and ſaved, it muſt be for the ſake of Chriſts merit

and his interceding for you with God; and that he by his grace muſt incline your hearts to love and fear God, and keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. You muſt not therefore depend upon your own righteouſneſs and ſtrength for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but on the righteouſneſs and grace of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>You muſt be truly willing and deſirous to have Chriſt for your Saviour, to be taught by his word and ſpirit and to own him as your maſter and Lord, to govern and keep you from ſin and danger, and bring you ſafely to heaven. You muſt give yourſelves <hi>wholly</hi> to him, and to God, through him; heartily ſorrowing for all your ſins, and reſolving with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay to forſake them all, and to do your duty to God and man; hoping for <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> and <hi>acceptance,</hi> through the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>merit</hi> of Chriſt. This muſt be your ſteady reſolution and endeavor, as long as you live.</p>
            <p>In this manner Chriſt would have all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren come to him, as ſoon as they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And they are capable, as ſoon as they have underſtanding to receive inſtruction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their <hi>need</hi> of a ſaviour, and that Chriſt is <hi>able</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to ſave them, upon their ſeeking Salvation from him, according to the goſpel.</p>
            <p>The diſpleaſure Chriſt expreſſed at thoſe, who would have kept children away from him, ſhews, that it was his will, that they ſhould come. He plainly expreſſed his <hi>will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs</hi> when he ſaid "Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not." His
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024390_0012_0FC704D639BAEA58"/>
coming into the world, and doing and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much to ſave them, from the pains of everlaſting death, is a clear proof, that he would <hi>moſt willingly</hi> have them come, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the bleſſings of grace, which he has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for children, as well as others, with his <hi>precious blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should not parents then be concerned to be <hi>workers together, with Chriſt,</hi> for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their children, by training them up in the way wherein they ſhould go, by praying with and for them, and leading them by their example, that ſo they may be the inſtruments of guiding and leading them <hi>to Chriſt, that they may be bleſſed in him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ought you not, my dear children, to give yourſelves up, moſt freely, to the kind and moſt merciful Saviour who would have you come to him, that you may have everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, and is waiting with open arms, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and bleſs you?</p>
            <p>Will you ſlight and diſobey the invitation of him, who only can ſave you? If any of you ſhould perſiſt in refuſing him, and the grace and mercy he offers, you will be miſerable creatures. How ſhall we eſcape, if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſo great ſalvation!</p>
            <p>But if you will receive, and give yourſelves to Chriſt and ſubmit to him, as your teacher, your Lord, and Saviour, now in the days of your youth, you will be happy forever. God, and Chriſt, and angels, and good men, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice over, and love you. You ſhall want nothing that is for your real good. You ſhall
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024390_0013_0FC704D87B7E83B8"/>
find more <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> in ſerving God than in all the <hi>pleaſures</hi> which ſin or the world can give. You ſhall be happy in <hi>life</hi> and in <hi>death,</hi> and you cannot conceive how great your happineſs will be in heaven, after this life is ended.</p>
            <p>Remember, that <hi>now</hi> is the <hi>accepted time,</hi> and day of Salvation. You muſt not delay <hi>one day</hi> or <hi>moment.</hi> If you do not <hi>now</hi> come to a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>hearty</hi> reſolution to hear the voice of Chriſt, in his word, and give yourſelves up to God through him, I fear greatly that I have loſt my labor, and done you no good.—"O that you were wiſe to conſider your latter end," and "that you would know, in this your day, the things which belong to your peace." You know that children may die, as well as others. And if any of you ſhould die, without an intereſt in Chriſt, and before your peace is made with God, my heart akes to think what muſt become of you. <hi>To day,</hi> then if you will hear the voice of Chriſt, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> your hearts. Seek the Lord while he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be found, call upon him, while he is nea<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>I might further preſs the exhortation from the conſideration of thoſe <hi>vows</hi> and <hi>bonds</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which, I ſuppoſe, the moſt of you have been laid in your baptiſm, when the token of your intereſt in the covenant, and of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing members of the church, was put upon you. This is a good reaſon, why children ſhould come to Chriſt. It is the reaſon which Chriſt himſelf has given—"Suffer little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024390_0014_0FC704E180EAF470"/>
to come to me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven—But this brings us to the <hi>third obſervation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. <hi>Little children belong to the kingdom of heaven.</hi>—There will be no need of arguing this point after Chriſt himſelf has affirmed it. He is a faithful and true witneſs.</p>
            <p>It gives me <hi>joy,</hi> and may well fill you with <hi>wonder</hi> and <hi>thankfulneſs,</hi> that Chriſt has aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured you, that children belong to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven.</p>
            <p>If we underſtand by the kingdom of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, the <hi>ſtate of the bleſſed after this life is ended,</hi> little children are capable of enjoying the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of heaven, and many of them are heirs of this bleſſedneſs. Young babes will go to heaven as well as older people. And ſo may children of ſome age and underſtanding, ſuch as you are. Some good thing was found in young Abijah; and Joſiah, while he was yet young, began to ſeek God. And many while they were very young, have been lovely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of early piety. You may read an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſeveral of theſe in the <hi>Token for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> and other books. Now ſuch as are good, however young they may be, are heirs of the <hi>kingdom of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or if the kingdom of heaven be underſtood to mean the <hi>viſible church</hi> (which I take to be the meaning of the word in our text) it is ſtill true, that children belong to the church, as well as their parents. God has taken them into his covenant, and therefore they are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024390_0015_0FC704E4A4084228"/>
and are to be watched over by the church, that they be not drawn into wicked practices, but taught to know and fear and ſerve God. They are bound to this by the covenant God has put them under, and by their baptiſm, in which they are given to God, and Chriſt to be his ſervants.</p>
            <p>And as it is a ſpecial favor for you to have been born members of the church, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the kingdom of heaven upon earth, this is a ſpecial reaſon why you ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to come and freely give up yourſelves to Chriſt, and to God through him, now you are grown to ſome meaſure of capacity and underſtanding in things of religion. God's covenant, which you are under, binds you to him. You are of the number of his people, and planted in his vineyard. It is required and expected that you ſhould be an example to thoſe whom he has not thus taken into the number of his covenant people, and admitted as members of his church. It will be a ſad aggravation of the wickedneſs of children, when they forſake their fathers' God, after they have been laid under the bonds of the covenant, and have had greater advantages than others for knowing and ſerving him. God will be more diſpleaſed with ſuch, and deal more ſeverely with them, than with thoſe who have not been ſo favored by him. Such wicked children of the kingdom will be caſe out into outer darkneſs, and heaten with many ſtripes. "For to whom much is given, of them ſhall much be required."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:024390_0016_0FC704E5E5CF3EB8"/>
But it ſhould alſo be ſeriouſly conſidered, that children who belong to the church, have ſpecial encouragement to come to Chriſt for the bleſſings of grace, to ſeek their father's God, and devote themſelves to him. Special encouragements are propoſed to early ſeeking—"They who ſeek me early ſhall find me." The children of the covenant may plead this their relation to God, in their prayers to him, for his converting grace. "Turn thou me and I ſhall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God." And there are many promiſes in the word of God, which expreſs his gracious purpoſe of ſhewing ſpecial favor and mercy to ſuch children as are in covenant with him: that he will give them a new heart: that he will circumciſe their hearts to love him: that he will pour his ſpirit and bleſſing upon them. Theſe promiſes give you great reaſon to hope, that your ſeeking the Lord will not be in vain—"He hath not ſaid to the ſeed of Jacob, the children of the covenant, ſeek ye me in vain." And though theſe promiſes do not make it certain that all ſuch children ſhall have their hearts inclined to love and ſerve God, yet theſe promiſes make it certain, that God will beſtow his ſpecial, converting, ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying grace on the children of the church. And as you are of that number, you have ſpecial reaſon to hope and ſeek for it.</p>
            <p>Should not this encourage your hopes, and enliven your endeavors, in ſeeking ſuch great and neceſſary bleſſings when come ſo near to you? God forbid, that any of you ſhould
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024390_0017_0FC704E774BE6160"/>
miſs of obtaining ſalvation, after his promiſe has brought it home to your houſe. I know not how to expreſs my love and concern for you better than in the words of king David to his beloved ſon—"My ſon, know thou the God of thy father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and willing mind; for the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou ſeek him he will be ſound of thee, but if thou forſake him, he will caſt thee off forever."</p>
            <p>I have a few things more to mention before I finiſh this head.</p>
            <p>Your being children of the kingdom of heaven is a conſideration which ſhould move you to take care not to keep company with ſuch as are wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For what communion hath light with darkneſs—what fellowſhip can the ſervants of Chriſt have with the children of the wicked one? Have no fellowſhip with the works of darkneſs, nor be partakers with other mens ſins; but rather reprove them, and ſo keep yourſelves pure. Be companions of thoſe who fear God. "He that walketh with the wiſe ſhall be wiſe, but a companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed." Again,</p>
            <p>Remember that you are under the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the church. And always receive inſtruction and admonition from miniſters, from parents, and other chriſtian friends, with thankfulneſs and due reſpect. Have an obedient ear for good counſels and reproofs, and make the beſt improvement of them. Further,</p>
            <p>Attend diligently upon thoſe ordinances
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024390_0018_0FC704EEE7AAEC28"/>
which Chriſt has given to the church, for the ſpiritual benefit of its members particularly, ſtudy the word of God which is a ſpecial pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege committed to the church, that you may, as was ſaid of Timothy, know the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from your childhood. They are able to make you wiſe to ſalvation. Attend the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and means of inſtruction in the houſe of God whenever you can, and endeavor to get good by them. And though children are not to come to the Lord's table till they appear to be, in a meaſure, capable and diſpoſed to do this in a pious remembrance of Chriſt, agreeably to the nature and deſign of <hi>this holy ordinance;</hi> yet they ſhould labor after ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments in Chriſtianity as to be prepared to come. And as ſoon as evidence of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, they ſhould no longer delay to offer themſelves, and <hi>aſk to be admitted to the table of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And forget not in your prayers to aſk the bleſſing of Chriſt upon the church of which you are members, and particularly upon your teachers. Yea, I would, in the words of the Apoſtle, beſeech you for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, and for the love of the ſpirit, that you ſtrive together with me in your prayers to God for me.</p>
            <p>Preſume not that your ſtate is ſafe, or that you are intitled to the bleſſedneſs of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of glory, merely becauſe you are children of the kingdom of heaven as outwardly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered upon earth. "Think not to ſay with yourſelves, we have Abraham to our
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024390_0019_0FC704F06A699EC8"/>
father"—This will not avail if we have not the faith, and walk not in the ſteps of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and are not, as he was, "the friends of God." Not every one who ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the will our father who is in heaven. If you continue in the word of Chriſt, then are you his diſciples indeed: and you ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free and happy. But remember that many of the children of the kingdom will be caſt out. To ſuch of them as are workers of iniquity, Chriſt will ſay, I know you not, depart from me. Chriſt has aſſerted your right to the privileges of the church to <hi>encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi> you to <hi>come</hi> to him, but not to <hi>embolden</hi> you to <hi>forſake</hi> him.</p>
            <p>IV. To draw to a cloſe. If you come to Chriſt as you are invited in the goſpel, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his call, and upon the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he holds forth, you ſhall receive his bleſſing. And then you will be bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. This you may remember was the <hi>fourth remark</hi> from the text which was mentioned for your notice and conſideration.</p>
            <p>The ſtory I have been endeavoring to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove for your inſtruction, informs us, that Chriſt took the little children into his arms and bleſſed them. Then might have been ſeen the fulfilment of the words of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſpoken concerning him—"He ſhall gather the lambs in his arms and carry them in his boſom."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:024390_0020_0FC704F1E38D49B0"/>
Happy children! you will ſay, whom Chriſt held in his arms and bleſſed. Yea rather, I would ſay, happy are you, if you hear his voice to day, when he ſpeaks to you from heaven, inviting you to him. For bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are they who have not ſeen him, and yet believe. Bleſſed are they who hear his word and keep it.</p>
            <p>I am not able to repreſent the number and excellency of the bleſſings, he will then beſtow upon you. He will bleſs you, by giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his unſearchable riches to you. He will bleſs you with the pardon of all your ſins, and a right to all the privileges of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. He will bleſs you, in adorning your ſouls with the robes of a perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and with the beauties of holineſs. He will bleſs to you all your bleſſings, and all your troubles. What ſhall I ſay more? He will bleſs you by giving you grace, and glory, and all good things.</p>
            <p>Chuſe you then this day, my dear children, the glorious redeemer for your Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Give him you whole hearts. Come to him. Take his yoke upon you and learn of him, for he is meek and lowly in heart: then you ſhall find reſt to your ſouls. He will be your never failing friend till you die, and then he will come and carry you up to heaven, where you will be happy forever.</p>
            <p>The grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you.</p>

            <head>THE STORY OF JOSEPH.</head>
            <p>IN London there lived a poor ignorant man, named <hi>Joſeph.</hi> It was his employment to go on errands and carry parcels. One day as he paſſed the ſtreets, his attention being excited by muſic, from a neighboring place of worſhip, he drew near and entered.</p>
            <p>It was Dr. Calamy's church. The text was, "this is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief."</p>
            <p>From this paſſage the Dr. preached in the cleareſt manner, the ancient apoſtolic goſpel.</p>
            <p>While the gay and polite audience admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more the <hi>ingenuity,</hi> than the <hi>piety</hi> of the preacher, poor Joſeph, in tattered clothing, fixed his eyes on the Dr. and liſtened with eagerneſs and wonder. After ſervice, as he went homeward, he often ſaid to himſelf "Joſeph never heard this before: Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024390_0023_0FC70501B9AA40B8"/>
like Joſeph; and this is a true and faithful ſaying."</p>
            <p>Not many days after be was taken ſick, with a fever, and often repeated "Joſeph is the chief of ſinners! Joſeph is the chief of ſinners! But Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, and Joſeph loves him for this." Some pious perſons aſked him how he felt in his mind. He anſwered, Joſeph has nothing to ſay for himſelf, only that he is the chief of ſinners, and as Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſuch, why may not Joſeph, after all, be ſaved? A gentleman having found out where Joſeph heard the words, upon which he dwelt with ſo much conſtancy and delight, went and informed Dr. Calamy.</p>
            <p>The Dr. readily haſtened to ſee Joſeph, but found him extremely feeble and low. The inſtant the Dr. ſpoke, he knew his voice, and exclaimed with a trembling tone, "Oh ſir, you are the friend of the Lord Jeſus whom I heard the other day ſpeak ſo well of him, and I love you for what you then ſaid. Joſeph is the chief of ſinners, Jeſus Chriſt has come to ſave ſuch, and why not poor Joſeph? Oh, pray to that Jeſus for me, tell him that Joſeph thinks he loves him, for coming to ſave ſuch ſinners as he is." The Dr. prayed. Joſeph very affectionately thanked him. Then reaching his hand under his pillow, drew from thence an old rag, in which were tied five guineas.</p>
            <p>He thus addreſſed the Dr. looking earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at him, "Joſeph laid up this to keep him
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024390_0024_0FC70503B5CF6400"/>
in his old age. But Joſeph will never ſee old age. Take it and divide it among the poor friends of the Lord Jeſus, and tell them Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph gave it them for his ſake, who came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom he is the chief." Having ſaid this, he inſtantly expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; leaving the world a <hi>memorable proof</hi> of the <hi>efficacy</hi> of the chriſtian religion, and a <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful leſſon</hi> of <hi>humility,</hi> of <hi>love</hi> to the Saviour of men, and of <hi>charity</hi> to his <hi>poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Calamy left this tender ſcene, not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever till he had ſhed many tears over poor Joſeph. He had, in ſo artleſs a manner, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his ſincere <hi>love</hi> to the Lord Jeſus, his <hi>hope</hi> in his <hi>mercy,</hi> and his unaffected <hi>kindneſs</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> to his poor friends, as <hi>quite</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and <hi>melted</hi> the Doctor's <hi>heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He uſed, often, to relate this ſtory, as one of the moſt <hi>affecting occurrences</hi> of his life.</p>
