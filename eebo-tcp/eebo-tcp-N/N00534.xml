            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Apostle, having given the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> divers Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the preceding Verses, closes all with a profession of <hi>Prayer</hi> for them; as well knowing, That all Counsels, or Charges by men, tho'

            <p>He prayes, not only that they may be <hi>Sanctified,</hi> but that they may be <hi>wholly</hi> so; And that the fulness of the Expression [<hi>HOLOTELEIS,</hi> wholly perfectly] may the better appear, He Descends to all the <hi>particulars,</hi> that are in Man; he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the chief Heads of them, which are either <hi>all</hi> that is in Man, or <hi>To which All,</hi> that belongs to Meer Man, may be Referred.

The <hi>words</hi> thus Explained, we come now to view the <hi>parts</hi> of the Text, wherein we have.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Two <hi>Acts.</hi> S<hi>anctification</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Author</hi> of them, <hi>God;</hi> to whom the Prayer is Directed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Modification</hi> of them; <hi>wholly, throughout, continually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Subject,</hi> the <hi>whole man,</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the <hi>Whole</hi> S<hi>pirit, both</hi> S<hi>oul and</hi> B<hi>ody.</hi> And this Last it is, with which (at present) we are mostly concerned.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Whole Man</hi> is sometimes expressed by only two words [S<hi>oul</hi> and B<hi>ody,</hi> or S<hi>pirit</hi> and B<hi>ody</hi>] which are the two phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical, or constituent parts of Man. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20.<hi>Ye are Bought with a price,

                  </gap>
               </hi> in the former. But why here the <hi>whole man</hi> (for 'twas the same to be <hi>preserved</hi> that was to be S<hi>ancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>) why (I say) he should be here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by three particulars, is a matter wherein Expositors do differ, and I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ind these several Interpretations of the place.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some will have S<hi>pirit</hi> and S<hi>oul</hi> to be put <hi>Exegetically;</hi> as if both signified but one and the same thing; one being add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only as Explication of the other; so <hi>Austin.</hi>) But (indeed methinks) this here seems a little harsh, because needless; for S<hi>oul</hi> and B<hi>ody,</hi> or S<hi>pirit</hi> and B<hi>ody</hi> (as it is in the two fore-cited Scriptures) were Intelligible enough to express the two physical constituents of a man. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the particle [<hi>Kl. And,</hi> or rather <hi>Both</hi>] seems to connect Spirit,, <hi>And</hi> Soul, as two things that have some Distinction between them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others will have S<hi>pirit</hi> to signifie the <hi>Mind and Understanding;</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> the W<hi>ill and Affections</hi> (<hi>Calvin, Marlorate,</hi> and divers others) from whom I would not
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000661_0014_0FA99FD96D5B1580"/>
willingly Dissent, and therefore shall not slight their Judgment; yet I must humbly profess, however clear the Notion was to them, it is not so to me; for that which they call S<hi>oul</hi> is as truly S<hi>pirit,</hi> as the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Faculty (the <hi>Intellect.</hi>) Yea, I find the Expressions quite Transverse; As if <hi>Soul</hi> signified the <hi>Intellectual</hi> Faculty and S<hi>pirit</hi> the <hi>Volitive</hi>) in <hi>Mary's</hi> Song. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 46,47. <hi>My Soul doth Magnify the Lord; and my Spirit hath Rejoyced in God my</hi> S<hi>avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> As if she had said; My S<hi>oul,</hi> (that is, my Mind and Understanding) <hi>Doth Magnify</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Has high Thoughts of God, great Estimation of him; which are Acts of the <hi>Intellect,</hi> and the only Internal Magnification of him) And my S<hi>pirit,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> my W<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ll and Affections</hi>) hath Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced (which is their proper Act.) This to me seems more currant, if in this place there be a <hi>Distinction</hi> between S<hi>oul</hi> and S<hi>pirit.</hi> But I will not Assert it, I rather think there is none here; only her Inward Joy of heart, being great; her Outward Expressions thereof in words, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>nlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; Soul and Spirit in a <hi>Pleonasm</hi> signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only her Inner Man. But if S<hi>pirit</hi> here do present us with any <hi>Distinct</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I should take it to be, a <hi>Chearful Frame<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> of</hi> S<hi>pirit,</hi> in which she then was; And then, it will fully fall in with our
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000661_0015_0FA99FDA2F55F350"/>
present Conceptions of the word S<hi>pirit</hi> in our Text, as shall be shewn anon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some will have S<hi>pirit</hi> (in our Text) to signifie the <hi>Higher</hi> Faculties (both <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> and <hi>Will</hi>) the <hi>Rational part</hi> in man; and S<hi>oul,</hi> the Inferiour Faculties common to man with Bruits and Plants (S<hi>ensative, Vigetative,</hi> &amp;c.) This indeed is a common Interpretation. But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it is harsh to Denominate <hi>Mans</hi> S<hi>oul</hi> from the Inferiour Powers (contrary to that <hi>Logical</hi> Rule. <hi>Denomination is from the better part.</hi> Nor do I find in Scripture (to my Remembrance) the word S<hi>oul,</hi> any where else to have this signification. Nor (Lastly) are these Lower Faculties capable of other Sanctification then that of the Body, which is to be but Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the Soul in Holiness; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus to separate S<hi>oul</hi> from S<hi>pirit,</hi> is but to confound it with Body in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of S<hi>anctification</hi> and <hi>Preservation</hi> here spoken of.</p>
            <p>These three forementioned Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I will not Absolutely deny, nor Contend with their Authors about them; Because they all agree well enough in the <hi>General Scope</hi> of the place, which is (be sure) that <hi>all,</hi> that is <hi>In Man</hi> be <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed</hi> to God, However any one part be
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000661_0016_0FA99FDAEDFFF0A0"/>
Distinguished from the other. Yet I am apt to think that a <hi>more Proper</hi> Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be found, which will give a more Full and Edifying sense to the place, then is usually ascribed to it.</p>
            <p>For the Enquiry after this we shall consider to what things the <hi>N</hi>ame of <hi>Spirit</hi> is given in Scripture besides those before mentioned: And this I finde to be, to some things <hi>Out of Man,</hi> and some things <hi>In Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 O<hi>ut of Man</hi> the Word (<hi>Spirit</hi>) is ascribed both to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>God</hi> both Essential and Personal.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Essential,</hi> as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24 <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worship him, &amp;c.</hi> Not that S<hi>pirit</hi> is an <hi>Univocal Genus</hi> of God and any of his Creatures; for then there would be a <hi>Common Nature;</hi> but there is <hi>Infinite Distance</hi> between them: Only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause S<hi>pirit</hi> is the Name of the <hi>most No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Created Nature, we Ascribe it also to God by <hi>Analogie,</hi> for that we have no better Name to give him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Personal,</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> in the Blessed <hi>Trinity,</hi> under the Title of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> or <hi>Spirit;</hi> the S<hi>pirit of the Lord; of Jesus &amp;c.</hi> But this is not <hi>OUR Spirit;</hi> nor is he to be <hi>Sanctified</hi> or <hi>Preserved;</hi> and so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be here meant.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:000661_0017_0FA99FDBAD0CD258"/>
2. To <hi>Angels,</hi> both Good and Bad; but Bad Angels cannot be Sanctified; and Good need no Prayers in this Respect: Nor can they be called <hi>OUR</hi> S<hi>pirits,</hi> unless by Assignation of particular <hi>Guardian An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> to particular men; which (whatever were the Opinion of some Jews, and Gentiles of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ld) I know no ground to Believe. This of the Spirit <hi>Out of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In</hi> M<hi>an,</hi> the Spirit is that, which belongs to a man in a proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural sense; and of this kind there seem to be four distinct Significations of the word. Such as.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When taken for the S<hi>oul</hi> (the <hi>forma hominis</hi>) Resigned up to God in Death. So I understand <hi>David,</hi> P<hi>sa.</hi> 31. 5. <hi>Unto thee, O Lord I commit my Spirit;</hi> (howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men deal with my B<hi>ody;</hi>) And this the rather, because <hi>Christ,</hi> at his Death u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the same words, must needs be so understood. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 46. Agreeable to <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>The</hi> S<hi>pirit returns to God who gave it.</hi> And in the same sense also, <hi>Ch.</hi> 11. 5. <hi>Thou knowest not the way of the</hi> S<hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nor how the</hi> B<hi>ones grow in the womb.</hi> That is, (as I take it) Thou understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not how the S<hi>oul</hi> doth form the <hi>Body,</hi> as an Habitation for it self. 'Tis the <hi>Inward</hi> part of man; so the Exegesis seems very
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000661_0018_0FA99FDC6C251620"/>
plain, in that I<hi>sa.</hi> 26. 9. W<hi>ith my</hi> S<hi>oul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my</hi> S<hi>pirit within me will</hi> I <hi>seek thee early; i. e.</hi> with my inward man I <hi>have,</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> apply my self to thee: from whence arises a <hi>Tropical</hi> sense of Spirit, namely to signifie S<hi>incerity. God is my witness, whom I</hi> S<hi>erve in my Spirit in the Gospel, Rom.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Spirit</hi> is taken for the <hi>Life,</hi> or <hi>Union</hi> of Soul and Body; or Souls being in the S<hi>tate of Union.</hi> So I understand, <hi>Job.</hi> 10. 12. <hi>thou hast granted me Life, and thy visitation hath preserved my Spirit;</hi> namely to continue in and with my Body. And ch. 34. 14. 15 <hi>If God gather to himself mans spirit and his breath, all flesh shall perish to gether, and man shall turn again unto Dust.</hi> Thus tis said of the Damsel. whom our Saviour Raysed to Life; <hi>Her Spirit came again, and she arose Luk</hi> 8. 55. <hi>came again</hi> (<hi>ie</hi>) to be <hi>again United</hi> to her Body. We Read <hi>Ecl:</hi> 3.21. of the S<hi>pirit of a man, that goes upwards; and the Spirit of a beast that goeth Downwards,</hi> If the <hi>Spirit</hi> in both parts be understood in the same sense (as most likely it is); then either <hi>Brutes</hi> have <hi>proper</hi> Spirits (which many are loath to admit;) or the Spirit of man must signifie but the <hi>Life,</hi> which is all
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000661_0019_0FA99FDD2EB42570"/>
(if not more, then) some will allow to Beasts. Again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>No man hath power over the Spirit, to Retain the</hi> S<hi>pirit in the Day of Death.</hi> i. e. No man is Master of his own <hi>Life</hi> to prolong it. To the same purpose is that Expression in <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> Prayer, <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 16. <hi>O Lord by these things men Live, and in all these things is the Life of my</hi> S<hi>pirit, so wilt thou Recover me, and make me to Live.</hi> He means not by the <hi>Life of his</hi> S<hi>pirit;</hi> the continued Duration of his Ever-living Soul, but the continuance of its <hi>Union</hi> with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whereby the Life of his person should be prolonged.</p>
            <p>The S<hi>pirit,</hi> in this sense taken, may indeed be S<hi>anctified.</hi> The <hi>Life</hi> may be Devotedun<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to God; according to that of the Apostle. <hi>Rom</hi> 14. 8. <hi>Whether we Live, we Live unto the Lord;</hi> or <hi>Whother we Dye</hi> &amp;c. But this (I think is not the direct meaning of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in our Text.</p>
            <p n="3">3. S<hi>pirit</hi> is taken for some special <hi>Faculties,</hi> or particular <hi>Acts</hi> of the mind; such as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Understanding,</hi> Prov. 20. 27. <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man is the Candle of the Lord, searching all the Inward Parts of the Belly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

find out by its Exercise, all those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Acts and Inclinations which would otherwise lie hidden and undiscovered. So that, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 24. <hi>They that Erred in Spirit, shall come to Understanding, and they that Murmured, shall Learn Doctrine.</hi> That is, they that had misapprehensions of Me, and my Ways, shall come to <hi>Understanding</hi> (not the <hi>Faculty,</hi> but) the <hi>Rectitude</hi> thereof; and they that Murmured, whose <hi>Wills</hi> were averse to embrace Truth shall be graciously Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Learn that which is Right.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Fancy</hi> or Imagination is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be understood by S<hi>pirit.</hi> Ezek. 13. 3. <hi>Wo unto the Foolish Prophets, that follow their own</hi> S<hi>pirit, and have seen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> or that walk after the things which they have not seen; (as in orig.) which God hath not Revealed to them, but they have fabricated to themselves out of their Evil Hearts and Foolish Fancies or Imaginations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The S<hi>pirit</hi> is also taken for the <hi>Thoughts upon,</hi> or Remembring of some person or thing. Thus the Apostle E<hi>x</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses his <hi>Thinking</hi> of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 3. I <hi>verily as absent in Body, but present in</hi> S<hi>pirit, have judged already, as tho' I were present, concerning him that hath
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000661_0021_0FA99FDEAF3CF0F8"/>
done this Deed.</hi> He thought of them and their Affairs; tho' at a distance from them. So of the <hi>Colossians, Chap.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Tho' I he absent in the Flesh, yet am I with you in the</hi> S<hi>pirit, Joying and</hi> B<hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding your order, and the stedfastness of your Faith in Christ.</hi> He Rejoyced to behold their Graces by the eye of his mind, his Cogitations of them. And thus much of the Souls <hi>Faculties</hi> or <hi>Acts,</hi> for which sometimes the word <hi>Spirit</hi> is taken.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Spirit</hi> is Lastly taken for some <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications,</hi> or <hi>Inclinations</hi> of the mind <hi>as United</hi> to the Body, and <hi>Conformed</hi> much thereunto.</p>
            <p>This is the product of <hi>Nature, Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> and <hi>Circumstances</hi> of Life, all which concur to form the <hi>GENIUS, Temper,</hi> or <hi>Disposition</hi> of man. Each man hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>peculiar</hi> to himself in this Respect; as he has in the Features of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, Stature, Shape, Meen or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his Body, whereby he is Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished from any other. So, if we ask, [What <hi>Spirit</hi> is he of?] we mean, of what Temper, Inclination or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us? How Disposed? How Qualified? And the true Answers will be as various, as men; of whom <hi>one</hi> man is (by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000661_0022_0FA99FDF720D1470"/>
Acquisition, or both) of a sober, grave Spirit. <hi>Another</hi> of a Quick, Active, Chearful Spirit. <hi>Another</hi> of a weak, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous, Careful; <hi>Some</hi> are Gentiel, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, Courteous, Open Hearted; <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> Churlish, Clownish, Surly, Rough, Close and Reserved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All these <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> are viciated by Corrupt Nature; and may by the Spirit of Grace be so Sanctified, as to Render men S<hi>erviceable,</hi> tho' in a <hi>different</hi> way, and of good acceptance both with God and man.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>This</hi> I take to be the <hi>most proper</hi> meaning of the word <hi>Spirit</hi> Here in the Text; And then the sense of it is,</p>

            <p>The place in <hi>General</hi> is that of <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I think not.</p>
            <p>I rather take it thus. The Apostle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Exhorted them to study and use Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, or <hi>Labour</hi> (as we read it) to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Rest before mentioned; Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly implies that this work should be done, with all Sincerity, for that they had to do herein with a Heart-searching God; This is manifest by the Energie of his Word, which openeth to a man the Secrets of his Soul; for the word is <hi>Living</hi> or <hi>Quick,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had said; God, who made man, knows him altogether, and better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands what is in man, than man does what is in himself. Man has but Dark Apprehensions of himself, and therein oft times grosly does mistake; But God by his Word Searcheth intimately, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth fully to him what he else would
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000661_0025_0FA99FE2EA9A6710"/>
not take notice of: His <hi>Soul</hi> and S<hi>pirit</hi> lye close together (as do his <hi>Joynts</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi>) But, as the <hi>Anatomists Knife</hi> lays open the <hi>one</hi> Difference; so the piercing Two Edged Sword of the W<hi>ord,</hi> does the <hi>other:</hi> That word shews him, How his S<hi>oul</hi> came pure out of the Hand of God; but he hath added thereto a vicious S<hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> by the perverting of what God did make upright.</p>
            <p>Let not man therefore charge God foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly, and say (as <hi>Adam</hi> did concerning <hi>Eve</hi>) From the S<hi>oul</hi> which thou gavest me all my faults do arise: No, It is from that Evil S<hi>pirit,</hi> which man hath to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Acquired: His S<hi>oul</hi> indeed has the <hi>powers,</hi> but 'tis his Spirit that gives the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,</hi> which (in a natural corrupt<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> State) are wholly bent unto Evil.

            <p>Add to this our daily Experience, and common observation; that men are much what the Custom and usual practice of the place is, where they live.

One, who lives where News is frequently Talked, Gets somewhat of a Publick Spirit: Amongst good natured People, a Candid Spirit. Amongst Souldiers, a Bold and Boysterous one; And so of all other Affections: which may be considered in an Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency; Neither morally Good nor Bad, in themselves; but only as Sanctification or Corruption makes the Difference.</p>

4. <hi>Outward Circumstances</hi> do also Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly vary <hi>mens spirits,</hi> and that in a shorter space of time, then <hi>Habits</hi> use to do.

            <p>If these are of a long continued Series, they do very much towards the forming of a setled and fixed <hi>Genius.</hi> But if only Occasionally, or at certain times they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur; then they vary and <hi>Contemperate</hi> the <hi>Setled</hi> S<hi>pirit</hi> for a season; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps become a means to Reduce it to a better <hi>Mediocrity.</hi> Thus one of a Light and Airy Spirit, and for the most part in all good Circumstances, (may at such times) be unmanageable by Advice; until perhaps, a particular sore Affliction, hath somewhat abated of his Gallantry, and opened his Ear to Instruction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his <hi>Spirit</hi> may be better Regulated for the future.</p>

Explaining of our <hi>General Notion,</hi> shall be the taking Notice; That all these do some way concurr to Constitute and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Man, <hi>Abstracted</hi> from <hi>Grace</hi> and S<hi>in;</hi> yet the Internals and Essentials of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> have the <hi>principal</hi> stroak herein: And then, that the other matters, that are <hi>External</hi> to the Essence of man; the Accidental Inherents, and Adjacents; do but somewhat <hi>Modify</hi> and <hi>Affect</hi> the former constitution, which will still ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in some Degree or other.</p>

            <p>And, because the <hi>Soules</hi> Primitive facultyes are supposed to be all Equal in every man; tis the <hi>Bodyes Temperament,</hi> that especially gives the great Diversity in Mens S<hi>pirits;</hi> we shall therefore speak of these more Distinctly; And that not Exactly according to the common four <hi>First Qualityes</hi> (Hot and Dry, Cold and Moyst) which are said, by their Mixture, to give the four <hi>Complexions</hi> (Sanguine, Cholerick, Melancholy, and Phlegmatick) of which Physicians do so often speak. But I shall Treat of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000661_0034_0FA99FE92DA5F190"/>
to the <hi>Actives</hi> (<hi>Hot,</hi> and <hi>Cold,</hi>) with a <hi>Mean</hi> Temper between them; Taking notice of the other By the way, only as occasion is offered. For it is not <hi>Physical</hi> composition, or <hi>Medical</hi> Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of spirits, which we have now to do with; But S<hi>pirits</hi> as they Relate to Humane and Moral Actions; into which these three (<hi>Hot, Cold,</hi> and <hi>Mean</hi>) have the greatest Influence. Besides, all men will admit of a Hotter, and a Cooler Temperament; even those who Reject Elementary Mixtures; and have no great Regard to the four Complexions. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny like better to have it expressed by <hi>Matter,</hi> more or less, moveable or moved; They may please themselves. There is no Difference in the <hi>Thing,</hi> however Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions vary.</p>
            <p>I say therefore; some mens Spirits are <hi>Hot,</hi> and they do commonly <hi>Act warmly;</hi> Others are <hi>Cold,</hi> and they usually <hi>Act Cooly;</hi> Others have a S<hi>pirit</hi> of a fine <hi>Mean</hi> between these two Extreams, and their Actions are <hi>participant</hi> of both qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>viciously,</hi> it Unsanctified, and under natural Corruption; <hi>vertuously,</hi> if Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and mens Spirits be guided, and acted by the Spirit of God: All common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to their several Capacities:
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000661_0035_0FA99FEA5C47CEA0"/>
But if at any time a man be acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his peculiar <hi>Genius,</hi> 'tis by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial hand of the Good or Evil Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; some special Instigation, and Assistance, upon a particular occasion. And according to this Method we shall Treat of the several Spirits; first Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing <hi>themselves,</hi> and then their S<hi>tates,</hi> both of <hi>Unregeneracy</hi> and S<hi>anctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The more <hi>Hot</hi> S<hi>pirit</hi> Discovers it self in Chearfulness, Activity, Courage, and Angry Zeal or Jealousy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chearfulness:</hi> Heat joyned with a convenient Moisture (answerable to the S<hi>anguine</hi> Complexion) Renders a man Chearful, Vivid, Sprightly, and upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (with apt Circumstances) Joyous, Refreshed, Merry and Comfortable.

and his prudent Mirth, might Drive away S<hi>auls</hi> Evil (Melancholly) Spirit. This Chearful Spirit, as it was, in <hi>Young David, Natural;</hi> so it was in <hi>Old Jacob,</hi> upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; when he heard good News of <hi>Joseph,</hi> and saw the Waggons that were sent for him, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 27.) 'tis said, <hi>The Spirit of Jacob their Father Revived.</hi> Such also were the <hi>Refreshed</hi> S<hi>pirits</hi> mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 16. 17, 18. I <hi>am glad of the coming of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus, for they have Refreshed my Spirit and Yours.</hi> And that of <hi>Titus</hi> his Joy, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 13. B<hi>ecause his Spirit was Refreshed by you all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning of all is: Their Spirits were Chearful and Vivid, upon these Comfortable occasions. The S<hi>pirit</hi> also signifyes Health and strength; as in the Hunger<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>starved <hi>Egyptian</hi> (1. <hi>Sam:</hi> 30) who being left sick (<hi>v</hi> 13) having now Eaten and Drank, after the three Days fasting; tis said (<hi>v</hi> 12. <hi>His spirit came again to him;</hi> that is, He had now some life in him, and could do something like himself; who before was as one Dead, with sadness and Desperation; But now Doubtless, was glad that he was alive.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Chearful</hi> S<hi>pirit,</hi> If <hi>Unsanctifyed and Corrupt,</hi> is groslyabused to <hi>Levity,</hi> froth, vanity, and foolish Jesting, which is not

            <p>But If S<hi>anctifyed,</hi> The <hi>Joy of their Spirit</hi> becomes <hi>Spiritual Joy;</hi> Like <hi>Marys</hi> (<hi>L</hi>uke 1. 46. 47.) <hi>My</hi> S<hi>oul doth Magnify the Lord, And my Spirit hath Rejoyced in God my</hi> S<hi>avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> It Disposeth them to <hi>Thankfulness,</hi> and adapts for Praysing and Glorifying of God. It fits men for Chearful Service to him; which much commends Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the World, who are apt to be fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it by Conceits of nothing but Mortification and Self Denial therein. Chearful Christianity adds a Lustre to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; and convinces men, That they may be merry and wise.</p>
            <p>Now, tho' this doth chiefly arise from the Testimony of a Good <hi>Conscience,</hi> and the Sealings of the Comforting S<hi>pirit of Adoption;</hi> yet <hi>Subservient</hi> thereunto is this our Natural Spirit, which Renders men more apt outwardly to express it. <hi>David</hi> was (as is before noted) of this Sanguine

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Activity</hi> is another effect of the <hi>Hotter Spirit;</hi> it shews it self in a willingness and readiness to be employed; as also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in strong inclinations and vigorous motions; in a great inquisitiveness and earnest search after things that are out of common view. This Temper is very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to Youth, which is usually fitter for <hi>Execution</hi> then <hi>Deliberation;</hi> and because of <hi>this Spirit</hi> tis called the <hi>Sprightliest</hi> time of mens Lives.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Active Spirit,</hi> while <hi>Unsanctifyed</hi> is (like as in a brisk Monkey) a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky thing; It <hi>renders</hi> men Idle Busy-Bodys; Medlers with other Mens Matters; Grievously Troublesome, both to the Church and World; Restless in themselves; and suffering none to be quiet by them; this fruitful Soyl uncultivated, brings forth a multitude of Weeds; if set upon mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif, <hi>one</hi> such will do more then <hi>many</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; like the active Element of <hi>Fire,</hi> where it is not employed in profitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, it works Destruction and Desolation.

A Professor of such a Spirit is but a <hi>Cold</hi> C<hi>hristian,</hi> and will have but a <hi>cold Entertainment</hi> when he comes to seek his Reward.

            <p>This <hi>Unsanctified softness of</hi> S<hi>pirit,</hi> Tho' it be thus <hi>Useless</hi> and <hi>Blameable;</hi> yet this must be acknowledged of it: That of all the Worldly Spirits 'tis <hi>one of the best;</hi> and as it does <hi>no good,</hi> so it does <hi>Least Harm</hi> and <hi>Mischief.</hi> It may Render a man a quiet and untroublesome <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and tollerable Member, of the <hi>Common wealth;</hi> But still a sapless and fruitless Branch in the <hi>Church,;</hi> and is far short of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, whatever it professes.</p>

The <hi>Hasty</hi> and Disordered Spirit is chiefly Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>Unruly,</hi> which often Exposes a man to <hi>Dangers,</hi> as an Unfortify'd City.

               <p>And by considering well the <hi>many</hi> S<hi>criptures,</hi> that have been alledged, we may fairly see, That 'tis <hi>no strained No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which is the Design of this present Treatise. It must indeed be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in <hi>many</hi> of those Scriptures, the word [<hi>Spirit</hi>] may be taken in some of the <hi>common</hi> S<hi>enses</hi> put upon it. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; it may be taken for the S<hi>oul</hi> in general; and in some, for the Inward Part, as an Expression of S<hi>incerity:</hi> But to take it for the <hi>Higher Faculties</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect and Will</hi> (as the <hi>Rational</hi> part, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinct from the S<hi>oul,</hi> or from the <hi>Liver;</hi> This, tho' it be the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and approved Interpretation of this Text; I must confess I do not see suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Reason to allow it.

               <p>'Tis true indeed, there is one Scripture
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:000661_0096_0FA9A01F31370B78"/>
usually alledged (<hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12.) wherein S<hi>oul</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> are Distinguished one from the other: of which place Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> in his P<hi>ortraiture of Old Age</hi> hath Discoursed, and Laboured to Evince, That S<hi>pirit,</hi> there signifies the S<hi>uperiour Faculties</hi> of man; And S<hi>oul,</hi> the <hi>Inferiour.</hi> This Discourse of the Doctor's was Considered in a former Draught on this Subject; which now, because that Ingenious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is some Years since gone to his Rest, I think fit to omit, only he, that has Leisure may compare what is there said, with what we have said of the <hi>same Scripture</hi> in the beginning of this Discourse, and then judge as he sees meet. And as for the many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces quoted, wherein <hi>Mans</hi> S<hi>pirit</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. (on which I now Desire you to Reflect) I suppose you will judg with me: That they may (for the most part) be very genuinely understood in our sense; and that the Interpretation of those Scriptures will, according to our proposed sense, be very Currant.</p>

And after all; because our Endeavours <hi>in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> (in this matter of Governing our <hi>peculiar</hi> S<hi>pirits</hi>) we see by daily sad Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, they Do, and will miserably fall short of Effect, Therefore to <hi>Invocate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Assistance,</hi> and <hi>Influence,</hi> That the work may be Accomplished; (as we shall again touch in the End.)</p>
