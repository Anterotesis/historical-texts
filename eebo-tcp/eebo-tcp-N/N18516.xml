            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Wherever medical records have been faithfully kept by phy≈øicians, fevers have been ≈øcrupulou≈øly noticed and inve≈øtigated. The nece≈ø≈øity of this we will not wonder at, when we come to con≈øider the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of di≈øea≈øes, which are either originally fevers, or become ≈øo from ≈øome ≈øymptomatic affection:‚ÄîBut fevers of the putrid kind have particularly drawn their attention, both on account of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and univer≈øal prevalence when they have taken place, as well as the difficulty in the method of cure: The uniformity of the pathognomonic ≈øymptoms in putrid fevers, from the days of Hippocrates to the pre≈øent time, is ≈øo great, that it renders almo≈øt all the hi≈øtories of this di≈øea≈øe like mere copies from one author to another. However, when it rages epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically, it may yet have ≈øome accidental ≈øymptoms, which have frequently led phy≈øicians to ≈øuppo≈øe it a different di≈øea≈øe, and con≈øequently to give it a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent name. It was this that led the great Sydenham, and the illu≈øtrious Boerhaave, tho≈øe luminaries of the profe≈ø≈øion of medicine, to believe that fevers were unlimited in their number; which, according to the ob≈øervations of Sir John Pringle, Doctor Hux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the late Profe≈ø≈øor Doctor Cullen,<note n="*" place="bottom">Cullen's Fir≈øt Lines, par. lxvii.</note> and others, is now proved to be exceedingly limited. Thus we ≈øhall find, in the hi≈øtory of the di≈øea≈øe under con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, ≈øome accidental ≈øymptoms ob≈øerved, which made phy≈øicians differ very much in the method of cure, as well as in their opinion of the nature of the fever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:024024_0006_0FC2DDE1E2568700"/>
It is not, however, my de≈øign to enter into a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral de≈øcription of fevers, and their differences; but merely to take notice of the epidemic which lately raged ≈øo univer≈øally in this city and its ≈øuburbs.</p>
            <p>About the middle of Augu≈øt, 1791, a contagious fever appeared in the city of New-York, which fir≈øt di≈øcovered it≈øelf near Peck's-≈ølip, a part of the city thickly inhabited, its hou≈øes generally ≈ømall, and badly ventulated<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> many of the inhabitants were in indigent circum≈øtances, which is a frequent cau≈øe of the want of cleanline≈øs. Here it raged a con≈øiderable time; it then began to ≈øpread, as ≈øome attendants on the ≈øick became affected, who lived in other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhoods. By this mean it was carried to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent families, and mo≈øt generally could be traced from this ≈øource. It likewi≈øe proved more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly fatal near the place where it fir≈øt appeared, than in any other part. Thus at length it ≈øpread through the city, until about the middle of October, when the weather growing a little cooler, the di≈øea≈øe greatly abated, and in a ≈øhort time nearly di≈øappeared. I have been informed by ≈øeveral phy≈øicians of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who re≈øide and practice in the country, that many of the boatmen, who frequented the city from Long-I≈øland and the upper part of Hud≈øon's river, carried the di≈øea≈øe home, where it proved fatal to ≈øeveral.<note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor William Moore, an eminent phy≈øician of New-York, informed me, that a gentleman from Lime, in the ≈øtate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, was on a vi≈øit to this city, when he became a patient of his, in whom the di≈øea≈øe was very evidently marked, attended with large vibices; he however recruited con≈øiderably before he left the city: on his pa≈ø≈øage to Lime he relap≈øed, and died ≈øhortly after he reached home. The greater part of his family caught the contagion, and ≈øoon became affected with a ≈øimilar di≈øea≈øe; which proved fatal to his mother, and ≈øome other per≈øons in the family.</note>
            </p>
            <p>At the ≈øame time, in the ≈øouth-we≈øtern part of the city, an intermittent and remittent fever prevailed,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024024_0007_0FC2DDEF86F518F0"/>
together with a few ca≈øes of dy≈øentery. This cau≈øed much di≈øpute among phy≈øicians, as they generally named the di≈øea≈øe from the ca≈øes which they had an opportunity of ≈øeeing mo≈øt prevalent. Some called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> a remittent, others, bilious; ≈øome typhus, putrid, or malignant; and others, following Sydenham, febris bilio≈øa remittens.</p>
            <p>In con≈øequence of a few ca≈øes terminating ≈øuddenly fatal, together with the very unju≈øt, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous judgment of ≈øome phy≈øicians, in determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every di≈øea≈øe to be the putrid fever, fear ≈øpread from mind to mind like a devouring famine, and terror, frequently more hideous than the di≈øea≈øe it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, wrought on the minds of the credulous and weak. This, in ≈øome ca≈øes, greatly increa≈øed the malignity of the fever: in others again, even a ≈ølight head-ach cau≈øed them to de≈øpond, and threw them into a ≈øtate of langour more ea≈øily conceived than de≈øcribed, but without the real ≈øymptoms of the fever. Whether this diagno≈øtic was given through ignorance, or as a profe≈ø≈øional trick, in order to gain applau≈øe by making many and ≈øpeedy cures, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; however, it was neverthele≈øs ≈øo con≈øidered. Thus ≈øome phy≈øicians obtained a credit in curing the complaint, without po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing any real merit.</p>

               <p>In ≈øome ca≈øes, the following ≈øymptoms took place without the patient's knowledge of the former hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pa≈øt: they however, in general, preceded violent pains in the head, back, and loins:‚ÄîA pul≈øe more ten≈øe, full, and ≈øomething increa≈øed in fulne≈øs.

               <p>About the third day, the inflammatory ≈øymptoms greatly changed, to tho≈øe of a putrid kind, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of the fever took place: if the latter did not ≈øucceed, the tongue became dry, and began to be covered with a brown or black ≈øordes: not long after the teeth and lips put on the ≈øame appearance; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpiration became more anxious, with an increa≈øed pro≈øtration of ≈øtrength: the vital functions at this time were much more di≈øturbed; watching, or a comato≈øe ≈øtate, now took place, if it had not before appeared; and even tho≈øe who did ≈øleep, enjoyed it but for a few moments, when they waked as if in a fright: the pul≈øe became ≈ømaller, weaker, and more frequent; thir≈øt was greatly increa≈øed; nau≈øea much more intolerable, together with the ≈øen≈øe of oppre≈ø≈øion at the ≈øtomach: tho≈øe who had not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited before, had that direful ≈øymptom added now to the others: the contents of the ≈øtomach, which were thrown up in the act of vomiting, were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a fetid nature; the voice began to be changed; ≈ømall petechiae appeared about the neck and brea≈øt; when the body, and even the room, unle≈øs well ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated, had a cadaverous ≈ømell‚ÄîThe patient kept continually rolling or turning in the bed, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently picking the bed-clothes.

extremities cold: the pul≈øe became more frequent, irregular, and ≈øometimes intermittent: the per≈øon would lay on his back, with his knees drawn up, and his body appearing as if falling down in the bed; his voice low, and ≈øcarcely perceptible: he was now ≈øen≈øele≈øs of per≈øons ≈øtanding around, or any of their proceedings: the pul≈øe in this ≈øtage of the di≈øea≈øe was ≈øo weak as ≈øcarcely to be felt: the extremities put on a livid appearance. From the comato≈øe ≈øtate which had already taken place, the patient could hardly be rou≈øed by the ≈øtronge≈øt ≈øtimuli of ≈øound and light, though in the beginning of the di≈øea≈øe he was ≈øcarcely able to bear the mo≈øt gentle; and if he ≈øhould be rou≈øed from this ≈øituation, in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the ≈øame would again ≈øucceed. The urine and ≈øtools were frequently involuntarily di≈øcharged; a hiccup followed, if it had not before taken place; and the per≈øon, in con≈øequence of univer≈øal debility producing inability to di≈øcharge the natural ≈øecretion in the bronchial ve≈ø≈øels, appeared as if choaking with phlegm, or ≈øomething pent up in the trachea: convul≈øions, or ≈øub≈øultus tendinum, now affected the frame; the eyes put on a gla≈ø≈øy appearance; and death, in a ≈øhort time, clo≈øed the ≈øcene.</p>
               <p>This was the general cour≈øe of the ≈øymptoms in tho≈øe to whom the di≈øea≈øe proved mortal; but in ≈øome they came on a little ≈øooner, in others later: in ≈øome, petechiae, and even maculae and vibices, extended over the body before death, though all ≈øhewed evident ≈øigns of putre≈øcency directly after.</p>
               <p>In one per≈øon, on the afternoon of the ≈øecond day, an entire intermi≈ø≈øion of his ≈øymptoms took place: on the morning of the third, they returned with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øed violence, when a vomiting came on, with apthae appearing in the mouth and fauces. Upon taking a few drops of any thing in the ≈øtomach, vomiting would immediately be produced, which
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024024_0011_0FC2DE06325EBEB0"/>
terminated in hiccup: this continued a few minutes; it would then ≈øub≈øide until any thing was again ≈øwallowed, when the ≈øame circum≈øtances returned. Petechiae appeared on his neck and brea≈øt the fifth day; and as nothing could be retained on his ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, he was ≈øupported with gly≈øters of broth for ≈øeveral days, to which, as there was no other way of admini≈øtering it, the red bark was added. The pul≈øe in this per≈øon remained good until within a few hours of his death, when it began to dimini≈øh, weaken, and became intermittent. From this time, it was remarked any thing would remain on his ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; the hiccup cea≈øed, and death in a few hours clo≈øed the ≈øcene. This was on the morning of the ≈øeventh day.</p>
               <p>In ≈øome, the di≈øea≈øe made its appearance in a more gradual manner, without any inflammatory ≈øymptoms attending it, and mo≈øt commonly tho≈øe were protracted beyond the eleventh or fourteenth days, when a remi≈ø≈øion or intermi≈ø≈øion took place, or the per≈øon ≈øunk under the di≈øea≈øe. There were ≈øome who recovered, as well as tho≈øe who peri≈øhed, on whom petechial eruptions appeared; and the ≈øtomach in many of tho≈øe who ≈øurvived, was very much di≈øordered.</p>
               <p>Some had other accidental ≈øymptoms accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the di≈øea≈øe, ≈øuch as a dry tickling cough, pains in different parts of the thorax, with other catarrhal and pneumonic ≈øymptoms; ≈øo that ≈øome phy≈øicians were induced to declare it a ≈øimple inflammatory fever, and treat it accordingly. In other patients, a billious yellowne≈øs appeared over the ≈øurface of the body, the ve≈ø≈øels in the adnatae of the eyes were filled with bile, and attended with the other ≈øymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of Doctor Cullen's ≈øpecies of typhus, the icteroides.</p>

Many of tho≈øe who ≈øurvived the di≈øea≈øe were a long time troubled with rheumatic pains of a chronic nature, or a ≈ømall eruption over the ≈øurface of their bodies, which ≈øeemed to be cau≈øed by the debilitated ≈øtate in which the di≈øea≈øe had left them; and the eruption appeared to depend particularly on a weakened action of the extreme ve≈ø≈øels.</p>

                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <head>PREDISPONENT CAUSE.</head>
                  <p>PREDISPOSITION is that ≈øtate of the body not ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently di≈øordered to con≈øtitute di≈øea≈øe,<note n="*" place="bottom">Brown's Elements of Medicine.</note> but verg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards it, and rendering a per≈øon ≈øu≈øceptible to the operation of an occa≈øional or exciting cau≈øe, which are con≈øidered only as po≈ø≈øible cau≈øes.</p>
                  <p>In many contagious complaints the body appears always predi≈øpo≈øed to receive the contagion of the di≈øea≈øe, by a proper application being made; and all that is requi≈øite to produce it, is to be expo≈øed to the effluvia as it flies from the body of the per≈øon affected, or fomes from clothes which have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued with the contagion; as ≈ømall-pox, mea≈øles, &amp;c. There are others which can only be communicated by contact, or an application of matter made to an ab≈øorbing ≈øurface, as ≈øyphilis, &amp;c. What makes it ≈øtill more remarkable is, that with re≈øpect to the production of the former of the≈øe, the body is only predi≈øpo≈øed to be operated on by the contagious mia≈øma but once in a per≈øon's life: on the contrary, a per≈øon being affected with ≈øyphilis once, will not render him un≈øu≈øceptible of receiving the contagion as often as the application of matter be properly made. Likewi≈øe, a per≈øon is not freed from the operation of the contagion of typhus fever by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viou≈øly having had the di≈øea≈øe.</p>
                  <p>For the production of typhus fever, particularly as it rages in this country, it is requi≈øite the body ≈øhould be in a certain ≈øtate to render the per≈øon ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to the operation of the occa≈øional cau≈øe, when properly applied; and this appears to be a ≈øtate verging towards debility, or debility actually produced.<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">De≈ø≈øert. inaug.

can account for the contagion not affecting every per≈øon within the limits of its action, and carrying deva≈øtation over our globe; and in this manner only we can explain why phy≈øicians and others attending on the ≈øick in this complaint, obviate its effects, by frequently taking ≈ømall quantities of ≈øome ≈øtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating cordial, by which means the excitment of the ≈øy≈øtem is kept up, and the effects of the noxious powers are avoided. On the contrary, in blockaded places, pri≈øons, or crouded ≈øhips, whenever the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, pri≈øoners, or crews, are debilitated either by a ≈øcanty allowance, or bad provi≈øions, or want of fre≈øh air; if a typhus fever ≈øhould happen to take place, either by foreign contagion being received, or by being produced by the already debilitated bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, we ≈øee it affect almo≈øt all within the atmo≈øphere of its operation, and find the contagion increa≈øe to ≈øuch a degree of virulency, as to affect others in whom predi≈øpo≈øition is ≈øcarcely perceptible.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the account of the Old Bailey, and Black A≈ø≈øizes of Oxford.

I will now take notice of a cau≈øe producing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øpo≈øition, which perhaps is more common than any before mentioned; which is, the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of heat in oppo≈øition to each other, termed heat and cold.</p>
                  <p>Heat appears to be the mo≈øt univer≈øal and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ≈øtimulus to the animal and vegetable world; a certain degree of it is e≈ø≈øentially nece≈ø≈øary to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to our bodies, in order to produce a moderate degree of excitement, which con≈øtitutes health:<note n="*" place="bottom">Brown's Elements of Medicine, Sect. 221, and onward.</note> but then, when this ≈øtimulus has increa≈øed to any con≈øiderable degree, perhaps there is no greater or more certain cau≈øe of producing predi≈øpo≈øition, and even di≈øea≈øe of the greate≈øt debility, and death it≈øelf. This we have an example of in all the di≈øea≈øes of hot climates, particularly cholera and typhus fever. The degree of external heat which appears to be nece≈ø≈øary in this climate to produce healthy excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is about 65<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Romayne's MS.

                  <p>Whenever the heat applied to the human body is below 65 degrees, we then call it cold, or a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of heat, becau≈øe there is not a ≈øufficient ≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus of heat to produce an agreeable ≈øen≈øation; and if the degree below 65 be applied for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable time, or the degree dimini≈øhed, it will actually le≈ø≈øen the heat of the body; by that mean, taken off a nece≈ø≈øary ≈øtimulus to all living bodies, excitement will be dimini≈øhed, the nervous ≈øy≈øtem

                  <p>TYPHUS fever being ≈øometimes epidemic, as we have an in≈øtance in the di≈øea≈øe related in the former chapter, has led many phy≈øicians to attempt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of its occa≈øional, or exciting cau≈øe, by ≈øuppo≈øing certain changes to take place in the atmo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, or that the air is impregnated with particles ari≈øing from putrifying animal or vegetable ≈øub≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir John Pringle on jail and ho≈øpital fevers.</note> others again ≈øuppo≈øed it merely depended upon increa≈øed predi≈øpo≈øition, or any thing which would produce a ≈øufficient degree of debility.<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Brown's Elements of Medicine.</note> However re≈øpectable the authorities which ≈øupport the≈øe opinions may be, yet, if we pay a little atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the method of cure in tho≈øe fevers, and the places where they mo≈øtly rage, I am confident we will be convinced that the putrefaction of animal and vegetable ≈øub≈øtances is not e≈ø≈øentially nece≈ø≈øary to produce typhus fever; on the contrary, it cannot operate as an occa≈øional cau≈øe, but only increa≈øes

predi≈øpo≈øition by contaminating the air, and thereby rendering it le≈øs proper for re≈øpiration; and that ≈øomething more is generally wanted than predi≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition already mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The effluvia exhaling from ≈øub≈øtances verging to putrefaction, or which have already pa≈ø≈øed into that ≈øtate, has been ≈øuppo≈øed to produce a di≈øea≈øe of a putrid nature, by being ab≈øorbed into the ma≈øs of fluids, and there producing a fermentation ≈øimilar to what takes place in dead matter. In this manner of rea≈øoning, however, I ≈øu≈øpect we are apt to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex vague and ill-defined ideas to terms; and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences may be drawn from chemical laws upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate matter, which, when applied to bodies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a living principle, will by no means be ju≈øt, but ≈øubject to lead us into error.</p>
                  <p>If we pre≈øume that fermentation takes place, as has been ≈øuppo≈øed, the fluids will be a≈ø≈øimilated; in that ca≈øe we ≈øhould only have to correct the putrid fermentation, and relieve the patient from the mo≈øt deplorable ≈øituation compatible with life; but daily experience convinces us this is not the ca≈øe. In large cities, where there is a great proportion of animal matter continually putrifying, this fever is not more common than in other places, unle≈øs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion be produced by another cau≈øe. And if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility only were nece≈ø≈øary to produce typhus fever, we ≈øhould always have it to take place whenever the body was reduced to a certain ≈øtate of weakne≈øs, which we find is not the ca≈øe; for in the drop≈øy, and in many other di≈øea≈øes, we ≈øee debility carried ≈øo far as even to produce death, and no ≈øuch fever appears. In ≈ømall-pox, mea≈øles, ≈øyphilis, &amp;c. each appears to depend on a ≈øpecific contagion applied to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:‚ÄîNow, if we allow typhus fever to be a conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious di≈øea≈øe, which is not doubted by any one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the pre≈øent ≈øtate of medicine, I think
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024024_0021_0FC2DE33AAD01928"/>
it will appear equally probable, that typhus fever depends on a ≈øpecific contagion as well as many other di≈øea≈øes: therefore I am of opinion, that the occa≈øional cau≈øe of typhus fever is a contagion, or effluvia<note n="*" place="bottom">Edin. Med. Com. vol. viii. p. 196. Romayne's MS. Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Pract. Medic.</note> ari≈øing from living or dead bodies affected with the ≈øame di≈øea≈øe, or the exhalation from living bodies being retained a con≈øiderable time in ≈øome porous ≈øub≈øtances,<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Lett≈øom's Ob≈øervations and Ca≈øes on putrid fevers.</note> ≈øo as to undergo a fermentation or concentration, by which means it will be enabled to operate on bodies predi≈øpo≈øed to receive it.</p>
                  <p>Although much has been ≈øaid re≈øpecting conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by men high in medical reputation, we mu≈øt ≈øtill acknowledge we know little of its properties. We can only note its effects, as they take place in bodies expo≈øed to its action; and the≈øe effects being ≈øo different in per≈øons differently predi≈øpo≈øed, that the judgment formed concerning the nature of the contagion mu≈øt be very uncertain. But, becau≈øe we cannot inve≈øtigate its peculiar nature, ≈øhall we reject the idea? By no means. If we do, we may with the ≈øame propriety reject the foundation of ≈øome of the mo≈øt beautiful theories in nature.</p>
                  <p>The operation of contagion appears to be much more virulent near the ≈øource from whence it ari≈øes, and when it becomes diffu≈øed in the air, it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered weaker, or entirely inert; therefore, by freely ventulating places impregnated with contagious matter, the effluvia will be ≈øo divided in the atmo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, as to render it little, or not at all, hurtful.</p>
                  <p>Per≈øons frequently expo≈øed to this contagion, or living within its atmo≈øphere, become le≈øs ≈øu≈øceptible of its operation than others who have not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øtomed to its effects. This ≈øhews the wonderful power our bodies have in accommodating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves

At the ≈øame time, convale≈øcents in this di≈øea≈øe, if expo≈øed to a new application of contagion, not unfrequently are affected more ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely than at the fir≈øt attack.<note n="*" place="bottom">Cullen's Practice of Phy≈øic, vol. i. p. 27.</note> The exhalation going off from the human body in a ≈øtate of health, or when affected with a di≈øea≈øe not contagious, is generally con≈øidered as unhurtful, and therefore has had little or no attention paid to it; but if it be long confined for want of free ventulation, or retained in the apparel or bed-clothes of the per≈øon, it will be concentrated or acted on in ≈øuch a manner as to produce a contagion little inferior in degree of viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to that which comes from the body of a per≈øon labouring under typhus fever.

≈øome ≈øtate of fermentation. A melancholy proof of this we have recorded in Stow's Chronicle, in what is called the Black A≈ø≈øizes of Oxford:‚Äî<q>On the 4th, 5th and 6th days of July, 1577, were the a≈ø≈øizes held at Oxon, where was arraigned and condemned, Rowland Jenkins, for a ≈øeditious tongue; at which time there aro≈øe amid≈øt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ≈øuch a damp, that almo≈øt all were ≈ømothered.

                  <p>Some phy≈øicians have ≈øuppo≈øed this fever was immediately produced, in the in≈øtance mentioned, by an exhalation from a large quantity of mud which had been thrown out of the ≈ølips on the adjoining docks, near Peck's-≈ølip, where the di≈øea≈øe fir≈øt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; however, this was nothing more than a mia≈øma ≈øimilar to that which ari≈øes from mar≈øhes, when acted on by the heat of the ≈øun, and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently could not produce putrid fever any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe than by increa≈øing predi≈øpo≈øition.

                  <p>A KNOWLEDGE of the proximate cau≈øes of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes is nece≈ø≈øary to be under≈øtood by every phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian; as the chief part of the cure depends imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon it:<note n="*" place="bottom">Cullen's Practice of Phy≈øic, parag. 4.</note> But the proximate cau≈øe of fevers has eluded the re≈øearch of every one who has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to inve≈øtigate it, at lea≈øt the inquiries into this part of medicine have not met with ≈øuch ≈øucce≈øs as that of many others; and at pre≈øent our knowledge of the proximate cau≈øe of typhus fever is incomplete, and in ≈øome manner doubtful. If, however, I may be allowed to give an opinion on this ≈øubject, from the many cau≈øes which tend to produce predi≈øpo≈øition, as before related, and from the effect of the occa≈øional cau≈øe appearing in the ≈øy≈øtem, all which ≈øhew the greate≈øt ≈øigns of debility; a like inference may al≈øo be drawn from the only remedies which are found to have been effectual in the cure of this di≈øea≈øe, which are either tonics or ≈øtimulants. I therefore think we ≈øhould con≈øider debility as the proximate cau≈øe of typhus fever; and upon this we can e≈øtabli≈øh the mo≈øt natural and effectual method of cure.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine of ≈øpa≈øm being the proximate cau≈øe of typhus fever, although very ingenious, and ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the celebrated Doctor Cullen, appears incompatible with the method of cure and the phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of this di≈øea≈øe. If ≈øpa≈øm be the proximate cau≈øe, why do we not find warm bathing, blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting, and other anti≈øpa≈ømodics, cure the di≈øea≈øe? But the≈øe only aggravate and increa≈øe the mo≈øt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ≈øymptoms. True, we may ≈øay that tonics
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024024_0025_0FC2DE488746F9E0"/>
and ≈øtimulants are anti≈øpa≈ømodics, and thus ≈øome may ≈øuppo≈øe they effectuate a cure by relieving the ≈øpa≈øm, and by giving tone to the ≈øy≈øtem prevent its recurring again, ≈øimilar to what takes place in the cure of tetanus and ≈øpa≈ømodic affections in cholera; but in this fever we have no real evidence of ≈øpa≈øm, which in tho≈øe two di≈øea≈øes we have: I therefore attribute the good effects of the≈øe remedies wholly to their obviating debility.</p>
                  <p>As to the phaenomena of the di≈øea≈øe, we find per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpiration and even ≈øweating not unfrequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a con≈øiderable length of time, ≈øometimes ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days, and even through the whole cour≈øe of the di≈øea≈øe,<note n="*" place="bottom">Sudor Anglicus Sennertus de febre, lib. iv. chap. 15.</note> when the ≈øpa≈øm on the ≈øurface mu≈øt be relaxed; and ≈øtill the fever remains.</p>
                  <p>What can evidence debility more clearly than what is manife≈øted by the ≈øymptoms of langour and la≈ø≈øitude in the beginning of the di≈øea≈øe, together with anorexy, nau≈øea, and vomiting?

unload the ≈øtomach without increa≈øing debility as much as any preparation of antimony. After the operation of the emetic, in order to prevent the debility increa≈øing, and to take off the irritability produced by the action of vomiting, an anodyne was admini≈øtered with advantage.</p>
               <p>In ≈øome ca≈øes, the fir≈øt day or two of the di≈øea≈øe put on ≈øuch inflammatory ≈øymptoms, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øed action of the arterial ≈øy≈øtem, attended with violent pains of the head, and delirium, as made it nece≈ø≈øary to moderate the inflammatory diathe≈øis. This appears more immediately nece≈ø≈øary, when we come to con≈øider the effects of violent action in the ≈øy≈øtem, which frequently takes place in tho≈øe fevers; when the collap≈øe, or ≈øtate of debility, in a ≈øhort time will be in proportion to the inflammatory ≈øymptoms which have preceded: con≈øequently it is much better to prevent the ≈øy≈øtem being worn down by too great excitement, and to endeavour to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate its action in ≈øuch ca≈øes by relaxing remedies; but this ≈øhould be done with the greate≈øt caution, as the danger of the di≈øea≈øe depends on the debility which en≈øues.</p>
               <p>Blood-letting being the mo≈øt effectual way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the inflammatory diathe≈øis, was made u≈øe of by many phy≈øicians, not con≈øidering the natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this di≈øea≈øe towards debility, con≈øequently putre≈øcency; but this, like almo≈øt all other conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious di≈øea≈øes, particularly of this kind, bore the lo≈øs of blood very badly; and in a few hours after blood was drawn, the pul≈øe would ≈øink, when a pro≈øtration of ≈øtrength, and other ≈øigns of debility, appeared: the di≈øea≈øe would increa≈øe with ≈øuch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, that the power of medicine would be ≈øcarcely able to re≈øcue the patient from the jaws of death.</p>

               <p>The fir≈øt thing which ≈øhould claim our attention, after con≈øidering ventulation, as before mentioned, is the temperature of the patient's chamber. In this, I think we often commit an egregious error, either from taking our ideas from authors who have written on the di≈øea≈øe, as it appears in hot climates, where the debilitating power of cold could not be obtained, or from our not having paid ≈øufficient attention to the difference between inflammatory di≈øea≈øes, and the one of which I am treating: for, if we con≈øider that we are admini≈øtering tonics and ≈øtimulants to increa≈øe the excitement, and at the ≈øame time applying the debilitating power of cold, which mu≈øt dimini≈øh it, we will be fully convinced, that the degree of temperature in the room ≈øhould be that which will afford a gentle ≈øtimulus, not to increa≈øe debility; at lea≈øt this practice will be more con≈øi≈øtent one part with the other. Another wrong conclu≈øion which has led phy≈øicians into an error, concerning the ≈øuppo≈øed good effects of cold, is attributing the effects of pure or fre≈øh air, obtained by free ventulation, to the cold to which the patient

               <p>If the bowels be co≈øtive, they ≈øhould be evacuated by gly≈øters, which are not followed by the degree of debility that cathartics are; and they are better combined with vegetable acid, which acts in ≈øome mea≈øure as an anti≈øeptic.</p>

               <p>Spirituous fomentations of the inferior extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties mo≈øt generally took off the irritability of the ≈øtomach, ≈øo as to enable it to retain the nece≈ø≈øary remedies, and frequently relieved it when the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ≈øymptom of vomiting had already taken place.</p>
               <p>Wine, the mo≈øt natural ≈øtimulus belonging to the materia medica, ≈øhould be given freely, and bark at the ≈øame time admini≈øtered. The be≈øt kind is old Madeira, or genuine Port; the former is to be preferred; and when the debility is very great, its ≈øtimulus may be increa≈øed by heat and being ≈øpiced: this ≈øhould be admini≈øtered in as large quantities as the patient can bear, without producing intoxication or indirect debility; though, when the di≈øea≈øe is ≈øevere, one or two bottles, or even more, may be taken in twenty-four hours with advantage. However, in the u≈øe of this remedy we ≈øhould pay particular attention to the former habits of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as whether he has been accu≈øtomed to the u≈øe of wine, or di≈øtilled or fermented liquors. If the patient has been in the u≈øe of ≈øpirituous liquors before he became ≈øick, this would be the mo≈øt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ≈øtimulus; and indeed in ≈øuch ca≈øes we ≈øhould not be able to produce a ≈øufficient excitement by wine or beer; therefore ≈øpirits or brandy, in water, becomes immediately nece≈ø≈øary, and in other ca≈øes
