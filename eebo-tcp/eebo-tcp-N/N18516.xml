            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Wherever medical records have been faithfully kept by phyſicians, fevers have been ſcrupulouſly noticed and inveſtigated. The neceſſity of this we will not wonder at, when we come to conſider the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of diſeaſes, which are either originally fevers, or become ſo from ſome ſymptomatic affection:—But fevers of the putrid kind have particularly drawn their attention, both on account of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and univerſal prevalence when they have taken place, as well as the difficulty in the method of cure: The uniformity of the pathognomonic ſymptoms in putrid fevers, from the days of Hippocrates to the preſent time, is ſo great, that it renders almoſt all the hiſtories of this diſeaſe like mere copies from one author to another. However, when it rages epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically, it may yet have ſome accidental ſymptoms, which have frequently led phyſicians to ſuppoſe it a different diſeaſe, and conſequently to give it a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent name. It was this that led the great Sydenham, and the illuſtrious Boerhaave, thoſe luminaries of the profeſſion of medicine, to believe that fevers were unlimited in their number; which, according to the obſervations of Sir John Pringle, Doctor Hux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the late Profeſſor Doctor Cullen,<note n="*" place="bottom">Cullen's Firſt Lines, par. lxvii.</note> and others, is now proved to be exceedingly limited. Thus we ſhall find, in the hiſtory of the diſeaſe under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, ſome accidental ſymptoms obſerved, which made phyſicians differ very much in the method of cure, as well as in their opinion of the nature of the fever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:024024_0006_0FC2DDE1E2568700"/>
It is not, however, my deſign to enter into a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral deſcription of fevers, and their differences; but merely to take notice of the epidemic which lately raged ſo univerſally in this city and its ſuburbs.</p>
            <p>About the middle of Auguſt, 1791, a contagious fever appeared in the city of New-York, which firſt diſcovered itſelf near Peck's-ſlip, a part of the city thickly inhabited, its houſes generally ſmall, and badly ventulated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many of the inhabitants were in indigent circumſtances, which is a frequent cauſe of the want of cleanlineſs. Here it raged a conſiderable time; it then began to ſpread, as ſome attendants on the ſick became affected, who lived in other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhoods. By this mean it was carried to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent families, and moſt generally could be traced from this ſource. It likewiſe proved more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly fatal near the place where it firſt appeared, than in any other part. Thus at length it ſpread through the city, until about the middle of October, when the weather growing a little cooler, the diſeaſe greatly abated, and in a ſhort time nearly diſappeared. I have been informed by ſeveral phyſicians of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who reſide and practice in the country, that many of the boatmen, who frequented the city from Long-Iſland and the upper part of Hudſon's river, carried the diſeaſe home, where it proved fatal to ſeveral.<note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor William Moore, an eminent phyſician of New-York, informed me, that a gentleman from Lime, in the ſtate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, was on a viſit to this city, when he became a patient of his, in whom the diſeaſe was very evidently marked, attended with large vibices; he however recruited conſiderably before he left the city: on his paſſage to Lime he relapſed, and died ſhortly after he reached home. The greater part of his family caught the contagion, and ſoon became affected with a ſimilar diſeaſe; which proved fatal to his mother, and ſome other perſons in the family.</note>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time, in the ſouth-weſtern part of the city, an intermittent and remittent fever prevailed,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024024_0007_0FC2DDEF86F518F0"/>
together with a few caſes of dyſentery. This cauſed much diſpute among phyſicians, as they generally named the diſeaſe from the caſes which they had an opportunity of ſeeing moſt prevalent. Some called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a remittent, others, bilious; ſome typhus, putrid, or malignant; and others, following Sydenham, febris bilioſa remittens.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of a few caſes terminating ſuddenly fatal, together with the very unjuſt, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous judgment of ſome phyſicians, in determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every diſeaſe to be the putrid fever, fear ſpread from mind to mind like a devouring famine, and terror, frequently more hideous than the diſeaſe it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, wrought on the minds of the credulous and weak. This, in ſome caſes, greatly increaſed the malignity of the fever: in others again, even a ſlight head-ach cauſed them to deſpond, and threw them into a ſtate of langour more eaſily conceived than deſcribed, but without the real ſymptoms of the fever. Whether this diagnoſtic was given through ignorance, or as a profeſſional trick, in order to gain applauſe by making many and ſpeedy cures, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; however, it was nevertheleſs ſo conſidered. Thus ſome phyſicians obtained a credit in curing the complaint, without poſſeſſing any real merit.</p>

               <p>THIS diſeaſe generally, in the firſt place, affected the perſon with a ſenſe of chillineſs, alternating with gentle fluſhings—and a ſenſe of ſoreneſs of all the muſcles; the face appeared pale, the features ſhrunk, the body weary, as if it had undergone ſome great fatigue, attended with yawnings and ſtretchings of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024024_0008_0FC2DDF19775B4F0"/>
the extremities; a diſinclination for any bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe; and when any exertion was made, it was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſluggiſhneſs and uneaſy ſenſations. The pulſe at this time was weak and frequent; the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal faculties were likewiſe impaired, and frequently a ſmall pain in the head, attended with ſighings and anorexy: reſpiration being anxious and rather ſmall at this ſtage of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>In ſome caſes, the following ſymptoms took place without the patient's knowledge of the former hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt: they however, in general, preceded violent pains in the head, back, and loins:—A pulſe more tenſe, full, and ſomething increaſed in fulneſs. (In one caſe, the patient compared the pulſation of the temporal arteries, to the ſtriking of a hammer againſt his temples.) In ſome, a delirium came on imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the cold ſtage, ſo that the perſons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected got out of their beds, and wandered about their rooms or houſes. Sometimes nauſea and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting appeared early in the diſeaſe, which proved very troubleſome, and greatly debilitated the patient. Reſpiration was now rather laborious than anxious; the ſkin dry and hot, belly moſt commonly coſtive, though ſome had a gentle diarrhoea from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the diſeaſe; no appetite, but a great deſire for drink, particularly any united with vegetable acids, as the acid of lemons, &amp;c. the adnatae of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               <p>About the third day, the inflammatory ſymptoms greatly changed, to thoſe of a putrid kind, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the fever took place: if the latter did not ſucceed, the tongue became dry, and began to be covered with a brown or black ſordes: not long after the teeth and lips put on the ſame appearance; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration became more anxious, with an increaſed proſtration of ſtrength: the vital functions at this time were much more diſturbed; watching, or a comatoſe ſtate, now took place, if it had not before appeared; and even thoſe who did ſleep, enjoyed it but for a few moments, when they waked as if in a fright: the pulſe became ſmaller, weaker, and more frequent; thirſt was greatly increaſed; nauſea much more intolerable, together with the ſenſe of oppreſſion at the ſtomach: thoſe who had not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited before, had that direful ſymptom added now to the others: the contents of the ſtomach, which were thrown up in the act of vomiting, were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a fetid nature; the voice began to be changed; ſmall petechiae appeared about the neck and breaſt; when the body, and even the room, unleſs well ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated, had a cadaverous ſmell—The patient kept continually rolling or turning in the bed, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently picking the bed-clothes. In ſome, the bowels at this ſtage of the diſeaſe were very coſtive, ſo that recourſe was obliged to be had to artificial means, whenever it became neceſſary to evacuate their contents: in others, a profuſe diarrhoea conſiderably increaſed the weakneſs of their debilitated bodies. Moſt generally, on the fourth or fifth day of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, with thoſe to whom it proved fatal, all the laſt mentioned ſymptoms were greatly increaſed, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a cadaverous ſmelling ſweat, which would appear on the body when the trunk was hot and the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024024_0010_0FC2DDF496276300"/>
extremities cold: the pulſe became more frequent, irregular, and ſometimes intermittent: the perſon would lay on his back, with his knees drawn up, and his body appearing as if falling down in the bed; his voice low, and ſcarcely perceptible: he was now ſenſeleſs of perſons ſtanding around, or any of their proceedings: the pulſe in this ſtage of the diſeaſe was ſo weak as ſcarcely to be felt: the extremities put on a livid appearance. From the comatoſe ſtate which had already taken place, the patient could hardly be rouſed by the ſtrongeſt ſtimuli of ſound and light, though in the beginning of the diſeaſe he was ſcarcely able to bear the moſt gentle; and if he ſhould be rouſed from this ſituation, in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the ſame would again ſucceed. The urine and ſtools were frequently involuntarily diſcharged; a hiccup followed, if it had not before taken place; and the perſon, in conſequence of univerſal debility producing inability to diſcharge the natural ſecretion in the bronchial veſſels, appeared as if choaking with phlegm, or ſomething pent up in the trachea: convulſions, or ſubſultus tendinum, now affected the frame; the eyes put on a glaſſy appearance; and death, in a ſhort time, cloſed the ſcene.</p>
               <p>This was the general courſe of the ſymptoms in thoſe to whom the diſeaſe proved mortal; but in ſome they came on a little ſooner, in others later: in ſome, petechiae, and even maculae and vibices, extended over the body before death, though all ſhewed evident ſigns of putreſcency directly after.</p>
               <p>In one perſon, on the afternoon of the ſecond day, an entire intermiſſion of his ſymptoms took place: on the morning of the third, they returned with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed violence, when a vomiting came on, with apthae appearing in the mouth and fauces. Upon taking a few drops of any thing in the ſtomach, vomiting would immediately be produced, which
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024024_0011_0FC2DE06325EBEB0"/>
terminated in hiccup: this continued a few minutes; it would then ſubſide until any thing was again ſwallowed, when the ſame circumſtances returned. Petechiae appeared on his neck and breaſt the fifth day; and as nothing could be retained on his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, he was ſupported with glyſters of broth for ſeveral days, to which, as there was no other way of adminiſtering it, the red bark was added. The pulſe in this perſon remained good until within a few hours of his death, when it began to diminiſh, weaken, and became intermittent. From this time, it was remarked any thing would remain on his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; the hiccup ceaſed, and death in a few hours cloſed the ſcene. This was on the morning of the ſeventh day.</p>
               <p>In ſome, the diſeaſe made its appearance in a more gradual manner, without any inflammatory ſymptoms attending it, and moſt commonly thoſe were protracted beyond the eleventh or fourteenth days, when a remiſſion or intermiſſion took place, or the perſon ſunk under the diſeaſe. There were ſome who recovered, as well as thoſe who periſhed, on whom petechial eruptions appeared; and the ſtomach in many of thoſe who ſurvived, was very much diſordered.</p>
               <p>Some had other accidental ſymptoms accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſeaſe, ſuch as a dry tickling cough, pains in different parts of the thorax, with other catarrhal and pneumonic ſymptoms; ſo that ſome phyſicians were induced to declare it a ſimple inflammatory fever, and treat it accordingly. In other patients, a billious yellowneſs appeared over the ſurface of the body, the veſſels in the adnatae of the eyes were filled with bile, and attended with the other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of Doctor Cullen's ſpecies of typhus, the icteroides.</p>

                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:024024_0012_0FC2DE080686AF50"/>
Many of thoſe who ſurvived the diſeaſe were a long time troubled with rheumatic pains of a chronic nature, or a ſmall eruption over the ſurface of their bodies, which ſeemed to be cauſed by the debilitated ſtate in which the diſeaſe had left them; and the eruption appeared to depend particularly on a weakened action of the extreme veſſels.</p>

               <p>IN conſidering the cauſes of the fever I am treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, I ſhall divide them into three kinds, as they take place in operating upon the human body, when they concur to produce diſeaſe, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                  <hi>prediſponent, occaſional</hi> or <hi>exciting,</hi> and <hi>proximate</hi> cauſes. The two former have been frequently conſidered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, under the title of <hi>remote cauſe,</hi> and with ſome degree of propriety, becauſe one only renders the body more liable to the operation of the other.</p>
               <div n="1" type="sect">
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:024024_0014_0FC2DE0B24DA8260"/>
                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <head>PREDISPONENT CAUSE.</head>
                  <p>PREDISPOSITION is that ſtate of the body not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently diſordered to conſtitute diſeaſe,<note n="*" place="bottom">Brown's Elements of Medicine.</note> but verg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards it, and rendering a perſon ſuſceptible to the operation of an occaſional or exciting cauſe, which are conſidered only as poſſible cauſes.</p>
                  <p>In many contagious complaints the body appears always prediſpoſed to receive the contagion of the diſeaſe, by a proper application being made; and all that is requiſite to produce it, is to be expoſed to the effluvia as it flies from the body of the perſon affected, or fomes from clothes which have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued with the contagion; as ſmall-pox, meaſles, &amp;c. There are others which can only be communicated by contact, or an application of matter made to an abſorbing ſurface, as ſyphilis, &amp;c. What makes it ſtill more remarkable is, that with reſpect to the production of the former of theſe, the body is only prediſpoſed to be operated on by the contagious miaſma but once in a perſon's life: on the contrary, a perſon being affected with ſyphilis once, will not render him unſuſceptible of receiving the contagion as often as the application of matter be properly made. Likewiſe, a perſon is not freed from the operation of the contagion of typhus fever by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly having had the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>For the production of typhus fever, particularly as it rages in this country, it is requiſite the body ſhould be in a certain ſtate to render the perſon ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to the operation of the occaſional cauſe, when properly applied; and this appears to be a ſtate verging towards debility, or debility actually produced.<note n="†" place="bottom">Deſſert. inaug. Edin. 1779. John Bell, de ſebre maligna.</note> It is upon this principle only that we
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024024_0015_0FC2DE140356EB60"/>
can account for the contagion not affecting every perſon within the limits of its action, and carrying devaſtation over our globe; and in this manner only we can explain why phyſicians and others attending on the ſick in this complaint, obviate its effects, by frequently taking ſmall quantities of ſome ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating cordial, by which means the excitment of the ſyſtem is kept up, and the effects of the noxious powers are avoided. On the contrary, in blockaded places, priſons, or crouded ſhips, whenever the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, priſoners, or crews, are debilitated either by a ſcanty allowance, or bad proviſions, or want of freſh air; if a typhus fever ſhould happen to take place, either by foreign contagion being received, or by being produced by the already debilitated bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, we ſee it affect almoſt all within the atmoſphere of its operation, and find the contagion increaſe to ſuch a degree of virulency, as to affect others in whom prediſpoſition is ſcarcely perceptible.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the account of the Old Bailey, and Black Aſſizes of Oxford. Stow's Chron.</note> The debilitating power of the depreſſing paſſions greatly favours the action of the exciting cauſe, particularly fear, which not only operates forcibly in producing prediſpoſition, but alſo increaſes the malignity of the diſeaſe. This muſt have frequently been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by every phyſician who has had any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able practice in contagious diſeaſes. Thus, ſome perſons who attended the ſick in the plague of Merſailles made uſe of a preparation of vinegar as a preventative; but then I would rather ſuppoſe they eſcaped the diſeaſe more for having full confidence that the vinegar would effectually prevent their taking the infection, than from any real virtue in the preparation which they uſed, although an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſeptic.</p>

I will now take notice of a cauſe producing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, which perhaps is more common than any before mentioned; which is, the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of heat in oppoſition to each other, termed heat and cold.</p>
                  <p>Heat appears to be the moſt univerſal and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtimulus to the animal and vegetable world; a certain degree of it is eſſentially neceſſary to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to our bodies, in order to produce a moderate degree of excitement, which conſtitutes health:<note n="*" place="bottom">Brown's Elements of Medicine, Sect. 221, and onward.</note> but then, when this ſtimulus has increaſed to any conſiderable degree, perhaps there is no greater or more certain cauſe of producing prediſpoſition, and even diſeaſe of the greateſt debility, and death itſelf. This we have an example of in all the diſeaſes of hot climates, particularly cholera and typhus fever. The degree of external heat which appears to be neceſſary in this climate to produce healthy excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is about 65<note n="†" place="bottom">Romayne's MS. Lectures, Pract. Medic. No. 21 of 1791 and 1792.</note> degrees of Fahrenheit's ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer; at the ſame time, the body is capable of bearing a degree of heat conſiderably above this, without producing any morbid effects.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Cullen's Practice of Phyſic, chap. 4. Philoſophical Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions concerning the experiments of heated rooms, made by Doctor Blagden, and others.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whenever the heat applied to the human body is below 65 degrees, we then call it cold, or a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of heat, becauſe there is not a ſufficient ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus of heat to produce an agreeable ſenſation; and if the degree below 65 be applied for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, or the degree diminiſhed, it will actually leſſen the heat of the body; by that mean, taken off a neceſſary ſtimulus to all living bodies, excitement will be diminiſhed, the nervous ſyſtem
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024024_0017_0FC2DE1CDED6CE50"/>
become languid, and injured; the ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the body will be impaired; ſleepineſs will at length be produced;<note n="*" place="bottom">See the account of Doctor Solander, who ſailed with Capt.

                  <p>It has been much diſputed among phyſicians, whether cold itſelf would produce typhus fever, without the concurrence of contagion. It muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be allowed, that if cold be applied, it will diminiſh the excitement of the body, but in no other manner than any other debilitating power: and as intermittent fevers appear to have only one ſource of occaſional cauſe, <abbr>viz.</abbr> marſh miaſma, ſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears probable that typhus fevers have only one alſo, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                     <hi>human effluvia.</hi> If we allow cold to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this diſeaſe in one inſtance, we muſt allow ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of cauſe, coeteris paribus, to produce ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of effect, and we ſhould always have typhus fevers produced in perſons expoſed to conſiderable degrees of cold, which is contrary to fact.

                  <p>TYPHUS fever being ſometimes epidemic, as we have an inſtance in the diſeaſe related in the former chapter, has led many phyſicians to attempt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of its occaſional, or exciting cauſe, by ſuppoſing certain changes to take place in the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, or that the air is impregnated with particles ariſing from putrifying animal or vegetable ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir John Pringle on jail and hoſpital fevers.</note> others again ſuppoſed it merely depended upon increaſed prediſpoſition, or any thing which would produce a ſufficient degree of debility.<note n="†" place="bottom">Brown's Elements of Medicine.</note> However reſpectable the authorities which ſupport theſe opinions may be, yet, if we pay a little atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the method of cure in thoſe fevers, and the places where they moſtly rage, I am confident we will be convinced that the putrefaction of animal and vegetable ſubſtances is not eſſentially neceſſary to produce typhus fever; on the contrary, it cannot operate as an occaſional cauſe, but only increaſes
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024024_0020_0FC2DE2DF73EE9F0"/>
prediſpoſition by contaminating the air, and thereby rendering it leſs proper for reſpiration; and that ſomething more is generally wanted than prediſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition already mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The effluvia exhaling from ſubſtances verging to putrefaction, or which have already paſſed into that ſtate, has been ſuppoſed to produce a diſeaſe of a putrid nature, by being abſorbed into the maſs of fluids, and there producing a fermentation ſimilar to what takes place in dead matter. In this manner of reaſoning, however, I ſuſpect we are apt to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex vague and ill-defined ideas to terms; and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences may be drawn from chemical laws upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate matter, which, when applied to bodies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a living principle, will by no means be juſt, but ſubject to lead us into error.</p>
                  <p>If we preſume that fermentation takes place, as has been ſuppoſed, the fluids will be aſſimilated; in that caſe we ſhould only have to correct the putrid fermentation, and relieve the patient from the moſt deplorable ſituation compatible with life; but daily experience convinces us this is not the caſe. In large cities, where there is a great proportion of animal matter continually putrifying, this fever is not more common than in other places, unleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion be produced by another cauſe. And if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility only were neceſſary to produce typhus fever, we ſhould always have it to take place whenever the body was reduced to a certain ſtate of weakneſs, which we find is not the caſe; for in the dropſy, and in many other diſeaſes, we ſee debility carried ſo far as even to produce death, and no ſuch fever appears. In ſmall-pox, meaſles, ſyphilis, &amp;c. each appears to depend on a ſpecific contagion applied to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:—Now, if we allow typhus fever to be a conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſeaſe, which is not doubted by any one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the preſent ſtate of medicine, I think
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024024_0021_0FC2DE33AAD01928"/>
it will appear equally probable, that typhus fever depends on a ſpecific contagion as well as many other diſeaſes: therefore I am of opinion, that the occaſional cauſe of typhus fever is a contagion, or effluvia<note n="*" place="bottom">Edin. Med. Com. vol. viii. p. 196. Romayne's MS. Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Pract.

                  <p>Although much has been ſaid reſpecting conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by men high in medical reputation, we muſt ſtill acknowledge we know little of its properties. We can only note its effects, as they take place in bodies expoſed to its action; and theſe effects being ſo different in perſons differently prediſpoſed, that the judgment formed concerning the nature of the contagion muſt be very uncertain. But, becauſe we cannot inveſtigate its peculiar nature, ſhall we reject the idea? By no means. If we do, we may with the ſame propriety reject the foundation of ſome of the moſt beautiful theories in nature.</p>
                  <p>The operation of contagion appears to be much more virulent near the ſource from whence it ariſes, and when it becomes diffuſed in the air, it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered weaker, or entirely inert; therefore, by freely ventulating places impregnated with contagious matter, the effluvia will be ſo divided in the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, as to render it little, or not at all, hurtful.</p>
                  <p>Perſons frequently expoſed to this contagion, or living within its atmoſphere, become leſs ſuſceptible of its operation than others who have not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to its effects. This ſhews the wonderful power our bodies have in accommodating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024024_0022_0FC2DE35262993B8"/>
to the action of any thing which may prove injurious to them. At the ſame time, convaleſcents in this diſeaſe, if expoſed to a new application of contagion, not unfrequently are affected more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely than at the firſt attack.<note n="*" place="bottom">Cullen's Practice of Phyſic, vol. i. p. 27.</note> The exhalation going off from the human body in a ſtate of health, or when affected with a diſeaſe not contagious, is generally conſidered as unhurtful, and therefore has had little or no attention paid to it; but if it be long confined for want of free ventulation, or retained in the apparel or bed-clothes of the perſon, it will be concentrated or acted on in ſuch a manner as to produce a contagion little inferior in degree of viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to that which comes from the body of a perſon labouring under typhus fever. But moſt frequently this does not affect the perſon producing it ſo much as it does others; becauſe the body becomes accuſtomed to its action,<note n="†" place="bottom">Medical Tranſactions, vol. iii. p. 345.

ſome ſtate of fermentation. A melancholy proof of this we have recorded in Stow's Chronicle, in what is called the Black Aſſizes of Oxford:—<q>On the 4th, 5th and 6th days of July, 1577, were the aſſizes held at Oxon, where was arraigned and condemned, Rowland Jenkins, for a ſeditious tongue; at which time there aroſe amidſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſuch a damp, that almoſt all were ſmothered. "Very few eſcaped that were not taken.—Here died in Oxon three hundred perſons; and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened there, but died in other places, two hundred and odd.</q>—Another inſtance we have in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſeſſion at the Old Bailey, in the year 1750, when four of the bench, a conſiderable number of the jury, and other perſons preſent, received the infection, and died from the fomites brought with the priſoners into court.</p>
                  <p>Some phyſicians have ſuppoſed this fever was immediately produced, in the inſtance mentioned, by an exhalation from a large quantity of mud which had been thrown out of the ſlips on the adjoining docks, near Peck's-ſlip, where the diſeaſe firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; however, this was nothing more than a miaſma ſimilar to that which ariſes from marſhes, when acted on by the heat of the ſun, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently could not produce putrid fever any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by increaſing prediſpoſition. I am alſo induced to doubt this being the immediate cauſe of this fever, from the perſons who were firſt affected reſiding at ſome diſtance from the dock on which the mud was depoſited. The ſlips were cleared out in the ſame manner, and the mud depoſited in like ſituations, in other parts of the city, near which no ſuch fever appeared, until it extended gradually from the place where it firſt ſhewed itſelf.</p>

                  <head>PROXIMATE CAUSE.</head>
                  <p>A KNOWLEDGE of the proximate cauſes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes is neceſſary to be underſtood by every phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian; as the chief part of the cure depends imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon it:<note n="*" place="bottom">Cullen's Practice of Phyſic, parag. 4.</note> But the proximate cauſe of fevers has eluded the reſearch of every one who has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to inveſtigate it, at leaſt the inquiries into this part of medicine have not met with ſuch ſucceſs as that of many others; and at preſent our knowledge of the proximate cauſe of typhus fever is incomplete, and in ſome manner doubtful. If, however, I may be allowed to give an opinion on this ſubject, from the many cauſes which tend to produce prediſpoſition, as before related, and from the effect of the occaſional cauſe appearing in the ſyſtem, all which ſhew the greateſt ſigns of debility; a like inference may alſo be drawn from the only remedies which are found to have been effectual in the cure of this diſeaſe, which are either tonics or ſtimulants. I therefore think we ſhould conſider debility as the proximate cauſe of typhus fever; and upon this we can eſtabliſh the moſt natural and effectual method of cure.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine of ſpaſm being the proximate cauſe of typhus fever, although very ingenious, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the celebrated Doctor Cullen, appears incompatible with the method of cure and the phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of this diſeaſe. If ſpaſm be the proximate cauſe, why do we not find warm bathing, blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting, and other antiſpaſmodics, cure the diſeaſe? But theſe only aggravate and increaſe the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſymptoms. True, we may ſay that tonics
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024024_0025_0FC2DE488746F9E0"/>
and ſtimulants are antiſpaſmodics, and thus ſome may ſuppoſe they effectuate a cure by relieving the ſpaſm, and by giving tone to the ſyſtem prevent its recurring again, ſimilar to what takes place in the cure of tetanus and ſpaſmodic affections in cholera; but in this fever we have no real evidence of ſpaſm, which in thoſe two diſeaſes we have: I therefore attribute the good effects of theſe remedies wholly to their obviating debility.</p>
                  <p>As to the phaenomena of the diſeaſe, we find per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration and even ſweating not unfrequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a conſiderable length of time, ſometimes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days, and even through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe,<note n="*" place="bottom">Sudor Anglicus Sennertus de febre, lib. iv. chap. 15.</note> when the ſpaſm on the ſurface muſt be relaxed; and ſtill the fever remains.</p>
                  <p>What can evidence debility more clearly than what is manifeſted by the ſymptoms of langour and laſſitude in the beginning of the diſeaſe, together with anorexy, nauſea, and vomiting? And as the diſeaſe continues, are not want of appetite, coldneſs of the extremities, tremblings, inability in walking or other exerciſe, weakneſs and quickneſs of the pulſe, frequent ſighings and faintings, cold clammy ſweats, impaired ſtate of the vital functions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſlipping down in the bed, want of ſleep, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techia, with all the other ſymptoms which take place near the cloſe of the diſeaſe, and even death itſelf, undeniable proofs of great debility being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the ſyſtem?—I therefore ſhall form my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral indication of cure from the ſuppoſition of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility being the proximate cauſe.</p>

               <p>IF in the beginning of the diſeaſe which I have made the ſubject of this diſſertation, the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory ſymptoms ran high, attended with delirium, want of ſleep, great anxiety, and about the third day no remiſſion took place, but the pulſe became ſmaller and quicker, reſpiration frequent and anxious, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with vomiting, and in the progreſs of the diſeaſe theſe ſymptoms became more ſevere, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with cold clammy ſweats, ſucceeded by pete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,—generally indicated an unhappy prognoſis, particularly if the irritability of the ſtomach was ſuch as not to allow the retention of any medicine.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, if on the third day a remiſſion appeared, the pulſe became ſlower, more ſoft and full, delirium began to abate, nauſea and vomiting, if any had appeared, now ceaſed, ſo that any thing would remain on the ſtomach, we might prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a favourable termination; though ſometimes this abatement of the ſymptoms was later in taking place.

               <head>METHOD of CURE.</head>
               <p>AS I have endeavoured to eſtabliſh the proximate cauſe of this diſeaſe as it appeared, to be debility, which, from what has been ſaid in the former ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024024_0027_0FC2DE4C5EE1F5C8"/>
I think will appear pretty evident, I will found the method of cure in obviating debility, taking into conſideration the prediſpoſing and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. To avoid, as far as may be, any further effects being produced by the occaſional cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. To relieve or remove any thing which may tend to obviate the more completely fulfilling the third indication; which is,</p>
               <p n="3">3d. To reſtore and ſupport the tone of the ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>The firſt indication may be fulfilled by having the patient removed from all contagious matter as ſpeedily and effectually as poſſible, and placed in a large chamber, which will admit of free ventulation: by this mean his own effluvia will not be allowed to ſtagnate, but be continually carried off in the air. The temperature of the room ſhould be governed in ſome meaſure by the prediſpoſition of the perſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and the ſtage of the diſeaſe. In the beginning of this fever, perſons who were naturally prediſpoſed to inflammatory diatheſis, and by ſome irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had indirect debility produced, ſo as to favour the operation of the occaſional cauſe, in whom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory ſymptoms were generally very violent, for two or three days the temperature of the room ſhould be below 65 degrees, ſo that it might dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the increaſed action of the ſyſtem, which would tend to produce healthy excitement.</p>
               <p>By having the bed-clothes and body linen changed at leaſt once in every twenty-four hours; and the ſhirts ſhould be wetted in good ſtrong vinegar, and dried without being wrung,<note n="*" place="bottom">Romayne's MS. Lectures, Pract. Med.</note> ſo that as much of the acid might remain on the linen as poſſible, which acts as an antiſeptic to the body, and tends to correct that diſagreeable ſmell of the perſpiration which always an attendant on this diſeaſe; and indeed to

have the body waſhed all over with vinegar<note n="*" place="bottom">Edin. Medical Commentaries, decad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> vi. p. 383.</note> not only tends to prevent putreſcency, but keeps the ſurface of the body clean, which is of very great moment in the cure of typhus fever.—By not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any excrementitious matter to remain in the room, but to have it removed immediately; dirty clothes ſhould alſo be removed from the apartment, ſo that the air in the room may be kept as pure as poſſible.—By evacuating the contents of the bowels once in twenty-four hours. And by paying atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the circumſtances above related, every accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of effluvia will be prevented, and of courſe its virulency muſt be diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>To fulfil the ſecond indication. If called early in the diſeaſe, when the ſtrength of the patient was but little impaired, or if there were ſigns of crudities in the ſtomach, which moſt generally was the caſe, the adminiſtration of an emetic<note n="†" place="bottom">Cullen's Practice of Phyſic, parag. 131 and 172. See Lind on fevers and infection.</note> proved of the greateſt benefit, not only in unloading immediately the ſtomach, but frequently with great relief to the pain in the head, by inducing a more equal circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion throughout the ſyſtem. The choice of the emetic ſhould depend on the ſymptoms of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. If there were, as frequently happened, conſiderable inflammatory ſymptoms, as a pretty full hard pulſe, ſkin dry, countenance fluſhed, with a pain in the head, an antimonial emetic ſhould be preferred, which, whilſt it evacuated the contents of the ſtomach, would relax the ſyſtem more than any other: this would ſometimes produce a remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and prove a criſis to the diſeaſe. On the other hand, if the perſon appeared debilitated, and we wiſhed only to clear the ſtomach, an emetic of ipecacuanha<note n="‡" place="bottom">Cullen's Practice of Phyſic, parag. 181.</note> would be preferable: this would
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024024_0029_0FC2DE54A2B0E3D0"/>
unload the ſtomach without increaſing debility as much as any preparation of antimony. After the operation of the emetic, in order to prevent the debility increaſing, and to take off the irritability produced by the action of vomiting, an anodyne was adminiſtered with advantage.</p>
               <p>In ſome caſes, the firſt day or two of the diſeaſe put on ſuch inflammatory ſymptoms, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed action of the arterial ſyſtem, attended with violent pains of the head, and delirium, as made it neceſſary to moderate the inflammatory diatheſis. This appears more immediately neceſſary, when we come to conſider the effects of violent action in the ſyſtem, which frequently takes place in thoſe fevers; when the collapſe, or ſtate of debility, in a ſhort time will be in proportion to the inflammatory ſymptoms which have preceded: conſequently it is much better to prevent the ſyſtem being worn down by too great excitement, and to endeavour to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate its action in ſuch caſes by relaxing remedies; but this ſhould be done with the greateſt caution, as the danger of the diſeaſe depends on the debility which enſues.</p>
               <p>Blood-letting being the moſt effectual way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the inflammatory diatheſis, was made uſe of by many phyſicians, not conſidering the natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this diſeaſe towards debility, conſequently putreſcency; but this, like almoſt all other conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſeaſes, particularly of this kind, bore the loſs of blood very badly; and in a few hours after blood was drawn, the pulſe would ſink, when a proſtration of ſtrength, and other ſigns of debility, appeared: the diſeaſe would increaſe with ſuch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, that the power of medicine would be ſcarcely able to reſcue the patient from the jaws of death.</p>
               <p>Whenever it be neceſſary to moderate the action of the ſyſtem, after the contents of the bowels are
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024024_0030_0FC2DE5CB2D532E8"/>
evacuated, ſome preparation of antimony,<note n="*" place="bottom">Cullen's Practice of Phyſic, parag. 182.</note> as James's powder, calx nitrata antimonii, or even tartar emetic, either, frequently given in ſmall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, not however ſo as to produce vomiting, will ſafely and effectually moderate the excitement, and bring on a gentle perſpiration, ſo as in a ſhort time to prepare the body for the adminiſtration of the bark: though in many caſes the fever from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſhewed ſuch ſigns of debility, or the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician not being called at an early period of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, rendered the ſecond indication unneceſſary, when recourſe ſhould immediately be had to the third; which is,</p>
               <p>To reſtore and ſupport the tone of the ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing which ſhould claim our attention, after conſidering ventulation, as before mentioned, is the temperature of the patient's chamber. In this, I think we often commit an egregious error, either from taking our ideas from authors who have written on the diſeaſe, as it appears in hot climates, where the debilitating power of cold could not be obtained, or from our not having paid ſufficient attention to the difference between inflammatory diſeaſes, and the one of which I am treating: for, if we conſider that we are adminiſtering tonics and ſtimulants to increaſe the excitement, and at the ſame time applying the debilitating power of cold, which muſt diminiſh it, we will be fully convinced, that the degree of temperature in the room ſhould be that which will afford a gentle ſtimulus, not to increaſe debility; at leaſt this practice will be more conſiſtent one part with the other. Another wrong concluſion which has led phyſicians into an error, concerning the ſuppoſed good effects of cold, is attributing the effects of pure or freſh air, obtained by free ventulation, to the cold to which the patient
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024024_0031_0FC2DE6085265818"/>
was expoſed in obtaining this air.<note n="*" place="bottom">Lettſom's Obſervations and Caſes on putrid fevers.</note> However, ſince a ſufficient number of experiments evince the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of this diſeaſe raging with great violence in cold climates, or cold ſeaſons of the year,<note n="†" place="bottom">London Medical Tranſactions, vol. iii. p. 345.</note> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſufficiently evident, that no good effects can, but many bad ones may, ariſe from the debilitating power of cold; but by heat being applied ſo as to be gently ſtimulant, much benefit will enſue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Brown's Elements of Medicine, vol. ii. p. 7, 8, &amp;c.</note> and at the ſame time we may have free ventulation:—Therefore the temperature of the patient's chamber ſhould be about 65 degrees of Fahrenheit's ſcale.</p>
               <p>If the bowels be coſtive, they ſhould be evacuated by glyſters, which are not followed by the degree of debility that cathartics are; and they are better combined with vegetable acid, which acts in ſome meaſure as an antiſeptic.</p>
               <p>Peruvian bark, although thrown out of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria medica by the ingenious Doctor Brown and his ſtrict followers, ſtill ſtands high on the liſt as one of the moſt effectual remedies in the cure of fevers. We ſhould begin the adminiſtration of this valuable remedy as ſoon as typhus ſymptoms appear, and not wait till an evident intermiſſion or remiſſion takes place, which frequently is not effected until the patient reſigns his life.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Lettſom's Obſervations and Caſes on putrid fevers. Cleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn on the diſeaſes of Minorca.</note> It ſhould be given in as large quantities as the ſtomach of the patient will bear, at leaſt an ounce or more in twenty-four hours: this is beſt given in powder; but the irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of the ſtomach in the fever which prevailed in New-York was ſuch that in moſt caſes the bark could not be retained, and in others the ſtomach could bear neither medicine nor diet, in which caſes
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024024_0032_0FC2DE65B5D7FF20"/>
the bark was freely adminiſtered in glyſters, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly emptying the bowels with an acetous injec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note n="*" place="bottom">Romayne's MS. Lectures, Practice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Medicine.</note> It is remarkable that the bowels generally retained theſe bark injections for ſeveral hours, or until they were brought away by having the acetous ones repeated; though in many caſes, when the powder could not be retained on the ſtomach, a cold infuſion in water, or joined with an alkali, or a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the tincture of bark, would be retained with the moſt happy effects.</p>
               <p>Spirituous fomentations of the inferior extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties moſt generally took off the irritability of the ſtomach, ſo as to enable it to retain the neceſſary remedies, and frequently relieved it when the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſymptom of vomiting had already taken place.</p>
               <p>Wine, the moſt natural ſtimulus belonging to the materia medica, ſhould be given freely, and bark at the ſame time adminiſtered. The beſt kind is old Madeira, or genuine Port; the former is to be preferred; and when the debility is very great, its ſtimulus may be increaſed by heat and being ſpiced: this ſhould be adminiſtered in as large quantities as the patient can bear, without producing intoxication or indirect debility; though, when the diſeaſe is ſevere, one or two bottles, or even more, may be taken in twenty-four hours with advantage. However, in the uſe of this remedy we ſhould pay particular attention to the former habits of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as whether he has been accuſtomed to the uſe of wine, or diſtilled or fermented liquors. If the patient has been in the uſe of ſpirituous liquors before he became ſick, this would be the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtimulus; and indeed in ſuch caſes we ſhould not be able to produce a ſufficient excitement by wine or beer; therefore ſpirits or brandy, in water, becomes immediately neceſſary, and in other caſes

may be advantageouſly uſed. Punch is generally very agreeable to the ſtomach, and proves a uſeful ſtimulant: I have ſeen warm punch ſtop a vomiting in a very debilitated ſtate, when nearly all the other ſtimulants had failed.</p>
               <p>Beer, ſuch as porter,<note n="*" place="bottom">Lettſom's Obſervations and Caſes on putrid fevers.</note> to thoſe who are accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to its uſe, is a very valuable remedy, and for others it frequently becomes neceſſary to change the ſtimulus, as the perſon gets tired of the uſe of one: here porter may be uſed with the greateſt advantage: the carbonic acid which it contains has been much extolled in the cure of putrid fevers; indeed, if there be much virtue in this acid, or air, it may be adminiſtered in this very beautiful manner, far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the nauſeous yeaſt remedy,<note n="†" place="bottom">Some phyſicians, in the time of this diſeaſe, extolled their own peculiar remedy; and many people were led to believe, that in conſequence of this remedy, they cured all their patients; by which trick probably ſome patients might be obtained: and this was nothing leſs than a quantity of yeaſt put in a decoction of bark, which being placed in a degree of heat ſo as to ferment, was then to be taken; and in this manner they produced a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of carbonic acid. In the days of Macbride, and other ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers for the doctrine of fixed air, or carbonic acid, being the bond of union in all animal bodies, this theory might appear plauſible; but at this time it is truly laughable that they ſhould put their dependence on ſuch a remedy. However, they were very cautious to combine it with bark.</note> which, by ſome phyſicians, was extolled almoſt as a catholicon.</p>
               <p>Opium comes next to be noticed—a medicine which, by phyſicians, has long been conſidered as a palliative only in this diſeaſe; but, from the moſt authentic teſtimonials of its operation, at preſent its ſtimulant effect is generally allowed; conſequently it is well ſuited to obviate and remove the cauſes of this diſeaſe;<note n="‡" place="bottom">Brown's Elements of Medicine.

Mead might well call it the "magnum donum Dei." The beſt method to give it is in the form of lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum, in ſome cordial mixture, in ſmall quantities at a time, and frequently repeated, until the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach be able to retain wine, with ſome preparation of animal food; at which time the quantity of lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum muſt be diminiſhed, as the other is increaſed. When delirium comes on, with all its attendants, and every ſymptom grows more alarming, uneaſy days are ſucceeded by reſtleſs nights, and the patient is exhauſted by pain and watching, a full doſe of opium relieves, in a meaſure, all thoſe diſagreeable ſymptoms, and produces ſleep, which is the ſick man's elyſium; it revives his hope, it is his moſt deſirable ſtate, and by which the ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the ſyſtem will be recruited: indeed, there are few things which wear out the ſyſtem more than continual watching, which is thus happily prevented. In convulſions alſo, and ſubſultus tendinum, which appear in the latter ſtages of this diſeaſe, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has ſo powerful an effect as opium; and when vomiting prevents its being retained on the ſtomach, it may be adminiſtered in glyſters with advantage.<note n="*" place="bottom">Any medicine adminiſtered in glyſters ſhould be double the quantity that would be neceſſary to be taken in the ſtomach.</note>

               <p>Volatile alkali, camphire, muſk, &amp;c. have been uſed by their admires; but they are all leſs power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtimulants than opium, and therefore not equal to thoſe already mentioned. I ſaw volatile alkali and camphire uſed in this diſeaſe with little or no effect.</p>
               <p>Vitriolic aether is another powerful ſtimulant, and has been extolled by ſome, when ſingultus takes place; but I think it is ſuperſeded by the uſe of opium.</p>

to their ſtimulating or debilitating power, were uſed by ſome in every ſtage of the diſeaſe, which generally proved hurtful, unleſs in the beginning, when a violent pain frequently took place in the head; a bliſter then applied between the ſhoulders mitigated, if not entirely relieved it; but when uſed in the latter ſtages of the complaint, their good effects did not appear manifeſt.
