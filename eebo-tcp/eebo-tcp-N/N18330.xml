            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And as the placing one in this Church hath occaſioned this meeting of the Congregation—permit me to conclude with offering ſome obſervations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions naturally ariſing from the Analogy betwixt the Organ of human contrivance and ourſelves the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Organs of God's building.</p>
            <p>THE materials of which the various parts both of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Organ and our Bodies, are compoſed, are of the earth; but what gives life to both deſcendeth from heaven. When the body of man received the breath of life, that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Organ was ready to praiſe God, ſo when the bellows, the lungs of the Organ of man's building, heaves and in hales the air, it may be ſaid to be alive—it is ready to obey the ſinger of him who deſireth it to join with the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in praiſing God.—The Spirit of the Lord giveth it breath—it ſoundeth—<q>and we hear the ſound thereof, but cannot tell whence that ſound cometh, nor whither it goeth.</q>—How expreſſive is this of the operations of that ſpirit who worketh is the hearts of the regenerate! Do the pipes ſtand in rows—does each one know it's own appointed place—and do they all receive their due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of air from the common ſtock? Juſt ſo, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body natural, ſocial, or chriſtian ſtand in that relation, which they bear to each other and to the whole; none can ſay to the other <q>I have no need of thee,—for no man liveth to himſelf.</q>—We are members one of another, and our duty is to preſerve "the unity of the ſpirit
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023778_0022_0FC11FC638B7C298"/>
in the bond of peace," always remembering that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good thing any man has, he muſt have received it from above.</p>
            <p>BUT, alas! expreſſive of the humbled condition of our nature, are all the works of man; for all loudly publiſh their own imperfection, as well as that of him who made them!—And are not we hereby admoniſhed to ſeek for perfection from God? and this perfection conſiſteth in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like unto God, and God, St. John tells us, is Love.</p>
            <p>IN tuning the Organ, the proportion of diſcord inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from the ſcale of Muſic, is diſtributed among the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pipes of the Octave, in order that they may all bear their proportion of this inconveniency—and conſequently produce better harmony, than if the whole error was laid on any one of them. What may we learn from this—but "to bear one another's burdens"—<q>to pleaſe each man his neighbour, for his good to edification?</q>—and thus to fulfil the royal law of concord the companion of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>TO the ſo general neglect of "mutual forbearance and mutual forgiveneſs," is owing the great diſſimilitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween many of our modern chriſtians and thoſe of ancient times, <q>when THE MULTITUDE OF THE BELIEVERS WERE OF ONE HEART AND OF ONE MIND.</q>
            </p>
            <p>NOT more apt to go out of tune, and all ſorts of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from the influences of heat, and cold, of moiſture and drought, and of winds and calms; than are the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the human heart, thoſe ſtrings or pipes of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of God's building from the influences of the various objects which ſurround them; <q>the luſt of the eye, the luſt of the fleſh, and the pride of life.</q> How oft do one

or all of theſe deſpire to put out ſouls out of tune, and ſpread the jarrings of diſcord among us? When comes wars and lightings among us? come they not even of our luſts?</p>
            <p>WHY need I purſue the Analogy further? Beholding Brethren, the weakneſs of our mortal nature thro' ſin, in the imperfection inſparable from all the works of ſkill and genius,—and the dignity of that nature, to which we are invited, and of which we have an engaging foretaſte <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>THUS prepared—we may pray "thy Kingdom come" "come Lord Jeſus—come quickly."</p>
            <p>So when "the AUTHOR OF PEACE, and LOVER OF CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CORD" ſhall again deſcend, and as at the firſt, breathe into man the breath of life, every one, whoſe life hath been a life of praiſe and love, and hope in Jeſus, ſhall again live, they ſhall ſtand in his ſight, and enter upon the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of never ending praiſe; and they ſhall invite the whole creation to join with them, ſaying <q>O all ye works of the Lord, bleſs ye the Lord, praiſe him and magnify him for ever.</q> They ſhall in ſeraphic and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate hymns, inceſſantly chant Jehovah's works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Providence, and Redemption, with the accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niment of ſuch INSTRUMENTS OF MUSIC, of which, thoſe uſed in the Temple and the Church have been the emblems types and ſhadows.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:023778_0024_0FC11FC8C5232B98"/>
PERSUADED of this, the Church ceaſeth not to ſing praiſes unto the Lord, well knowing that the Celebration of her Nuptials with the Lamb faſt approacheth, when the grand hymenaeum ſhall be ſung, to which every hymn performed on earth is a kind of prelude. Whilſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of grace laſteth let prayer and praiſe aſcend up to glorify God, and benediction and grace will deſcend to ſanctify and gladden the heart of man. But, when pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhall be abſorbed in fruition, and hope ſhall have fully accompliſhed its purſuits—Praiſe like her ſiſter charity ſhall reign triumphant, throughout the endleſs ages of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>
               <q>PRAISE the Lord, ye houſe of Levi—praiſe the Lord ye houſe of Aaron—O all ye children of men bleſs ye the Lord, praiſe him and magnify him forever:—be tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſalvation from day to day;—for he is good and gracious, and cannot worthily be praiſed.</q>—Salvation be aſcribed unto our God, for he hath holpen his people—and redeemed us from the hand of the enemy: hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah;—he who is the reſurrection and the life—was dead and as alive again, and liveth forevermore, hallelujah, Amen.</p>
            <p>NOW to the incomprehenſible NAME—at which good Angles bow—and evil angels tremble—JEHOVAH ELO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HIM—THREE PERSONS in ONE ever gloirous and adorable ESSENCE, revealed to men under the endearing names of FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST—be aſcribed by the Church viſible and inviſible—and by every part of the Creation of GOD, all glory, honor, dominion, thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and praiſe—now in time, and when time ſhall be no more.</p>
