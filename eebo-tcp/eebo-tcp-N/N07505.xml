            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IMPARTIALITY (it ſeems this Letter wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would have his Readers believe) is the chief Baſes, on which he has founded his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; but eiher for want of Honeſty, or Policy, or both, he has forſook it in the moſt obvious Manner: For where a Man is impartial, he deals in Truth to the beſt of his Judgment, not favouring either party; but this Author has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, with all his little Politicks, to paliate the Actions of the one Side, when for want of Policy he has exclaimed againſt the other, in the moſt malignant Manner.</p>
            <p>HE begins his Letter thus, The <hi>Paxton</hi> Riot (as it is called) makes ſo great a Noiſe, <q>And is ſo much the general Topick, that a Man muſt be but little in Converſation, without having his Opinion asked concerning this Affair.</q> What muſt this Queſtion be! Whether the King will bring thoſe Men to Juſtice, for that Act, and puniſh them according to their deſerts. Not whether they deſerve Puniſhment; that's a Queſtion, I believe, never asked: For I think it muſt be the ſettled Opinion of every ſolid Man, that the <hi>Paxton</hi> Men, who Murdered the <hi>Indians,</hi> deſerve the ſame Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as though they had Murdered ſo many white
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009580_0003_0F76DDCAE0A2FB00"/>
People under the ſame Situation.—Again.—<q>In Truth Matters are now come to ſuch a paſs, that ſome People are of Opinion, that an endeavour to make them worſe may probably be the way to make them better.</q> Here he muſt mean the <hi>Paxton</hi> People and their Advocates, who, if they had ſucceeded in their attempts on the Lives of the <hi>Indians</hi> in the Barraks, with Murdering ſome of the Citizens, for whoſe Scalps they offered Two Hundred Pounds each, then they ſhould have been able to have deſtroyed the Conſtitution of Government, and ſettled a Republick, agreeable to their own darling Principles. Again, for my Part, I am no adept <q>in Politicks, and have but ſeldom troubled my Head about that Science be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reading of a common News-Paper.</q>—The word Politicks is this, (that Part of Ethick, or Moral Philoſophy, that relates to the well-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a State or Kingdom. Here I join him: But why did he not content himſelf ſoly with reading his News-papers? And not Vindicate the <hi>Paxton</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and their bloody Act, by introducing Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from divers places in Hiſtorys, that I am ſure his common News-papers never uſhered into his Brain: And that with falſe Quotations and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Miſrepreſentations, which I am ſure, agreeable to his own Sentiments, proves that he is no poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. But did this Letter Writer imagine, that in caſe the <hi>Paxton</hi> people had ſucceeded in their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, it would have eſcaped the Notice of his Majeſty? (Wofull ſtupidity! Or did they propoſe to have thrown of the Reins of Government en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, and paid no Tribute but to their Goddeſs
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009580_0004_0F76DDCBF59E3628"/>
               <hi>Preſbytery?</hi> If this I ſay be his meaning (which I rather think it is) it alſo proves him to be no poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, for had he been one of that Claſs, he would have concealed his Sentiments from the populace, and only devulged them to his dear Brethren. He ſayeth I have no <q>other View in troubling you with this Letter, then to reſcue the miſerable Frontier people, who lately roſe in Arms, from the infamy and odium thrown upon them.</q> I think the <hi>Paxton</hi> people may be tired of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate by this Time. They committed the worſt of Crimes, and he is making bad worſe; he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging the whole Scheme; he tells us it was to make better Times. If that be ſo it muſt be under the head I have already mentioned; but this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is no policy; for if they have by that Act, uſhered into their corrupt Minds, ſome ſmall Glimps of fain'd pleaſure, I think the Time is coming, when they I wiſh they had never ſeen the Light of that Day. He goes on and tells us, <q>that whilſt they were thus buſied, and thus ſtripped of their Birth-Rights,—<hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> two petty fellows, who ought to have no higher Claims than themſelves, were permitted to Lord it over the Land, and in contempt of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and the expreſs Orders of the Crown, for bidding them to hold private Treaties with the <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </q>—Here is the want of policy; when he intended to exclaim againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he heaps the higheſt Ecomiums on them, when he ſayeth they ought to have (obſerve) no higher Claims than themſelves; which plainly points out, that they ſhould have no higher Claims than their
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009580_0005_0F76DDCC528F9258"/>
own Merits deſerve, which it ſeems was eſteemed great,—(by whom?) Why by our Superiors. For he ſayeth, that they were (obſerve) permitted. I ask this Writer, who permitted them? It could not be their Equals. For no Man hath power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit another to do a Thing, but he muſt alſo have power to forbid the doing of that Thing. Here is the meaning of the Word, <hi>(permit.)</hi> I. e. to give leave, to Authorize, Suffer or allow, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to do ſomewhat—now I ſay, a perſon muſt be inveſted with power in himſelf, before he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligate another to Tranſact any Affair; neither can a Man act in Contempt of Authority, when his Actions receive their very Being from that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Well I conceive the Force of his Argument carries thus much, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> were Men, whoſe Viracity the Government might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in; therefore allowed to act in the Manner they thought fit. A very juſt permiſſion; for it has evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeared, that thoſe two Men have acted their parts in the moſt worthy Manner they were capable of, for the well-being of this province, with regard to <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs.—I ask how can that be? When the ſame Writer affirmeth, that they have acted in Contempt of the Government, and the expreſs orders of the Crown. Why I muſt allow it to be a plain Contradiction. But will not his ſpeaking the Truth in the Front of his Letter (where he ſayeth he is no Adept in politicks) pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate for a few Untruths in the following Sheets, well but he ſayeth they held private — Treaties with the <hi>Indians.</hi> (Where was that) why at the publick Treaty at <hi>Lancaſter:</hi> Where his
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009580_0006_0F76DDCD4F99C258"/>
late Honour, the Governor, with the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, was preſent. How could that be a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy when acted publickly? And he ſayeth by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his Honour:—Excuſe him he is no Adopt in politicks.—But all this they have done, ſayeth this Writer, without ſo much as including the ſimple <hi>Menoniſts,</hi> from whom they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted large Sums of Money, to ſupport their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. (The meaning of the Word Extort is this) to exact Illequally, or get, or take violently and by unjuſtificable Means, to abuſe Authority) this muſt be a falſe Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>Let the <hi>Menoniſts</hi> Anſwer for themſelves. But the Truth is, that the <hi>Menoniſts,</hi> as a Society of good Religious people, by way of Simele col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Money and deſired the Quakers to hand it to the then ſuffering people on the Frontiers, to ſerve their Neceſſities. Is this extortion in the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers? I leave the Candid Reader to judge. Or doth it ſhew the <hi>Menoniſt</hi> to be a ſimple people? No; it's evident that the <hi>Menoniſts,</hi> were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate people, not regardleſs of their fellow Creatures ſufferings, and willing to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Support, (obſerve) here is a poſſitive Aſſertion, when he ſayeth—<q>Nay with the moſt matchleſs impudence, Inſinuated to the <hi>Indians,</hi> that they were Rulers and Governors.</q> (Well let us hear his proop:) As plainly appeared, at the late Treaty at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> where the principal Chief <q>and Speaker told Mr. <hi>H — n,</hi> then Governor, that as he underſtood there were two Governors in the province, he would be glad to know which he was to Treat with.</q> In Caſe
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009580_0007_0F76DDCDF79BCF30"/>
               <hi>this writer ſpeaks the Truth,) here is not ſo much as a ſingle</hi> Indians <hi>Affirmative, to prove the Aſſertion; no not any Evidence at all.</hi> 
               <q>Again the <hi>Indians</hi> were induced to look upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the firſt Man, or Chief <hi>Cechim</hi> of the Province (why ſo, becauſe they ſay his Haughtineſs and the Contempt with which he treated his fellow Subjects;</q>—<hi>then I conclude, our Author muſt be of Opinion, that this has been a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule with our Governors,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Haughtineſs and Contempt— by which the</hi> Indians <hi>hath known them. (He juſt now ſaid Mr.</hi> H. — n. <hi>was a</hi> Quaker, <hi>and now calls him ſomething elſe fie upon ſuch a fellow) he muſt have had a high Opinion of the</hi> Indians <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or he would not have made it the chief Baſes of his Argument, and by this means of falſe Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unjuſtly blam'd the</hi> Quakers. <hi>Here I ſhall take ſome notice of his Note in Page the</hi> 7th, <hi>where he ſayeth, one</hi> Patrick Ignew, <hi>of the Burrough of</hi> Lancaſter, <hi>who upon Oath ſayed, that at the late Treaty at</hi> Lancaſter, <hi>he was commanded to make Proclamation by the Governor, to forbid any Perſon to either ſell, or give, Spiritious Liquors to the</hi> Indians; <hi>and when he proclaimed, and ſaid by order of the Governour, the Infamous</hi> Tediuskung, <hi>as be is called, in Page the</hi> 4th. <hi>Cryed out, D—n your G—nr, D — n your G —r. I'm—tn is our Governor, he allows Rum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; Who alſo upon his Oath, declares, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Proclamation, the</hi> Indians <hi>where privately entertained at a certain Tavern in the Town: Well and what does all this make for him? ſuppoſe</hi> Tediuskung <hi>did ſay that, Pm—tn allows Rum enough; ſo did his Honour too. But at that Time, and upon ſuch Important Buſineſs, the Governor, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009580_0008_0F76DDCEA65F45D0"/>
that any quantity might be too much, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forbid the uſe of it intirely. Well but they were privately entertained at a Tavern in the Town: I ask with what? Here this writer is Silent. Now if he would but comply with one word, in the front of his Letter (Truth) and tell us it was no other then with the Neceſſaries of Life, he would then give the Peoples Actions a genuine Connection with the Governor's Proclimation; for the ſaid Deponent doth not Charge the</hi> Quakers <hi>or any one of them, with the leaſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct; neither is there one word of Spiritious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors in the whole Affadavit, nor the Name</hi> Quaker <hi>mentioned: And as to the reſt of the Affadavits, I think they are not worth a ſolled Man's notice.

This writer Caluminates the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, when it is ſome of his own Kidny, that has been the hateful Agreſſors. Did not a Colony from <hi>New-England</hi> ſettle on Lands, unpurchaſed of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in Contempt of Government and contrary to all Rules of Equity?

And was not the Author of this prepoſterious Letter, the ſame Man, or one of his baſe Brethren? In fine, I think the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> have been the Authors, and Abettors, of all the Miſchief, that's happened to us, as a People. Did we ever read or hear tell of a Quaker, being guilty of any one of the above Villanous acts? I ſay no. But if any pretended Member of their Society had been found guilty of any one of them, they would have diſown'd him in ten Minutes: But the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> do all this with impunity; And who but their Miniſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes their Advocates?

The names of Rioters, Rebels, Murderers, white Savages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been liberally and indiſcriminately beſtowed upon them; but all this they look upon only as the Effects of diſappointed Malice, and the Reſentments of a diſtructive (Faction,) who ſee their darling Power in Danger.</q> I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this Paragraph, and Adapt the diſcourſe to the Faculty of Reaſon, and that in ſo plain and familiar a Manner, as to reach the Capacity of every ſoled thinking Man; which I am confident is an eaſy Task. The Inhabitants of this Province, and under this Government, are a body Corporate, which body compoſes a Society in civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009580_0011_0F76DDD0DA23D560"/>
and every Loyal Perſon, a real Member of that Society. Thus we are bound together by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naminity and Concord, under the ſanction of Laws, to ſupport our civil and Religious Rights in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: And we are not to be diſturbed in this happy Situation, but by a failure in one, or more of the Members; and this appears in every Perſon, that acts contrary to the ſyſtem of Laws, by which this body Corporate is formed into a Society. The Word, factious, declares for me, that thoſe People, whom this Writer ſo much extoles, are the very Men, whom he ſo horridly exclaims a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. See the word (factious) ie. Quarrelſome, Riotous, Rebellious, diſatisfied with the publick Eſtabliſhment; here it wants of Policy with a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it: But I have ſo much Charity for the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Writer, as to think, if he has at any Time met with ſome of theſe, ſholaſtick Words, that he has made uſe of, in his common News-paper, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has been ſo ungenerous, as not to give him the Meaning of one half of them. Let the Blame lye there. Well but is this agreeable to his Title Page? Impartially repreſented? I think its the neareſt that of any Branch of his Diſcourſe I have met with; he has been exclaiming againſt the Government; he has been exclaiming againſt the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and now he exclaims againſt the <hi>Preſbyterians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no one thing appears clearer, then that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are blam'd without a Cauſe. Is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor a Quaker? Is his Council Quakers? Is the Majority of the Aſſembly Quakers? I anſwer in the negative. Well, they are the Men, that all Acts of State are determined by; then pray what are
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009580_0012_0F76DDD196D06888"/>
they blam'd for? why, becauſe they aſſiſted their honeſt Neighbours to ſave the <hi>Indians</hi> from a horrid Maſſacre: And this is every Thing I find againſt them, when I have canvas'd the whole Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, in the minueteſt Manner, I am capable of. Did not the Governor requeſt all the Freeholders in the City, to meet him at the State-Houſe? Was not this with the Approbation of his Council? And did not the Governor and Aſſembly paſs an Act againſt Riots and Rioters? All this was done on the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the <hi>Paxton Rebels:</hi> And without the aid of the Quakers. Now I conclude, this none-Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition has in the firſt Place to prove, that for one Man to endeavour to ſave the Life and Fortune of another, is an unjuſtifiable Act; <hi>Secondly,</hi> the whole Siſtom, or Body of Laws, which ſupport civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and bindeth the Body corporate, as with Chains of Iron, to be a mere Fandom or uſeleſs Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony: Nay it ſtrikes at the very Aſſence of thoſe Laws; I mean the Laws of God: For why did the great and wiſe Legiſlature form thoſe Laws, but for the Regulation and well being of Mankind. I ſay he muſt firſt prove the aboveſaid Poſſitions, or he cannot prove the <hi>Quakers</hi> worthy of any Blame. If this is not the moſt palbable Eſſay towards the intire Demolition of all good Government, I know not what is. Well my Countrymen, by this Time you ſee, in what a ſophiſtical Manner, this Author hath wrote: He meaneth one then, and ſpeaketh another; he ſpitts his Spite at you our Superiors, whoſe Title I have juſt mentioned, under the Similitude of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi> but how you will put up with ſuch glarring impudence, I don't undertake to determine.</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:009580_0013_0F76DDD2AE3BA1E0"/>Now I come to conſider that Part, where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that it can be proved, the firſt <hi>Quakers</hi> took up Arms, and fought well too upon many other Occaſions; the firſt Man he mentions, is <hi>George Keith:</hi> Where he ſayeth page 9. Whoever will take the trouble to read the printed Tryals of <hi>George Keith,</hi> will find, that when a <hi>Quaker Sloop</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this province, was formerly taken by ſome pirates; and finding it impoſſible to ſave both the Sloop and their ſo much cried up principles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oppoſed Force to Force, retook their Veſſel: This parragraph contains both Noneſenſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction <hi>i. e.</hi> A <hi>Quaker Sloop,</hi> what can he mean by that? Doth he call the Sloop a Quaker, or doth he ſuppoſe the Owner was a Quaker? Well, but he doth not tell us, whether the Mariners were Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers or what they were. But thats not all, for he ſayeth the Sloop was taken; (obſerve) and after it was taken, (here is the Cunning) they found it impoſſible to ſave it (I believe ſo), And their ſo much cryed up principles againſt outward Force. Now I ask this Writer, how it was poſſible for the Captain of that Sloop to deliver up his ſole Right of that to the pirate? (which was the Caſe if he had taken it) And ſtill retain his ſole property in that Veſſel. And after it became the others property fight and ſave it: But he tells neither Book or page, therefore I ſhall take no more Notice of it: But ſhall inform the Reader that <hi>George Keith</hi> though once in Community with the Quakers, was afterwards diſown'd by them, and wrote againſt them and their principles; out of which Book this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath undoubtedly fetch'd this Quotation. I
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009580_0014_0F76DDD310A5E6E0"/>
remember a ſaying of a great and wiſe Man i. e. one Runagate is worſe than ten Turks-Men; the next he mentions is <hi>George Fox,</hi> as worthy a Man as I believe the modern Ages hath produced on <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to beſpatter the Character of the Quakers (but this is want of Policy) for if he would have vilified the Quakers Reputation: He ſhould have Quoated the Works of none but thoſe like himſelf, and concealed Book and Page; in doing of which he might have drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſome ſort of Men into his Scheme. However I ſhall Quote a paſſage or two of the genuine Works of</hi> George Fox, <hi>by which the moderate Reader will be convinced that that good Man was quite of the Reverſe opinion, to what this Writer inſinuates. If</hi> George Fox <hi>made uſe of any of thoſe Expreſſions, which this Writer has, they are pick'd words, and a Connection given them as they now ſtand to ſerve the Purpoſe of ſome envious Apoſtate, of whom there were ſeveral that run into ſuch Extravagances, or took ſuch undue Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, that the Rules in the Society could not diſpenſe with; then they teſtified againſt them, and thoſe Men being of the like Spirit with our Author, thought the worſt they could ſay or write, was hardly enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatter them, and their innocent Principles. This Letter Writer ſayeth: <q>It is plain that the firſt Quakers were never againſt force of Arms, if they thought the Quarrel juſt;</q> if you will believe their own writers, they fought well in the Reign of</hi> Oliver Cromwell. <hi>George Fox</hi> in the fifth page of his Letter directed to the Council of Officers of the Army, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains that many were disbanded out of the Army for no other fault, then their being <hi>Quakers.</hi>—I will not undertake to ſay that <hi>George Fox,</hi> did not
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009580_0015_0F76DDD3D44CF1F8"/>
make uſe of any of the above Expreſſions to <hi>Cromwel</hi> or his Army (though I find nothing like it in any of his Writings) for I conceive the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles took place by degrees. They firſt ſaw one thing wrong and then another: And by acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what they ſaw to be their Duty, they at length became acquainted with every Part that conſtituted, a ſound religious Society of People. And amongſt the many that joined them, there was ſome of the Soldiery part; and thoſe were Men of good Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, they were zealous for what they thought right, and ſome were convinced inpart of the Quakers Principles: But for a Time did not ſee, its their Duty to lay down their Arms, but ſtood as valiant Soldiers for their Lives and Liberties. That was the Caſe with <hi>George Biſhop,</hi> whome this Writer mentions, he was a Captain in the Parliament Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: And in that Station manifeſted his Loyalty to the beſt of his Knowledge to detect and ſuppreſs every thing that might obſtruct thee, then hope for peaceable Government. But this was before he became eſtabliſhed in the Quakers Principles, he afterwards laid down his Sword, enter'd into Community with them, and became as faithful a Warrior for his God as he had been a Soldier in the Parliaments Army. And was Author of a Book <hi>entituled, New-England Judged.</hi> In which he has ſet forth the Cruelty and Barbarity of this Authors Brethren, while they had the Reins of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Hands.—I would adviſe him to get one of thoſe Books, and read it through with good Attention, I believe it might be of more Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him, then his News-Papers.

This was in the twentieth Year of his Age. Page 96. there being new Soldiers raiſed, the Commiſſioners would have made me Captain over them: And the Soldiers cried, they would have none but me. They asked me, if I would not take up Arms for the common Wealth againſt <hi>Charles Steuart:</hi> I told them, I knew from whence all Wars did ariſe, even from the Luſts according to <hi>James's</hi> his Doctrine. And that I lived in the Virtue of that Life and Power that took away the Occaſion of all Wars, but they courted me to except of their offer, and thought I did but Complement with them: But I told them I was come into the Covenant of Peace, which was before Wars and Strifes were, they ſaid they offered it in Love and Kindneſs to me, becauſe of my virtue, and ſuch like flattering Words they uſed. But I told them, if that was their Love and Kindneſs I trampled it under my Feet, then their Rage got up. And they ſaid, take him away Jailer, and put him into the Priſon amongſt the Rogues and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons: This was in the 26th. Year of his Age, when he was committed to a loathſome ſtinking Jaile, among thirty Fellons where he remained near ſix Months, and for no other Reaſon but becauſe he would not bear Arms; what I have wrote all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in <hi>Cromwels</hi> Life time, he died in 1658 and the Year following <hi>George Fox</hi> wrote the following Paper, wherein he ſhewed the unlawfulneſs of Wars and Fighting, repreſenting it as a Work not

at all becoming the followers of CHRIST. And he exhorted his Friend not to join with thoſe that took up Arms, but to fight only with Spiritual weapons which took away the occaſion of the Carnal; this was in the 35th Year of his Life, the next is <hi>Robert Rich,</hi> another Author (here he ſhews his cunning) for he neither tells Book nor Page, neither is he ſo kind as to inform us that the <hi>Quakers</hi> had diſown'd him when he wrote; he alſo tells us that the ſaid <hi>Rich</hi> names five Commiſſioners, to nominate Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Aſſertion might be proved as it deſerves to be a poſitive Untruth, the Truth is that <hi>Robert Rich</hi> was a Member of the <hi>Quaker</hi>'s Society, and continued ſo for ſometime, but could not content himſelf to live agreeable to the Rules of that Society, but run into immoral or at leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſent practices; being a Man naturally of a haughty and aſſpiring Temper. However the Quakers diſown'd him, and then to be up with them he became juſt ſuch another fellow as our Letter Writer. He might as well have mention'd another Author, (for he don't ſay <hi>Rich</hi> was a Quaker,) <hi>Bur—on,</hi> and he recommended us to the peruſal of his Works (where I'll be a Voucher for him,) that nearly every Page is examin'd with wrong Quotations, Miſrepreſentations, falſe Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations and horrid Exclamations, againſt almoſt every Thing that's good, well, but if he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd to do, all this he can't help it: I allow that, but I will affirm that if he was ordain'd to do ſo, he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ordain'd to be a Miniſter of CHRIST. The next he Quotes is <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> and all the Miſchief he ſeems to Deſign at him, is to call him <hi>St. Robert:</hi> But I ſhall not thank him for that, for he has no Apoſtate Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

to cite were by he might be able to vilifie that good Man, but this Sentence is to condemn the <hi>Quakers;</hi> whereas, a little before he juſtifies them, where he ſays, it can be proved that thoſe People have taken up Arms, and fought well too. However, this I am ſure that he hath fell prodigiouſly ſhort of his proof; for there is not one Circumſtance produced by him, that no one of them took up Arms and fought for neither King or Parliament; p. 9, 11. That uſurpation Friend has ſuch an Intereſt, that by the Act of Parliament, bearing date <hi>June</hi> 28 1659, for ſetting the Militia? The <hi>Quakers</hi> were made Commiſſioners to form Troops, and Regiments, to buy Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Paragraph contains both Nonſenſe and Contradiction; but Friends will deny all theſe Things, (obſerve) and if you turn over to the very Expreſſions, they will ſneere at your Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; for taking them in a literal Senſe, and tell you with a very grave Phyz, that they are all to be taken ſpiritually. What ſtrange Logick is this? in the firſt Place, the deny that Charge, and in the ſecond Place, and at the ſame Inſtant allows that Charge; and in the third Place he confirms it, when he ſayeth they tell you that the Battle with the Pirates, the Petition to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the choping off <hi>Charles Stuarts</hi> Head, the forming of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the buying of Horſes, are all to be taken ſpiritually. Now I ſhall anſwer agreeable to, and in his own words; i. e. If any Man has a mind to be impoſed upon by ſuch Quibbles, I have no objection: Let him believe that no more is mentioned here, than Malice in diſguiſe, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cricy under a Cloak, Venum as from under the

He tells that the <hi>Senators</hi> kill'd <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> even in the <hi>Senate</hi> Houſe: But is not ſo kind as to inform us how it far'd with the murderers, the Hiſtorian ſayeth that the Judgments of GOD was evidently manifeſted, in taking Vengeance on thoſe treacherous Villains; he ſayeth there was hardly one of them that died a natural Death, divine Juſtice perſued them where ever they went, untill they were exterpated, <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> the chief Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators put an end to their own Lives; not for fear of coming under Tyrany, (as this Author aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerteth) but becauſe it ſhould not be ſaid they were put to Death by the Hands of other Men; If our Author produceth this as a Parallel Caſe, with that of the <hi>Paxton Men;</hi> he muſt alſo think the like Cataſtrophe may be all them, in which opinion I think the Majority may ſafely join him: our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tells us, he hopes that he ſhall not be ſuſpected to be an encourager of Inſurrections and Tumults; certainly this muſt be the hope of the Hypocrite, which the Scripture ſays ſhall fail, I hope he is not

quite ſo ſtupid as to think all Men are like himſelf, not in a Capacity to judge what's for, or what's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their preſents or future Happineſs, but if it be juſt ſo, I query, what he wrote this Letter for, it is ſtuft with little but immoral Sentences; it has no Connection with Religion, it has no perſwaſive Arguments, that has any Tendency to promote the good of the Church or State? What was it wrote for? was it not to divide and ſcatter People one from another? by ſowing the Seeds of Diſcord and Contention, by uſhering into the Minds of the one Part an inveteracy and hatred againſt the other, by the moſt unjuſt way of Arguments, that Malice could Dictate.</p>
            <p>The moderate Reader has ſeen by this Time, how I have canvas'd his Quotations, not in the Minueteſt but in a Corſory way; and find no one Inſtance of any Quaker that has been ſeen in the Field of Battle, or of uſing earnel Weapons of any ſort as this Writer hath aſſerted: again, he hath Quoted Heathen Authors to vindicate the Actions of the <hi>Paxton Men:</hi> But for want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (I think) it muſt be that he has handed us ſuch that make againſt and not for him. He tells us that he hath as great an Advertion to Mobs and all Rioters proceedings as any can have, (obſerve) as any Man ought to have a harden'd Man. However we ſhall ſee his proof in Page 24. After telling us the Storys of the moſt celebrated He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes of Antiquity: Men whom the preſent World is not worthy of <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who have recited, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed or expelled Traytors and Tyrants, the Peſts, the Burdens and the Butchers of Mankind.

Then draws a Line, makes it an entire Paragraph of it ſelf, throws off all his covering; and tells us in plain Terms that <q>indeed ſuch an Action could never have been cenſured in the World, if their had not lived in all Ages; abject Flatterers and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Creatures of power, always prepared to ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and abet the moſt enormous wickedneſs, if it were gainful, and they are they, who have often miſſed good Men in the worſt Prejudices.</q> Here I have given the intire Paragraph; now I propoſe to give the definition, <hi>ergo:</hi> Indeed ſuch an Action could never have been cenſured in the World, i. e. killing the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> coming down to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> with the like Deſign, <hi>ergo:</hi> If they had not been in all Ages abject Flatterers, and ſervile Creatures of Power; the Governor, Commiſſioners and Aſſembly, it can be well elſe: They are always prepared to Sanctifie and abet the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous wickedneſs, if it were gainful, theſe are thoſe who have often led good Men in the worſt Prejudices, i. e. The Actions of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> who at the Governors requeſt, ſaved the Lives of the <hi>Indians</hi> in the <hi>Barraks,</hi> and this Letter writer and his Brethren are the Men that are Prejudiced againſt them for it; the Reader may ſee that I have not ſtrain'd this Paragraph in the leaſt, but have given the genuine Character and Sentiments of the Author, which is that he was the Inſtigator of all the Miſchef; or that he is the Abettor and doth approve of all their Conduct, nay, we have his own Qualifications for what I aſſert in the following Words, <hi>viz.</hi> (As any Man ought to have) and his whole Writing make a Chain of Circumſtances, which being linkt together at the Ends, makes a Lawful Evidence,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009580_0025_0F76DDDE5E838218"/>
therefore by the valitity of theſe two Evidences and according to Form in Law, I ſhall paſs Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on him; and do hereby Pronounce in a ſollid Manner, the Author of this Letter I now have under my Notice to be a <hi>Stark Naked Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian,</hi> Page 22, 23. Here he ſeems to be ſomewhat mift'd at the Author of the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,</hi> for calling the killing of the <hi>Indians</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and wants to know, who made him Judge or Jury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall let him know their wants nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judge nor Jury in that Affair: Such like Actions as that at <hi>Lancaſter</hi> has been condemned by the expreſs Name murder, ſome thouſand of Years paſt. Numb. 35. v. 16. <hi>And if a Man ſmite another, with an Inſtrument of Iron, (ſo that he die,) he is a murderer: The murderer ſhall ſurely be put to Death.</hi> Is not the Barrel of a Gun Iron? and is not that the principle Part of the Machine? and are not the Tomahawks Iron? and did they not kill the <hi>Indians</hi> with thoſe very weapons? <hi>ergo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> This cannot be denied, well then, I aſſert it is prov'd that the <hi>Paxton</hi> People did murder the Indians at <hi>Lancaſter?</hi> the Author has Quoted one Paſſage in the Bible, and another in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criphy, which I conceive he has brought for no other Purpoſe than to palliate the Horrid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy of the <hi>Paxton Men,</hi> in ſhewing us that there was two People in former Times that did make uſe of Treachery, though it was in Caſes quite

fore-on from his Subject. In Page 32. He tells us that to ſtifle the Notions of Revenge is prudent and Religous in private Perſons. But at the ſame Time it is undoubtedly true, that a proper Spirit of Jealouſy (obſerve) and revenge too, in a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are oppreſſed and injured; is a Politick and commendable Virtue: I ſhould have been glad to have ſeen a little of his Activity diſplayed here, where he might have ſaved this Paragraph from a plain Contradiction; for my Part I can't to ſtifle the Notions of Revenge, is Prudant; that is when a Perſon thinks himſelf or his Friend injured, he feels ſomething ſtiring in his Heart, which inclines him to do ſomewhat as bad or worſe to the Perſon whom he looks upon to be, or is the Agreſſor; this motion ought to be ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled (obſerve) and never allow'd to come forth into Action; nay, he ſeems to bind every Perſon to this, by the Cords of Religion; (well this is ſound Doctrine.) But (obſerve) when Men kick againſt the Pricks of Conſcience, and will pay no Regard to the divine Inſtinct in themſelves. notwithſtanding, our Author cries out againſt it; Religion abſolutely forbids it. Each Man ſuffers it to raiſe into a Flame, and Numbers of them being infatuated, combine together determined to be reveng'd and will Proſecute their Deſign, let the Conſequence be what it will; even to murder their Neigbours, inſult Government,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009580_0027_0F76DDE006CF4D28"/>
redicule their Friends, pay no regard to Laws moral or Divine. Then behold! this Letter Writer ſayeth, it is acommendable Virtue without which they will never be valued or reſpected: I am ſure I have done this Author no other diſkindneſs on my Definition of this Paragraph; but to expoſe his notorious Nonſenſe. I expect this little Book when it comes into the World, will meet Men of three opinions; the one may think I have been too ſmart on the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> the other may ſay its but what they deſerve, and the third will hardly have Patience to read a ſingle Page. The Reader may ſee I have run over the whole, and here and there made a Remark: But in Truth, they are but ſlightly touch, if Life and Health Permitted: I could write a Volume upon it, ſhewing the Authors Envy and Folly; in ſuch a Manner that it would diſgrace him to all Intents and Purpoſes: However, I am ſpared, that Pains, for his own Work, will come nearly to the ſame thing; I ſay as I was inſpecting into the Charges againſt the Quakers, I found myſelf, as I thought under a Neceſſity to mention ſome Facts againſt the Presbyterians, that the impartial Reader may judge as he finds Things ſtand in an obvious Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner either for one or the other of the two Societies: And that he may be the better enabled to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine upon the Whole, and judge for himſelf, which Societies Members may be the fiteſt for
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009580_0028_0F76DDE0C8E2EAE8"/>
               <hi>Repreſentatives of the Peoples Lives and Fortunes, the fiteſt for Magiſtrates to judge impartially between a Man and his Neighbour, the fiteſt for Aſſeſſors to value Men's Goods and Chattles without Malice or Favour, the fiteſt for Collectors of Taxes and Aſſizes, where a Man ought to do by his Neighbour as he would have his Neighbour do by him; in ſhort, whether an honeſt Man would rather have a Quaker or a Presbyterian for his Neighbour. I ſhall conclude with a ſhort Addreſs, (but with a great deal of ſencerity) to doom Bur—on and his Ulceration Presbyterians, deſiring the next Day, they dedicate to Liberty and St. Patrick; and at the end of their Chorus, he will make a Proclamation, as with the ſound of a Ram's-Horn, begging and intreating thoſe that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Indians, to ſurrender themſelves up to Juſtice: Pray their Neighbours to take warning by them, confeſſing his hearty ſorrow for his being the Author or Abetter of ſuch a horrid Crime, promiſing in the moſt ſollid Manner that he will never protitute his Pen to ſuch villianous Pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſes more; pray that the Quakers will forgive, and paſs by, acknowledging that he wrote by no other Motion than the Spirit of Lucifer, and declare that his Will and Pleaſure is; that whoſoever has this ſpurious Letter, that he will commit it to the Flames. Amen.</hi> 
               <q>And then we may expect to feel the happy Effects reſulting from Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Law; to ſee the Quiet of the Province reſtored, and Harmony and good order of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment re-eſtabliſhed among us.</q>
