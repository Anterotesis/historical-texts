         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Occaſion of this divine Meſſage to King <hi>Aſa,</hi> and his Army, was the compleat victory, which, thro' help of God, and in anſwer to humble, believing prayer, they had very lately obtained over the huge and formidable Army of <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> who had invaded their Territories.—<hi>Aſa,</hi> as a <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>martial</hi> Prince, led forth his Army to put a ſtop to their progreſs, and ſet the battle in array: and, as a <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> prince, ſought to God for help and ſucceſs. He led them
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:008586_0005_102F89DA1BDFD188"/>
into the field of battle to <hi>fight</hi>; before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, he led them to the throne of Grace to <hi>pray,</hi> to obtain mercy, and find grace to help them, in this time of need and danger. He lift up a <hi>cry</hi> to God, e're he gave the <hi>ſhout</hi> for the battle:— That battle, that work is begun well, and like to ſucceed well, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced with holy, humble prayer. — <hi>Aſa cried unto the Lord his God:</hi> It was a cry of Faith, rather than of Fear. His prayer was ſhort, but fervent; a Prayer of Faith, effectual and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent: it entred into the ears of the Lord of <hi>Sabaoth,</hi> found a gracious acceptance, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained divine help. God fought for them; and by them; gave their Enemies a total Overthrow. — Thro' faith and prayer, out of weakneſs, they were made ſtrong, waxed vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in fight, and put to flight this vaſt Army of Aliens.</p>
            <p>Something ſimilar have been the exerciſe, the practice, and the experience of the people of God in theſe <hi>Britiſh American Provinces and Colonies.</hi> — Envious and ambitious enemies made encroachments upon our King's territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and erected ſeveral ſtrong Forts in them, to enable them to keep what they had got, and to win more. To oppoſe their further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and to drive them off from their unjuſt poſſeſſions, we muſtered, and ſent forth our Forces; and our gracious Sovereign, pitying us, ſent brave Troops to aſſiſt us; but we, not
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:008586_0006_102F89DE1F6A7EE8"/>
truſting to an arm of fleſh, not to our numbers nor ſtrength, not to our Sword nor Bow, like godly <hi>Aſa,</hi> cried to the Lord our God; we faſted and wept, and made ſupplication to him; and, bleſſed be God, he turned not away our prayer nor his mercy from us; but has main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained our right, and given us a ſeries of ſignal Succeſſes.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Aſa,</hi> and his victorious army were now returning in triumph, from the field of battle, to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> laden and enrich'd with the ſpoils of their enemies: doubtleſs greatly affected with the goodneſs of God, for the victory they had won: their tho'ts might be much employed as to the advantages, they ſhould make of it, to the kingdom. Perhaps they might alſo be too much diſpoſed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud themſelves and one another, for their ſkill, and bravery, and ſucceſs, and ſo take to themſelves that glory, which was due to God: however theſe things were, God ſent a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to meet them, and to deliver them a meſſage from him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>manner</hi> of the prophet's addreſs was plain, and earneſt, and authoritative: he uſed no pompous titles of honour, no fulſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments, no ceremonious congratulations, not flattering applauſes. He came upon a more important errand, and with a holy zeal and vehemency delivered it: nor did he in a mean
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008586_0007_102F89E0CD7D8978"/>
ſervile manner, beg leave to ſpeak, or favour to be heard: but, coming in the name of God, and with a Meſſage from him, he demanded their reverent attention: <hi>Hear ye me, Aſa, and all Judah and Benjamin.</hi>— When God ſpeaks by the Mouth of a prophet, it becomes the greateſt men, the higheſt in Dignity and Power, to attend with the deepeſt humility and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to hear what God the Lord has to ſay unto them: conſidering that, how high ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are above other men, they are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more beneath the moſt high God: nor ſhould they take it in diſdain, if God's prophet, at ſuch a time, give them not thoſe honorary titles, which other men do.</p>
            <p>The <hi>meſſage</hi> was partly <hi>monitory</hi> to them of their duty and intereſt: <hi>The Lord is with you, while ye are with him, and if ye ſeek him, he will be found of you:</hi> and partly <hi>minatory; but if ye forſake him, he will forſake you:</hi> and partly <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morative,</hi> to call afreſh to their minds, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the battle, they were with God, in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fervent prayer, and in the battle God was with them by his providence and power: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the battle they ſought God, in the battle God was a preſent help: they prayed, God heard; they believed, and were eſtabliſhed, were proſpered: the victory they had gained, was owing more to God's preſence and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, than to their proweſs and ſwords.—From the experience they had had of God's being
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008586_0008_102F89E467EAE710"/>
with them, in the way of mercy and help, while they were with him, in the way of duty and truſt, he ſhewed them what their duty and intereſt ſtill were, even ſtill to be with God, and he will ſtill be with them.— Their enemies were worſted, either fled or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>there was no more war in the land:</hi> yet ſtill they needed the divine preſence and bleſſing, to direct their <hi>national affairs,</hi> and to proſper their public Concerns: he let them know, that the Continuance of God's <hi>gracious preſence</hi> with them, depended upon their <hi>dutiful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> with him: and aſſured them from God, that ſo long as they ſhould be with God, God would be with them; but withal aſſured them, that if they forſook God, God would in like manner, forſake them. As they behaved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, in reſpect of duty and obedience, God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would deal with them, in reſpect of the ways of providence.</p>
            <p>This divine Meſſage, I humbly conceive, is ſeaſonable, and inſtructive to us, in our cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as it was to them, in their's.</p>
            <p>The experience, which we, the Lord's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in this land, have had, of the happineſs of engaging and enjoying the preſence of God with our Armies, ſhould make us careful not to forfeit it by any ſinful departure from God; and conſcientious in our abiding with God, that he may ſtill abide with us. Still we have
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008586_0009_102F89E60A3CE920"/>
need of the divine preſence and help: we have not yet put off the harneſs, nor has our land reſt from war. Again our Troops are gone forth, and we may expect to hear of garments roll'd in blood. The preſence of God is as neceſſary for the ſucceſs of our Arms <hi>this</hi> Year, as it was the <hi>laſt:</hi> and if God go forth with our Armies, they will be proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered.</p>
            <p>As to the expert, the indefatigable, the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous <hi>General,</hi> who led on his valiant Army to battle laſt year; and that under the greateſt diſadvantages, and with the utmoſt difficulty and hazzard, but with an invincible reſolution and courage, and a ſuperior conduct, againſt the vaſtly greater Number of his enemies; and who quickly ſcattered deſtruction among them, put them to the rout, and chaſed them before him: this ſuper-eminent General, the glorious <hi>WOLFE,</hi> can be with us no more; he greatly fell in the laſt and conquering battle, and died in the bed of honour, fighting like an <hi>Hero,</hi> in the ſervice of his King, and in the defence of his ſubjects.—But tho' <hi>WOLFE,</hi> the dear, the brave, the bold, leader of his Troops, can no more ſtand in the front of the battle, nor give his orders, nor by his words and example, fire their ſpirits, and make them undaunted, amidſt the terrors and tumults of the fight; yet God lives, and ſtill we may have his favourable preſence; <hi>this</hi> is infinitely more, infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008586_0010_102F89E8942C3710"/>
               <hi>this</hi> made our ſlain General, ſuch an every way accompliſhed one: <hi>this</hi> can raiſe up, and give us other Generals, of equal ſkill and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, of equal zeal and fidelity, of equal forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and ſucceſs. And if God be with our Troops, we may hope he will:— yea, bleſſed be God, he has: tho' one is taken, another is left: a <hi>General</hi> who enjoyed the preſence of God with him, in the Reduction of <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> the pride and truſt of our enemies, a <hi>General,</hi> whoſe very name ſtruck ſuch terror into them, the laſt year, that they quickly abandoned their ſtrong Forts, at his approach, and betook themſelves to inglorious flight—<hi>AMHERST,</hi> the wary, the valiant, the victorious, is ſtill left unto us.</p>
            <p>The preſence of God is equally neceſſary and beneficial, for the Governour, as the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; for the Court, as the Camp; for the field of huſbandry, as the field of battle; in peace, as in war; and for the wiſe and ſucceſsful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of affairs at home, as abroad: and our enjoyment of it turns upon our being with God.</p>
            <p>There are two heads of diſcourſe before me; viz. 1. <hi>That the preſence of God with his people, is their only ſafety and happineſs.</hi> 2. <hi>That their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the preſence of God with them, depends upon their being with God.</hi>

            <p>The preſence of God may be conſidered, as his <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>eſſential</hi> preſence: this is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and univerſal, abſolutely neceſſary for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding in being, all creatures, in all worlds. In reſpect of this, God is the God of all the earth, and has the abſolute ordering and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all things, in the kingdoms of men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own will, with ſovereign domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and irreſiſtible power.—Or, as his <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and <hi>majeſtick</hi> preſence, which is peculiar to the heavenly world: there God dwells in the habitation of his holineſs, and ſits upon the throne of his glory: Angels ſtanding in his preſence, &amp; doing homage:—or, as his <hi>judicial, vindictive</hi> preſence, by which the damned in hell are puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction, from the glory of his power — or, as his <hi>ſpiritual, gracious</hi> preſence: which is peculiar to his church and ſaints in this world: this accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhes for them, the everlaſting purpoſes of his grace and mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, and bleſſes them with all ſpiritual bleſſings, in heavenly things in him— or, as his <hi>ſpecial providential</hi> preſence, which alſo is peculiar to his profeſſing people: in reſpect of this, he is with them, ſometimes in <hi>judicial diſpenſations,</hi> correcting them for, and recovering them from their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacies from him, and the ways of holineſs: and ſometimes in <hi>merciful diſpenſations,</hi> proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008586_0012_102F89ED2A103FE0"/>
them in their public concerns, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all outward bleſſings richly to enjoy: health in their habitations, plenty in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, peace in ther borders; and in caſe of war, ſucceſs to their Arms.</p>
            <p>This <hi>favourable providential preſence</hi> of God with his people, conſidered as a people, is <hi>that</hi> preſence of God, which the text more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if not only, relates to. — This God vouchſafes to them, for the ſake of Chriſt, the great Mediator, thro' whom he comes nigh to them, and they are made nigh to him.</p>
            <p>The ſafety and peace, the proſperity and happineſs of God's people, depends wholly upon this preſence of God with them. This performs many great and diſtinguiſhing acts of kindneſs and mercy for them: for where God is thus <hi>with</hi> his people, he is <hi>for</hi> them, eſpouſes their cauſe, conſults their welfare, and promotes their happineſs. His right hand, and his arm, and the light of his countenance, do great things for them, becauſe he has a favour to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This preſence</hi> of God with his people <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves</hi> them in their greateſt ſufferings &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: when like a <hi>buſh on fire,</hi> flames threaten them with immediate deſtruction, they are not conſumed: but according to the greatneſs of God's power and pity, he preſerves them, when
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008586_0013_102F89F122199188"/>
to themſelves they ſeem appointed to periſh. By this, the <hi>three Jewiſh Worthies</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in the midſt of the burning fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; and <hi>Daniel</hi> in the lions den; in the mount the Lord is ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This delivers</hi> them, in their loweſt and moſt deſperate circumſtances. When they are ſurrounded with difficulties and dangers, and reduced to the greateſt ſtreights: when they have neither wiſdom to contrive, nor power to effect, any way of eſcape, but, as to any viſible means, all hope of being ſaved is gone; Now is God's times to work: <hi>Now will I ariſe,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and ſet them in ſafety.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence wonderfully ſteps in, and opens a door of hope and help to them. So it did for <hi>Iſrael</hi> in delivering them from <hi>Egyptian</hi> bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: then God went forth for the ſalvation of his people: yea, he rode upon his horſes and chariots of ſalvation, made ſpeed to help and ſave them.—Miraculous appearances and operations of providence, for the deliverance of God's oppreſſed, endangered people, may not <hi>now</hi> be expected; yet God has very ſtrange and unthought of ways, to accompliſh delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for them: as we ſee, in the deliverance of God's people, from their <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity, and alſo in the days of <hi>Eſther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This lays reſtraint</hi> upon their envious and malicious enemies:—ſometimes <hi>upon their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008586_0014_102F89F2B2E747D0"/>
tho' they envy them their enjoyments, and would fain deprive them of them, they cannot find an heart to do it. Thus tho' the enemies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> coveted the good land, God had given them, yet when all the males went up to the feaſt of the Lord, to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and left their borders expoſed to their incurſions and depredations, God put ſuch a reſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſpirits, that no man then deſired their land. <hi>When a man's,</hi> when a people's, <hi>ways pleaſe the Lord, he maketh even their enemies to be at peace with them.</hi>— Sometimes <hi>upon their Tongues</hi>; that not ſo much as a <hi>Dog</hi> ſhall move his tongue againſt them: as <hi>Balaam,</hi> who loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs, tho' hired with great rewards, could not curſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> — And ſometimes <hi>upon their Hands</hi>; tho' they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly have them in their power, and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked enough to deſtroy them, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to do it, yet their hands are, as it were, bound; they cannot execute their bloody purpoſes. So, when the ſons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and cruelly murdered the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> the terror of God was upon the cities round about, that they ſhould not purſue after them, nor avenge themſelves upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This defeats</hi> the miſchievous plots and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their enemies againſt them. When their enemies conſpire their ruin, and dig deep to hide their counſels; and when they imagine, they have brought their matters to bear, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008586_0015_102F89F46964AE00"/>
are confident of their ſucceſs, providence lays rubs in their way, and fruſtrates their machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: their deep-lay'd plots, and long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured Schemes prove abortive: and God's people eſcape, as a bird out of the ſnare of the fowler. Thus <hi>Haman's</hi> plot for the deſtruction of God's people, ended in diſappointment: and ſo did the horrible, the helliſh <hi>Powder-Plot</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation, intended to blow up at once, and in a moment, the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: when it was ripened, and juſt upon the point of execution, it was ſtrangely diſcovered, and timouſly prevented. — Yea, Providence often brings that miſchief, upon the enemies of God's people, which they deviſed and intended againſt them: they are ſnared in the work of their own hands, and their deſigned miſchief returns upon their own heads. — So <hi>Haman</hi> handſell'd the Gallows, he had prepared for <hi>Mordecai.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This ſupplies</hi> them, with the comforts of life, ſo that they want no good thing. This gives them <hi>Rain</hi> in due ſeaſon and meaſure: makes their fields, ſuch as the Lord has bleſſed, to yield their fruits in plenty; ſo that their barns are filled with ſubſtance, their preſſes burſt out with new wine, and their garners are full, affording all manner of ſtore; they have plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, variety, dainties.—If at any time they ſeem to be cut ſhort, and fear want of bread, and cleanneſs of teeth, the good providence of God
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008586_0016_102F89F76CD664C0"/>
finds out ways for their ſupply, and prevents them with the bleſſings of goodneſs. It was a wonderful work of God, for <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs, a land not ſown, that for <hi>forty years</hi> together, they had ſupplies brought them, from day to day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This directs</hi> them in all their darkneſs, and points out to them, the path of duty, the way of ſafety. When in ſome critical conjunctures, they are wholly at a loſs, and, like <hi>Jehoſhaphat, know not what to do</hi>; when they are perplexed in their minds, and hem'd in on every ſide with difficulties and perils, and can ſee no way to ſurmount, or eſcape them, providence, by ſome unexpected turns, opens a new ſcene, and ſhews them plainly the way, wherein they ſhould go. God often gives his people di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as to their preſent duty and ſafety, by an uncommon coincidence of things in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; ſo that whoſo is wiſe, and obſerves them, may underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord. So God guided his people in the wilderneſs, and led them in a right way, in all their removes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This protects</hi> them, from all enemies and dangers, and is as a wall of fire, round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, to keep them from harm. When their enemies confederate againſt them, unite their counſels to deceive them, and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to deſtroy them, and thunder out their
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008586_0017_102F89FA892EC8C8"/>
boaſts and threats to terrify them; and when they themſelves are ſenſible of their own ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to withſtand, or defeat them, and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to human view, muſt fall ſacrifices to their rage and cruelty; then <hi>God repents him for his ſervants when he ſees they have no power:</hi> then providence undertakes for them, interpoſes, and powerfully protects them: their enemies are ſcattered in the imagination of their hearts, and their hands are not able to execute their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and threats: So God defended <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the numerous army, and proud threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarch.— So God ſaved <hi>England</hi> in <hi>former days</hi> from the formidable <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>—and the <hi>laſt year</hi> from the threatned, and perhaps really intended, <hi>Invaſion of the French</hi>:— and but a few Years ago, he ſaved <hi>New-England</hi> from the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Armament of their <hi>French</hi> enemies, who came into theſe <hi>American</hi> ſeas.— The ancient famous <hi>Cloud,</hi> the ſymbol of God's preſence, ſerved to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for protection, as well as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. God's preſence is to his people, a <hi>Sun</hi> and a <hi>Shield</hi>; a Shield to defend them, as well as a Sun to comfort and direct them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This gives them ſucceſs,</hi> in all their Affairs. Succeſs doth not conſtantly follow the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſecond cauſes. <hi>The Race is not</hi> always <hi>to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong.</hi> Oft-times the beſt human counſels are turned into fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs, the wiſeſt meaſures are diſconcerted,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008586_0018_102F89FE10A62178"/>
the greateſt preparations brought to nothing, and the cunningeſt politicians befooled; while on the other hand, weak and contemptible means are proſpered, and the moſt improbable, meet with the greateſt ſucceſs. This is entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owing to the divine governing providence. But when God is preſent with his people, he orders all things well for them, and proſpers all their lawful undertakings. The ſmiles of God upon them, make every thing flouriſhing— God's preſence makes their land healthful, their fields fruitful, their merchandize gainful, and their armies ſucceſsful: as in this laſt inſtance, we ſee by the great victory <hi>Aſa</hi> obtained over his enemies—and may ſee in the repeated victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> fleets and armies, over our <hi>French</hi> enemies—and in the admirable ſucceſs of <hi>our</hi> Arms, in this quarter of the world, by the reduction of ſo many of the ſtrong and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant <hi>Fortreſſes</hi> of our enemies, and even of their <hi>Capital</hi> city.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This repairs the ruins,</hi> brought upon them, by the judgments of providence. When God's profeſſing people forſake him, apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize from his worſhip, and live in a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous diſobedience to his laws, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for the vindication of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs and honour of the divine government, that God teſtify his diſpleaſure againſt them, and puniſh them, with judicial diſpenſations. And when he doth this, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008586_0019_102F89FFA7D8E5B0"/>
breaks them with breach upon breach, till he brings them very low. But he means not to make a full end of them, but to renew them to repentance, and to recover them from their declenſions. When therefore they repent, and turn to him that ſmites them, he becomes to them a repairer of the breaches, and a reſtorer of paths to dwell in: and builds them up, as he had pluckt them down. — Thus did he to his ancient people: he <hi>raiſed up the tabernacle of David, that was fallen, and cloſed up the breaches thereof, and raiſed up the ruins thereof, and built them as in the days of old.</hi>—So did he by the great City, <hi>London,</hi> when, an <hi>hundred</hi> years ago, great part of it was laid in rubbiſh by devouring flames— So did he by this great Town, <hi>Boſton,</hi> when, near <hi>forty nine</hi> years ſince, this part of it, and the <hi>Meeting-Houſe,</hi> which ſtood in this place, and the <hi>Town-Houſe,</hi> and many other buildings along this ſtreet, on both ſides of it, were laid in aſhes. God being-graciouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his people, the ruins in a few years were repaired, and that with great advantage and ſplendor —and ſo will he again the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſolations, made in it by the <hi>late Fire,</hi> if he be graciouſly preſent with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This turns all the evils they meet with into real kindneſſes to them.</hi> Providence has a vaſt reach, and by ſeemingly contrary methods, promotes the good of God's people: and when they are ready to ſay, <hi>all theſe things are againſt
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008586_0020_102F8A05F13F6818"/>
us,</hi> they are meant for good, tend to it, and terminate in it. — So the Lord being with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> all the hard things he met with, were the direct way to his future preferment and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—So God ſent ſome of his people into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, in the land of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> for their good. —So the repeated diſaſters <hi>we</hi> met with, in the beginning of this war, have been over-ruled for our advantage.—God brings his people low, in order to exalt them the higher.</p>
            <p>Finally,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This favourable providential preſence of God with his people, builds his Houſe, and appoints the Ordinances of his Worſhip, among them.</hi>— Where God is with his people, and walks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, he ſets his <hi>Tabernacle</hi> among them, as he did among his people <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes ſymbols of his gracious <hi>ſpiritual</hi> preſence with them, to be means of keeping up a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual communion with him, and of conveying ſpitual bleſſings to them; that ſo the common bleſſings of providence may be ſanctified to them, by the ſpecial bleſſings of grace.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the ſpecial providential favours, which God beſtows upon his people, according to their varied circumſtances, when he is graciouſly preſent with them. — Upon a review of them, who will not ſay with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Jewiſh Lawgiver, What nation is there ſo great, who has God ſo nigh unto them in all things
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008586_0021_102F8A07A2D98A10"/>
that we call upon him for? Happy art thou, O Iſrael, who is like unto thee, O people ſaved by the Lord, the ſhield of thy help, and the ſword of thine excellency?</hi>— And with the devout king of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Happy is that people, that is in ſuch a caſe; yea happy is that people, whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> — What wiſe people would not deſire to be, and to continue, ſuch a happy people? to know the means, and uſe them, to be ſuch?</p>
            <p>This brings me to the ſecond Head of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, viz. That <hi>God's people's enjoyment of this favourable providential preſence of God with them, depends upon their being with God.</hi> — The text aſſures us, that this is the <hi>only</hi> way to this feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: <hi>The Lord is with you, while ye are with him,</hi> and no longer; for if <hi>ye forſake him, he will forſake you.</hi> Their <hi>obediential preſence</hi> with God is the only condition, the only qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's gracious <hi>providential preſence</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>All men, even they, who know not God, and are without God in the world, are yet with God, i. e. in his preſence, under his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and the goverment of his providence. They are encompaſſed with the divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity, and <hi>in God they live, and move, and have their being.</hi> — But as God's preſence with his people ſignifies ſomething more, than his eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial preſence, and univerſal providence, even his <hi>voluntary, choſen,</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> preſence, ſo
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008586_0022_102F8A0933212068"/>
their preſence with God, ſignifies ſomething elſe, and ſomething more, than this natural and neceſſary preſence with him, even their <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, choſen,</hi> and <hi>dutiful</hi> preſence. Their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with God muſt correſpond to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with them, be as a kind of counterpart to it; and anſwer to it, as the wax to the ſeal.</p>
            <p>As God's being with his people is his being for them, taking care of them, and diſpenſing favours to them; ſo their being with God, is their being <hi>for</hi> God, owning his cauſe, purſuing his intereſt, doing his will, and advancing his glory. God's gracious providential preſence with them performs great acts of favour for them, and their obediential preſence with God, lies in performing religious duties to him.—It implies in it, <hi>their keeping covenant with God.</hi>— Their covenant relation to God conſtitutes them his peculiar people: and brings them into a ſtate of nearneſs to him; for they, that are ſtrangers from the covenant, are afar off from God: and their keeping covenant with God, being ſtedfaſt in it, abſtaining from all ſins forbidden, and doing all required duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving all revealed truths, and walking in all the commandments &amp; ordinances of the Lord; and in all deſigning his glory, is their being with God.—So alſo is <hi>their eying God in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential diſpenſations.</hi>— When they look thro' ſecond cauſes, and above viſible inſtruments, and ſee the ſovereign providence of God in all
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008586_0023_102F8A0C10551760"/>
events, and adore the divine wiſdom &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, power and righteouſneſs, truth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, in them, and compoſe themſelves to a behaviour, comporting with them, they are with God.—When they expreſs a dutiful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to, and a fiducial dependance upon God in all their wants, and fears, &amp; dangers:— when they maintain a prayerful frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſeeking of God the ſupply of their wants, direction in their ſtreights, deliverance from their dangers, protection from their enemies, and other judgments, ſucceſs in their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, and a bleſſing upon their labours:— when they excite themſelves to a thankful praiſing God for all his benefits: —when they endeavour a wiſe and good improvement of all God's dealings towards them: —and when they conſcienciouſly walk in obedience to his commands:— then may they be ſaid to be with God, and not to forſake him.</p>
            <p>God's people being thus with him, God will be with them. — Not as if their being with God <hi>merited</hi> his being with them. By no means: for after all, they are unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: and there are ſo many ſinful imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections attending them, in their abiding with God, ſuch as, diſtruſt and impatience, carnal confidence and undue dependance upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others, or means, neglect of humble believing prayer, or of holy thankful praiſes, that God might juſtly withdraw from them,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008586_0024_102F8A0F760CC6D8"/>
and deny them his gracious preſence. But, theſe infirmities notwithſtanding, his people may humbly hope for his preſence &amp; bleſſing; for God is not ſtrict to mark iniquity, where he ſees ſincerity.</p>
            <p>This hope they may build upon the <hi>gracious promiſe of God:</hi> the text carries the emphaſis of a promiſe in it: and God expreſly promiſed his people, that if <hi>they would walk in his ſtatutes, and keep his commandments, and do them,</hi> i. e. if they would be with him, <hi>he would walk among them, and be their God:</hi> i. e. would be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with them. This promiſe God has ever made good to his people: they ever found that, when they were with God in the way of duty, God was with them in the way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential mercy: and God will not <hi>now</hi> ſuffer his faithfulneſs to fail.</p>
            <p>Beſides, <hi>the great concernment of God's glory ſecures his favourable preſence with them, while they are with him.</hi> Should God forſake his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, while they keep near to him; ſhould he deny them the bleſſings, and load them with the judgments, of providence, while they are faithful in his covenant, and ſtedfaſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, and always abounding in works of obedience to him; the wicked world would take occaſion to blaſpheme his name, as well as inſult his people. They would ſay, <hi>Where is now your God</hi>? and upbraid them with his want of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008586_0025_102F8A13A5610BC8"/>
love to them, or care of them, or power to help them. Therefore, for the glory of his great name, he will not forſake them, while they abide with him. God's glory is his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme end; and the advancement of this is the great Deſign, he is carrying on in the world.</p>
            <p>What remains is an <hi>Application</hi>; which I ſhall attempt, by way of <hi>Addreſs</hi> to ſeveral Orders of men amongſt us. My incapacity for, as well as my unacquaintedneſs with, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, courtly Addreſs, and its unſuitableneſs to my function, and the ſacred Deſk, will, I truſt, obtain an eaſy pardon, for my plainneſs of ſpeech; and the example of our prophet, I conceive, will juſtify me in it.</p>
            <p>As your EXCELLENCY is, <hi>as yet,</hi> in the firſt and chief ſeat of Government over us, juſtice and decency require me, in the firſt place, to direct an <hi>Addreſs</hi> to YOU: an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of a <hi>Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> reminding of duty, and exciting to it.</p>
            <p>SIR,</p>
