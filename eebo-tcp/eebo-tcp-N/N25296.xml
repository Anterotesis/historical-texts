            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Author has thought proper to form this poem into a dialogue, as it furnished an opportunity of displaying, with more perspicuity, the natural gasconading arrogance of France, and the just retort and manly independence of her opponents. He likewise considered the Hudibrastic measure best adapted for interspersing that requisite burlesque which the subject required: how near he has come to the celebrated Butler, or whether he has had him at all in view, is left to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of that author to decide.</p>

                  <l>Yet they exist we can't deny,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>The ladies jar at every meal,</l>

                  <l>To backbite and to scandalize</l>
                  <l>Is charming in the fair ones' eyes.</l>

                  <l>Because she knows 'twill give him pain;</l>
                  <l>She's so tenacious of her lover,</l>
                  <l>He must not look at any other;</l>
                  <l>Thus are we trammel'd when we court,</l>
                  <l>And made the butt of woman's sport:</l>
                  <l>And ask the damsel why she teazes?</l>
                  <l>Most like she'll say, because she pleases,</l>
                  <l>It is her fancy to perplex him,</l>
                  <l>The more she loves, the more she'll vex him,</l>

Will ne'er desist nor give him quarter,</l>
                  <l>But keep him always in hot water,</l>
                  <l>Until she's gain'd him and his riches,</l>
                  <l>And then perhaps she'll wear the breeches.</l>
                  <l>The sex, alas! tho' fam'd for beauty,</l>
                  <l>Think contradiction is their duty;</l>
                  <l>But we must yield and seldom flout them,</l>
                  <l>Because we cannot live without them.</l>
                  <l>Yet man is frail as well as woman,</l>
                  <l>Tho' 'tis not always quite so common.</l>
                  <l>Some think their love cannot be zealous,</l>
                  <l>If of their wives they are not jealous,</l>
                  <l>When they most likely are the reason,</l>
                  <l>For acts of matrimonial treason.</l>
                  <l>T' avenge an insult to his jewel,</l>
                  <l>He must of course provoke a duel;</l>
                  <l>And should he 'scape this bold affray,</l>
                  <l>And "live to fight another day,"</l>
                  <l>He only lives to see his spouse</l>
                  <l>Gallant with others and carouse,</l>
                  <l>To feel each morn his horns a sprouting,</l>
                  <l>Which must be <hi>pleasant</hi> past all doubting.</l>
                  <l>But these are jars in private station,</l>
                  <l>A mortal stab to reputation,</l>
                  <l>A kind of murder in the retail,</l>
                  <l>Of which there is a lengthy detail.</l>
                  <l>But public feuds should widely alter,</l>

Men are not mushrooms—by this light!</l>

                     <l>But all her arguments won't do</l>
                     <l>She's thrown out ev'ry art and lure</l>
                     <l>About the loan and her douceur,</l>
                     <l>And laid on flattery so thick,</l>
                     <l>We thought it would have made us sick.</l>
                     <l>Tho' Adam was by woman drawn in,</l>
                     <l>We'll not be done by Gallic fawning;</l>
                     <l>Eve was a beauty form'd to win,</l>
                     <l>No wonder Adam gave it in.</l>
                     <l>Her beauteous limbs! her lovely Face,</l>
                     <l>Was <hi>nature'</hi>s dignity and grace,</l>
                     <l>She gave the apple with a grandeur!</l>
                     <l>No man existing, cou'd withstand her!</l>
                     <l>Now your sweet lady gave disgust,</l>
                     <l>For she demanded money <hi>first,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>The part she play'd we must deplore,</l>
                     <l>Was too much like a common wh—e;</l>
                     <l>She flew like lightning when she found</l>
                     <l>She'd lost the <hi>fifty thousand pound;</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>However, sirs, we'll not dispute,</l>
                     <l>But give an answer to your suit.</l>
                     <l>Firm as a rock! we'll ever stand,</l>
                     <l>And scorn the schemes of Talleyrand,</l>
                     <l>Not France with all her pow'r combin'd,</l>
                     <l>Shall shake the purpose of our mind.</l>
                     <l>Talk not of "faith, of public trust,"</l>
                     <l>When you're unwilling to be just;</l>
                     <l>

Insult no more, no more intrude,</l>
                     <l>And let this visit now conclude;</l>
                     <l>Too long we've borne your galling pride,</l>
                     <l>'Tis now high time we should divide;</l>
                     <l>Return no more, unless your nation</l>
                     <l>Will pay for every depredation.</l>
                     <l>The path great WASHINGTON has trod,</l>
                     <l>Shall lead Columbians to their GOD;</l>
                     <l>On this grand <hi>base</hi> we'll stand or fall,</l>
                     <l>And hurl defiance on each Gaul.</l>
