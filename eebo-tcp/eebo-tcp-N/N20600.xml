            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Mode≈øty, however, widely differs from an awkward ba≈øhfulne≈øs, which is as much to be condemned as the other is to be applauded. To appear ≈øimple is as ill-bred as to be impudent. A young man ought to be able to come into a room and addre≈øs the company without the lea≈øt embarra≈ø≈øment. To be out of countenance when ≈øpoken to, and not to have an an≈øwer ready, is ridiculous to the la≈øt degree.</p>

                  <pb n="2" facs="unknown:027039_0005_0FD2F9C40C1B5D80"/>
An awkward country fellow, when he comes into company better than him≈øelf, is exceedingly di≈øconcerted. He knows not what to do with his hands or his hat, but either puts one of them in his pocket, and dangles the other by his ≈øide; or perhaps twirls his hat on his fingers, or fumbles with the button. If ≈øpoken to, he is in a much wor≈øe ≈øituation; he an≈øwers with the utmo≈øt difficulty, and nearly ≈øtammers; whereas, a gentleman who is acquainted with life, enters a room with gracefulne≈øs, and a mode≈øt a≈ø≈øurance, addre≈ø≈øes per≈øons whom he does not know, in an ea≈øy and natural manner, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the lea≈øt embarra≈ø≈øment. This is the characteri≈øtic of good breeding, a very nece≈ø≈øary knowledge in our intercour≈øe with men; for one of inferior parts, with the behaviour of a gentleman, is frequently better received than a man of ≈øen≈øe, with the addre≈øs and manners of a clown.</p>
               <p>Ignorance and vice are the only things we need be a≈øhamed of; ≈øteer clear of the≈øe, and you may go into any company you will; not that I would have a young man throw off all dread of appearing abroad, as a fear of offending or being di≈øe≈øteemed, will make him pre≈øerve a proper decorum. Some per≈øons, from experiencing the inconveniencies of fal≈øe mode≈øty, have run into the other extreme, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> acquired the name of impudent. This is as great a fault as the other. A well-bred man keeps him≈øelf between the two, and ≈øteers the middle way. He is ea≈øy and firm in every company, is mode≈øt, but not ba≈øhful, ≈øteady, but not impudent. He copies the manners of the better ≈øort of people, and conforms to their cu≈øtoms with ea≈øe and attention.</p>
               <p>Till we can pre≈øent our≈øelves in all companies with coolne≈øs and unconcern, we can never pre≈øent our≈øelves well; nor will a man ever be ≈øuppo≈øed to have kept good company<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> or ever be acceptable in ≈øuch company, if he cannot appear there ea≈øy and unembarra≈ø≈øed. A mode≈øt a≈ø≈øurance, in every part of life, is the mo≈øt advantageous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification we can po≈ø≈øibly acquire.</p>
               <p>In≈øtead of becoming in≈øolent, a man of ≈øen≈øe, under a con≈øciou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of merit, is more mode≈øt. He behaves him≈øelf indeed with firmne≈øs, but without the lea≈øt pre≈øumption. The man who is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his own merit, is no le≈øs a fool, than he who is con≈øtantly di≈øplaying it. A man of under≈øtanding avails him≈øelf of his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but never boa≈øts of them; whereas the timid and ba≈øhful can never pu≈øh him≈øelf in life, be his merit as great as it will; he will be always kept behind by the forward and the bu≈øtling. A man of abilities, and acquainted with life, will ≈øtand as firm in defence of his own rights, as the mo≈øt impudent man alive; but then he does it with a ≈øeeming mode≈øty. Thus, manner is every thing; what is impudence in one, is proper a≈ø≈øurance only in another; for firmne≈øs is commendable, but an overbearing conduct is di≈øgu≈øtful.</p>
               <p>Forwardne≈øs being the very rever≈øe of mode≈øty, follow rather than lead the company: that is, join in di≈øcour≈øe upon ≈øubjects, rather than ≈øtart one of your own; if you have parts, you will have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities enough of ≈øhowing them on every topic of conver≈øation; and if you have none, it is better to expo≈øe your≈øelf upon a ≈øubject of other people's than one of your own.</p>
               <p>But, be particularly careful not to ≈øpeak of your≈øelf, if you can help it. An impudent fellow lugs in him≈øelf abruptly upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øions,

and is ever the hero of his own ≈øtory. Others will colour their arrogance with, "It may ≈øeem ≈øtrange, indeed, that I ≈øhould talk in this manner of my≈øelf; it is what I by no means like, and ≈øhould never do, if I had not been cruelly and unju≈øtly accu≈øed; but when my character is attacked; it is a ju≈øtice I owe to my≈øelf to defend it." This veil is too thin not to be ≈øeen through on the fir≈øt in≈øpection.</p>
               <p>Others again, with more art, will <hi>mode≈øtly</hi> boa≈øt of all the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal virtues, by calling the≈øe virtues, weakne≈ø≈øes, and ≈øaying, they are ≈øo unfortunate as to fall into weakne≈ø≈øes.

"I cannot avoid ≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth, though it is often very imprudent," and ≈øo on.</p>
               <p>This angling for prai≈øe is ≈øo prevailing a principle, that it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øtoops to the lowe≈øt objects. Men will often boa≈øt of doing that, which, if true, would be rather a di≈øgrace to them than otherwi≈øe.

Thus for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was a ≈øuperior, the ma≈øter of the table, to offer you a thing of which there was but one, to pa≈øs it to the per≈øon next you, would be directly charging him that offered it to you, with a want of good manners and proper re≈øpect to his company; or, if you were the only ≈øtranger pre≈øent, it would be a rudene≈øs if you would make a feint of refu≈øing it, without the cu≈øtomary apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, "I cannot think of taking it from you, ≈øir;" or, "I am ≈øorry to deprive you of it;" as it is ≈øuppo≈øed he is con≈øcious of his own rank, and if he cho≈øe not to give it, would not have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it; your apology, therefore, in this ca≈øe, is putting him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an equality with your≈øelf. In like manner, it is rudene≈øs to draw back when reque≈øted by a ≈øuperior to pa≈øs a door fir≈øt, or to ≈øtep into a carriage before him. In ≈øhort, it would be endle≈øs to particulari≈øe all the in≈øtances in which a well-bred man ≈øhows his politene≈øs in good company, ≈øuch as not yawning, ≈øinging, whi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, warming his breech at the fire, lounging, putting his legs upon the chairs, and the like; familiarities, every man's good ≈øen≈øe mu≈øt condemn, and good breeding abhor.</p>
               <p>But good breeding con≈øi≈øts in more than merely not being ill-bred. To return a bow, ≈øpeak when you are ≈øpoken to, and ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing rude, are ≈øuch negative acts of good breeding, that they are little more than not being a brute. Would it not be a very poor recommendation of any man's cleanline≈øs, to ≈øay, that, he was not offen≈øive? If we wi≈øh for the good will and e≈øteem of our acquaintance, our good breeding mu≈øt be active, cheerful, officious and ≈øeducing.</p>
               <p>For example, ≈øhould you invite any one to dine or ≈øup with you, recollect whether ever you had ob≈øerved them to prefer one thing to another, and endeavour to procure that thing; when at table, ≈øay, "At ≈øuch a time, I think, you ≈øecured to give this di≈øh a preference, I therefore ordered it." "This is the wine I ob≈øerved you be≈øt like, I have therefore been at ≈øome pains to procure it." Trifling as the≈øe things may appear, they prove an attention to the per≈øon they are ≈øaid to; and as attention in trifles is the te≈øt of re≈øpect, the compliment will not be lo≈øt.</p>
               <p>I need only refer you to your own brea≈øt. How have the≈øe little attentions when ≈øhown you by others, flattered that ≈øelf-love which no man is free from? They incline and attach us to that per≈øon, and prejudice us afterwards to all that he ≈øays or does. The declaration of the women in a great degree, ≈øtamps a man's reputation of being either ill or well bred; you mu≈øt then, in a manner overwhelm them with the≈øe attentions; they are u≈øed to them, and naturally expect them; and to do them ju≈øtice, they are ≈øeldom lo≈øt upon them. You mu≈øt be ≈øedulous to wait upon them, pick up with alacrity any thing they drop, and be very officious in procuring their carriages or chairs in public places; he blind to what you ≈øhould not ≈øee, and deaf to what you ≈øhould not hear. Opportunities of ≈øhowing the≈øe attentions are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually

pre≈øenting them≈øelves; but in ca≈øe they ≈øhould not, you mu≈øt ≈øtudy to create them.</p>
               <p>If ever you would be e≈øteemed by the women, your conver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them ≈øhould be always re≈øpectful, lively, and addre≈ø≈øed to their vanity. Every thing you ≈øay or do, ≈øhould tend to ≈øhow a regard to their beauty or good ≈øen≈øe: even men are not without their vanities of one kind or other, and flattering that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by words and looks of approbation, is one of the principal characters of good breeding.</p>
               <p>Addre≈øs and manners, with weak per≈øons, who are actually three-fourths of the world, are every thing; and even people of the be≈øt under≈øtanding are taken in with them. Where the heart is not won, and the eye plea≈øed, the mind will be ≈øeldom on our ≈øide.</p>
               <p>In ≈øhort, learning and erudition, without good breeding, is tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome and pedantic; and an ill-bred man is as unfit for good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as he will be unwelcome in it. Nay, he is full as unfit for bu≈øine≈øs as for company. Make then, good breeding the great object of your thoughts and actions. Be particularly ob≈øervant of, and endeavour to imitate, the behaviour and manners of ≈øuch as are di≈øtingui≈øhed by their politene≈øs; and be per≈øuaded, that good breeding is to all worldly qualifications, what charity is to all chri≈øtian virtues; it adorns merit, and often covers the want of it.</p>

               <p>IN all good company, we meet with a certain manner, phra≈øeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and general conver≈øation, that di≈øtingui≈øhes the man of fa≈øhion. This can only be acquired by frequenting good company and being particularly attentive to all that pa≈ø≈øes there.</p>
               <p>When invited to dine or ≈øup at the hou≈øe of any well-bred man, ob≈øerve how he does the honours of his table, and mark his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of treating his company.</p>
               <p>Attend to the compliments of congratulation or condolence that he pays; and take notice of his addre≈øs to his ≈øuperiors, his equals and his inferiors; nay his very looks and tone of voice are worth your attention, for we cannot plea≈øe without an union of them all.</p>
               <p>There is a certain di≈øtingui≈øhing diction that marks the man of fa≈øhion, a certain language of conver≈øation that every gentleman ≈øhould be ma≈øter of. Saying to a man ju≈øt married, "I wi≈øh you joy," or to one who had lo≈øt his wife, "I am ≈øorry for your lo≈øs," and both perhaps with an unbecoming countenance, may be civil, but it is neverthele≈øs vulgar. A man of fa≈øhion will expre≈øs the ≈øame thing more elegantly, and with a look of ≈øincerity, that, ≈øhall attract the e≈øteem of the per≈øon he ≈øpeaks to. He will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to the one with warmth and cheerfulne≈øs, and perhaps ≈øqueezing him by the hand, will ≈øay, "Believe me, my dear ≈øir, I have ≈øcarce words to expre≈øs the joy I feel, upon your happy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with ≈øuch and ≈øuch a family, &amp;c." to the other in affliction he will advance flower, and with a peculiar compo≈øure of voice and countenance, begin his compliments of condolence with, "I hope ≈øir, you will do me the ju≈øtice to be per≈øuaded, that I am not in≈øen≈øible of your unhappine≈øs, that I take part in your di≈øtre≈øs, and ≈øhall ever be affected where <hi>you</hi> are ≈øo."</p>

               <p>What the world calls an ab≈øent man is, generally either a very affected one, or a very weak one; but whether weak or affected, he is, in company, a very di≈øagreeable man.

He forgets what he ≈øaid la≈øt, leaves his hat in one room, his cane in another, and his ≈øword in a third; nay if it was not for his buckles, he would even leave his ≈øhoes behind him. Neither his arms <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He joins not in the general conver≈øation, except by fits and ≈øtarts, as if awaking from a dream; I attribute this either to weakne≈øs or affectation. His ≈øhallow mind is po≈ø≈øibly not able to attend to more than one thing at a time; or he would be ≈øuppo≈øed wrapt up in the inve≈øtigation of ≈øome very important matter. Such men as Sir I≈øaac Newton or Mr. Locke, might occa≈øionally, have ≈øome excu≈øe for ab≈øence of mind; it might proceed from that inten≈øene≈øs of thought that was nece≈ø≈øary at all times for the ≈øcientific ≈øubjects they were ≈øtudying; but for a young man, and a man of the world, who has no ≈øuch plea to make, ab≈øence of mind is a rudene≈øs to the company, and de≈øerves the ≈øevere≈øt cen≈øure.</p>
               <p>However in≈øignificant a company may be; however trifling their conver≈øation; while you are with them, do not ≈øhow them by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention, that you think them trifling; that can never be the way to plea≈øe; but rather fall in with their weakne≈øs than otherwi≈øe; for, to mortify, or ≈øhow the lea≈øt contempt to tho≈øe we are in company with, is the greate≈øt rudene≈øs we can be guilty of, and what few can forgive.</p>

I never yet found a man inattentive to the per≈øon he feared, or the woman he loved; which convinces me, that ab≈øence of mind is to be got the better of, if we think proper to make the trial; and believe me it is always worth the attempt.</p>
               <p>Ab≈øence of mind is a tacit declaration, that tho≈øe we are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with, are not worth attending to; and what can be a greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front?‚ÄîBe≈øides, can an ab≈øent man improve by what is ≈øaid or done in his pre≈øence?‚ÄîNo; he may frequent the be≈øt companies for years together, and all to no purpo≈øe.

               <p>Man is made up of ≈øuch a variety of matter, that to ≈øearch him thoroughly, requires time and attention; for though we are all made of the ≈øame materials, and have all the ≈øame pa≈ø≈øions, yet from a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in their proportion and combination, we vary in our di≈øpo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; what is agreeable to one is di≈øagreeable to another, and what one ≈øhall approve another ≈øhall condemn.

               <p>You cannot judge of other mens minds better than by ≈øtudying your own; for though ≈øome men have one foible, and another has another, yet men in general are very much alike. Whatever plea≈øes or offends you, will in ≈øimilar circum≈øtances, plea≈øe or offend others; if you find your≈øelf hurt when another makes you feel his ≈øuperiority, you will certainly, upon the common rule of right, <hi>do as you would be done by,</hi> take care not to let another feel <hi>your</hi> ≈øuperiority, if you have it; e≈øpecially if you wi≈øh to gain his intere≈øt or e≈øteem.

You may po≈ø≈øibly tell me that this coolne≈øs mu≈øt be natural, for if not, you can never acquire it. I will admit the force of con≈øtitution, but people are very apt to blame for many things they might readily avoid. Care with a little reflexion will ≈øoon give you this ma≈øtery of your temper and your countenance. If you find your≈øelf ≈øubject to ≈øudden ≈øtarts of pa≈ø≈øion, determine with your≈øelf not to utter a ≈øingle word till your rea≈øon has recovered it≈øelf; and re≈øolve to keep your countenance as unmoved as po≈ø≈øible.

               <p>In the cour≈øe of life; we ≈øhall find it nece≈ø≈øary very often to put on a plea≈øing countenance when we are exceedingly di≈øplea≈øed; we mu≈øt frequently ≈øeem friendly when we are quite otherwi≈øe.

On receiving an affront, if you cannot be ju≈øtified in knocking the offender down, you mu≈øt not notice the offence; for, in the eye of the world, taking an affront calmly is con≈øidered as cowardice,</p>

politene≈øs, or the ≈øword. If a man openly and de≈øignedly affronts you, call him out; but if it does not amount to an open in≈øult, be outwardly civil; if this does not make him a≈øhamed of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, it will prejudice every by-≈øtander in your favour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of being di≈øgraced, you will come off with honour. Politene≈øs to tho≈øe you do not re≈øpect, is no more a breach of faith, than <hi>your humble ≈øervant</hi> at the bottom of a challenge; they are univer≈øally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood to be things of cour≈øe.</p>
               <p>Wrangling and quarreling are characteri≈øtic of a weak mind; leave that to the women, be <hi>you</hi> always above it. Enter into no ≈øharp conte≈øt, and pride your≈øelf, in ≈øhowing, if po≈ø≈øible, more civility to your antagoni≈øt than to any other in company; this will infallibly bring over all the laughers to your ≈øide, and the per≈øons you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with, will be very likely to confe≈øs you have behaved very hand≈øomely throughout the whole affair.</p>
               <p>Experience will teach us, that though all men con≈øi≈øt principally of the ≈øame materials, as I before took notice, yet for a difference in their proportion, no two men are uniformly the ≈øame: we differ from one another, and we often differ from our≈øelves, that is, we ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do things utterly incon≈øi≈øtent with the general tenor of our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. The wi≈øe≈øt man will occa≈øionally do a weak thing; the mo≈øt hone≈øt man a wrong thing; the proude≈øt man a mean thing; and the wor≈øt of men will ≈øometimes do a good thing. On this account, our ≈øtudy of mankind ≈øhould not be general: we ≈øhould take a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent view of individuals, and though we may upon the whole form a judgment of the man from his prevailing pa≈ø≈øion or his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral character, yet it will be prudent not to determine, till we have waited to ≈øee the operations of his ≈øubordinate appetites and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
               <p>For example: a man's general character may be that of ≈øtrictly hone≈øt; I would not di≈øpute it, becau≈øe, I would not be thought envious or malevolent; but I would not rely upon this general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, ≈øo as to entru≈øt him with my fortune or my life. Should this hone≈øt man, as is not uncommon, be my rival in power, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt, or love, he may po≈ø≈øibly do things, that in other circum≈øtances he would abhor: and power, intere≈øt and love, let me tell you, will often put hone≈øty to the ≈øevere≈øt trial, and frequently overpower it. I would then ran≈øack this hone≈øt man to the bottom, if I wi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to tru≈øt him, and as I found him, would place my confidence accordingly.</p>
               <p>One of the great compo≈øitions in our nature is vanity, to which all men more or le≈øs give way.</p>
               <p>Women have an intolerable ≈øhare of it. No flattery, no adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too gro≈øs for them; tho≈øe who flatter them mo≈øt plea≈øe them be≈øt, and they are mo≈øt in love with them: and the lea≈øt ≈ølight or contempt of them is never forgotten. It is in ≈øome mea≈øure the ≈øame with men; they will ≈øooner pardon an injury than an in≈øult, and are more hurt by contempt than by ill u≈øage. Though all men do not boa≈øt of ≈øuperior talents, though they pretend not to the abilities of a Pope, a Newton, or a Bolingbroke, every one who pretends to have common ≈øen≈øe, and to di≈øcharge his office in life with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon decency; to arraign therefore, in any ≈øhape his abilities or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027039_0023_0FD2F9F032F7B2F0"/>
in the department he holds, is an in≈øult he will not readily forgive.</p>
               <p>As I would not have you tru≈øt too implicitly to a man, becau≈øe the world gives him a good character; ≈øo I mu≈øt particularly caution you again≈øt tho≈øe who ≈øpeak well of them≈øelves. In general ≈øu≈øpect tho≈øe who boa≈øt of, or affect to have any one virtue above all others, for they are commonly impo≈øtors. There are exceptions however to this rule, for we hear of prudes that have been cha≈øte, bullies that have been brave, and ≈øaints that have been religious. Confide only where your own ob≈øervation ≈øhall direct you; ob≈øerve not only what is ≈øaid, but how it is ≈øaid, and if you have any penetration, you may find out the truth better by your eyes than your ears; in ≈øhort, never take a character upon common report, but enquire into it your≈øelf; for common report, though it is right in general, may be wrong in particulars.</p>
               <p>Beware of tho≈øe who on a ≈øhort acquaintance, make you a tender of their friend≈øhip, and ≈øeem to place a confidence in you; 'tis ten to one but they deceive and betray you; however, do not rudely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them upon ≈øuch a ≈øuppo≈øition: you may be civil to them, though you do not entru≈øt them. Silly men are apt to ≈øolicit your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip and unbo≈øom them≈øelves upon the fir≈øt acquaintance; ≈øuch a friend cannot be worth hearing, their friend≈øhip being as ≈ølender as their under≈øtanding; and if they proffer their friend≈øhip with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign to make a property of you, they are dangerous acquaintance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Not but the little friend≈øhips of the weak may be of ≈øome u≈øe to you, if you do not return the compliment; and it may not be ami≈øs to ≈øeem to accept tho≈øe of de≈øigning men, keeping them, as it were, in play, that they may not be openly your enemies; for their enmity is the next dangerous thing to their friend≈øhip. We may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly hold their vices in abhorrence, without being marked out as their per≈øonal enemy. The general rule is to have a real re≈øerve with almo≈øt every one, and a ≈øeeming re≈øerve with almo≈øt no one: for it is very di≈øgu≈øting to ≈øeem re≈øerved, and very dangerous not to be ≈øo. Few ob≈øerve the true medium. Many are ridiculou≈øly my≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious upon trifles, and many indi≈øcreetly communicative of all they know.</p>
               <p>There is a kind of ≈øhort-lived friend≈øhip that takes place among young men, from a connexion in their plea≈øures only; a friend≈øhip too often attended with bad con≈øequences. This companion of your plea≈øures, young and unexperienced, will probably in the heat of convivial mirth, vow a perpetual friend≈øhip, and unfold him≈øelf to you without the lea≈øt re≈øerve: but new a≈ø≈øociations, change of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or change of place, may ≈øoon break this ill-timed connexion and an improper u≈øe may be made of it. Be one if you will, in young companies, and bear your part like others in all the ≈øocial fe≈øtivity of youth; nay, tru≈øt them with your innocent frolics, but keep your ≈øerious matters to your≈øelf; and if you mu≈øt at any time make <hi>them</hi> known, let it be to ≈øome tried friend of great experience; and that nothing may tempt him to become your rival, let that friend be in a different walk of life from your≈øelf.</p>
               <p>Were I to hear a man making ≈øtrong prote≈øtations and ≈øwearing to the truth of the thing that is in it≈øelf probable, and very likely to

be, I ≈øhould doubt his veracity; for when he takes ≈øuch pains to make me believe it, it cannot be a good de≈øign.</p>
               <p>There is a certain ea≈øine≈øs or fal≈øe mode≈øty in mo≈øt young people, that either makes them unwilling, or a≈øhamed to refu≈øe any thing that is a≈øked of them. There is al≈øo an unguarded openne≈øs about them, that makes them the ready prey of the artful and de≈øigning. They are ea≈øily led away by the feigned friend≈øhips of a knave or a fool, and too ra≈øhly place a confidence in them, that terminates in their lo≈øs, and frequently in their ruin. Beware therefore, as I ≈øaid before, of the≈øe proffered friend≈øhips; repay them with compliments, but not with confidence. Never let your vanity make you ≈øuppo≈øe, that people become your friends on a ≈ølight acquaintance; for good offices mu≈øt be ≈øhown upon both ≈øides to create a friend≈øhip: it will not thrive unle≈øs its love be mutual; and it requires time to ripen it.</p>
               <p>There is ≈øtill among young people another kind of friend≈øhip, merely nominal, warm indeed for the time, but fortunately of no long continuance. This friend≈øhip takes it ri≈øe from their pur≈øuing the ≈øame cour≈øe of riot and debauchery; their pur≈øes are open to each other, they tell one another all they know; they embark in the ≈øame quarrels, and ≈øtand by each other on all occa≈øions. I ≈øhould rather call this a confederacy again≈øt good morals and good manners, and think it de≈øerves the ≈øevere≈øt la≈øh of the law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> but, they have the impudence to call it friend≈øhip. However, it is often as ≈øuddenly di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved as it is ha≈øtily contracted; ≈øome accident di≈øper≈øes them, and they pre≈øently forget each other, except it be to betray and to laugh at their own egregious folly.</p>
               <p>In ≈øhort, the ≈øum of the whole is, to make a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween companies and friends, for a very agreeable companion has often proved a very dangerous friend.</p>

               <p>It may po≈ø≈øibly be que≈øtioned, whether a man has it always in his power to get into good company: undoubtedly, by de≈øerving it he has; provided he is in circum≈øtances which enable him to live and appear in the ≈øtyle of a gentleman.

               <p>Though the company of men of learning and genius is highly to be valued and occa≈øionally coveted, I would by no means have you always found in ≈øuch company.

               <p>The vanity I mean, is that of being the fir≈øt of the company. This pride, though too common, is idle to the la≈øt degree. Nothing in the world lets a man down ≈øo much.

Depend upon it, in the e≈øtimation of mankind, you will ≈øink or ri≈øe to the level of the company you keep.</p>
               <p>Be it, then, your ambition to get into the be≈øt company; and, when there, imitate their virtues, but not their vices. You have no doubt, often heard of genteel and fa≈øhionable vices. The≈øe are whoreing, drinking and gaming. It has happened that ≈øome men, even with the≈øe vices, have been admired and e≈øteemed.

               <p>Frequent and loud laughter is a ≈øure ≈øign of a weak mind, and no le≈øs characteri≈øtic of a low education. It is the manner in which low-bred men expre≈øs their ≈øilly joy, at ≈øilly things, and they call it being merry.</p>

True wit never made a man of fa≈øhion laugh; he is above it. It may create a ≈ømile, but a loud laughter ≈øhows, that a man has not the command of him≈øelf, every one who would wi≈øh to appear ≈øen≈øible mu≈øt abhor it.</p>

               <head>SUNDRY LITTLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS.</head>
               <p>I HAVE had rea≈øons to ob≈øerve before, that various little matters, apparently trifling in them≈øelves, con≈øpire to form the <hi>whole</hi> of plea≈øing, as in a well fini≈øhed portrait, a variety of colours combine to complete the piece. It not being nece≈ø≈øary to dwell much upon them, I ≈øhall content my≈øelf, with ju≈øt mentioning them as they occur.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To do the honours of a table gracefully, is one of the outlines of a well-bred man; and to carve well, is an article, little as it may ≈øeem, that is u≈øeful twice every day, and the doing of which ill, is not only trouble≈øome to one's ≈øelf, but renders us di≈øagreeable and ridiculous to others. We are always in pain for a man, who in≈øtead of cutting up a fowl genteelly, is hacking for half an hour acro≈øs the the bone, grea≈øing him≈øelf, and be≈øpattering the company with the ≈øauce. U≈øe, with a little attention, is all that is requi≈øite to acquit your≈øelf in this particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To be well received, you mu≈øt al≈øo pay ≈øome attention to your behaviour at table, where it is exceedingly rude to ≈øcratch any part of your body, to ≈øpit or blow your no≈øe, if you can po≈ø≈øibly avoid it, to eat greedily, to lean your elbows on the table, to pick your teeth before the di≈øhes are removed, or to leave the table before grace is ≈øaid.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Drinking of healths is now growing out of fa≈øhion, and is very unpolite in good company. Cu≈øtom once had made it univer≈øal, but the improved manners of the age now renders it vulgar. What can be more rude, or ridiculous than to interrupt per≈øons at their mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> with an unnece≈ø≈øary compliment? Ab≈øtain then from this ≈øilly cu≈øtom, where you find it out of u≈øe; and u≈øe it only at tho≈øe tables where it continues general.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A polite manner of refu≈øing to comply with the ≈øolicitations of a company, is al≈øo very nece≈ø≈øary to be learnt; for, a young man, who ≈øeems to have no will of his own, but does every thing that is a≈øked of him, may be a very good-natured fellow, but he is a very ≈øilly one. If you are invited to drink at any man's hou≈øe, more than you think is whole≈øome, you may ≈øay, "you wi≈øh you could, but that ≈øo little makes you both drunk and ≈øick, that you ≈øhall only be bad company by doing it: of cour≈øe, beg to be excu≈øed." If de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired to play at cards deeper than you would, refu≈øe it ludicrou≈øly; tell them, <q>if you were ≈øure to lo≈øe, you might po≈ø≈øibly ≈øit down; but that as fortune may be favourable, you dread the thought of having too much money, ever ≈øince you found what an incumbrance it was to poor Harlequin, and therefore you are re≈øolved never to put your≈øelf in the way of winning more than ≈øuch or ≈øuch a ≈øum a-day.</q> This light way of declining invitations to vice and folly, is more becoming a young man, than philo≈øophical or ≈øententious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øals, which would only be laughed at.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now I am on the ≈øubject of cards, I mu≈øt not omit mentioning the nece≈ø≈øity of playing them well and genteelly, if you would be thought to have kept company. I would by no means recommend play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at cards as a part of your ≈øtudy, le≈øt you would grow too fond of

                  </gap> and the con≈øequence prove bad. It were better not to know a diamond from a club, than to become a gambler; but, as cu≈øtom has introduced innocent card-playing at mo≈øt friendly meetings, it marks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>he gentleman to handle them genteelly, and play them well, and as I hope you will play only for ≈ømall ≈øums, ≈øhould you lo≈øe your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, pray lo≈øe it with temper; or if you win, receive your winnings without elation or greedine≈øs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To write well and correct, and in a plea≈øing ≈øtyle, is another part of polite education. Every man who has the u≈øe of his eyes and right hand, can write whatever hand he plea≈øes. Nothing is ≈øo illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral as a ≈øchool-boy's ≈øcrawl. I would not have you learn a ≈øtiff formal hand-writing like that of a ≈øchool-ma≈øter, but a genteel, legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and liberal hand, and to be able to write quick. As to the correctne≈øs and elegance of your writing, attention to grammar does the one, and to the be≈øt authors the other. Epi≈øtolary corre≈øpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ≈øhould not be carried on in a ≈øtudied or affected ≈øtyle, but the language ≈øhould flow from the pen, as naturally and as ea≈øily as it would from the mouth. In ≈øhort, a letter ≈øhould be penned in the ≈øame ≈øtyle, as you would talk to your friend if he were pre≈øent.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If writing well ≈øhows the gentleman, much more ≈øo does ≈øpell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well. It is ≈øo e≈ø≈øentially nece≈ø≈øary for a gentleman, or a man of letters, that one fal≈øe ≈øpelling may fix a ridicule on him for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his life. Words in books are generally well ≈øpelled, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the orthography of the age; reading therefore, with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, will teach every one to ≈øpell right. It ≈øometimes happens that words ≈øhall be ≈øpelled differently by different authors; but if you ≈øpell them upon the authority of one, in e≈øtimation of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, you will e≈øcape ridicule. Where there is but one way of ≈øpelling a word, by your ≈øpelling it wrong, you will be ≈øure to be laughed at. For a <hi>woman</hi> of a tolerable education would laugh at and de≈øpi≈øe her lover, if he wrote to her, and the words were ill-≈øpelled. Be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly attentive then to your ≈øpelling.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There is nothing that a young man, at his fir≈øt appearance in life, ought more to dread, than having any ridicule fixed on him. In the e≈øtimation even of the mo≈øt rational men, it will le≈ø≈øen him, but ruin him with all the re≈øt. Many a man has been undone by a ridiculous nick-name. The cau≈øes of nick-names among well-bred men, are generally the little defects in manner, air, or addre≈øs. To have the appellation of ill-bred, awkward, muttering, left-leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or any other, tacked always to your name, would injure you more than you are aware of; avoid then tho≈øe little defects, (and they are ea≈øily avoided) and you need never fear a nick-name.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Some young men are apt to think that they cannot be complete gentlemen, without becoming men of plea≈øure: and the rake they often mi≈øtake for the man of plea≈øure. A rake is made up of the meane≈øt and mo≈øt di≈øgraceful vices. They all combine to degrade his character, and ruin his health and fortune<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> A man of plea≈øure will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>efine upon the enjoyments of the age, attend them with decency and partake of them becomingly. Indeed he is too often le≈øs ≈øcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous than he ≈øhould be, and frequently has the cau≈øe to repent it. A man of plea≈øure at be≈øt is but a di≈ø≈øipated being, and what the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional part of mankind mu≈øt abhor; I mention it however, le≈øt in taking up the man of plea≈øure, you ≈øhould fall into the rake: for of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:027039_0029_0FD2F9FB874851A0"/>
two evils, always choo≈øe the lea≈øt. A di≈ø≈øolute flagitious footman may make as good a rake as a man of the fir≈øt quality. Few men can be men of plea≈øure; every man may be a rake. There is a certain dignity that ≈øhould be pre≈øerved in all our plea≈øures; in love a man may lo≈øe his heart without lo≈øing his no≈øe; at table, a man may have a di≈øtingui≈øhing palate without being a glutton; he may love wine without being a drunkard; he may game without being a gambler; and ≈øo on. Every virtue has its kindred vice, and every plea≈øure its neighbouring di≈øgrace. Temperance and moderation, mark the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; but exce≈øs the black-guard. Attend carefully then to the line that divides them; and remember to ≈øtop rather a yard ≈øhort, than ≈øtep an inch beyond it. Weigh the pre≈øent enjoyment of your plea≈øures again≈øt the nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequences of them, and I will leave you to your own determination.</p>
               <p n="10">10. A gentleman has ever ≈øome regard al≈øo to the <hi>choice</hi> of his amu≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If at cards, he will not be ≈øeen at cribbage, all-fours, or putt; or, in ≈øports of exerci≈øe, at ≈økittles, foot-ball, leap-frog, cricket, driving of coaches, &amp;c. but will pre≈øerve a propriety in every part of his conduct; knowing that any imitations of the manners of the mob, will unavoidably ≈øtamp him with vulgarity. There is another amu≈øement too, which I cannot help calling illiberal, that is, playing upon any mu≈øical in≈øtrument. Mu≈øic is commonly reckoned one of the liberal arts, and undoubtedly is ≈øo; but to be piping or fiddling at a concert is degrading to a man of fa≈øhion. If you love mu≈øic, hear it; pay fiddlers to play to you, but never fiddle your≈øelf. It makes a gentleman appear frivolous and contemptible, leads him fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently into bad company, and wa≈øtes that time which might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe be well employed.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Secrecy is another characteri≈øtic of good breeding. Be careful never to tell in one company what you ≈øee or hear in another; much le≈øs to divert the pre≈øent company at the expence of the la≈øt. Things apparently indifferent may, when often repeated and told abroad, have much more ≈øerious con≈øequences than imagined. In conver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is generally a tacit reliance, that what is ≈øaid will not be repeated; and a man, though not enjoined to ≈øecrecy, will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded company if found to be a tatler; be≈øides, he will draw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf into a thou≈øand ≈øcrapes, and every one will be afraid to ≈øpeak before him.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Pulling out your watch in company una≈øked, either at home or abroad, is a mark of ill-breeding; if at home, it appears as if you were tired of your company, and wi≈øhed them to be gone; if abroad, as if the hours dragged heavily, and you wi≈øhed to be gone your≈øelf. If you want to know the time, withdraw; be≈øides, as the taking what is called a French leave was introduced, that on the per≈øon's leaving the company, the re≈øt might not be di≈øturbed; look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at your watch does what that piece of politene≈øs was de≈øigned to prevent; it is a kind of dictating to all pre≈øent, and telling them it is time, or almo≈øt time to break up.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Among other things let me caution you again≈øt ever being in a hurry: a man of ≈øen≈øe may be in ha≈øte, but he is never in a hurry: convinced that hurry is the ≈øure≈øt way to make him do what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes ill. To be in a hurry is a proof that the bu≈øine≈øs we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:027039_0030_0FD2F9FD16962290"/>
in is too great for us; of cour≈øe, it is the mark of little minds, that are puzzled and perplexed, when they ≈øhould be cool and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate; they wi≈øh do every thing at once, and are thus able to do nothing. Be ≈øteady then, in all your engagements; look round you, before you begin; and remember that you had better do half of them well, and leave the re≈øt undone, than do the whole indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently.</p>
               <p n="14">14. From a kind of fal≈øe mode≈øty, mo≈øt young men are apt to con≈øider familiarity as unbecoming. Forwardne≈øs, I allow is ≈øo; but there is a decent familiarity that is nece≈ø≈øary in the cour≈øe of life. More formal vi≈øits, upon formal invitations, are not the thing; they create no connexion, nor will they prove of ≈øervice to you; it is the carele≈øs and ea≈øy ingre≈øs and egre≈øs, at all hours, that ≈øecures an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance to our intere≈øt, and this is acquired by a re≈øpectful familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity entered into, without forfeiting your con≈øequence.</p>
               <p n="15">15. In acquiring new acquaintances, be careful not to neglect your old, for a flight of this kind is ≈øeldom forgiven. If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be with your former acquaintance ≈øo often as you u≈øed to be when you had no others, take care not to give them cau≈øe to think you neglect them: call upon them frequently though you cannot ≈øtay long with them; tell them, you are ≈øorry to leave them ≈øo ≈øoon, and nothing ≈øhould take you away but certain engagements which good-manners oblige you to attend to; for it will be your intere≈øt to make all the friends you can, and as few enemies as po≈ø≈øible; by friends I would not be under≈øtood to mean confidential ones: but per≈øons who ≈øpeak of you re≈øpectfully, and who, con≈øi≈øtent with; their own intere≈øt, would wi≈øh to be of ≈øervice to you, and would rather do you good than harm.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Another thing I mu≈øt recommend to you, as characteri≈øtic of a polite education, and of having kept good company, is a graceful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of confering favours. The mo≈øt obliging things may be done ≈øo awkwardly as to offend, while the mo≈øt di≈øagreeable things may be done ≈øo agreeable as to plea≈øe.</p>
               <p n="17">17. A few more articles of general advice, and I have done; the fir≈øt is on the ≈øubject of vanity. It is the common failing of youth and ≈øuch as ought to be carefully guarded again≈øt. The vanity I mean, is that which, if given way to, ≈øtamps a man a coxcomb, a character he will find a difficulty to get rid of, perhaps as long as he lives. Now this vanity ≈øhows it≈øelf in a variety of ≈øhapes; one man ≈øhall pride him≈øelf in taking the lead in all conver≈øations, and peremptorily deciding upon every ≈øubject; another, de≈øirous of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ≈øucce≈øsful among the women, ≈øhall in≈øinuate the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he has met with, the conque≈øts he makes, and perhaps boa≈øts of favours he never received; if he ≈øpeaks truth, he is ungenerous; if fal≈øe, he is a villain, but whether true or fal≈øe, defeats his own purpo≈øes, overthrows the reputation he wi≈øhes to erect, and draws upon him≈øelf contempt in the room of re≈øpect. Some men are vain enough to think they acquire con≈øequence by alliance, or by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with per≈øons of di≈øtingui≈øhed character or abilities; hence they are continually telling of their grand-father lord ≈øuch-a-one; their kin≈øman Sir William ≈øuch-a-one; or their intimate friend Dr. ≈øuch-a-one; with whom perhaps they are ≈øcarce acquainted. If they are ever found out (and that they are ≈øure to be one time or other)
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027039_0031_0FD2FA020519ADE8"/>
they become ridiculous and contemptible: but even admitting what they ≈øay to be true, what then? A man's intrin≈øic merit does not ri≈øe from an ennobled alliance, or a reputable acquaintance. A rich man never borrows. When angling for prai≈øe, mode≈øty is the ≈øure≈øt bait. If we would wi≈øh to ≈øhine in any particular character, we mu≈øt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver affect that character. An affectation of courage will make a man pa≈øs for a bully; an affectation of wit for a coxcomb; and an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ≈øen≈øe for a fool. Not that I would recommend ba≈øhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs or timidity; no, I would have every one know his own value, yet not di≈øcover that he knows it, but leave his merit to be found out by others.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Another thing worth your attention is, if in company with an inferior, not to let him feel his inferiority; if he di≈øcovers it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf without your endeavour, the fault is not yours, and he will not blame you; but if you take pains to mortify him, or to make him feel him≈øelf inferior to you, in abilities, fortune, or rank, it is an in≈øult that will not readily be forgiven. In point of abilities it would be unju≈øt, as they are out of his power; in point of rank or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, it is ill-natured and ill-bred. This rule is never more nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary than at table, where there cannot be a greater in≈øult than to help an inferior to a part he di≈ølikes, or a part that may be wor≈øe than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and to take the be≈øt to your≈øelf. If you at any time invite an inferior to your table, you put him during the time he is there, upon an equality with you, and it is an act of the highe≈øt rudene≈øs to treat him in any re≈øpect ≈ølightingly. I would rather double my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ≈øuch a per≈øon, and treat him with additional re≈øpect, le≈øt he ≈øhould even ≈øuppo≈øe him≈øelf neglected. There cannot be a greater ≈øavagene≈øs or cruelty, or any thing more degrading to a man of fa≈øhion, than to put upon or take unbecoming liberties with him, who≈øe mode≈øty, humility, or re≈øpect will not ≈øuffer him to retaliate. True politene≈øs con≈øi≈øts in making every body about you happy; and as to mortify, is to render unhappy, it can be nothing but the wor≈øt of breeding. Make it a rule rather to flatter a per≈øon's vanity than otherwi≈øe; make him, if po≈ø≈øible, more in love with him≈øelf, and you will be certain to gain his e≈øteem; never tell him any thing he may not like to hear, nor ≈øay things that will put him out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, but let it be your ≈øtudy on all occa≈øions to plea≈øe; this will be making friends in≈øtead of enemies, and be a means of helping your≈øelf in the end.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Never be witty at the expence of any one pre≈øent, nor gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify that idle inclination, which is too ≈øtrong in mo≈øt young men, I mean laughing at, or ridiculing the weakne≈ø≈øes or infirmities of others, by way of diverting the company or di≈øplaying your own ≈øuperiority. Mo≈øt people have their weakne≈ø≈øes, their peculiar lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and aver≈øions. Some cannot bear the ≈øight of a cat; others the ≈ømell of chee≈øe, and ≈øo on; was you to laugh at tho≈øe men for their antipathies, or by de≈øign or inattention to bring them in their way, you could not in≈øult them more. You may po≈ø≈øibly thus gain the laugh on your ≈øide, for the pre≈øent, but it will make the per≈øon, perhaps, at who≈øe expence you are merry, your enemy for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and even tho≈øe who laugh with you, will, on a little reflexion, fear you and probably de≈øpi≈øe you; whereas, to procure what <hi>one</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:027039_0032_0FD2FA0415E44368"/>
likes, and remove what the <hi>other</hi> hates, would ≈øhow them that they were the objects of your attention, and po≈ø≈øibly make them more your friends than much greater ≈øervices would have done. If you have wit, u≈øe it to plea≈øe, but not to hurt. You may ≈øhine, but take care not to ≈øcorch. In ≈øhort, never ≈øeem to ≈øee the faults of others. Though among the ma≈øs of men, there are, doubtle≈øs, numbers of fools and knaves, yet were we to tell eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the≈øe we meet with, that we know them to be ≈øo, we ≈øhould be in perpetual war. I would dete≈øt the knave and pity the fool, wherever I found him; but I would let neither of them know unnece≈ø≈øarily that I did ≈øo; as I would not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du≈øtrious to make my≈øelf enemies. As one mu≈øt plea≈øe others, in order to be plea≈øed one's ≈øelf; con≈øider what is agreeable to you, mu≈øt be agreeable to them, and conduct your≈øelf accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Whi≈øpering in company is another act of ill-breeding: it ≈øeems to in≈øinuate, either that the per≈øons whom we would not wi≈øh ≈øhould hear, are unworthy of our confidence, or it may lead them to ≈øuppo≈øe we are ≈øpeaking improperly of them: on both accounts therefore, ab≈øtain from it.</p>
               <p n="21">21. So pulling out one letter after another, and reading them in company, or cutting and paring one's nails, is unpolite and rude. It ≈øeems to ≈øay, we are weary of the conver≈øation, and are in want of ≈øome amu≈øement to pa≈øs away the time.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Humming a tune to our≈øelves, drumming with our fingers on the table, making a noi≈øe with our feet, and ≈øuch like, are all breaches of good manners, and indications of our contempt for the per≈øons pre≈øent; therefore they ≈øhould not be indulged.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Walking fa≈øt in the ≈øtreets is a mark of vulgarity imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurry of bu≈øine≈øs: it may appear well in a mechanic of trade≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but it ≈øuits ill with the character of a gentleman or a man of fa≈øhion.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Staring any per≈øon you meet, full in the face, is an act al≈øo of ill-breeding; it looks as if you ≈øaw ≈øomething wonderful in his appearance, and is therefore a tacit reprehen≈øion</p>

Eating quick, or very ≈ølow at meals is characteri≈øtic of the vulgar; the fir≈øt infers poverty, that you have not had a good meal for ≈øome time; the la≈øt, if abroad, that you di≈ølike your entertaiment; if at home, that your are rude enough to ≈øet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your friends what you cannot eat your≈øelf. So again, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ≈øoup with your no≈øe in the plate is vulgar; it has the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of being u≈øed to hard work, and of cour≈øe an un≈øteady hand.

I have ≈øeen many ill-bred fellows do this, and have been ≈øo angry, that I could have kicked them from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

in a man of liberal education.

               <head>DIGNITY OF MANNERS.</head>
               <p>THERE is a certain dignity of manners, without which the very be≈øt characters would not be valued.</p>

                  </gap>ping, loud and frequent laughing, punning, joking, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mickry, waggery, and too great and indi≈øcriminate familiarity, will render any man contemptible, in ≈øpite of all his knowledge or his merit. The≈øe may con≈øtitute a merry fellow<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but a merry fellow was never yet re≈øpectable. Indi≈øcriminate familiarity will either offend your ≈øuperiors, or make you pa≈øs for their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant or toad-eater, and it will put your inferiors, on a degree of equality with you, that may be trouble≈øome.</p>
               <p>A joke, if it carries a ≈øting along with it, is no longer a joke, but an affront; and even if it has no ≈øting, unle≈øs its wittici≈øm is delicate and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:027039_0035_0FD2FA0841590438"/>
Punning is mere playing upon words, and far from being a mark of ≈øen≈øe: thus were we to ≈øay, ≈øuch a dre≈øs is <hi>commodious,</hi> one of the≈øe wags would an≈øwer <hi>odious;</hi> or that whatever it has been, it is now be-<hi>com-odious.</hi> Others will give us an an≈øwer dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what we ≈øhould expect, without either wit or the lea≈øt beauty of thought; as<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> "<hi>Where's my lord?‚Äî" In his cloaths, unle≈øs he is in bed." "How does this wine ta≈øte?‚Äî"A little moi≈øt, I think." "How is this to be eaten?</hi>‚Äî<hi>"With your mouth;</hi>" and ≈øo on, all which (you will readily apprehend) is low and vulgar. If your wittici≈øms are not in≈øtantly approved by the laugh of the company, for heaven's ≈øake, don't attempt to be witty for the future; for you may take it for granted, the defect is in your≈øelf, and not in your hearers.</p>
               <p>As to a mimic or wag, he is little el≈øe than a buffoon, who will di≈øtort his mouth and his eyes to make people laugh. Be a≈ø≈øured, no per≈øon ever demeaned him≈øelf to plea≈øe the re≈øt, unle≈øs he wi≈øhed to be thought the Merry-Andrew of the company, and whether this character is re≈øpectable, I leave you to judge.</p>
               <p>If a man's company is coveted on any other account than his knowledge, his good ≈øen≈øe, or his manners, he is ≈øeldom re≈øpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by tho≈øe who invite him, but made u≈øe of only to entertain. "Let's have ≈øuch-a-one, for he ≈øings a good ≈øong, or he is always joking or laughing; or, "Let's ≈øend for ≈øuch-a-one, for he is a good-bottle companion;" the≈øe are degrading di≈øtinctions, that preclude re≈øpect and e≈øteem, whoever <hi>is had</hi> (as the phra≈øe is) for the ≈øake of any qualification, ≈øingly, is merely that thing he <hi>is had</hi> for, is never con≈øidered in any other light, and, of cour≈øe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver properly re≈øpected, let his intrin≈øic merits be what they will.</p>
               <p>You may po≈ø≈øibly ≈øuppo≈øe this dignity of manners to border upon pride; but it differs as much from pride, as true courage from blu≈øtering.</p>
               <p>To flatter a per≈øon right or wrong, is abject flattery; and to con≈øent readily to do every thing propo≈øed by a company, be it ≈øilly or criminal, is full as degrading as to di≈øpute warmly upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øubject, and to contradict upon all actions. To pre≈øerve dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we ≈øhould mode≈øtly a≈ø≈øert our own ≈øentiments, though we politely acquie≈øce in tho≈øe of others.</p>
               <p>So again, to ≈øupport dignity of character, we ≈øhould neither be frivolou≈øly curious about trifles, nor be laboriou≈øly intent upon lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle objects that de≈øerve not a moment's attention; for this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies an incapacity in matters of greater importance.</p>
               <p>A great deal likewi≈øe depends upon our air, addre≈øs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions; an awkward addre≈øs and vulgar expre≈ø≈øions infer either a low turn of mind, or a low education.</p>
               <p>In≈øolent contempt or low envy is incompatible al≈øo with dignity of manners. Low-bred per≈øons fortunately lifted in the world, in fine cloaths and fine equipages, will in≈øolently look down on all tho≈øe who cannot afford to make as good an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and they openly envy tho≈øe who perhaps make a better. They al≈øo dread the being ≈ølighted; of cour≈øe are ≈øu≈øpicious and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:027039_0036_0FD2FA0ADDEDFCC0"/>
captious; are unea≈øy to them≈øelves, and make every body el≈øe ≈øo about them.</p>
               <p>A certain degree of outward ≈øeriou≈øne≈øs in looks and actions, gives dignity, while a con≈øtant ≈ømirk upon the face (that in≈øipid ≈øilly ≈ømile, which fools have when they would be civil) and whif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling motions are ≈øtrong marks of futility.</p>
               <p>But above all; a dignity of character is to be acquired be≈øt by a certain firmne≈øs in all our actions. A mean, timid and pa≈ø≈øive complai≈øance lets a man down more than he is aware of: but ≈øtill his firmne≈øs or re≈øolution ≈øhould not extend to brutality, but be accompanied with a peculiar and engaging ≈øoftne≈øs or mildne≈øs.</p>
               <p>If you di≈øcover any ha≈øtine≈øs in your temper, and find it apt to break out into rough and unguarded expre≈ø≈øions, watch it narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and endeavour to curb it; but let no complai≈øance, no weak de≈øire of plea≈øing, no wheedling, urge you to do that which di≈øcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion forbids; but per≈øi≈øt and per≈øevere in all that is right. In your connexions and friend≈øhips, you will find this rule of u≈øe to you. Invite and pre≈øerve attachments, by your firmne≈øs: but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to keep clear of enemies by a mildne≈øs of behaviour. Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm tho≈øe enemies you may unfortunately have, (and few are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them) by a gentlene≈øs of manner, but make them feel the ≈øteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of your re≈øentment; for there is a wide difference between bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing malice, and a determined ≈øelf-defence; the one is imperious, but the other is prudent and ju≈øtifiable.</p>
               <p>In directing your ≈øervants, or any per≈øon you have a right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; if you deliver your orders mildly, and in that engaging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which every gentleman ≈øhould ≈øtudy to do, you will be cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and con≈øequently well obeyed: but if tyrannically, you would be very unwillingly ≈øerved, if ≈øerved at all. A cool ≈øteady determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ≈øhould ≈øhow that you <hi>will</hi> be obeyed; but a gentlene≈øs, in the manner of enforcing that obedience, ≈øhould make ≈øervice a cheerful one. Thus will you be loved without being de≈øpi≈øed, and feared without being hated.</p>
               <p>I hope I need not mention vices. A man who has been patiently kicked out of company, may have as good a pretence to courage, as one rendered infamous by his vices, may to dignity of any kind; however of ≈øuch con≈øequence are appearances, that an outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and an affected dignity of manners, will even keep ≈øuch a man the longer from ≈øinking<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> If therefore you ≈øhould unfortunately have no intrin≈øic merit of our own, keep up, if po≈ø≈øible, the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it; and the world will po≈ø≈øibly give you credit for the re≈øt. A ver≈øatility of manners is as nece≈ø≈øary in ≈øocial life, as a ver≈øatility of parts in political. This is no way blameable, if not u≈øed with an ill-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign. We mu≈øt like the cameleon, often put on the hue of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons we wi≈øh to be well with: and it ≈øurely can never be blameable, to endeavour to gain the good-will or affection of any one, if when obtained we do not mean to abu≈øe it.</p>

               <head>RULES FOR CONVERSATION.</head>
               <p>HAVING now given you full and ≈øufficient in≈øtructions for making you well received in the be≈øt of companies: nothing
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027039_0037_0FD2FA0B220E23C0"/>
remains but that I lay before you ≈øome few rules for your conduct in ≈øuch company. Many things on this ≈øubject I have mentioned before; but ≈øome few matters remain to be mentioned now.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Talk then frequently: but not long together, le≈øt you tire the per≈øons you are ≈øpeaking to; for few per≈øons talk ≈øo well upon a ≈øubject, as to keep up the attention of their hearers for any length of time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Avoid telling ≈øtories in company, unle≈øs they are very ≈øhort indeed, and very applicable to the ≈øubject you are upon; in this ca≈øe relate them in as few words as po≈ø≈øible, without the lea≈øt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øion, and with ≈øome apology; as that you hate the telling of ≈øtories, but the ≈øhortne≈øs of it induced you. And, if your ≈øtory has any wit in it, be particularly careful not to laugh at it your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf. Nothing is more tire≈øome and di≈øagreeable than a long te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious narrative; it betrays a go≈ø≈øiping di≈øpo≈øition and great want of imagination; and nothing is more ridiculous than to expre≈øs an approbation of your own ≈øtory by a laugh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In relating any thing, keep clear of repetitions, or very hackneyed expre≈ø≈øions, ≈øuch as, <hi>≈øays he,</hi> or <hi>≈øays ≈øhe.</hi> Some people will u≈øe the≈øe ≈øo often, as to take off the hearer's attention from the ≈øtory: as in an organ out of tune, one pipe ≈øhall perhaps found the whole time we are playing, and confu≈øe the piece ≈øo as not to be under≈øtood.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Digre≈ø≈øions likewi≈øe, ≈øhould be guarded again≈øt. A ≈øtory is always more agreeable without them. Of this kind are, "<hi>the gentleman I am telling you of is the ≈øon of Sir Thomas‚Äî, who lives in Harley-≈øtreet;‚Äîyou mu≈øt know him‚Äîhis brother had a hor≈øe that won the ≈øweep≈øtakes at the la≈øt New-market meeting‚ÄîZounds! if you don't know him, you know nothing.</hi>" Or, "<hi>He was an upright tall old gentleman, who wore his own long hair: don't you recollect him?</hi>"‚ÄîAll this is unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary; is very tire≈øome and provoking, and would be an excu≈øe for a man's behaviour, if he was to leave us in the mid≈øt of our narrative.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some people have a trick of holding the per≈øon they are ≈øpeaking to by the button, or the hand, in order to be heard out; con≈øcious, I ≈øuppo≈øe, that their tale is tire≈øome. Pray never do this; if the per≈øon you ≈øpeak to is not as willing to hear your ≈øtory as you are to tell it, you had much better break off in the middle, for if you tire them once, they will be afraid to li≈øten to you a ≈øecond time.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Others have a way of punching the per≈øon they are talking to in the ≈øide, and, at the end of every ≈øentence, a≈øking him ≈øome ≈øuch que≈øtions as the following: "Wa≈øn't I right in that?"‚Äî"You know I told you ≈øo?"‚Äî"What's your opinion," and the like; or perhaps they will be threading him, or jogging him with their elbow. For mercy's ≈øake, never give way to this: it will make your company dreaded.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Long talkers are frequently apt to ≈øingle out ≈øome unfortunate man pre≈øent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> generally the mo≈øt ≈øilent one of the company, or probably one who ≈øits next them. To this man, in a kind of half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whi≈øper, will they run on for half an hour together. Nothing
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027039_0038_0FD2FA0CD4D1AE70"/>
can be more ill-bred. But if one of the≈øe unmerciful talkers ≈øhould attack you, if you wi≈øh to oblige him, I would recommend the hearing him with patience: ≈øeem to do ≈øo at lea≈øt, for you could not hurt him more than to leave him in the middle of his ≈øtory, or di≈øcover any impatience in the cour≈øe of it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Ince≈ø≈øant talkers are very di≈øagreeable companions. Nothing can be more rude than to engro≈øs the conver≈øation to your≈øelf, or to take the words, as it were, out of another man's mouth. Every man in company has an equal claim to bear his part in the conver≈øation, and to deprive him of it, is not only unju≈øt, but a tacit declaration, that he cannot ≈øpeak ≈øo well upon the ≈øubject as your≈øelf. You will therefore take it up. And what can be more rude? I would as ≈øoon forgive a man that ≈øhould ≈øtop my mouth when I was gaping, as taking my words from me while I was ≈øpeaking them. Now, if this be unpardonable, it cannot be le≈øs ≈øo,</p>
               <p n="9">9. To help out or fore≈øtall the ≈ølow ≈øpeaker, as if you alone were rich in expre≈ø≈øions, and he were poor. You may take it for granted, every one is vain enough to think he can talk well, tho' he may mode≈øtly deny it; helping a per≈øon out therefore in his expre≈ø≈øion, is a correction that will ≈øtamp the corrector with imprudence and ill-manners.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Tho≈øe who contradict others upon all occa≈øions and make every a≈ø≈øertion a matter of di≈øpute, betray by this behaviour an unacquaintance with good breeding. He therefore who wi≈øhes to appear amiable with tho≈øe he conver≈øes with, will be cautious of ≈øuch expre≈ø≈øions as the≈øe, "That can't be true, Sir," "The affair is as I ≈øay;" "That mu≈øt be fal≈øe, Sir;" "If what you ≈øay is true, &amp;c." You may as well tell a man he lies at once, as thus indirectly impeach his veracity. It is equally as rude to be proving every trifling a≈ø≈øertion with a bet or a wager. "I'll bet you fifty of it, and ≈øo on." Make it then a con≈øtant rule in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of no great importance, complai≈øantly to ≈øubmit your opinion to that of other; for a victory of this kind often co≈øts a man the lo≈øs of a friend.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Giving advice una≈øked is another piece of rudene≈øs; it is, in effect, declaring our≈øelves wi≈øer than tho≈øe to whom we give it<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> reproaching them with ignorance and inexperience. It is a freedom that ought not to be taken with any common acquaintance, and yet there are tho≈øe, who will be offended if their advice is not taken. "Such-a-one," ≈øay they, "is above being advi≈øed." "He ≈øcorns to li≈øten to my advice;" as if it were not a mark of greater arrogance to expect every one to ≈øubmit to their opinion, than for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

There is nothing ≈øo unpardonably rude, as a ≈øeeming inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the per≈øon who is ≈øpeaking to you; though you may meet with it in others, by all means avoid it your≈øelf. Some ill-bred peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, while others are ≈øpeaking to them, will, in≈øtead of looking at, or attending to them, perhaps ≈øix their eyes on the cieling, or ≈øome picture in the room, look out at the window, play with a dog, their watch-chain, or their cane, or probably pick their nails or their no≈øes. Nothing betrays a more trifling mind than this; nor can any thing be a greater affront to the per≈øon ≈øpeaking; it being a tacit declaration,

"Let us con≈øider it again; whether we take it right or not." It is much more polite and amiable to make ≈øome excu≈øe for another, and even in ca≈øes where he might ju≈øtly be blamed, and to repre≈øent the mi≈øtake as common to both, rather than charge him with in≈øen≈øibility or incomprehen≈øion.</p>

                  <p>He ri≈øeth up early, and lieth down late; he exerci≈øeth his mind with contemplation, and his body with action; and pre≈øerveth the health of both.</p>
                  <p>The ≈ølothful man is a burden to him≈øelf, his hours hang heavy on his head: he loitereth about, and knoweth not what he would do.</p>
                  <p>His days pa≈øs away like the ≈øhadow of a cloud, and he leaveth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him no mark for remembrance.</p>
                  <p>His body is di≈øea≈øed for want of exerci≈øe: He wi≈øheth for action, but hath not power to move: his mind is in darkne≈øs; his thoughts are confu≈øed; he longeth for knowledge, but hath no application.</p>
                  <p>He would eat of the almond, but hateth the trouble of breaking its ≈øhell.</p>
                  <p>His hou≈øe is in di≈øorder, his ≈øervants are wa≈øteful and riotous, and he runneth on towards ruin: He ≈øeeth it with his eyes; he heareth it with his ears; he ≈øhaketh his head, and wi≈øheth, but hath no re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; till ruin cometh upon him like a whirlwind, and ≈øhame and repentance de≈øcend with him to the grave.</p>

                  <p>It behoveth thee, therefore, O child of calamity! early to fortify thy mind with courage and patience, that thou maye≈øt ≈øupport, with a becoming re≈øolution, thy allotted portion of human evil.</p>

                  <p>LET not thy mirth be ≈øo extravagant as to intoxicate thy mind, nor thy ≈øorrow ≈øo heavy as to depre≈øs thy heart. This world affordeth no good ≈øo tran≈øporting, nor inflicteth any evil ≈øo ≈øevere, as ≈øhould rai≈øe thee far above, or ≈øink thee much beneath the balance of moderation.</p>
                  <p>Lo! yonder ≈øtandeth the hou≈øe of Joy. It is painted on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide, and looketh gay; thou maye≈øt know it by the continual noi≈øe of mirth and exultation that i≈ø≈øueth from it.</p>
                  <p>The mi≈øtre≈øs ≈øtandeth at the door, and calleth aloud to all who pa≈øs by: ≈øhe ≈øingeth, and ≈øhouteth, and laugheth without cea≈øing.</p>
                  <p>She inviteth them to go in and ta≈øte the plea≈øures of life, which ≈øhe telleth them are no where to be found but beneath her roof.</p>
                  <p>But enter thou not into her gate; neither a≈ø≈øociate thy≈øelf with tho≈øe who frequent her hou≈øe.</p>
                  <p>They call them≈øelves the ≈øons of Joy, they laugh and ≈øeem delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but madne≈øs and folly are in all their doings.</p>
                  <p>They are linked with mi≈øchief hand in hand, and their ≈øteps lead down to evil. Dangers be≈øet them round about, and the pit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction yawneth beneath their feet.</p>
                  <p>Look now on the other ≈øide; and behold, in that vale, over≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with trees, and hid from the ≈øight of men, the habitation of ≈øorrow.</p>
                  <p>Her bo≈øom heaveth with ≈øighs, her mouth is filled with lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ≈øhe delighteth to dwell on the ≈øubject of human mi≈øery.</p>
                  <p>She looketh on the common accidents of life, and weepeth; the weakne≈øs and wickedne≈øs of man is the theme of her lips.</p>
                  <p>All nature to her, teemeth with evil, every object ≈øhe feeth is ting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the gloom of her own mind, and the voice of complaint ≈øaddeneth her dwelling day and night.</p>

                  <p>But con≈øider, and forget not thine own weakne≈øs; ≈øo ≈øhalt thou pardon the failings of others.</p>
                  <p>Indulge not thy≈øelf in the pa≈ø≈øion of anger; it is whetting a ≈øword, to wound thine own brea≈øt, or murder thy friend.</p>
                  <p>If thou beare≈øt ≈ølight provocations with patience, it ≈øhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto thee for wi≈ødom; and if thou wipe≈øt them from thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, thy heart ≈øhall feel re≈øt, and thy mind ≈øhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach thee.</p>
                  <p>See≈øt thou not that the angry man lo≈øeth his under≈øtanding? Whil≈øt thou art yet in thy ≈øen≈øes, let the wrath of another be a le≈ø≈øon to thy≈øelf.</p>
                  <p>Do nothing in a pa≈ø≈øion. Why wilt thou put to ≈øea in the violence of a ≈øtorm?</p>
                  <p>If it be difficult to rule thine anger, it is wi≈øe to prevent it; avoid therefore all occa≈øions of falling into wrath, or guard thy≈øelf again≈øt them whenever they occur.</p>
                  <p>A fool is provoked with in≈øolent ≈øpeeches, but a wi≈øe man laugheth them to ≈øcorn.</p>
                  <p>Harbour not revenge in thy brea≈øt; it will torment thy heart, and di≈øcolour its be≈øt inclinations.</p>

                  <p>A mild an≈øwer to an angry man, like water ca≈øt upon the fire, abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his heat, and from an enemy he ≈øhall become thy friend.</p>

                  <p>WEAK and ignorant as thou art, O Man! Humble as thou oughte≈øt to be, O child of the du≈øt! would≈øt thou rai≈øe thy thoughts to infinite wi≈ødom? would≈øt thou ≈øee Omnipotence di≈øplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before thee? contemplate thine own frame.</p>
                  <p>Fearfully and wonderfully art thou made: Prai≈øe therefore thy creator with awe, and rejoice before him with reverence.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore of all creatures art thou only erect, but that thou ≈øhoulde≈øt behold his works? wherefore art thou to behold, but that thou maye≈øt admire them? wherefore to admire, but that thou maye≈øt adore their and thy Creator?</p>
                  <p>Wherefore is con≈øciou≈øne≈øs repo≈øed in thee alone? and whence is it derived to thee?</p>
                  <p>It is not in fle≈øh to think; it is not in bones to rea≈øon. The lion knoweth not that worms ≈øhall eat him; the ox perceiveth not that he is fed for ≈ølaughter.</p>
                  <p>Something is added to thee unlike to what thou ≈øee≈øt: Something informs thy clay, higher than all that is the object of thy ≈øen≈øes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! what is it?</p>
                  <p>Thy body remaineth perfect after it is fled, therefore it is no part of it: It is immaterial, therefore it is eternal: It is free to act there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is accountable for its actions.</p>
                  <p>Knoweth the a≈øs the u≈øe of food, becau≈øe his teeth mow down the herbage? or ≈øtandeth the crocodile erect, although his back-bone is ≈øtraight as thine?</p>
                  <p>God formed thee as he had formed the≈øe: After them all wert thou created; ≈øuperiority and command were given thee over all, and of his own breath did he communicate to thee thy principle of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>Know thy≈øelf then the pride of his creation, the link uniting divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and matter! Behold a part of God him≈øelf within thee! Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thine own dignity, nor dare de≈øcend to evil or to meanne≈øs.</p>

                  <p>VAUNT not of thy body, becau≈øe it was fir≈øt formed; nor of thy brain, becau≈øe therein thy ≈øoul re≈øideth. Is not the ma≈øter of the hou≈øe more honourable than its walls?</p>
                  <p>The ground mu≈øt be prepared, before corn can be planted: The potter mu≈øt build his furnace, before he can make his porcelain.</p>
                  <p>As the breath of Heaven ≈øayeth unto the waters of the deep, This way ≈øhall thy billows roll, and no other; thus high, and no higher ≈øhall they rai≈øe their fury: So let thy ≈øpirit, O man! actuate, and direct thy fle≈øh; ≈øo let it repre≈øs its wildne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>Thy ≈øoul is the monarch of thy frame; ≈øuffer not its ≈øubjects to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel again≈øt it.</p>
                  <p>The body is as the globe of the earth, thy bones the pillars that ≈øu≈øtain it on its ba≈øis.</p>

                  <p>Do not both retain their cour≈øe for ever? Behold! the ≈øame God ordained them.</p>
                  <p>Is not thy no≈øe the channel to perfumes? thy mouth the path to delicacies? Yet know thou, that perfumes long ≈ømelt become offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive; that delicacies de≈øtroy the appetite they flatter.</p>
                  <p>Are not thine eyes the centinels that watch for thee? yet how often are they unable to di≈øtingui≈øh truth from error?</p>
                  <p>Keep thy ≈øoul in moderation, teach thy ≈øpirit to be attentive to its good; ≈øo ≈øhall the≈øe, its mini≈øters, be always to thee conveyances of truth.</p>
                  <p>Thine hand, is it not a miracle? Is there in the creation aught like unto it? wherefore was it given thee, but that thou mighte≈øt ≈øtretch it out to the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of thy brother?</p>
                  <p>Why of all things living art thou alone made capable of blu≈øhing? The world ≈øhall read thy ≈øhame upon thy face; therefore do nothing ≈øhameful.</p>
                  <p>Fear and di≈ømay, why rob they thy countenance of its ruddy ≈øplendor? Avoid guilt, and thou ≈øhalt know that fear is beneath thee; that di≈ømay is unmanly.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to thee alone ≈øpeak ≈øhadows in the vi≈øions of thy pillow? Reverence them; for, know that dreams are from on high.</p>
                  <p>Thou, man, alone can≈øt ≈øpeak. Wonder at the glorious preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and pay to him who gave it thee, a rational and welcome prai≈øe, teaching thy children wi≈ødom, in≈øtructing the offspring of thy loins in piety.</p>

                  <p>THE ble≈ø≈øings, O man! of thy external part, are health, vigour, and proportion. The greate≈øt of the≈øe is health. What health is to the body, even that is hone≈øty to the ≈øoul.</p>

That thou ha≈øt a ≈øoul, is of all knowledge the mo≈øt certain, of all truths the mo≈øt plain unto thee. Be meek, be grateful for it. Seek not to know it perfectly. It is in≈øcrutable.</p>
                  <p>Thinking, under≈øtanding, rea≈øoning, willing, call not the≈øe the ≈øoul. They are its actions, but they are not its e≈ø≈øence.</p>
                  <p>Rai≈øe it not too high, that thou be not de≈øpi≈øed. Be not thou like unto tho≈øe that fall by climbing, neither deba≈øe it to the ≈øen≈øe of brutes; nor be thou like to the hor≈øe and the mule, in whom there is no under≈øtanding.</p>
                  <p>Search it by its faculties, know it by its virtues. They are more in number than the hairs of thy head; the ≈øtars of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are not to be counted with them.</p>
                  <p>Think not with Arabia, that one ≈øoul is parted among all men; neither believe thou with the ≈øons of Egypt, that every man hath many: know that as thy heart, ≈øo al≈øo thy ≈øoul is one.</p>
                  <p>Doth not the ≈øun harden the clay? Doth it not al≈øo ≈øoften the wax? As it is one ≈øun that worketh both, even ≈øo it is one ≈øoul that wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>She is immortal; ≈øhe is unchangeable; ≈øhe is alike in all. Health called her forth to ≈øhow her loveline≈øs, and application annointeth her with the oil of wi≈ødom.</p>
                  <p>Although ≈øhe ≈øhall live after thee, think not ≈øhe was born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee. She was concreted with thy fle≈øh, and formed with thy brain.</p>
                  <p>Ju≈øtice could not give her to thee exalted by virtues, nor mercy deliver her to thee deformed by vices. The≈øe mu≈øt be thine, and thou mu≈øt an≈øwer them.</p>
                  <p>Suppo≈øe not death can ≈øhield thee from examination; think not corruption can hide thee from enquiry. He who formed thee of thou knowe≈øt not what, can he not rai≈øe thee from thou knowe≈øt not what again?</p>
                  <p>Perceiveth not the cock the hour of midnight? Exalteth he not his voice, to tell thee it is morning? Knoweth not the dog the foot≈øteps of his ma≈øter? and flieth not the wounded goat unto the herb that healeth him? Yet when the≈øe die, their ≈øpirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to the du≈øt: thine alone ≈øurviveth.</p>
                  <p>Envy not the≈øe of their ≈øen≈øes, becau≈øe quicker than thine own. Learn that the advantage lieth not in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing good things, but in knowing to u≈øe them.</p>
                  <p>Had≈øt thou the ear of the ≈ølag, or were thine eye as ≈øtrong and piercing as the eagle's; did≈øt thou equal the hound in ≈ømell, or could the ape re≈øign to thee his ta≈øte, or the tortoi≈øe her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet, without rea≈øon, what would they avail thee? Peri≈øh not all the≈øe like their kindred?</p>
                  <p>Hath any one of them the gift of ≈øpeech? Can any ≈øay unto thee, Therefore did I ≈øo?</p>
                  <p>The lips of the wi≈øe are as the doors of a cabinet: no ≈øooner are they opened, but trea≈øures are poured but before thee.</p>

                  <p>Her motion is perpetual; her attempts are univer≈øal; her agility is not to be ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed. Is it at the uttermo≈øt part of the earth? ≈øhe will have it: Is it beyond the region of the ≈øtars? yet will her eye di≈øcover it.</p>

                  <p>Weep not therefore at the calamities of the human ≈øtate; rather laugh at its follies. In the hands of the man addicted to vanity, life is but the ≈øhadow of a dream.</p>
                  <p>The hero, the mo≈øt renowned of human characters, what is he but the bubble of this weakne≈øs? The public is un≈øtable and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; why ≈øhould the man of wi≈ødom endanger him≈øelf for fools?</p>

                  <p>The heart of the vain is troubled, while it ≈øeemeth content; his cares are greater than his plea≈øures.</p>
                  <p>His ≈øolicitude cannot re≈øt with his bones; the grave is not deep enough to hide it: He extendeth his thoughts beyond his being; he be≈øpeaketh prai≈øe to be paid when he is gone: But who≈øo promi≈øeth it, deceiveth him.</p>
                  <p>As the man who engageth his wife to remain in widowhood, that ≈øhe di≈øturb not his ≈øoul, ≈øo is he who expecteth that prai≈øe ≈øhall reach his ears beneath the earth, or cheri≈øh his heart in its ≈øhroud.</p>
                  <p>Do well while thou live≈øt; but regard not what is ≈øaid of it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thy≈øelf with de≈øerving prai≈øe, and thy po≈øterity ≈øhall rejoice in hearing it.</p>

                  <p>Why be≈øtowe≈øt thou on every man the flattery of unmeaning words? Thou knowe≈øt, when returned thee, thou regarde≈øt it not. He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he lyeth unto thee; yet he knoweth thou wilt thank him for it. Speak in ≈øincerity, and thou ≈øhalt near with in≈øtruction.</p>
                  <p>The vain delighteth to ≈øpeak of him≈øelf; but he ≈øeeth not that others like not to hear him.</p>
                  <p>If he hath done any thing worthy prai≈øe, if he po≈ø≈øe≈øs that which is worth admiration, his joy is to proclaim it, his pride is to hear it reported.</p>
                  <p>The de≈øire of ≈øuch a man defeateth it≈øelf. Men ≈øay not, Behold, he hath done it; or, See, he po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth it: But mark how proud he is of it!</p>
                  <p>The heart of man cannot attend at once to many things. He who fixeth his ≈øoul on ≈øhow, lo≈øeth reality.</p>
                  <p>He pur≈øueth bubbles, which break in their flight, while he treads to earth what would do him honour.</p>

                  <p>Wherein art thou mo≈øt weak? In that wherein thou ≈øeeme≈øt mo≈øt ≈øtrong; in that wherein mo≈øt thou glorie≈øt; even in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing the things which thou ha≈øt; in u≈øing the good that is about thee.</p>
                  <p>Are not thy de≈øires al≈øo frail? or knowe≈øt thou even what it is thou woulde≈øt wi≈øh? When thou ha≈øt obtained what mo≈øt thou ≈øoughte≈øt after, behold it contenteth thee not.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore lo≈øeth the plea≈øure that is before thee, its reli≈øh? and why appeareth that which is yet to come, the ≈øweeter? Becau≈øe thou art wearied with the good of this, becau≈øe thou knowe≈øt not the evil of that which is not with thee. Know, that to be content, is to be happy.</p>
                  <p>Could≈øt thou chu≈øe for thy≈øelf, would thy Creator lay before thee all that thine heart could a≈øk for? Would happine≈øs then remain with thee? Or would joy dwell always in thy gates?</p>
                  <p>Alas! thy weakne≈øs forbiddeth it; thy infirmity declareth again≈øt it. Variety is to thee in the place of plea≈øure; but that which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manently delighteth, mu≈øt be permanent.</p>

That which ≈øucceedeth it, hath no more plea≈øure for thee; and thou afterwards quarrele≈øt with thy≈øelf for preferring it: Behold the only circum≈øtance in which thou erre≈øt not!</p>
                  <p>Is there any thing in which thy weakne≈øs appeareth more than in de≈øiring things? It is in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing, and in the u≈øing them.</p>
                  <p>Good things cea≈øe to be good in our enjoyment of them. What nature meant pure ≈øweets, are ≈øources of bitterne≈øs to us; from our delights ari≈øe pain, from our joys, ≈øorrow.</p>
                  <p>Be moderate in the enjoyment, and it ≈øhall remain in thy po≈ø≈øe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion: let thy joys be founded on rea≈øon, and to its end ≈øhall ≈øorrow be a ≈øtranger.</p>
                  <p>The delights of love are u≈øhered in by ≈øighs, and they terminate in langui≈øhment and dejection. The object thou burned≈øt for, nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeates with ≈øatiety, and no ≈øooner had≈øt thou po≈ø≈øe≈øt it, but thou wert weary of its pre≈øence.</p>

                  <p>God hath given thee no good without its admixture of evil; but he hath given thee al≈øo the means of throwing off the evil from it.</p>
                  <p>As joy is not without its allay of pain, ≈øo neither is ≈øorrow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its portion of plea≈øure. Joy and grief, though unlike, are united. Our own choice only can give them to us entire.</p>
                  <p>Melancholy it≈øelf often giveth delight, and the extremity of joy is mingled with tears.</p>

                  <p>So blended is weakne≈øs in thy nature, O man! that thou ha≈øt not ≈øtrength either to be good, or to be evil entirely. Rejoice that thou can≈øt not excel in evil, and let the good that is within thy reach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thee.</p>

                  <p>Would≈øt thou at once have the liberality of the rich, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of the poor? or ≈øhould the wife of thy bo≈øom be de≈øpi≈øed, becau≈øe ≈øhe ≈øheweth not the virtues of the widow?</p>
                  <p>If thy father ≈øink before thee in the divi≈øions of thy country, can at once thy ju≈øtice de≈øtroy him, and thy duty ≈øave his life?</p>
                  <p>If thou behold thy brother in the agonies of a ≈ølow death, is it not mercy to put a period to his life? and is it not al≈øo he who takes away his life his murderer?</p>
                  <p>Truth is but one; thy doubts are of thine own rai≈øing. He who made virtues what they are, planted al≈øo in thee a knowledge of their pre-eminence. Act as thy ≈øoul dictates to thee, and the end ≈øhall be always right.</p>

                  <p>The fault is not in truth; for that is amiable; but the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of man beareth not its ≈øplendor.</p>
                  <p>Would thou ≈øee thine in≈øufficiency more plainly, view thy≈øelf at thy devotions.

                  <p>Doth it not remind thee, that thou art du≈øt? doth it not tell thee, that thou art a≈øhes? And, behold! repentance: is it not built on frailty?</p>
                  <p>When thou give≈øt thy oath: when thou ≈øweare≈øt thou wilt not deceive; behold! it ≈øpreadeth ≈øhame upon thy face, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of him that receiveth it.</p>
                  <p>Learn to be ju≈øt, and repentance may be forgotten: learn to be hone≈øt, and oaths are unnece≈ø≈øary.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øhorter follies are, the better: ≈øay not therefore to thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, I will not play the fool by halves.</p>
                  <p>He that heareth his own faults with patience, ≈øhall reprove another with boldne≈øs.</p>

                  <p>The tender of heart is turned from his purpo≈øe by ≈øupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the proud is rendered more ob≈øtinate by intreaty, the ≈øen≈øe of thine in≈øufficiency commandeth thee to hear; but to be ju≈øt, thou mu≈øt hear without thy pa≈ø≈øions.</p>

way laughing; he maketh him≈øelf merry at this addition to his mi≈øery.</p>
                  <p>Revenge is painful in the intent, and it is dangerous in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ≈øeldom doth the axe fall, where he who lifteth it up intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and lo! he remembereth not that it mu≈øt recoil again≈øt him≈øelf.</p>
                  <p>While the revengeful ≈øeeketh his enemy's hurt, be oftentimes procureth his own de≈øtruction; while he aimeth at one of the eyes of his adver≈øary, lo! he putteth out both his own.</p>
                  <p>If he attain not his end, he lamenteth it; if he ≈øucceed, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth of it; the fear of ju≈øtice taketh away the peace of his own ≈øoul; the care to hide him from it, de≈øtroyeth that of his friend.</p>
                  <p>Can the death of thine adver≈øary ≈øatiate thy hatred? Can the ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him at re≈øt re≈øtore thy peace?</p>
                  <p>Would≈øt thou make him ≈øorry for the offence, conquer him, by ≈øparing him; In death he owneth not thy ≈øuperiority; nor feeleth he any more the power of thy wrath.</p>
                  <p>In revenge, there ≈øhould be a triumph of the avenger; and he who hath injured him, ≈øhould feel his di≈øplea≈øure; he ≈øhould ≈øuffer pain from it, and ≈øhould repent him of the cau≈øe.</p>
                  <p>This is the revenge in≈øpired from anger; but that which makes thee greater, is to repay injuries with kindne≈øs.</p>

                  <p>Death endeth the quarrel; but it re≈øtoreth not the reputation: Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is an act of caution, not of courage; it is ≈øafe, but it is not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing ≈øo ea≈øy as to revenge an offence, but nothing is ≈øo honourable as to pardon it.</p>
                  <p>The greate≈øt victory man can obtain, is over him≈øelf: He that di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth to feel an injury, retorteth it upon him who offereth it.</p>
                  <p>When thou meditate≈øt revenge, thou confe≈ø≈øe≈øt that thou feele≈øt the wrong; when thou complaine≈øt, thou acknowledge≈øt thy≈øelf hurt by it: Meane≈øt thou to add this triumph to the pride of thine enemy?</p>
                  <p>That cannot be an injury which is not felt: how then can he who de≈øpi≈øeth it revenge it?</p>
                  <p>If thou think it di≈øhonourable to bear an offence, more is in thy power; thou maye≈øt conquer it.</p>
                  <p>Good offices will make a man a≈øhamed to be thine enemy; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of ≈øoul will terrify him from the thought of hurting thee.</p>
                  <p>The greater the wrong, the more glory is in pardoning it: and by how much the more ju≈øtifiable would be revenge, by ≈øo much the more honour is in clemency.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Self-love is more ≈øubtle than the mo≈øt ≈øubtle man in the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The duration of our pa≈ø≈øions no more depends on us, than the duration of our lives.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Pa≈ø≈øion often makes a man of ≈øen≈øe mad; and often makes a fool ≈øen≈øible.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Tho≈øe great and ≈øhining actions, who≈øe lu≈øtre even dazzles us, we repre≈øented by the politicians as the effects of great de≈øigns: whereas, for the mo≈øt part, they are indeed the effects of humour and pa≈ø≈øion: thus the war between <hi>Augu≈øtus</hi> and <hi>Antony,</hi> which is attributed to the ambition each had of making him≈øelf ma≈øter of the world, was perhaps nothing but the effect of jealou≈øy.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The pa≈ø≈øions are the only orators that are always ≈øure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuade: they are, as it were, nature's art of eloquence, the rules of which are infallible: and the plaine≈øt man with pa≈ø≈øion, per≈øuades more than the mo≈øt eloquent without it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There is ≈øuch an inherent inju≈øtice and ≈øelf-intere≈øt in the pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, that it is dangerous to follow them, and they are mo≈øt to be di≈øtru≈øted, even when they appear to be mo≈øt rea≈øonable.</p>
               <p n="10">10. There is in the heart of man a perpetual ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, in≈øomuch, that the ruin of one is almo≈øt always the ri≈øe of another.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The pa≈ø≈øions often beget other pa≈ø≈øions of a quite contrary nature; avarice ≈øometimes produces prodigality, and prodigality avarice: weakne≈øs often makes a man re≈øolute, and fear, bold.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For all the care we ake to conceal our pa≈ø≈øions under the veil of religion and honour, they always appear through the di≈øgui≈øe.</p>

13. Our ≈øelf-love bears more impatiently the condemnation of our inclinations than of our opinions</p>
               <p n="14">14. Men are not only apt to forget kindne≈ø≈øes and injuries, but even to hate tho≈øe who have obliged them, and to cea≈øe to hate tho≈øe who have u≈øed them ill. The trouble of returning favours and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging wrongs, ≈øeems a ≈ølavery to them, which they do not ea≈øily ≈øubmit to.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The clemency of princes is often nothing but a piece of policy to gain the affections of their ≈øubjects.</p>
               <p n="16">16. That clemency which is cried up as a virtue, is practi≈øed ≈øometimes out of vanity, ≈øometimes out of lazine≈øs, often out of fear, and almo≈øt always out of a mixture of all three together.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The moderation of per≈øons in pro≈øperity proceeds from the calm that good fortune gives to their humour and temper.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Moderation is a fear of falling into that envy and contempt, which tho≈øe de≈øerve that are intoxicated with their good fortune: it is a vain o≈øtentation of the force of our mind: and, in ≈øhort, the moderation of men, in their mo≈øt exalted condition, is a de≈øire of appearing greater than their fortune.</p>
               <p n="19">19. We have all of us ≈øtrength enough to bear the misfortunes of other people.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The con≈øtancy of the wi≈øe is no more than the art of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining their troubles to their own brea≈øts.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Criminals, when led to execution, affect ≈øometimes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtancy and a contempt of death, which, in truth, is nothing but a fear to look it in the face: ≈øo that this con≈øtancy and this contempt may be ≈øaid to be to their mind, what the handkerchief is to their eyes.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Philo≈øophy makes nothing to triumph over pa≈øt and future evils, but the pre≈øent triumph over that.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Few people are acquainted with death: they generally ≈øubmit to it, not out of re≈øolution, but in≈øen≈øibility and cu≈øtom; and the greate≈øt part of men die, only becau≈øe they cannot avoid dying.</p>
               <p n="24">24. When great men are dejected with the length of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, they di≈øcover that it was the force of their ambition, and not of their ≈øoul, that ≈øu≈øtaineth them: and that, bating a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, heroes are made ju≈øt like other men.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Greater virtues are required to bear a good fortune than an ill one.</p>
               <p n="26">26. The ≈øun and death are two things that cannot ≈øteadily be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Men are often vain even of the mo≈øt criminal pa≈ø≈øions; but, envy is a cowardly and ≈øhameful pa≈ø≈øion, which nobody ever dares to own.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Jealou≈øy is in ≈øome ≈øort ju≈øt and rea≈øonable, ≈øince it only tends to pre≈øerve a good which belongs to us, or which we believe does belong to us: whereas envy is a madne≈øs that cannot bear the good of others.</p>
               <p n="29">29. The ill we do, expo≈øes us, not ≈øo much to per≈øecution and hatred, as our good qualities.</p>

               <p n="31">31. If we had no defects of our own, we ≈øhould not take ≈øo much plea≈øure as we do, to remark defects in others.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Jealou≈øy is fed by doubts, and either becomes madne≈øs, or cea≈øes, as ≈øoon as doubt is turned into certainty.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Pride always indemnifies it≈øelf one way or other, and lo≈øes nothing, even when it renounces vanity.</p>
               <p n="34">34. If we were not proud our≈øelves, we ≈øhould not complain of the pride of others.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Pride is equal in all men, and the difference is only in the means and the manner of ≈øhowing it.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Nature, who ≈øo wi≈øely has fitted the organs of our body to make us happy, ≈øeems likewi≈øe to have be≈øtowed pride on us, on purpo≈øe, as it were, to ≈øave us the pain of knowing our imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Pride has a greater ≈øhare than good nature, in our reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people for their faults; and we reprove them not ≈øo much to amend them, as to make them believe we are free from tho≈øe faults our≈øelves.</p>
               <p n="38">38. We make promi≈øes according to our hopes, and keep them according to our fears.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Intere≈øt ≈øpeaks all ≈øorts of languages, and acts all ≈øorts of parts, even that of the di≈øintere≈øted per≈øon.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Intere≈øt, which blinds ≈øome people, enlightens others.</p>
               <p n="41">41. The men that apply them≈øelves too much to little things, commonly become incapable of great.</p>
               <p n="42">42. We have not ≈øtrength enough to follow all the dictates of our rea≈øon.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Man often fancies he governs him≈øelf when he is governed: and while he, with his under≈øtanding, aims at one mark, his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in≈øen≈øibly carry him off to another.</p>
               <p n="44">44. Strength and weakne≈øs of mind are improper terms; they are, in reality, nothing but the good or ill di≈øpo≈øition of the organs of our body.</p>
               <p n="45">45. The caprice of our humour is more fanta≈øtical even than that of fortune.</p>
               <p n="46">46. The fondne≈øs or indifference which the philo≈øophers had for life, was nothing but a reli≈øh of ≈øelf-love, which ought no more to be di≈øputed, than the reli≈øh of the palate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p n="48">48. Happine≈øs is in the ta≈øte, and not in the things; and it is a man's having that which he loves that makes him happy, and not what others think lovely.</p>
               <p n="49">49. We are never ≈øo happy, or unhappy, as we imagine.</p>

               <p n="51">51. Nothing ought ≈øo much to le≈ø≈øen the ≈øatisfaction we take in our≈øelves, as to ≈øee that we di≈øapprove at one time, what we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved at another.</p>

               <p n="54">54. The contempt of riches was, in the philo≈øophers, a ≈øecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire to revenge on fortune the inju≈øtice ≈øhe had done to their merit, by de≈øpi≈øing tho≈øe goods which ≈øhe had denied them: 'twas an art to ≈øecure them≈øelves from the di≈øgrace of poverty; 'twas a by-way to arrive at e≈øteem, which they could not come at by the ordinary one of riches.</p>
               <p n="55">55. Our hatred of favourites, is nothing but our love of favour: the indignation we conceive at our not po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing it our≈øelves, is ≈øoothed and ≈øoftened by the contempt we expre≈øs for tho≈øe who do po≈ø≈øe≈øs it; and we refu≈øe them our re≈øpect, not being able to deprive them of that which procures them the re≈øpect of all the world.</p>
               <p n="56">56. To make a fortune in the world, men u≈øe all the means po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to appear to have made it already.</p>

The inequality that is remarkable in the courage of a world of brave men, proceeds from this, that death di≈øcovers it≈øelf in different ≈øhapes to them, and appears more pre≈øent to their imagination at one time than another: ≈øo it happens, that after having de≈øpi≈øed what they did not know, they are afraid at la≈øt of what they do know<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> If we would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it the greate≈øt of all evils, we mu≈øt never look it in the face with all its circum≈øtances.

It may be, that graver books have been written on this ≈øubject, but few more to the point; its author being equally ≈økilled in books and in men, in the dead languages and the living; I pre≈øume, therefore, that his ob≈øervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be generally found true, and his maxims ju≈øt.</hi>

                  <hi>At fir≈øt fight, it may ≈øeem that this e≈ø≈øay is calculated only for a few; but I beg leave to ob≈øerve, that in truth there are but few to whom it may not be u≈øeful. As every man in his ≈øtation ought to be hone≈øt, ≈øo every man in his behaviour may be polite; nay, he ought to be ≈øo<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> becau≈øe he will be ≈øure to find his account in it; ≈øince it is a quality ea≈øier di≈øcerned, and of con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ≈øooner rewarded than the former. We mu≈øt know and conver≈øe with a man, to be convinced of his probity; whereas we perceive at fir≈øt ≈øight whether he has good manners; by this we are prejudiced in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: and who then would not ≈øtrive to learn an art at once ≈øo ea≈øy, and ≈øo exten≈øive in its u≈øe?</hi>

                  <hi>But, if it be beneficial to all, it is peculiarly nece≈ø≈øary to</hi> Youth. <hi>It is at once a remedy for ba≈øhfulne≈øs, and a pre≈øervative again≈øt the contrary vice. A polite per≈øon ≈øtands in the middle, between a ≈øheepi≈øh mode≈øty and a di≈øta≈øteful boldne≈øs. It is the habit which adds the la≈øt poli≈øh to education, brightens the man of letters, and ≈øpreads a glo≈øs over that ≈øort of learning which would otherwi≈øe appear pedantic. The polite man may not only under≈øtand Latin and Greek, but may al≈øo introduce them into di≈øcour≈øe, provided it be before proper company, and on a proper oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion. The unpoli≈øhed ≈øcholar lugs them in whenever they occur; quotes</hi> OVID <hi>to his mi≈øtre≈øs, and repeats a pa≈ø≈øage from</hi> POLYAENEUS <hi>to a captain of the guards. To your youth, therefore, I beg leave to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this conci≈øe manual, which will co≈øt them but little time to read, and no great pains to practi≈øe.</hi>

Exactly parallel to this, is that wrong notion which many have that nothing more is due from them to their neighbours than what re≈øults from a principle of hone≈øty; which commands us to pay our debts, and forbids us to do injuries: whereas a thou≈øand little civilities, complai≈øances, and endeavours to give others plea≈øure, are requi≈øite to keep up the reli≈øh of life, and procure us that affection and e≈øteem which every man who has a ≈øen≈øe of it mu≈øt de≈øire.

               <p>Examples have, generally ≈øpeaking, greater force than precepts; I will therefore delineate the characters of <hi>Honorious</hi> and <hi>Garcia,</hi> two gentlemen of my acquaintance, who≈øe humour I have perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered, and ≈øhall repre≈øent them without the lea≈øt exaggeration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Honorious</hi> is a per≈øon equally di≈øtingui≈øhed by his birth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. He has naturally good ≈øen≈øe; and that too hath been impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a regular education. His wit is lively, and his morals with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ≈øtain.‚ÄîIs not this an amiable character? Yet <hi>Honorious</hi> is not beloved. He has, ≈øome way or other, contracted a notion, that it is beneath a man of honour to fall below the height of truth in any degree, or on any occa≈øion what≈øoever. From this principle he ≈øpeaks bluntly what he thinks, without regarding the company who are by. Some weeks ago, he read a lecture on female hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cri≈øy, before a married couple, though the lady was much ≈øu≈øpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that head. Two hours after he fell into a warm declamation again≈øt ≈øimony and prie≈øtcraft before two dignitaries of the church<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and, from a continued cour≈øe of this ≈øort of behaviour, hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him≈øelf dreaded as a monitor, in≈øtead of being e≈øteemed as a friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Garcia,</hi> on the contrary, came into the world under the greate≈øt di≈øadvantages. His birth was mean, and his fortune not to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; yet, though he is ≈øcarce forty, he has acquired a hand≈øome e≈øtate in the country, and lives on it with more reputation than mo≈øt of his neighbours. While a ≈øervitor at the univer≈øity, he, by his a≈ø≈øiduities, recommended him≈øelf to a noble lord, and thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a place of fifty pounds a year in a public office. His behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our there made him as many friends as there were per≈øons belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this board. His readine≈øs in doing favours, gained him the hearts of his inferiors; his deference for tho≈øe in the highe≈øt charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the office, procured him their good will; and the compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency he expre≈ø≈øed towards his equals and tho≈øe immediately above

him, made them e≈øpou≈øe his intere≈øt, with almo≈øt as much warmth, as they did their own. By this management, in ten years time, he ro≈øe to the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of an office which brought him in a thou≈øand pounds a-year ≈øalary, and near double as much in perqui≈øites. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence hath made no alteration in his manners. The ≈øame ea≈øine≈øs of di≈øpo≈øition attends him in that fortune to which it has rai≈øed him; and he is at this day the delight of all who know him, from an art <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it ≈øeems not altogether credible they ≈øhould, at every turn, prefer their country's intere≈øt to their own. The thing looks noble indeed; and therefore like a becoming habit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body would put it on. But this is hypocri≈øy, you'll ≈øay, and therefore ≈øhould be detected! Here the <hi>Polite Philo≈øopher</hi> finds new inducements to caution: ≈øore places are always tender; and people at a ma≈øquerade are in pain, if you do any thing which may di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their faces.</p>
               <p>Our philo≈øophy is not intended to make a man that four moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor who points out folks faults, but to make them in love with their virtues; that is, to make him≈øelf and them ea≈øy while he is with them; and to do, or ≈øay nothing, which, on reflexion, may make them le≈øs his friends at their next meeting.</p>
               <p>Let us explain this a little further. The rules we offer, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended rather to guide men in company than when alone. What we advance, tends not ≈øo directly to amend peoples hearts, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate their conduct; a matter which we have already demon≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be of no ≈ømall importance. Yet I beg you'll ob≈øerve, that though morality be not immediately our ≈øubject, we are far, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, from requiring any in our pupils contrary thereto.</p>
               <p>A <hi>polite man</hi> may yet be religious, and, if his rea≈øon be convinced, attached to any intere≈øt which, in his opinion, ≈øuits be≈øt with that of the public; provided he conform thus far to our ≈øy≈øtem, that on no occa≈øion he trouble others with the articles of his religious creed, or political engagements; or, by any ≈øtroke of wit or raillery, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:027039_0167_0FD2FB48AA4F6BC0"/>
for a laugh, that di≈øpo≈øition of mind which is ab≈øolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to make men ea≈øy when together.</p>
               <p>Were I indeed to indulge my own ≈øentiments, I ≈øhould ≈øpeak yet with greater freedom on this ≈øubject. Since there is ≈øo va≈øt a di≈øproportion when we come to compare tho≈øe who have really ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a concern in the government, or the ≈øervice of their country, more particularly at heart, and the men who pretend to either, merely from a de≈øire of appearing of ≈øome con≈øequence them≈øelves; we ought certainly to avoid making one of this number, and aim rather at being quiet within our≈øelves, and agreeable to tho≈øe among whom we live, let their political notions be what they will; ina≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as this is a direct road to happine≈øs, which all men profe≈øs they would reach, if they could<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 
                  <hi>Pomponius Atticus,</hi> who≈øe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter appears ≈øo amiable, from the concurring te≈øtimony of all who mention him, owed the greate≈øt part of that e≈øteem in which he lived, and of the reputation by which he ≈øtill ≈øurvives, unto his ≈øteady ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to this rule. His benevolence made him love mankind in general, and his good ≈øen≈øe hindered him from being tainted with tho≈øe party prejudices which had bewitched his friends. He took not up arms for <hi>Cae≈øar;</hi> nor did he abandon <hi>Italy</hi> when <hi>Pompey</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew with his forces, and had, in outward form, the ≈øanction of the commonwealth. He ≈øaw too plainly the ambition of both: yet he pre≈øerved his complai≈øance for his friends in each party, without ≈øiding with either. Succe≈øs never made them more welcome to <hi>Pomponius;</hi> nor could any defeat le≈ø≈øen them in his e≈øteem. When victorious he vi≈øited them, without ≈øharing in their power; and when vanqui≈øhed<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> he received them, without con≈øidering any thing but their di≈øtre≈øs. In a few words, he entertained no hopes from the good fortune of his friends, nor ≈øuffered the rever≈øe of it to chill his brea≈øt with fear. His equanimity produced a ju≈øt effect, and his univer≈øal kindne≈øs made him univer≈øally beloved.</p>
               <p>I fancy this picture of a di≈øpo≈øition, perfectly free from political ≈øourne≈øs, will have an agreeable effect on many of my readers; and prevent their falling into a common mi≈øtake, that the circum≈øtances of public affairs, and the characters of public per≈øons, are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere≈øt topics for general conver≈øation: whereas they never con≈øider, that it is hard to find a company wherein ≈øomebody or other hath not either liking or di≈øta≈øte, or has received injuries or obligations from tho≈øe who are likelie≈øt to be mentioned upon ≈øuch occa≈øions: and who, con≈øequently, will be apt to put a ≈øerious con≈øtruction on a ≈ølight expre≈ø≈øion, and remember afterward in earne≈øt, what the ≈øpeaker ment ≈øo much a je≈øt, as never to have thought of it more. The≈øe, perhaps, may pa≈øs with ≈øome for trivial remarks; but tho≈øe who regard their own ea≈øe, and have at all ob≈øerved what conduces to make men di≈øagreeable to one another, I flatter my≈øelf they will have more weight.</p>
               <p>Behaviour is like architecture; the ≈øymmetry of the whole plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes us ≈øo much, that we examine not into its parts, which, if we did, we ≈øhould find much nicety required in forming ≈øuch a ≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: though, to per≈øons of no ta≈øte, the rules of either art would ≈øeem to have little connexion with their effects.</p>

Next to tho≈øe cautions with re≈øpect to raillery, which, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine ≈øtrictly, we ≈øhall find no better than a well-bred phra≈øe for ≈øpeaking ill of folks; it may not be ami≈øs to warn our readers of a certain vehemence in di≈øcour≈øe, exceedingly ≈øhocking to others, at the ≈øame time that it not a little exhau≈øts them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>If we trace this error to its ≈øource, we ≈øhall find that the ≈øpring of it is an impatience at finding others differ from us in opinion; and can there be any thing more unrea≈øonable, than to blame that di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition in them which we cheri≈øh in our≈øelves?</p>
               <p>If ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion be a thing ≈øo di≈øagreeable to us, why ≈øhould we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it from the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As this is a foible more e≈øpecially indecent in the fair ≈øex, I think it will be highly nece≈ø≈øary to offer another, and perhaps a more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent argument to their con≈øideration. Pa≈ø≈øion is a prodigious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to beauty: it ruffles the ≈øweete≈øt features, di≈øcolours the fine≈øt complexion, and, in a word, gives the air of a fury to the face of an angel. Far be it from me to lay re≈øtraints upon the ladies; but, an di≈ø≈øuading them from this method of enforcing their ≈øentiments, I put them upon an ea≈øier way of effecting what they de≈øire: for what can be denied to beauty, when ≈øpeaking with an air of ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction? Complai≈øance does all that vehemence would extort, as anger alone can abate the influence of their charms.</p>

What contributed to make this conduct of his the more out of the way, was, that every gentleman in the room had been in <hi>Italy</hi> as well as he: and one of them, who was a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, was the very per≈øon at who≈øe hou≈øe the major re≈øided when at <hi>Naples.</hi> Po≈ø≈øibly he might imagine the knowledge they had in tho≈øe things might give them a greater reli≈øh for his animadver≈øions; or, to ≈øpeak more candidly, the de≈øire of di≈øplaying his own parts buried every other circum≈øtance in oblivion.</p>
               <p>Ju≈øt as the major had done ≈øpeaking, a gentleman called for a gla≈øs of water; and happened to ≈øay, after drinking it, that he found his con≈øtitution much mended ≈øince he left off malt liquor. Doctor <hi>Hectick,</hi> another of the ≈øtrangers, immediately laid hold of this opportunity, and gave us a large account of the virtues of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; confirming whatever he advanced from the mo≈øt eminent phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øicians. From the main ≈øubject, he made an ea≈øy tran≈øition to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical baths and ≈øprings. Nor were his ≈øearches bounded by our own country; he conde≈øcended to acquaint us with the properties of the ≈øprings of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> particularized the genuine ≈ømell of <hi>Spa</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, applauded the wonderful effects of the <hi>Pierpont</hi> mineral; and, like a true patriot, wound up his di≈øqui≈øitions with preferring <hi>A≈øtrop</hi> wells (within three miles of which he was born) to them all. It was now turned of eleven; when the major and the doctor took their leaves and went away together in a hackney-coach.</p>
               <p>The company ≈øeemed inclinable to extend their u≈øual time of ≈øit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in order to divert them≈øelves after the night's fatigue. When, Mr. <hi>Papilio,</hi> the third new comer, after two or three ≈øevere reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions on the oddity of ≈øome people's humours, who were for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing their own idle conceits as things worthy the attention of a whole company; though, at the ≈øame time, their ≈øubjects are tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial, and their manner of treating them in≈øipid: for my part, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, gentlemen, mo≈øt people do me the honour to ≈øay, that few per≈øons under≈øtand medals better than I do. To put the mu≈øty ≈øtories of the≈øe queer old men out of our heads, I'll give you the hi≈øtory of a valuable medallion, which was ≈øent me about three weeks ago from <hi>Venice.</hi> Without ≈øtaying for any further mark of approbation than ≈øilence, he entered immediately on a long di≈ø≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; in which he had ≈øcarce proceeded ten minutes, before his auditors, lo≈øing all patience, followed the example of an old <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi> merchant, who, takin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> who knew human nature perhaps as well as any man who ever ≈øtudied it, has given us a ju≈øt picture of the force of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male charms, in the ≈øtory of <hi>Cymon</hi> and <hi>Iphigenia.

The <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> poet, like ≈øome <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, gave <hi>≈øterling</hi> ≈øilver in exchange for that ≈øuperficial gilding; and be≈øtowed a moral where he found a tale. He paints, in <hi>

                     </gap>,</hi> a ≈øoul buried in a confu≈øion of ideas, inflamed with ≈øo little fire, as ≈øcarce to ≈øtruggle under the load, or afford any glimmerings of ≈øen≈øe. In this condition, he repre≈øents him ≈øtruck with the rays of <hi>Iphigenia'</hi>s beauty; kindled by them, his mind exerts its powers, his intellectual faculties ≈øeem to awake; and that uncouth ferocity of manners, by which he had hitherto been di≈øtingui≈øhed, gave way to an obliging behaviour, the natural effect of love.</p>
               <p>The moral of this fable is a truth which can never be inculcated too much. It is to the fair ≈øex we owe the mo≈øt ≈øhining qualities of which ours is ma≈øter: as the ancients in≈øinuated, with their u≈øual addre≈øs, by painting both the Virtues and Graces as females.

plea≈øing; which is the di≈øpo≈øition at once the mo≈øt grateful to others, and the mo≈øt ≈øatisfactory to our≈øelves. An intimate acquaintance with the other ≈øex fixes this complai≈øance into a habit, and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit is the very e≈ø≈øence of <hi>politene≈øs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, I pre≈øume to ≈øay, <hi>politene≈øs</hi> can be no other way attained. Books may furni≈øh us with right ideas, experience may prove our judgments, but it is the acquaintance of the ladies only, which can be≈øtow that ea≈øine≈øs of addre≈øs, whereby the <hi>fine gentleman</hi> is di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed from the <hi>≈øcholar</hi> and the <hi>man of bu≈øine≈øs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That my readers may be perfectly ≈øatisfied in a point, which I think of ≈øo great importance, let us examine this a little more ≈øtrictly.</p>
               <p>There is a certain con≈øtitutional pride in men, which hinders their yielding in point of knowledge, honour or virtue, to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This immediately for≈øakes us at the ≈øight of women. And the being accu≈øtomed to ≈øubmit to the ladies gives a new turn to our ideas, and opens a path to rea≈øon, which ≈øhe had not trod be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Things appear in another light, and that degree of compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øancy ≈øeems now a virtue, which heretofore we regarded as a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.</p>
               <p>I have dwelt the longer on the charms of the ≈øex, ari≈øing from the perfection vi≈øible in their exterior compo≈øition, becau≈øe there is the ≈øtronge≈øt analogy between them, and excellencies which, from a nicer inquiry, we di≈øcover in the minds of the fair. As they are di≈øtingui≈øhed from the robu≈øt make of man by that delicacy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>≈ø≈øed by nature, in their form; ≈øo the ≈øeverity of ma≈øculine ≈øen≈øe is ≈øoftened by a ≈øweetne≈øs peculiar to the female ≈øoul.</p>
               <p>A native capacity of plea≈øing attends them through every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of life; and, what we improperly call the weakne≈øs of the ≈øex, gives them a ≈øuperiority unattainable by force.</p>
               <p>The fable of the north wind and the ≈øun, contending to make the man throw off his cloak, is not an improper picture of the ≈øpecific difference between the powers of either ≈øex. The blu≈øtering fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the former, in≈øtead of producing the effect at which it aimed, made the fellow but wrap him≈øelf up the clo≈øer; yet no ≈øooner did the ≈øun beams play, than that which before protected, became now an incumbrance.</p>
               <p>Ju≈øt ≈øo, that pride which makes us tenacious in di≈øputes between man and man, when applied to the ladies, in≈øpires us with an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerne≈øs not to contend, but to obey.</p>
               <p>To ≈øpeak ≈øincerely and philo≈øophically, women ≈øeem de≈øigned by Providence to ≈øpread the ≈øame ≈øplendour and cheerfulne≈øs through the intellectual economy, that the cele≈øtial bodies diffu≈øe over the material part of the creation. Without them, we might indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, de≈øtroy, and triumph over one another. Fraud and force would divide the world between them: and we ≈øhould pa≈øs our lives, like ≈ølaves, in continual to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l, without the pro≈øpect of plea≈øure or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation.</p>
               <p>It is the conver≈øation of women that gives a proper bias to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and, by abating the ferocity of our pa≈ø≈øions, engages us to that gentlene≈øs of deportment which we ≈øtyle <hi>humanity.</hi> The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne≈øs we have for them, ≈øoftens the ruggedne≈øs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="176" facs="unknown:027039_0178_0FD2FB64363D9AD8"/>
and the virtues we put on to make the better figure in their eyes, keep us in humour with our≈øelves.</p>
               <p>I ≈øpeak it without affectation or vanity, that no man has applied more a≈ø≈øiduou≈øly than my≈øelf to the ≈øtudy of the fair ≈øex; and I over it with the greate≈øt ≈øimplicity of heart, that I have not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the mo≈øt engaging and mo≈øt amiable, but al≈øo the mo≈øt generous and mo≈øt heroic qualities among≈øt the ladies; and that I have di≈øcovered more of candour, di≈øintere≈øtedne≈øs, and fervour in their friend≈øhips, than in tho≈øe of our own ≈øex, though I have been very careful, and particularly happy in the choice of my acquaintance.</p>
               <p>My readers will, I dare ≈øay, ob≈øerve, and indeed I de≈øire they ≈øhould, a more than ordinary zeal for inculcating a high e≈øteem of, and a ≈øincere attachment to the fair. What I propo≈øe from it, is to rectify certain notions, which are not only de≈øtructive of all <hi>politene≈øs,</hi> but, at the ≈øame time, detrimental to ≈øociety, and incompatible with the dignity of human nature. The≈øe have, of late years, ≈øpread much among tho≈øe who a≈ø≈øume to them≈øelves the title of <hi>fine gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> and, in con≈øequence thereof, talk with great freedom of tho≈øe from whom they are in no danger of being called to an account.

To the end, that entering into this exorbitant age, thou maye≈øt be the better prepared to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

And, becau≈øe I will not confound thy memory, I have reduced them into ten precepts; and next to Mo≈øes' tables, if thou imprint them in thy mind, thou ≈øhalt reap the benefit, and I the content. And they are the≈øe following:</p>
            <p>I. When it ≈øhall plea≈øe God to bring thee to man's e≈øtate, u≈øe great providence and circum≈øpection in choo≈øing thy wife; for from thence will ≈øpring all thy future good or evil. And it is an action of life, like unto a ≈øtratagem in war; wherein a man can err but once. If thy e≈øtate be good, match near home and at lei≈øure; if weak, far off and quickly. Inquire diligently of her di≈øpo≈øition, and how her parents have been inclined in their youth. Let her not be poor, how generous ≈øoever. For a man can buy nothing in the market with gentility. Nor choo≈øe a ba≈øe and uncomely creature altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for wealth; for it will cau≈øe contempt in others, and loathing in thee. Neither make choice of a dwarf, or a fool; for, by the one thou ≈øhalt beget a race of pigmies; the other will be thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual di≈øgrace; and it will yirke thee to hear her talk. For thou ≈øhalt find it, to thy great grief, that there is nothing more ful≈øome than a ≈øhe-fool.</p>
            <p>And, touching the guiding of thy hou≈øe, let thy ho≈øpitality be moderate; and, according to the means of thy e≈øtate, rather plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful than ≈øparing, but not co≈øtly. For I never knew a man grow poor by keeping an orderly table. But ≈øome con≈øume them≈øelves through ≈øecret vices, and their ho≈øpitality bears the blame. But ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:027039_0181_0FD2FB6A2A495910"/>
≈øwini≈øh drunkards out of thine hou≈øe, which is a vice impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing health, con≈øuming much, and makes no ≈øhow. I never heard prai≈øe a≈øcribed to a drunkard, but for the wellbearing of his drink; which is a better commendation for a brewer's hor≈øe or a drayman than either a gentleman, or a ≈øerving man. Beware that thou ≈øpend not above three of four parts of thy revenues, nor above a third part of that in thy hou≈øe. For the other two parts will do no more than defray thy extraordinaries, which always ≈øurmount the ordinary by much: otherwi≈øe thou ≈øhalt live, like a rich beggar, in continual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>. And the needy man can never live happily nor contentedly. For every di≈øa≈øter makes him ready to mortgage or ≈øell. And that gentleman, who ≈øells an acre of land, ≈øells an ounce of credit. For gentility is nothing el≈øe but ancient riches. So that if the foundation ≈øhall at any time ≈øink, the building mu≈øt need follow.‚ÄîSo much for the fir≈øt precept.</p>
            <p>II. Bring thy children up in learning and obedience, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out outward au≈øterity. Prai≈øe them openly, reprehend them ≈øecretly, give them good countenance and convenient maintenance according to thy ability; otherwi≈øe thy life will ≈øeem their bondage, and what portion thou ≈øhalt leave them at thy death, they will thank death for it, and not thee.

               </gap>ckering of ≈øome parents, and the over-≈øtern carriage of others, cau≈øe more men and women to take ill cour≈øes, than their own vicious inclinations. Marry thy daughters in time, left they marry them≈øelves. And ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not thy ≈øons to pa≈øs the Alps. For they ≈øhall learn nothing there but pride, bla≈øphemy and athei≈øm. And if by travel they get a few broken languages, that ≈øhall profit them nothing more than to have one meat ≈øerved in divers di≈øhes. Neither, by my con≈øent, ≈øhalt thou train them up in wars. For he that ≈øets up his re≈øt to live by that profe≈ø≈øion, can hardly be an hone≈øt man or a good chri≈øtian. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, it is a ≈øcience no longer in reque≈øt than u≈øe. For ≈øoldiers in peace are like chimneys in ≈øummer.</p>
            <p>III. Live not in the country without corn and cattle about thee. For he that putteth his hand to the pur≈øe for every expence of hou≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, is like him that keepeth water in a ≈øieve. And what provi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thou ≈øhalt want, learn to buy it at the be≈øt hand. For there is one penny ≈øaved in four, betwixt buying in thy need, and when the markets and ≈øea≈øons ≈øerve fitte≈øt for it. Be not ≈øerved with kin≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or friends, or men intreated to ≈øtay; for they expect much and do little; nor with ≈øuch as are amorous, for their heads are intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. And keep rather too few, than one too many. Feed them well, and pay them with the mo≈øt; and then thou maye≈øt boldly require ≈øervice at their hands.</p>
            <p>IV. Let thy k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ndred and allies be welcome to thy hou≈øe and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Grace them with thy countenance, and father them in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt actions. For by the≈øe means thou ≈øhalt find them ≈øo many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates to plead an apology for thee behind thy back. But ≈øhake off tho≈øe glow-worms, I mean para≈øites and ≈øycophants, who will feed and fawn upon thee in the ≈øummer of pro≈øperity, but in adver≈øe ≈øtorms, they will ≈øhelter thee no more than an arbor in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>V. Beware of ≈øurety≈øhip for thy be≈øt friends. He that pay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>th another man's debts, ≈øeeketh his own decay. But if thou can≈øt not otherwi≈øe choo≈øe, rather lend thy money thy≈øelf upon good bonds,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:027039_0182_0FD2FB68CDF07758"/>
although thou borrow it. So ≈øhalt thou ≈øecure thy≈øelf and plea≈øure thy friend. Neither borrow money of a neighbour or a friend, but of a ≈øtranger; where paying for it, thou ≈øhalt hear no more of it. Otherwi≈øe thou ≈øhalt eclip≈øe thy credit, lo≈øe thy freedom, and pay as dear as to another. But in borrowing of money be precious of thy word. For he that hath care of keeping days of payment, is lord of another man's pur≈øe.</p>
            <p>VI. Undertake no ≈øuit again≈øt a poor man without receiving much wrong. For, be≈øides that thou make≈øt him thy compeer, it is a ba≈øe conque≈øt to triumph where there is ≈ømall re≈øi≈øtance. Neither at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt law again≈øt any man before thou be fully re≈øolved that thou ha≈øt right on thy ≈øide; and then ≈øpare not for either money or pains. For a cau≈øe or two ≈øo followed and obtained, will free thee from ≈øuits great part of thy life.</p>
            <p>VII. Be ≈øure to keep ≈øome great man thy friend, but trouble him not for trifles. Compliment him often with many, yet ≈ømall gifts, and of little charge. And if thou ha≈øt cau≈øe to be≈øtow any great gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, let it be ≈øomething which may be daily in ≈øight. Otherwi≈øe, in this ambitious age, thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>VIII. Towards thy ≈øuperiors, be humble, yet generous. With thine equals, familiar, yet re≈øpective. Towards thine inferiors, ≈øhow much humanity, and ≈øome familiarity; as to bow the body, ≈øtretch forth the hand, and to uncover the head: with ≈øuch like popular compliments. The fir≈øt prepares thy way to advancement. The ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For right humanity takes ≈øuch deep root in the minds of the multitude, as they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øier gained by unprofitable curte≈øies than by churli≈øh benefits. Yet I advi≈øe thee not to affect or neglect popularity too much. Seek not to be E≈ø≈øex: ≈øhun to be Rawleigh.</p>
            <p>IX. Tru≈øt not any man with thy life, credit, or e≈øtate. For it is mere folly for a man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>o enthral him≈øelf to a friend, as though oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion being offered, he ≈øhould not dare to become thy enemy.</p>
            <p>X. Be not ≈øcurrilous in conver≈øation, nor ≈øatyrical in thy je≈øts. The one will make thee unwelcome to all company; the other pulls on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I HAVE heard, that nothing gives an author ≈øo great a plea≈øure, as to find his works re≈øpectfully quoted by others<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Judge, then, how much I mu≈øt have been gratified by an incident I am going to relate you. I ≈øtopped my hor≈øe lately, where a great number of people were collected at an auction of merchants goods. The hour of ≈øale not being come, they were conver≈øing on the badne≈øs of the times, and one of the company called to a plain clean Old Man, with white locks,‚Äî'Pray, <hi>Father Abraham,</hi> what think you of the times? Will not the≈øe heavy taxes quite ruin the country? How ≈øhall we be ever able to pay them? What would you advi≈øe us to?‚ÄîFather Abraham ≈øtood up, and replied, 'If you would have my advice, I will give it you in ≈øhort, "for a word to the wi≈øe is enough", as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ≈øays.' They joined in de≈øiring him to ≈øpeak his mind, and gathering round him he proceeded as follows:</p>
            <p>'Friends, ≈øays he, the taxes are indeed very heavy; and if tho≈øe laid on by the government were the only ones we had to pay, we might more ea≈øily di≈øcharge them; but we have many others, and much more grievous to ≈øome of us. We are taxed twice as much by our idlene≈øs, three times as much by our pride, and four times as much by our folly; and from the≈øe taxes the commi≈ø≈øioners can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ea≈øe or deliver us, by allowing an abatement. However, let us hearken to good advice, and ≈øomething may be done for us: "God helps them that help them≈øelves," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ≈øays.</p>
            <p>I. 'It would be thought a hard government that ≈øhould tax its people one tenth part of their time, to be employed in its ≈øervice: but idlene≈øs taxes many of us much more; ≈øloth, by bringing on di≈øea≈øes, ab≈øolutely ≈øhortens life.‚Äî"Sloth, like ru≈øt, con≈øumes fa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than labour wears, while the key u≈øed is always bright," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ≈øays.‚Äî"But do≈øt thou love life, then do not ≈øquander time, for that is the ≈øtuff life is made of," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ≈øays.‚ÄîHow much more than is nece≈ø≈øary do we ≈øpend in ≈øleep; forgetting that "The ≈øleeping fox catches no poultry, and that there will be ≈øleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough in the grave," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ≈øays.</p>
            <p>'If time be of all things the mo≈øt precious, wa≈øting time mu≈øt be', as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ≈øays. "the greate≈øt prodigality;" ≈øince, as he el≈øewhere tells us, "Lo≈øt time is never found again; and what we call time enough, always proves little enough:" Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the purpo≈øe; for by diligence we ≈øhall do more with le≈øs perplexity. "Sloth makes all things difficult, but indu≈øtry all ea≈øy; and, he that ri≈øeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>'So what ≈øignifies wi≈øhing and hoping for better times? We may make the≈øe times better, if we be≈øtir our≈øelves. Indu≈øtry need not wi≈øh, and he that lives upon hope will die fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

And farther, "What maintains one vice, would bring up two children." You may think, perhaps, that a little tea or a little punch now and then, diet a little more co≈øtly, cloaths a little finer, and a little entertainment now and then, can be no great matter; but remember, "Many a little makes a mickle." Beware of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle expences; "A ≈ømall leak will ≈øink a great ≈øhip," as <hi>Poor Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> ≈øays; and again, "Who dainties love, ≈øhall beggars prove;" and moreover, "Fools make fea≈øts, and wi≈øe men eat them."

Remember what <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ≈øays, "Buy what thou ha≈øt no need of, and ere long thou ≈øhalt ≈øell thy nece≈ø≈øaries." And again, "At a great pennyworth p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He means, that perhaps the cheapne≈øs is apparent only, and not real; or the bargain, by ≈øtraitening thee in thy bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, may do thee more harm than good. For in another place he ≈øays, "Many have been ruined by buying good pennyworths." Again, "It is fooli≈øh to lay out money in a purcha≈øe of repentance;" and yet this folly is practi≈øed every day at auctions, for want of minding the Almanac. Many a one, for the ≈øake of finery on the back, has gone with a hungry belly, and have ≈øtarved their families; "Silks and ≈øattins, ≈øcarlets and velvets, put out the kitchen fire,"

as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ≈øays. The≈øe are not the nece≈ø≈øaries of life; they can ≈øcarcely be called the conveniences; and yet only becau≈øe they look pretty, how many want to have them? By the≈øe, and other extravagancies, the genteel are reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow of tho≈øe whom they formerly de≈øpi≈øed, but, who through indu≈øtry and frugality, have maintained their ≈øtanding; in which ca≈øe it appears plainly, that "A ploughman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ≈øays. Perhaps they have had a ≈ømall e≈øtate left them, which they knew not the getting of; they think, "It is day, and will never be night;" that a little to be ≈øpent out of ≈øo much is not worth minding; but "Always tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the meal-tub, and never putting in, ≈øoon comes to the bottom," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ≈øays; and then, "When the well is dry, they know the worth of water." But this they might have known before, if they had taken his advice: If you would know the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of money, go and try to borrow ≈øome; for "He that goes a borrowing goes a ≈øorrowing," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ≈øays; and, indeed, ≈øo does he that lends to ≈øuch people, when he does not get it again, <hi>Poor D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

When you have bought one fine thing, you mu≈øt buy ten more, that your appearance be all of a-piece; but <hi>Poor Dick</hi> ≈øays, "It is ea≈øier to ≈øuppre≈øs the fir≈øt de≈øire, than to ≈øatisfy all that follow it:" And it is as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich, as for the frog to ≈øwell, in order to equal the ox.

And, after all, of what u≈øe is this pride of appearance, for which ≈øo much is ri≈øked, ≈øo much is ≈øuffered?

But ah! think what you do when you run in debt; you give to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power over your liberty. If you cannot pay at the time, you will be a≈øhamed to ≈øee your creditor; you will be in fear when you ≈øpeak to him; you will make poor, pitiful, ≈øneaking, excu≈øes; and, by degrees, come to lo≈øe your veracity, and ≈øink into ba≈øe downright lying; for "The <hi>≈øecond</hi> vice is lying, the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> is running in debt," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ≈øays; and again to the ≈øame purpo≈øe, "Lying rides upon Debt's back;" whereas a free-born American ought not to be a≈øhamed to ≈øee or to ≈øpeak to any man living. But poverty often deprives a man of all ≈øpirit and virtue. "It is hard for an empty bag to ≈øtand upright."

And yet you are about to put your≈øelf under that tyranny, when you run in debt for ≈øuch dre≈øs! Your creditor has authority, at his plea≈øure, to deprive you of your liberty, by confining you in goal for life, or by ≈øelling you for a ≈øervant, if you ≈øhould not be able to pay him. When you have got your bargain, you may, perhaps, think little of payment; but as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ≈øays, "Creditors have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter memories than debtors; creditors are a ≈øuper≈øtitious ≈øect, great ob≈øervers of ≈øet days and times." The day comes round before you are aware, and the demand is made before you are prepared to ≈øatisfy it: or, if you bear your debt in mind, the term which at fir≈øt ≈øeemed ≈øo long, will, as it le≈ø≈øens, appear extremely ≈øhort. Time will ≈øeem to have added wings to his heels as well as his ≈øhoulders. "Tho≈øe have a ≈øhort Lent who owe money to be paid at Ea≈øter."

A rich man beginning to fall, is held up of his friends: but a poor man being down, is thru≈øt away by his friends: when a rich man is fallen he hath many helpers; he ≈øpeaketh things not to be ≈øpoken, and yet men ju≈øtify him; the poor man ≈ølipt, and they rebuke him; he ≈øpoke wi≈øely, and could have no place. When a rich man ≈øpeaketh, every man holdeth his tongue, and, look, what he faith they extol it to the clouds; but if a poor man ≈øpeaks, they ≈øay, What fellow is this?

Wealth is his that enjoys it, and the world is his who ≈øcrambles for it. A father with very great wealth, and a ≈øon with no virtue at all. Little wealth, and little care and trouble. The Roman conquers by ≈øitting ≈øtill at home. Between robbing and re≈øtoring, men commonly get thirty in the hundred. He is learned enough who knows how to live well. The more a man knows, the le≈øs credulous he is. There is no harm in de≈øiring to be thought wi≈øe by others, but a great deal in a man's thinking him≈øelf to be ≈øo. Bare wages never made a ≈øervant rich. Lo≈øing much breeds bad blood. Health without any money is half ≈øickne≈øs. When a man is tumbling down, every ≈øaint lends a hand. He that un≈øea≈øonab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plays the wi≈øe man is a fool. He that pretends too much to wi≈ødom is counted a fool. A wi≈øe man never ≈øets his heart upon what he cannot have. A lewd batchelor makes a jealous hu≈øband. That crown is well ≈øpent which ≈øaves you ten. Love can do much, but ≈øcorn or di≈ødain can do more. If you would have a thing kept ≈øecret, never tell it to any one; and if you would not have a thing known of you, never do it. Whatever you are going to do or ≈øay, think well fir≈øt what may be the con≈øequence of it. They are always ≈øelling wit to others who have lea≈øt of it for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves.

Cha≈øtity is the chief and mo≈øt charming beauty. Little con≈øcience and great diligence make a rich man. Never count four except you have them in your bag.

We are u≈øually the be≈øt men when we are wor≈øt in health. Learning is wealth to the poor, an honour to the rich, and a ≈øupport and comfort to old age. Learning procures re≈øpect to good fortune, and helps out the bad. The ma≈øter makes the hou≈øe to be re≈øpected, not the hou≈øe the ma≈øter. The ≈øhort and ≈øure way to reputation, is to take care to be in truth what we would have others think us to be. A good reputation is a ≈øecond, or half an e≈øtate. He is the better man who comes neare≈øt to the be≈øt. A wrong judgment of things is the mo≈øt mi≈øchievous thing in the world. The neglect or contempt of riches makes a man more truly great than the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of them. That only is true honour which he gives who de≈øerves it him≈øelf.

Di≈øea≈øes are the intere≈øt of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure. All covet, all lo≈øe. Plain dealing is a jewel; but he who u≈øeth it will die a beggar. Honour bought is temporal ≈øimony. Live, and let live, <hi>i. e.</hi> be a kind landlord. Children are certain

cares, but very uncertain com≈øorts. Giving begets love, lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing u≈øually le≈ø≈øens it. He is the wi≈øe, who is the hone≈øt man. Take part with rea≈øon again≈øt thy own will or humour. Wit is a fine thing in a wi≈øe man's hand. Speak not of my debts except you mean to pay them. Words in≈øtruct, but examples per≈øuade effectually. He who lives in hopes dies a fool. He who gives wi≈øely fells to advantage. Years know more than books. All earthly joys are empty bubbles, and make men boys. Better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born than untaught. If thou do ill, the joy fades, not the pains: if well, the pains do fade, the joy remains. Always refu≈øe the advice which pa≈ø≈øion gives; nor lay nor do that thing which anger prompts you to. Bear and forbear is ≈øhort and good philo≈øophy. Set out wi≈øely at fir≈øt; cu≈øtom will make every virtue more ea≈øy and plea≈øant to you than any vice can be. The be≈øt and noble≈øt conque≈øt is that of a man's own rea≈øon over his pa≈ø≈øions and his follies.</p>

            <head>A FABLE.</head>
            <byline>By the Celebrated LINNOEUS, Tran≈ølated from the Latin.</byline>
            <p>ONCE upon a time the ≈øeven wi≈øe men of Greece were met together at Athens, and it was propo≈øed that every one of them ≈øhould mention what he thought the greate≈øt wonder in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. One of them, of higher conceptions than the re≈øt, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed the opinion of ≈øome of the a≈øtronomers about the fixed ≈øtars, which they believed to be ≈øo many ≈øuns, that had each their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets rolling about them, and were ≈øtored with plants and animals like this earth. Fired with this thought, they agreed to ≈øuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Jupiter, that he would at lea≈øt permit them to take a journey to the moon, and ≈øtay there three days, in order to ≈øee the wonders of that place, and give an account of them at their return. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter con≈øented, and ordered them to a≈ø≈øemble on a high mountain, where there ≈øhould be a cloud ready to convey them to the place they de≈øired to ≈øee. They picked out ≈øome cho≈øen companions, who might a≈ø≈øi≈øt them in de≈øcribing and painting the objects they
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:027039_0222_0FD2FBB0A63B1818"/>
≈øhould meet with. At length they arrived at the moon, and found a palace there well fitted up for their reception. The next day, being very much fatigued with their journey, they kept quiet at home till noon; and being ≈øtill faint, they refre≈øhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves with a mo≈øt delicious entertainment, which they reli≈øhed ≈øo well, that it overcame their curio≈øity. This day they only ≈øaw through the window that delightful ≈øpot, adorned with the mo≈øt beautiful flowers, to which the beams of the ≈øun gave an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lu≈øtre, and heard the ≈øinging of mo≈øt melodious birds till evening came on. The next day they aro≈øe very early in order to begin their ob≈øervations; but ≈øome very beautiful young ladies of that country coming to make them a vi≈øit, advi≈øed them fir≈øt to recruit their ≈øtrength before they expo≈øed them≈øelves to the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ta≈øk they were about to undertake.</p>
            <p>The delicate meats, the rich wines, the beauty of the≈øe dam≈øels, prevailed over the re≈øolution of the≈øe ≈øtrangers. A fine concert of mu≈øic is introduced, the young ones begin to dance, and all is turned to jollity; ≈øo that this whole day was ≈øpent in gallantry, till ≈øome of the neighbouring inhabitants, growing envious at their mirth, ru≈øhed in with ≈øwords. The elder part of the company tried to appea≈øe the younger, promi≈øing the very next day they would bring the rioters to ju≈øtice. This they performed, and the third day the cau≈øe was heard; and what with accu≈øations, pleadings, exceptions, and the judgment it≈øelf, the whole day was taken up, on which the term ≈øet by Jupiter, expired. On their return to Greece, all the country flocked in upon them to hear the wonders of the moon de≈øcribed, but all they could tell was, for that was all they knew, that the ground was covered with green, intermixed with flowers, and that the birds ≈øung among the branches of the trees; but what kind of flowers they ≈øaw, or what kind of birds they heard, they were totally ignorant. Upon which they were treated every where with contempt.</p>
            <p>If we apply this fable to men of the pre≈øent age, we ≈øhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a very ju≈øt ≈øimilitude. By the≈øe three days the fable denotes the three ages of man. Fir≈øt, Youth, in which we are too feeble in every re≈øpect to look into the works of the Creator: all that ≈øea≈øon is given up to idlene≈øs, luxury, and pa≈øtime. Secondly, Manhood, in which men are employed in ≈øettling, marrying, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating children, providing fortunes for them, and rai≈øing a family. Thirdly, Old Age, in which after having made their fortunes, they are overwhelmed with law-≈øuits and proceedings relating to their e≈øtates. Thus it frequently happens that men never con≈øider to to what end they were de≈øtined, and why they were brought into the world.</p>
