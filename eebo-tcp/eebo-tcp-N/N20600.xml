            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>MODESTY is a polite accompliſhment, and generally an attendant upon merit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is engaging in the higheſt degree, and wins the hearts of all our acquaintance. On the contrary, none are more diſguſtful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Modeſty, however, widely differs from an awkward baſhfulneſs, which is as much to be condemned as the other is to be applauded. To appear ſimple is as ill-bred as to be impudent. A young man ought to be able to come into a room and addreſs the company without the leaſt embarraſſment. To be out of countenance when ſpoken to, and not to have an anſwer ready, is ridiculous to the laſt degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="unknown:027039_0005_0FD2F9C40C1B5D80"/>
An awkward country fellow, when he comes into company better than himſelf, is exceedingly diſconcerted. He knows not what to do with his hands or his hat, but either puts one of them in his pocket, and dangles the other by his ſide; or perhaps twirls his hat on his fingers, or fumbles with the button. If ſpoken to, he is in a much worſe ſituation; he anſwers with the utmoſt difficulty, and nearly ſtammers; whereas, a gentleman who is acquainted with life, enters a room with gracefulneſs, and a modeſt aſſurance, addreſſes perſons whom he does not know, in an eaſy and natural manner, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt embarraſſment. This is the characteriſtic of good breeding, a very neceſſary knowledge in our intercourſe with men; for one of inferior parts, with the behaviour of a gentleman, is frequently better received than a man of ſenſe, with the addreſs and manners of a clown.</p>
               <p>Ignorance and vice are the only things we need be aſhamed of; ſteer clear of theſe, and you may go into any company you will; not that I would have a young man throw off all dread of appearing abroad, as a fear of offending or being diſeſteemed, will make him preſerve a proper decorum. Some perſons, from experiencing the inconveniencies of falſe modeſty, have run into the other extreme, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> acquired the name of impudent. This is as great a fault as the other. A well-bred man keeps himſelf between the two, and ſteers the middle way. He is eaſy and firm in every company, is modeſt, but not baſhful, ſteady, but not impudent. He copies the manners of the better ſort of people, and conforms to their cuſtoms with eaſe and attention.</p>
               <p>Till we can preſent ourſelves in all companies with coolneſs and unconcern, we can never preſent ourſelves well; nor will a man ever be ſuppoſed to have kept good company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ever be acceptable in ſuch company, if he cannot appear there eaſy and unembarraſſed. A modeſt aſſurance, in every part of life, is the moſt advantageous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification we can poſſibly acquire.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of becoming inſolent, a man of ſenſe, under a conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of merit, is more modeſt. He behaves himſelf indeed with firmneſs, but without the leaſt preſumption. The man who is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his own merit, is no leſs a fool, than he who is conſtantly diſplaying it. A man of underſtanding avails himſelf of his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but never boaſts of them; whereas the timid and baſhful can never puſh himſelf in life, be his merit as great as it will; he will be always kept behind by the forward and the buſtling. A man of abilities, and acquainted with life, will ſtand as firm in defence of his own rights, as the moſt impudent man alive; but then he does it with a ſeeming modeſty. Thus, manner is every thing; what is impudence in one, is proper aſſurance only in another; for firmneſs is commendable, but an overbearing conduct is diſguſtful.</p>
               <p>Forwardneſs being the very reverſe of modeſty, follow rather than lead the company: that is, join in diſcourſe upon ſubjects, rather than ſtart one of your own; if you have parts, you will have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities enough of ſhowing them on every topic of converſation; and if you have none, it is better to expoſe yourſelf upon a ſubject of other people's than one of your own.</p>
               <p>But, be particularly careful not to ſpeak of yourſelf, if you can help it. An impudent fellow lugs in himſelf abruptly upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:027039_0006_0FD2F9C5717A61C0"/>
and is ever the hero of his own ſtory. Others will colour their arrogance with, "It may ſeem ſtrange, indeed, that I ſhould talk in this manner of myſelf; it is what I by no means like, and ſhould never do, if I had not been cruelly and unjuſtly accuſed; but when my character is attacked; it is a juſtice I owe to myſelf to defend it." This veil is too thin not to be ſeen through on the firſt inſpection.</p>
               <p>Others again, with more art, will <hi>modeſtly</hi> boaſt of all the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal virtues, by calling theſe virtues, weakneſſes, and ſaying, they are ſo unfortunate as to fall into weakneſſes. "I cannot ſee perſons ſuffer," ſays one of this caſt, "without relieving them; though my circumſtances are very unable to afford it." "I cannot avoid ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth, though it is often very imprudent," and ſo on.</p>
               <p>This angling for praiſe is ſo prevailing a principle, that it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtoops to the loweſt objects. Men will often boaſt of doing that, which, if true, would be rather a diſgrace to them than otherwiſe. One man affirms, that he rode twenty miles within the hour; 'tis probably a lie, but ſuppoſe he did, what then? He had a good horſe under him, and is a good jocky. Another ſwears he has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, at a ſitting, drank five or ſix bottles to his own ſhare. Out of reſpect to him, I will believe him a liar, for I would not wiſh to think him a beaſt.</p>

               <p>OF all the vices, there is none more criminal, more mean, and more ridiculous, than lying. The end we deſign by it, is very ſeldom accompliſhed, for lies are always found out, at one time or other; and yet there are perſons who give way to this vice, who are otherwiſe of good principles, and have not been ill educated.</p>
               <p>Lies generally proceed from vanity, cowardice, and a revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſpoſition, and ſometimes from a miſtaken notion of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>He who tells a malicious lie, with a view of injuring the perſon he ſpeaks of, may gratify his wiſh for a while, but will in the end, find it recoil upon himſelf; for as ſoon as he is detected, (and detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he moſt certainly will be) he is deſpiſed for the infamous attempt, and whatever he may ſay hereafter of that perſon, will be conſidered as falſe, whether it be ſo or not.</p>
               <p>If a man lies, ſhuffles or equivocates, for, in fact, they are all

alike, by way of excuſe for any thing he has ſaid or done, he aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the offence, rather than leſſens it; for the perſon to whom the lie is told, has a right to know the truth, or there ſhould have been no occaſion to have framed a falſehood. This perſon, of courſe will think himſelf ill-treated for being a ſecond time affronted; for what can be a greater affront than an attempt to impoſe upon any man's underſtanding? Beſides, lying in excuſe for a fault, betrays fear, than which nothing is more daſtardly, and unbecoming the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a gentleman.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more manly, or more noble, if we have done wrong, than frankly to own it. It is the only way of meeting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs. Indeed, confeſſing a fault, and aſking pardon, with great minds, is conſidered as a ſufficient attonement. "I have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed into an error," or, "I have injured you, ſir, and am heartily aſhamed of it, and ſorry for it," has frequently diſarmed the perſon injured, and, where he would have been our enemy, has made him our friend.</p>
               <p>There are perſons alſo, whoſe <hi>vanity</hi> leads them to tell a thouſand lies. They perſuade themſelves, that, if it be no way injurious to others, it is harmleſs and innocent, and they ſhelter their falſehoods under the ſofter name of <hi>untruths.</hi> Theſe perſons are fooliſh enough to imagine, that if they can recite any thing wonderful, they draw the attention of the company, and if they themſelves are the objects of that wonder, they are looked up to as perſons extraordinary. This has made many a man ſee things that never were in being, hear things that never were ſaid, and atchieve feats that never were attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and dealing always in the marvellous. Such may be aſſured, however unwilling the perſons they are converſing with, may be to laugh in their faces, that they hold them ſecretly in the higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; for he who will tell a lie thus idly, will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Rather than any perſon ſhould doubt of my veracity for one minute, I would deprive my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of telling abroad either what I had really ſeen or heard, if ſuch things did not carry with them the face of probability.</p>
               <p>Others again will boaſt of the great reſpect they met with in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain companies; of the honours that are continually heaped on them there; of the great price they give for every thing they purchaſe, and this is to be thought of conſequence; but unleſs ſuch people have the beſt and moſt accurate memory, they will, perhaps, very ſoon after, contradict their former aſſertions, and ſubject themſelves to contempt and deriſion.</p>
               <p>Remember then, as long as you live, that nothing but ſtrict truth can carry you through life with honour and credit. Liars are not only diſagreeable, but dangerous companions, and, when known, will ever be ſhunned by men of underſtanding.

               <p>VOID of good-breeding, every other qualification will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, unadorned, and to a certain degree unavailing.</p>

Good breeding being the reſult of good ſenſe and good nature, is it not wonderful that people poſſeſſed of the one, ſhould be deficient in the other? The modes of it varying according to perſons, places and circumſtances, cannot, indeed, be acquired otherwiſe than by time and obſervation, but the ſubſtance is every where and always the ſame.</p>
               <p>What good morals are to ſociety in general, good manners are to particular ones; their band and ſecurity. Of all actions, next to that of performing a good one, the conſciouſneſs of rendering a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, is the moſt grateful.</p>
               <p>We ſeldom ſee a perſon, let him be ever ſo ill-bred, wanting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> reſpect to thoſe whom he acknowledges to be his ſuperiors; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſhowing this reſpect, then, is all I contend for. The well-bred man expreſſes it naturally and eaſily, while he who is unuſed to good company expreſſes it awkwardly. Study, then, to ſhow that reſpect which every one wiſhes to ſhow, in an eaſy and graceful way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this muſt be learned by obſervation.</p>
               <p>In company with our equals, or in mixed companies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a greater lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude may be taken in your behaviour; yet it ſhould never exceed the bounds of decency; for though no one in this caſe, can claim any diſtinguiſhed marks of reſpect, every one is entitled to civility and good manners. A man need not, for example, fear to put his hands in his pockets, take ſnuff, fit, ſtand, or occaſionally walk about the room; but it would be highly unbecoming to whiſtle, wear his hat, looſen his garters, or throw himſelf acroſs the chairs. Such liberties are offenſive to our equals, and inſulting to our inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. Eaſineſs of carriage, by no means implies inattention and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs. No one is at liberty to act in all reſpects as he pleaſes; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Let a man talk to you ever ſo ſtupidly or frivolouſly, not to pay ſome attention to what he ſays, is ſavageneſs to the greateſt degree. Nay, if he even forces his converſation on you, it is worſe than rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not to liſten to him; for your inattention in this caſe, tells him in expreſs terms, that you think him a blockhead, and not worth the hearing. Now, if ſuch behaviour is rude to men, it is much more ſo to women, who be their rank what it will, have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>In promiſcuous companies you ſhould vary your addreſs agreeable to the different ages of the perſons you ſpeak to. It would be rude and abſurd to talk of your amours or your pleaſures, to men of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dignity and gravity, to clergymen, or men in years; but ſtill you ſhould be as eaſy with them as with others; your manner only ſhould be varied; you ſhould if poſſible double your e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

places, the beſt diſhes, &amp;c. but always decline them, and offer them to others, except, indeed, you are offered any thing by a ſuperior, when it would be a rudeneſs, if you liked it, not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it immediately, without the leaſt apology. Thus for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was a ſuperior, the maſter of the table, to offer you a thing of which there was but one, to paſs it to the perſon next you, would be directly charging him that offered it to you, with a want of good manners and proper reſpect to his company; or, if you were the only ſtranger preſent, it would be a rudeneſs if you would make a feint of refuſing it, without the cuſtomary apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, "I cannot think of taking it from you, ſir;" or, "I am ſorry to deprive you of it;" as it is ſuppoſed he is conſcious of his own rank, and if he choſe not to give it, would not have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it; your apology, therefore, in this caſe, is putting him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an equality with yourſelf. In like manner, it is rudeneſs to draw back when requeſted by a ſuperior to paſs a door firſt, or to ſtep into a carriage before him. In ſhort, it would be endleſs to particulariſe all the inſtances in which a well-bred man ſhows his politeneſs in good company, ſuch as not yawning, ſinging, whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, warming his breech at the fire, lounging, putting his legs upon the chairs, and the like; familiarities, every man's good ſenſe muſt condemn, and good breeding abhor.</p>
               <p>But good breeding conſiſts in more than merely not being ill-bred. To return a bow, ſpeak when you are ſpoken to, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing rude, are ſuch negative acts of good breeding, that they are little more than not being a brute. Would it not be a very poor recommendation of any man's cleanlineſs, to ſay, that, he was not offenſive? If we wiſh for the good will and eſteem of our acquaintance, our good breeding muſt be active, cheerful, officious and ſeducing.</p>
               <p>For example, ſhould you invite any one to dine or ſup with you, recollect whether ever you had obſerved them to prefer one thing to another, and endeavour to procure that thing; when at table, ſay, "At ſuch a time, I think, you ſecured to give this diſh a preference, I therefore ordered it." "This is the wine I obſerved you beſt like, I have therefore been at ſome pains to procure it." Trifling as theſe things may appear, they prove an attention to the perſon they are ſaid to; and as attention in trifles is the teſt of reſpect, the compliment will not be loſt.</p>
               <p>I need only refer you to your own breaſt. How have theſe little attentions when ſhown you by others, flattered that ſelf-love which no man is free from? They incline and attach us to that perſon, and prejudice us afterwards to all that he ſays or does. The declaration of the women in a great degree, ſtamps a man's reputation of being either ill or well bred; you muſt then, in a manner overwhelm them with theſe attentions; they are uſed to them, and naturally expect them; and to do them juſtice, they are ſeldom loſt upon them. You muſt be ſedulous to wait upon them, pick up with alacrity any thing they drop, and be very officious in procuring their carriages or chairs in public places; he blind to what you ſhould not ſee, and deaf to what you ſhould not hear. Opportunities of ſhowing theſe attentions are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:027039_0010_0FD2F9CE10741110"/>
preſenting themſelves; but in caſe they ſhould not, you muſt ſtudy to create them.</p>
               <p>If ever you would be eſteemed by the women, your converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them ſhould be always reſpectful, lively, and addreſſed to their vanity. Every thing you ſay or do, ſhould tend to ſhow a regard to their beauty or good ſenſe: even men are not without their vanities of one kind or other, and flattering that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by words and looks of approbation, is one of the principal characters of good breeding.</p>
               <p>Addreſs and manners, with weak perſons, who are actually three-fourths of the world, are every thing; and even people of the beſt underſtanding are taken in with them. Where the heart is not won, and the eye pleaſed, the mind will be ſeldom on our ſide.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, learning and erudition, without good breeding, is tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and pedantic; and an ill-bred man is as unfit for good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as he will be unwelcome in it. Nay, he is full as unfit for buſineſs as for company. Make then, good breeding the great object of your thoughts and actions. Be particularly obſervant of, and endeavour to imitate, the behaviour and manners of ſuch as are diſtinguiſhed by their politeneſs; and be perſuaded, that good breeding is to all worldly qualifications, what charity is to all chriſtian virtues; it adorns merit, and often covers the want of it.</p>

Further, he has perhaps a number of diſagreeable tricks, he ſnuffs up his noſe, picks it with his finger, blows it, and looks into his handkerchief, crams his hand into his boſom, and next into his breeches.

               <p>There is alſo an awkwardneſs in ſpeech, that naturally falls under his head, and ought to, and may be guarded againſt; ſuch as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geting names, and miſtaking one name for mother; to ſpeak of Mr. What-dy'e-call-him, or You know-who, Mrs. Thingum, What's-her-name, or How-dy'e-call-her, is exceeding awkward and vulgar.

               <p>Our voice and manner of ſpeaking too, ſhould likewiſe be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to. Some will mumble over their words, ſo as not to be intelligible, and others will ſpeak ſo faſt as not to be underſtood; and, in doing this, will ſputter and ſpit in your face; ſome will bawl as if they were ſpeaking to the deaf; others will ſpeak ſo low as ſcarcely to be heard; and many will put their faces ſo cloſe to yours, as to offend you with their breath. All theſe habits are horrid and diſguſtful, but may eaſily be got the better of with care. They are the vulgar characteriſtics of a low-bred man, or are proofs that very little pains have been beſtowed in his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In ſhort, an attention to theſe little matters are of greater importance than you are aware of; many a ſenſible man having loſt ground for want of thoſe little graces, and many a one poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of theſe perfections alone, has made his way through life, that otherwiſe would not have been noticed.</p>

               <p>BUT, as no one can pleaſe in company, however graceful his air, unleſs he be clean and neat in his perſon, this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication comes next to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Negligence of one's perſon not only implies an insufferable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, but an indifference whether we pleaſe or not.

               <p>He who is not thoroughly clean in his perſon, will be offenſive to all he converſes with. A particular regard to the cleanlineſs of your mouth, teeth, hands and nails, is but common decency. A ſoul mouth, and unclean hands, are certain marks of vulgarity; the firſt is the cauſe of an offenſive breath, which nobody can bear, and the laſt is declarative of dirty work; one may always know a gentleman by the ſtate of his hands and nails. The fleſh at the roots ſhould be kept back, ſo as to ſhow the ſemi-circles at the bottom of the nails; the edges of the nails ſhould never he cut down below the ends of the fingers, nor ſhould they be ſuffered to grow longer than the fingers. When the nails are cut down to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Theſe things may appear too inſignificant to be mentioned; but when it is conſidered that a thouſand little nameleſs things, which every one feels, but no one can deſcribe, conſpire to form that <hi>whole</hi> of pleaſing, I hope you will not call them trifling.

               <p>NEATNESS of perſon, I obſerved, was as neceſſary as cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; of courſe ſome attention muſt be paid to your dreſs.</p>
               <p>Such is the abſurdity of the times, that to paſs well with the world, we muſt adopt ſome of its cuſtoms, be they ridiculous or not.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, to neglect one's dreſs, is to affront all the female part of our acquaintance. The women in particular pay an attention to their dreſs; to neglect therefore your's, will diſpleaſe them, as it would be tacitly taxing them with vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and declaring that you thought them not worthy that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect which every body elſe does. And, as I have mentioned before, as it is the women who ſtamp a young man's credit in the faſhionable world, if you do not make yourſelf agreeable to the women, you will aſſuredly loſe ground among the men.</p>
               <p>Dreſs, as trifling as it may appear to a man of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prepoſſeſſes on the firſt appearance, which is frequently deciſive. And indeed we may form ſome opinion of a man's ſenſe and character from his dreſs. Any exceeding of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, or any affectation in dreſs, whatever, argues a weakneſs in underſtanding, and nine times out of ten it will be found out ſo.</p>
               <p>There are few young fellows but what diſplay ſome character or other in this ſhape. Some would be thought fearleſs and brave; theſe wear a black cravat, a ſhort coat and waiſtcoat, and an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon long ſword, hanging to their knees, a large hat fiercely cocked, and are FLASH all over. Others affect to be country ſquires; theſe will go about in buckſkin breeches, brown frock, and a great oaken cudgel in their hands, ſlouched hats, with their hair un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, and tucked up under them to an enormous ſize, and imitate grooms, and country boobies ſo well externally, that there is not the leaſt doubt of their reſembling them as well internally. Others again, paint and powder themſelves ſo much, and dreſs ſo finically, as leads us to ſuppoſe they are only girls in boys cloaths. Now a ſenſible man carefully avoids all this, or any other affectation. He dreſſes as faſhionably and well as perſons of

               <p>It is not one or two qualifications <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> graceful ſpeaking is as eſſential as gracefulneſs of perſon. Every man cannot be an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious ſpeaker; a roughneſs or coarſeneſs of voice may prevent it; but if there are no natural imperfections, if a man does not ſtammer or liſp, or has not loſt his teeth, he may ſpeak gracefully, nor will all theſe defects, if he has a mind to it, prevent him from ſpeaking correctly.</p>
               <p>Nobody can attend with pleaſure to a bad ſpeaker. One who tells his ſtory ill, be it ever ſo important, will tire even the moſt patient.

                  </gap> ill-ſpoken one has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted you. 'Tis the ſame in common converſation; he who ſpeaks deliberately, diſtinctly and correctly; he who makes uſe of the beſt words to expreſs himſelf, and varies his voice accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of the ſubject, will always pleaſe; while the thick or haſty ſpeaker, he who mumbles out a ſet of ill-choſen words, utters them ungrammatically, or with a dull monotony, will tire and diſguſt. Be aſſured, then, the air, the geſture, the looks of a ſpeaker, a proper accent, a juſt emphaſis, and tuneful cadence, are full as neceſſary to pleaſe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> attended to, as the ſubject matter itſelf.</p>
               <p>People may talk what they will of ſolid reaſoning and ſound ſenſe; without the graces and ornaments of language, they will neither pleaſe or perſuade. In common diſcourſe, even trifles elegantly expreſſed, will be better received than the beſt of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, homeſpun and unadorned.</p>
               <p>A good way to acquire a graceful utterance is, to read aloud to ſome friend every day, and beg of him to ſet you right, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aſe you read too faſt, do not obſerve the proper ſtops, lay a wrong emphaſis, or utter your words indiſtinctly. You may even read
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027039_0015_0FD2F9DD6B427A68"/>
aloud to yourſelf, where ſuch a friend is not at hand, and you will find your own ear a good corrector. Take care to open your teeth when you read or ſpeak, and articulate every word diſtinctly, which laſt cannot be done, but by ſounding the final letter. But above all, endeavour to vary your voice, according to the matter, and avoid a monotony. By a daily attention to this, it will, in a little time, become eaſy and habitual to you.</p>
               <p>Pay an attention alſo to your looks and your geſture, when talking even on the moſt trifling ſubjects; things appear very different, according as they are expreſſed, looked and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>Now, if it is neceſſary to attend ſo particularly to our <hi>manner</hi> of ſpeaking, it is much more ſo, with reſpect to the <hi>matter.</hi> Fine turns of expreſſion, a genteel and correct ſtyle, are ornaments as requiſite to common ſenſe, as polite behaviour and an elegant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs are to common good manners: they are great aſſiſtants in the point of pleaſing. A gentleman, 'tis true, may be known in the meaneſt garb, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Be careful then of your ſtyle upon all occaſions; whether you write or ſpeak, ſtudy for the beſt words and beſt expreſſions, even in common converſation, or the moſt familiar letters. This will prevent your ſpeaking in a hurry, than which nothing is more vulgar; though you may be a little embarraſſed at firſt, time and uſe will render it eaſy.

               <p>There is a certain diſtinguiſhing diction that marks the man of faſhion, a certain language of converſation that every gentleman ſhould be maſter of.

               <p>A continual inattention to matters that occur, is the character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic of a weak mind; the man who gives way to it, is little leſs than a trifler, a blank in ſociety, which every ſenſible perſon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks;

               <p>HAVING mentioned abſence of mind, let me be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular concerning it.</p>
               <p>What the world calls an abſent man is, generally either a very affected one, or a very weak one; but whether weak or affected, he is, in company, a very diſagreeable man. Loſt in thought, or poſſibly in no thought at all, he is a ſtranger to every one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to every thing that paſſes; he knows not his beſt friends, is deficient in every act of good manners, unobſervant of the actions of the company, and inſenſible of his own. His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> are quite the reverſe of what they ought to be; talk to him of one thing, and he replies as of another. He forgets what he ſaid laſt, leaves his hat in one room, his cane in another, and his ſword in a third; nay if it was not for his buckles, he would even leave his ſhoes behind him. Neither his arms <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> his legs ſeem to be a part of his body, and his head is never in a right poſition. He joins not in the general converſation, except by fits and ſtarts, as if awaking from a dream; I attribute this either to weakneſs or affectation. His ſhallow mind is poſſibly not able to attend to more than one thing at a time; or he would be ſuppoſed wrapt up in the inveſtigation of ſome very important matter. Such men as Sir Iſaac Newton or Mr. Locke, might occaſionally, have ſome excuſe for abſence of mind; it might proceed from that intenſeneſs of thought that was neceſſary at all times for the ſcientific ſubjects they were ſtudying; but for a young man, and a man of the world, who has no ſuch plea to make, abſence of mind is a rudeneſs to the company, and deſerves the ſevereſt cenſure.</p>
               <p>However inſignificant a company may be; however trifling their converſation; while you are with them, do not ſhow them by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention, that you think them trifling; that can never be the way to pleaſe; but rather fall in with their weakneſs than otherwiſe; for, to mortify, or ſhow the leaſt contempt to thoſe we are in company with, is the greateſt rudeneſs we can be guilty of, and what few can forgive.</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:027039_0019_0FD2F9E9C501BD00"/>
I never yet found a man inattentive to the perſon he feared, or the woman he loved; which convinces me, that abſence of mind is to be got the better of, if we think proper to make the trial; and believe me it is always worth the attempt.</p>
               <p>Abſence of mind is a tacit declaration, that thoſe we are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with, are not worth attending to; and what can be a greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front?—Beſides, can an abſent man improve by what is ſaid or done in his preſence?—No; he may frequent the beſt companies for years together, and all to no purpoſe. In ſhort, a man is neither fit for bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs or converſation, unleſs he can attend to the object before him, be that object what it will.</p>

               <p>A KNOWLEDGE of the world by your own experience and obſervation is ſo neceſſary, that without it we ſhall act very abſurdly, and frequently give offence, when we do not mean it. All the learning and parts in the world will not ſecure us from it. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an acquaintance with life, a man may ſay very good things, but time them ſo ill, and addreſs them ſo improperly, that he had much better be ſilent. Full of himſelf and his own buſineſs, and inattentive to the circumſtances and ſituations of thoſe he converſes with, he vents them without the leaſt diſcretion, ſays things that he ought not to ſay, confuſes ſome, ſhocks others, and puts the whole company in pain, leſt what he utters next ſhould prove worſe than the laſt. The beſt direction I can give you in this matter, is rather to fall in with the converſation of others, than ſtart a ſubject of your own; rather ſtrive to put them more in conceit with themſelves, than draw their attention to you.</p>

But how? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard either to circumſtances or occaſion. Inſtead of thoſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate touches, thoſe ſoft tints, that ſerve to heighten the piece, he lays on his colours with a heavy hand, and daubs where he means to adorn; in other words, he will flatter ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, and at the ſame time ſo groſsly, that while he wiſhes to pleaſe, he puts out of countenance, and is ſure to offend. On the contrary, a man of the world, one who has made life his ſtudy, knows the power of flattery as well as he; but then he knows how to apply it, he watches the opportunity, and does it indirectly, by inference, compariſon and hint.</p>
               <p>Man is made up of ſuch a variety of matter, that to ſearch him thoroughly, requires time and attention; for though we are all made of the ſame materials, and have all the ſame paſſions, yet from a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in their proportion and combination, we vary in our diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; what is agreeable to one is diſagreeable to another, and what one ſhall approve another ſhall condemn. Reaſon is given us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul theſe paſſions, but ſeldom does it. Application therefore to the reaſon of any man, will frequently prove ineffectual, unleſs we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour at the ſame time to gain his heart.</p>
               <p>Wherever then you are, ſearch into the characters of men; find out,

if poſſible, their foible, their governing paſſion, or their particular merit; take them on their weak ſide, and you will generally ſucceed; their prevailing vanity you may readily diſcover, by obſerving their favourite topic of converſation, for every one talks moſt of what he would be thought moſt to excel in.</p>
               <p>The time ſhould alſo be judiciouſly made choice of. Every man has his particular time, when he may be applied to with ſucceſs, the <hi>mollia tempora fandi;</hi> but theſe times are not all day long; they muſt be found out, watched, and taken advantage of. You could not hope for ſucceſs in applying to a man about one buſineſs, when he was taken up with another, or when his mind was affected with exceſs of grief, anger, or the like.</p>
               <p>You cannot judge of other mens minds better than by ſtudying your own; for though ſome men have one foible, and another has another, yet men in general are very much alike. Whatever pleaſes or offends you, will in ſimilar circumſtances, pleaſe or offend others; if you find yourſelf hurt when another makes you feel his ſuperiority, you will certainly, upon the common rule of right, <hi>do as you would be done by,</hi> take care not to let another feel <hi>your</hi> ſuperiority, if you have it; eſpecially if you wiſh to gain his intereſt or eſteem. If diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſinuations, open contradictions or oblique ſneers vex and anger you, would you uſe them where you wiſhed to pleaſe? Certainly not. Obſerve then, with care the operations of your own mind, and you may in a great meaſure read all mankind.</p>
               <p>I will allow that one bred up in a cloyſter or college may reaſon well on the ſtructure of the human mind; he may inveſtigate the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, and give a tolerable account of his head, his heart, his paſſions, and his ſentiments: but at the ſame time he may know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of him; he has not lived with him, and of courſe can know but little how thoſe ſentiments or thoſe paſſions will work—He muſt be ignorant of the various<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Labour then to acquire this intuitive knowledge; attend carefully to the addreſs, the arts and manners of thoſe acquainted with life, and endeavour to imitate them. Obſerve the means they take to gain the favour and conciliate the affections of thoſe they aſſociate with; purſue thoſe means, and you will ſoon gain the eſteem of all that know you.</p>
               <p>How often have we ſeen men governed by perſons very much their inferiors in point of underſtanding, and even without their knowing it? A proof that ſome men have more worldly dexterity than others; they find out the weak and unguarded part, make their attack there, and the man ſurrenders.</p>
               <p>Now from a knowledge of mankind, we ſhall learn the advantage of two things, the command of our temper and our countenances;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027039_0021_0FD2F9ED4AC5FAF8"/>
a trifling diſagreeable incident ſhall perhaps anger one unacquainted with life, or confound him with ſhame; ſhall make him rave like a mad-man, or look like a fool; but a man of the world will never underſtand what he cannot or ought not to reſent. If he ſhould chance to make a ſhip himſelf, he will ſtifle his confuſion, and turn it off with a jeſt, recovering it with coolneſs.</p>
               <p>Many people have ſenſe enough to keep their own ſecrets, but from being unuſed to a variety of company, have unfortunately ſuch a tell-tale countenance, as involuntarily declares what they would wiſh to conceal. This is a great unhappineſs, and ſhould, as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible be got the better of.</p>
               <p>That coolneſs of mind, and evenneſs of countenance, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents a diſcovery of our ſentiments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> our words, our actions, or our looks, is too neceſſary to paſs unnoticed. A man who cannot hear diſpleaſing things without viſible marks of anger or uneaſineſs, or pleaſing ones, without a ſudden burſt of joy, a cheerful eye, or an expanded face, is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the mercy of every knave, for either they will deſignedly pleaſe or provoke you themſelves, to catch your unguarded looks; or they will ſeize the opportunity, thus to read your very heart, when any other ſhall do it. You may poſſibly tell me that this coolneſs muſt be natural, for if not, you can never acquire it. I will admit the force of conſtitution, but people are very apt to blame for many things they might readily avoid. Care with a little reflexion will ſoon give you this maſtery of your temper and your countenance. If you find yourſelf ſubject to ſudden ſtarts of paſſion, determine with yourſelf not to utter a ſingle word till your reaſon has recovered itſelf; and reſolve to keep your countenance as unmoved as poſſible. As a man, who at a card table, can preſerve a ſerenity in his looks under good or bad luck, has conſiderably the advantage of one who appears elated with ſucceſs, or caſt down with ill fortune, from our being able to read his cards in his face, ſo the man of the world, having to deal with one of theſe babbling countenances, will take care to profit by the circumſtance, let the conſequence, to him with whom he deals, be as injurious as it may.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of life; we ſhall find it neceſſary very often to put on a pleaſing countenance when we are exceedingly diſpleaſed; we muſt frequently ſeem friendly when we are quite otherwiſe. I am ſenſible it is difficult to accoſt a man with ſmiles whom we know to be our enemy: but what is to be done? On receiving an affront, if you cannot be juſtified in knocking the offender down, you muſt not notice the offence; for, in the eye of the world, taking an affront calmly is conſidered as cowardice,</p>
               <p>If fools ſhould attempt at any time to be witty upon you, the beſt way is not to know their witticiſms are levelled at you, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal any uneaſineſs it may give you: but ſhould they be ſo plain that you cannot be thought ignorant of their meaning, I would recommend, rather than quarrel with the company, joining even in the laugh againſt yourſelf; allow the jeſt to be a good one, and take it in ſeeming good humour. Never attempt to retaliate the ſame way, as that would imply you were hurt. Should what is ſaid wound your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               <p>Remember there are but two alternatives for a gentleman; extreme
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027039_0022_0FD2F9EEBB25B170"/>
politeneſs, or the ſword. If a man openly and deſignedly affronts you, call him out; but if it does not amount to an open inſult, be outwardly civil; if this does not make him aſhamed of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, it will prejudice every by-ſtander in your favour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being diſgraced, you will come off with honour. Politeneſs to thoſe you do not reſpect, is no more a breach of faith, than <hi>your humble ſervant</hi> at the bottom of a challenge; they are univerſally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be things of courſe.</p>
               <p>Wrangling and quarreling are characteriſtic of a weak mind; leave that to the women, be <hi>you</hi> always above it. Enter into no ſharp conteſt, and pride yourſelf, in ſhowing, if poſſible, more civility to your antagoniſt than to any other in company; this will infallibly bring over all the laughers to your ſide, and the perſons you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with, will be very likely to confeſs you have behaved very handſomely throughout the whole affair.</p>
               <p>Experience will teach us, that though all men conſiſt principally of the ſame materials, as I before took notice, yet for a difference in their proportion, no two men are uniformly the ſame: we differ from one another, and we often differ from ourſelves, that is, we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do things utterly inconſiſtent with the general tenor of our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. The wiſeſt man will occaſionally do a weak thing; the moſt honeſt man a wrong thing; the proudeſt man a mean thing; and the worſt of men will ſometimes do a good thing. On this account, our ſtudy of mankind ſhould not be general: we ſhould take a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent view of individuals, and though we may upon the whole form a judgment of the man from his prevailing paſſion or his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral character, yet it will be prudent not to determine, till we have waited to ſee the operations of his ſubordinate appetites and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
               <p>For example: a man's general character may be that of ſtrictly honeſt; I would not diſpute it, becauſe, I would not be thought envious or malevolent; but I would not rely upon this general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, ſo as to entruſt him with my fortune or my life. Should this honeſt man, as is not uncommon, be my rival in power, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, or love, he may poſſibly do things, that in other circumſtances he would abhor: and power, intereſt and love, let me tell you, will often put honeſty to the ſevereſt trial, and frequently overpower it. I would then ranſack this honeſt man to the bottom, if I wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to truſt him, and as I found him, would place my confidence accordingly.</p>
               <p>One of the great compoſitions in our nature is vanity, to which all men more or leſs give way.</p>
               <p>Women have an intolerable ſhare of it. No flattery, no adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too groſs for them; thoſe who flatter them moſt pleaſe them beſt, and they are moſt in love with them: and the leaſt ſlight or contempt of them is never forgotten. It is in ſome meaſure the ſame with men; they will ſooner pardon an injury than an inſult, and are more hurt by contempt than by ill uſage. Though all men do not boaſt of ſuperior talents, though they pretend not to the abilities of a Pope, a Newton, or a Bolingbroke, every one who pretends to have common ſenſe, and to diſcharge his office in life with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon decency; to arraign therefore, in any ſhape his abilities or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027039_0023_0FD2F9F032F7B2F0"/>
in the department he holds, is an inſult he will not readily forgive.</p>
               <p>As I would not have you truſt too implicitly to a man, becauſe the world gives him a good character; ſo I muſt particularly caution you againſt thoſe who ſpeak well of themſelves. In general ſuſpect thoſe who boaſt of, or affect to have any one virtue above all others, for they are commonly impoſtors. There are exceptions however to this rule, for we hear of prudes that have been chaſte, bullies that have been brave, and ſaints that have been religious. Confide only where your own obſervation ſhall direct you; obſerve not only what is ſaid, but how it is ſaid, and if you have any penetration, you may find out the truth better by your eyes than your ears; in ſhort, never take a character upon common report, but enquire into it yourſelf; for common report, though it is right in general, may be wrong in particulars.</p>
               <p>Beware of thoſe who on a ſhort acquaintance, make you a tender of their friendſhip, and ſeem to place a confidence in you; 'tis ten to one but they deceive and betray you; however, do not rudely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them upon ſuch a ſuppoſition: you may be civil to them, though you do not entruſt them. Silly men are apt to ſolicit your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and unboſom themſelves upon the firſt acquaintance; ſuch a friend cannot be worth hearing, their friendſhip being as ſlender as their underſtanding; and if they proffer their friendſhip with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to make a property of you, they are dangerous acquaintance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Not but the little friendſhips of the weak may be of ſome uſe to you, if you do not return the compliment; and it may not be amiſs to ſeem to accept thoſe of deſigning men, keeping them, as it were, in play, that they may not be openly your enemies; for their enmity is the next dangerous thing to their friendſhip. We may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly hold their vices in abhorrence, without being marked out as their perſonal enemy. The general rule is to have a real reſerve with almoſt every one, and a ſeeming reſerve with almoſt no one: for it is very diſguſting to ſeem reſerved, and very dangerous not to be ſo. Few obſerve the true medium. Many are ridiculouſly myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious upon trifles, and many indiſcreetly communicative of all they know.</p>
               <p>There is a kind of ſhort-lived friendſhip that takes place among young men, from a connexion in their pleaſures only; a friendſhip too often attended with bad conſequences. This companion of your pleaſures, young and unexperienced, will probably in the heat of convivial mirth, vow a perpetual friendſhip, and unfold himſelf to you without the leaſt reſerve: but new aſſociations, change of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or change of place, may ſoon break this ill-timed connexion and an improper uſe may be made of it. Be one if you will, in young companies, and bear your part like others in all the ſocial feſtivity of youth; nay, truſt them with your innocent frolics, but keep your ſerious matters to yourſelf; and if you muſt at any time make <hi>them</hi> known, let it be to ſome tried friend of great experience; and that nothing may tempt him to become your rival, let that friend be in a different walk of life from yourſelf.</p>
               <p>Were I to hear a man making ſtrong proteſtations and ſwearing to the truth of the thing that is in itſelf probable, and very likely to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:027039_0024_0FD2F9F1B3D83398"/>
be, I ſhould doubt his veracity; for when he takes ſuch pains to make me believe it, it cannot be a good deſign.</p>
               <p>There is a certain eaſineſs or falſe modeſty in moſt young people, that either makes them unwilling, or aſhamed to refuſe any thing that is aſked of them. There is alſo an unguarded openneſs about them, that makes them the ready prey of the artful and deſigning. They are eaſily led away by the feigned friendſhips of a knave or a fool, and too raſhly place a confidence in them, that terminates in their loſs, and frequently in their ruin. Beware therefore, as I ſaid before, of theſe proffered friendſhips; repay them with compliments, but not with confidence. Never let your vanity make you ſuppoſe, that people become your friends on a ſlight acquaintance; for good offices muſt be ſhown upon both ſides to create a friendſhip: it will not thrive unleſs its love be mutual; and it requires time to ripen it.</p>
               <p>There is ſtill among young people another kind of friendſhip, merely nominal, warm indeed for the time, but fortunately of no long continuance. This friendſhip takes it riſe from their purſuing the ſame courſe of riot and debauchery; their purſes are open to each other, they tell one another all they know; they embark in the ſame quarrels, and ſtand by each other on all occaſions. I ſhould rather call this a confederacy againſt good morals and good manners, and think it deſerves the ſevereſt laſh of the law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> but, they have the impudence to call it friendſhip. However, it is often as ſuddenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved as it is haſtily contracted; ſome accident diſperſes them, and they preſently forget each other, except it be to betray and to laugh at their own egregious folly.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the ſum of the whole is, to make a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween companies and friends, for a very agreeable companion has often proved a very dangerous friend.</p>

               <head>CHOICE OF COMPANY.</head>
               <p>THE next thing to the choice of your friends is the choice of your company.</p>
               <p>Endeavour as much as you can to keep good company, and the company of your ſuperiors; for you will be held in eſtimation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what company you keep. By ſuperiors, I do not mean ſo much with regard to birth, as merit, and the light in which they are conſidered in the world.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of good company, the one conſiſts of perſons of birth, rank and faſhion; the other, of thoſe who are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome peculiar merit, in any liberal art or ſcience; as men of letters, &amp;c. and a mixture of theſe is what I would have underſtood by good company; for it is not what particular ſets of people in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral acknowledge to be ſo, and are the accredited good company of the place.</p>
               <p>Now and then, perſons without either birth, rank or character, will creep into good company, under the protection of ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable perſonage; but, in general, none are admitted of mean de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or infamous immoral character.</p>

In this faſhionable good company alone, can you learn the beſt manners and the beſt language: for, as there is no legal ſtandard to form them by, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>It may poſſibly be queſtioned, whether a man has it always in his power to get into good company: undoubtedly, by deſerving it he has; provided he is in circumſtances which enable him to live and appear in the ſtyle of a gentleman. Knowledge, modeſty and good breeding, will endear him to all that ſee him; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out politeneſs, the ſcholar is no better than a pedant, the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher than a cynic, the ſoldier than a brute, nor any man than a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>own.</p>
               <p>Though the company of men of learning and genius is highly to be valued and occaſionally coveted, I would by no means have you always found in ſuch company. As they do not live in the world, they cannot have that eaſy manner of addreſs which I would wiſh you to acquire. If you can bear a part in ſuch company, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly adviſeable to be in it ſometimes, and you will be the more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed in other company by being ſo: but let it not engroſs you, leſt you ſhould be conſidered as one of the <hi>literati,</hi> which however reſpectable in name, is not the way to riſe or ſhine in the faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world.</p>
               <p>But the company which, of all others, you ſhould carefully avoid, is that, which, in every ſenſe of the word may be called <hi>

                     </gap>ow;</hi> low in birth, low in rank, low in parts, and low in manners; that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who, inſignificant and contemptible in themſelves, think is an honour to be ſeen with <hi>you,</hi> and who will flatter your follies, nay your very vices to keep you with them</p>
               <p>Though <hi>you</hi> may think ſuch a caution unneceſſary, <hi>I</hi> do not; for many a young gentleman of ſenſe and rank, has been led by his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to keep ſuch company, till he has been degraded, villified and undone.</p>
               <p>The vanity I mean, is that of being the firſt of the company. This pride, though too common, is idle to the laſt degree. Nothing in the world lets a man down ſo much. For the ſake of dictating, being applauded and admired by this low company, he is diſgraced and diſqualified for better. Depend upon it, in the eſtimation of mankind, you will ſink or riſe to the level of the company you keep.</p>
               <p>Be it, then, your ambition to get into the beſt company; and, when there, imitate their virtues, but not their vices. You have no doubt, often heard of genteel and faſhionable vices. Theſe are whoreing, drinking and gaming. It has happened that ſome men, even with theſe vices, have been admired and eſteemed. Underſtand this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rightly, it is not their vices for which they are admired; but for ſome accompliſhments they at the ſame time poſſeſs; for their parts, their learning or their good-breeding. Be aſſured, were they free from their vices, they would be much more eſteemed. In theſe mixed characters, the bad part is over-looked for the ſake of the good.</p>
               <p>Should you be unfortunate enough to have any vices of your own, add not to their number by adopting the vices of others. Vices of adoption are of all others the moſt unpardonable, for they have not

               <head>LAUGHTER.</head>
               <p>LET us now deſcend to minute matters, which though not ſo important as thoſe we have mentioned, are far from inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Of theſe, laughter is one.</p>
               <p>Frequent and loud laughter is a ſure ſign of a weak mind, and no leſs characteriſtic of a low education. It is the manner in which low-bred men expreſs their ſilly joy, at ſilly things, and they call it being merry.</p>
               <p>I do not recommend upon all occaſions a ſolemn countenance. A man may ſmile, but if he would be thought a gentleman and a man of ſenſe, he would by no means laugh. True wit never made a man of faſhion laugh; he is above it. It may create a ſmile, but a loud laughter ſhows, that a man has not the command of himſelf, every one who would wiſh to appear ſenſible muſt abhor it.</p>
               <p>A man's going to ſit down, on ſuppoſition that he has a chair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, and falling for want of one, occaſions a general laugh, when the beſt pieces of wit would not do it; a ſufficient proof, how low and unbecoming laughter is.</p>
               <p>Beſides, could the immediate laugher hear his own noiſe, or ſee the faces he makes, he would deſpiſe himſelf for his folly. Laughter being generally ſuppoſed to be the effect of gaiety, its abſurdity is not properly attended to; but a little reflexion will eaſily reſtrain it; and when you are told, it is a mark of low breeding, I perſuade myſelf you will endeavour to avoid it.</p>
               <p>Some people have a ſilly trick of laughing whenever they ſpeak; ſo that they are always on the grin, and their faces are ever diſtorted. This and a thouſand other tricks, ſuch as ſcratching their heads, twirling their hats, fumbling with their button, playing with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Being ſhame-faced in company, they try a variety of ways to keep themſelves in countenance; thus, they fall into theſe awkward habits I have mentioned, which grow upon them, and in time become habitual.</p>

               <head>SUNDRY LITTLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS.</head>
               <p>I HAVE had reaſons to obſerve before, that various little matters, apparently trifling in themſelves, conſpire to form the <hi>whole</hi> of pleaſing, as in a well finiſhed portrait, a variety of colours combine to complete the piece. It not being neceſſary to dwell much upon them, I ſhall content myſelf, with juſt mentioning them as they occur.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To do the honours of a table gracefully, is one of the outlines of a well-bred man; and to carve well, is an article, little as it may ſeem, that is uſeful twice every day, and the doing of which ill, is not only troubleſome to one's ſelf, but renders us diſagreeable and ridiculous to others. We are always in pain for a man, who inſtead of cutting up a fowl genteelly, is hacking for half an hour acroſs the the bone, greaſing himſelf, and beſpattering the company with the ſauce. Uſe, with a little attention, is all that is requiſite to acquit yourſelf in this particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To be well received, you muſt alſo pay ſome attention to your behaviour at table, where it is exceedingly rude to ſcratch any part of your body, to ſpit or blow your noſe, if you can poſſibly avoid it, to eat greedily, to lean your elbows on the table, to pick your teeth before the diſhes are removed, or to leave the table before grace is ſaid.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Drinking of healths is now growing out of faſhion, and is very unpolite in good company. Cuſtom once had made it univerſal, but the improved manners of the age now renders it vulgar. What can be more rude, or ridiculous than to interrupt perſons at their mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> with an unneceſſary compliment? Abſtain then from this ſilly cuſtom, where you find it out of uſe; and uſe it only at thoſe tables where it continues general.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A polite manner of refuſing to comply with the ſolicitations of a company, is alſo very neceſſary to be learnt; for, a young man, who ſeems to have no will of his own, but does every thing that is aſked of him, may be a very good-natured fellow, but he is a very ſilly one. If you are invited to drink at any man's houſe, more than you think is wholeſome, you may ſay, "you wiſh you could, but that ſo little makes you both drunk and ſick, that you ſhall only be bad company by doing it: of courſe, beg to be excuſed." If de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to play at cards deeper than you would, refuſe it ludicrouſly; tell them, <q>if you were ſure to loſe, you might poſſibly ſit down; but that as fortune may be favourable, you dread the thought of having too much money, ever ſince you found what an incumbrance it was to poor Harlequin, and therefore you are reſolved never to put yourſelf in the way of winning more than ſuch or ſuch a ſum a-day.</q> This light way of declining invitations to vice and folly, is more becoming a young man, than philoſophical or ſententious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſals, which would only be laughed at.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now I am on the ſubject of cards, I muſt not omit mentioning the neceſſity of playing them well and genteelly, if you would be thought to have kept company. I would by no means recommend play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at cards as a part of your ſtudy, leſt you would grow too fond of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:027039_0028_0FD2F9F872046D98"/>

                  </gap> and the conſequence prove bad. It were better not to know a diamond from a club, than to become a gambler; but, as cuſtom has introduced innocent card-playing at moſt friendly meetings, it marks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he gentleman to handle them genteelly, and play them well, and as I hope you will play only for ſmall ſums, ſhould you loſe your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, pray loſe it with temper; or if you win, receive your winnings without elation or greedineſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To write well and correct, and in a pleaſing ſtyle, is another part of polite education. Every man who has the uſe of his eyes and right hand, can write whatever hand he pleaſes. Nothing is ſo illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral as a ſchool-boy's ſcrawl. I would not have you learn a ſtiff formal hand-writing like that of a ſchool-maſter, but a genteel, legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and liberal hand, and to be able to write quick. As to the correctneſs and elegance of your writing, attention to grammar does the one, and to the beſt authors the other. Epiſtolary correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould not be carried on in a ſtudied or affected ſtyle, but the language ſhould flow from the pen, as naturally and as eaſily as it would from the mouth. In ſhort, a letter ſhould be penned in the ſame ſtyle, as you would talk to your friend if he were preſent.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If writing well ſhows the gentleman, much more ſo does ſpell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well. It is ſo eſſentially neceſſary for a gentleman, or a man of letters, that one falſe ſpelling may fix a ridicule on him for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his life. Words in books are generally well ſpelled, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the orthography of the age; reading therefore, with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, will teach every one to ſpell right. It ſometimes happens that words ſhall be ſpelled differently by different authors; but if you ſpell them upon the authority of one, in eſtimation of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, you will eſcape ridicule. Where there is but one way of ſpelling a word, by your ſpelling it wrong, you will be ſure to be laughed at. For a <hi>woman</hi> of a tolerable education would laugh at and deſpiſe her lover, if he wrote to her, and the words were ill-ſpelled. Be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly attentive then to your ſpelling.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There is nothing that a young man, at his firſt appearance in life, ought more to dread, than having any ridicule fixed on him. In the eſtimation even of the moſt rational men, it will leſſen him, but ruin him with all the reſt. Many a man has been undone by a ridiculous nick-name. The cauſes of nick-names among well-bred men, are generally the little defects in manner, air, or addreſs. To have the appellation of ill-bred, awkward, muttering, left-leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or any other, tacked always to your name, would injure you more than you are aware of; avoid then thoſe little defects, (and they are eaſily avoided) and you need never fear a nick-name.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Some young men are apt to think that they cannot be complete gentlemen, without becoming men of pleaſure: and the rake they often miſtake for the man of pleaſure. A rake is made up of the meaneſt and moſt diſgraceful vices. They all combine to degrade his character, and ruin his health and fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A man of pleaſure will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>efine upon the enjoyments of the age, attend them with decency and partake of them becomingly. Indeed he is too often leſs ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous than he ſhould be, and frequently has the cauſe to repent it. A man of pleaſure at beſt is but a diſſipated being, and what the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional part of mankind muſt abhor; I mention it however, leſt in taking up the man of pleaſure, you ſhould fall into the rake: for of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:027039_0029_0FD2F9FB874851A0"/>
two evils, always chooſe the leaſt. A diſſolute flagitious footman may make as good a rake as a man of the firſt quality. Few men can be men of pleaſure; every man may be a rake. There is a certain dignity that ſhould be preſerved in all our pleaſures; in love a man may loſe his heart without loſing his noſe; at table, a man may have a diſtinguiſhing palate without being a glutton; he may love wine without being a drunkard; he may game without being a gambler; and ſo on. Every virtue has its kindred vice, and every pleaſure its neighbouring diſgrace. Temperance and moderation, mark the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; but exceſs the black-guard. Attend carefully then to the line that divides them; and remember to ſtop rather a yard ſhort, than ſtep an inch beyond it. Weigh the preſent enjoyment of your pleaſures againſt the neceſſary conſequences of them, and I will leave you to your own determination.</p>
               <p n="10">10. A gentleman has ever ſome regard alſo to the <hi>choice</hi> of his amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If at cards, he will not be ſeen at cribbage, all-fours, or putt; or, in ſports of exerciſe, at ſkittles, foot-ball, leap-frog, cricket, driving of coaches, &amp;c. but will preſerve a propriety in every part of his conduct; knowing that any imitations of the manners of the mob, will unavoidably ſtamp him with vulgarity. There is another amuſement too, which I cannot help calling illiberal, that is, playing upon any muſical inſtrument. Muſic is commonly reckoned one of the liberal arts, and undoubtedly is ſo; but to be piping or fiddling at a concert is degrading to a man of faſhion. If you love muſic, hear it; pay fiddlers to play to you, but never fiddle yourſelf. It makes a gentleman appear frivolous and contemptible, leads him fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently into bad company, and waſtes that time which might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be well employed.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Secrecy is another characteriſtic of good breeding. Be careful never to tell in one company what you ſee or hear in another; much leſs to divert the preſent company at the expence of the laſt. Things apparently indifferent may, when often repeated and told abroad, have much more ſerious conſequences than imagined. In converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is generally a tacit reliance, that what is ſaid will not be repeated; and a man, though not enjoined to ſecrecy, will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded company if found to be a tatler; beſides, he will draw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a thouſand ſcrapes, and every one will be afraid to ſpeak before him.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Pulling out your watch in company unaſked, either at home or abroad, is a mark of ill-breeding; if at home, it appears as if you were tired of your company, and wiſhed them to be gone; if abroad, as if the hours dragged heavily, and you wiſhed to be gone yourſelf. If you want to know the time, withdraw; beſides, as the taking what is called a French leave was introduced, that on the perſon's leaving the company, the reſt might not be diſturbed; look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at your watch does what that piece of politeneſs was deſigned to prevent; it is a kind of dictating to all preſent, and telling them it is time, or almoſt time to break up.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Among other things let me caution you againſt ever being in a hurry: a man of ſenſe may be in haſte, but he is never in a hurry: convinced that hurry is the ſureſt way to make him do what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes ill. To be in a hurry is a proof that the buſineſs we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:027039_0030_0FD2F9FD16962290"/>
in is too great for us; of courſe, it is the mark of little minds, that are puzzled and perplexed, when they ſhould be cool and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate; they wiſh do every thing at once, and are thus able to do nothing. Be ſteady then, in all your engagements; look round you, before you begin; and remember that you had better do half of them well, and leave the reſt undone, than do the whole indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently.</p>
               <p n="14">14. From a kind of falſe modeſty, moſt young men are apt to conſider familiarity as unbecoming. Forwardneſs, I allow is ſo; but there is a decent familiarity that is neceſſary in the courſe of life. More formal viſits, upon formal invitations, are not the thing; they create no connexion, nor will they prove of ſervice to you; it is the careleſs and eaſy ingreſs and egreſs, at all hours, that ſecures an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance to our intereſt, and this is acquired by a reſpectful familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity entered into, without forfeiting your conſequence.</p>
               <p n="15">15. In acquiring new acquaintances, be careful not to neglect your old, for a flight of this kind is ſeldom forgiven. If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be with your former acquaintance ſo often as you uſed to be when you had no others, take care not to give them cauſe to think you neglect them: call upon them frequently though you cannot ſtay long with them; tell them, you are ſorry to leave them ſo ſoon, and nothing ſhould take you away but certain engagements which good-manners oblige you to attend to; for it will be your intereſt to make all the friends you can, and as few enemies as poſſible; by friends I would not be underſtood to mean confidential ones: but perſons who ſpeak of you reſpectfully, and who, conſiſtent with; their own intereſt, would wiſh to be of ſervice to you, and would rather do you good than harm.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Another thing I muſt recommend to you, as characteriſtic of a polite education, and of having kept good company, is a graceful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of confering favours. The moſt obliging things may be done ſo awkwardly as to offend, while the moſt diſagreeable things may be done ſo agreeable as to pleaſe.</p>
               <p n="17">17. A few more articles of general advice, and I have done; the firſt is on the ſubject of vanity. It is the common failing of youth and ſuch as ought to be carefully guarded againſt. The vanity I mean, is that which, if given way to, ſtamps a man a coxcomb, a character he will find a difficulty to get rid of, perhaps as long as he lives. Now this vanity ſhows itſelf in a variety of ſhapes; one man ſhall pride himſelf in taking the lead in all converſations, and peremptorily deciding upon every ſubject; another, deſirous of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ſucceſsful among the women, ſhall inſinuate the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he has met with, the conqueſts he makes, and perhaps boaſts of favours he never received; if he ſpeaks truth, he is ungenerous; if falſe, he is a villain, but whether true or falſe, defeats his own purpoſes, overthrows the reputation he wiſhes to erect, and draws upon himſelf contempt in the room of reſpect. Some men are vain enough to think they acquire conſequence by alliance, or by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with perſons of diſtinguiſhed character or abilities; hence they are continually telling of their grand-father lord ſuch-a-one; their kinſman Sir William ſuch-a-one; or their intimate friend Dr. ſuch-a-one; with whom perhaps they are ſcarce acquainted. If they are ever found out (and that they are ſure to be one time or other)
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027039_0031_0FD2FA020519ADE8"/>
they become ridiculous and contemptible: but even admitting what they ſay to be true, what then? A man's intrinſic merit does not riſe from an ennobled alliance, or a reputable acquaintance. A rich man never borrows. When angling for praiſe, modeſty is the ſureſt bait. If we would wiſh to ſhine in any particular character, we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver affect that character. An affectation of courage will make a man paſs for a bully; an affectation of wit for a coxcomb; and an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſenſe for a fool. Not that I would recommend baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or timidity; no, I would have every one know his own value, yet not diſcover that he knows it, but leave his merit to be found out by others.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Another thing worth your attention is, if in company with an inferior, not to let him feel his inferiority; if he diſcovers it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without your endeavour, the fault is not yours, and he will not blame you; but if you take pains to mortify him, or to make him feel himſelf inferior to you, in abilities, fortune, or rank, it is an inſult that will not readily be forgiven. In point of abilities it would be unjuſt, as they are out of his power; in point of rank or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, it is ill-natured and ill-bred. This rule is never more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary than at table, where there cannot be a greater inſult than to help an inferior to a part he diſlikes, or a part that may be worſe than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and to take the beſt to yourſelf. If you at any time invite an inferior to your table, you put him during the time he is there, upon an equality with you, and it is an act of the higheſt rudeneſs to treat him in any reſpect ſlightingly. I would rather double my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſuch a perſon, and treat him with additional reſpect, leſt he ſhould even ſuppoſe himſelf neglected. There cannot be a greater ſavageneſs or cruelty, or any thing more degrading to a man of faſhion, than to put upon or take unbecoming liberties with him, whoſe modeſty, humility, or reſpect will not ſuffer him to retaliate. True politeneſs conſiſts in making every body about you happy; and as to mortify, is to render unhappy, it can be nothing but the worſt of breeding. Make it a rule rather to flatter a perſon's vanity than otherwiſe; make him, if poſſible, more in love with himſelf, and you will be certain to gain his eſteem; never tell him any thing he may not like to hear, nor ſay things that will put him out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, but let it be your ſtudy on all occaſions to pleaſe; this will be making friends inſtead of enemies, and be a means of helping yourſelf in the end.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Never be witty at the expence of any one preſent, nor gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify that idle inclination, which is too ſtrong in moſt young men, I mean laughing at, or ridiculing the weakneſſes or infirmities of others, by way of diverting the company or diſplaying your own ſuperiority. Moſt people have their weakneſſes, their peculiar lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and averſions. Some cannot bear the ſight of a cat; others the ſmell of cheeſe, and ſo on; was you to laugh at thoſe men for their antipathies, or by deſign or inattention to bring them in their way, you could not inſult them more. You may poſſibly thus gain the laugh on your ſide, for the preſent, but it will make the perſon, perhaps, at whoſe expence you are merry, your enemy for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and even thoſe who laugh with you, will, on a little reflexion, fear you and probably deſpiſe you; whereas, to procure what <hi>one</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:027039_0032_0FD2FA0415E44368"/>
likes, and remove what the <hi>other</hi> hates, would ſhow them that they were the objects of your attention, and poſſibly make them more your friends than much greater ſervices would have done. If you have wit, uſe it to pleaſe, but not to hurt. You may ſhine, but take care not to ſcorch. In ſhort, never ſeem to ſee the faults of others. Though among the maſs of men, there are, doubtleſs, numbers of fools and knaves, yet were we to tell eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of theſe we meet with, that we know them to be ſo, we ſhould be in perpetual war. I would deteſt the knave and pity the fool, wherever I found him; but I would let neither of them know unneceſſarily that I did ſo; as I would not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious to make myſelf enemies. As one muſt pleaſe others, in order to be pleaſed one's ſelf; conſider what is agreeable to you, muſt be agreeable to them, and conduct yourſelf accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Whiſpering in company is another act of ill-breeding: it ſeems to inſinuate, either that the perſons whom we would not wiſh ſhould hear, are unworthy of our confidence, or it may lead them to ſuppoſe we are ſpeaking improperly of them: on both accounts therefore, abſtain from it.</p>
               <p n="21">21. So pulling out one letter after another, and reading them in company, or cutting and paring one's nails, is unpolite and rude. It ſeems to ſay, we are weary of the converſation, and are in want of ſome amuſement to paſs away the time.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Humming a tune to ourſelves, drumming with our fingers on the table, making a noiſe with our feet, and ſuch like, are all breaches of good manners, and indications of our contempt for the perſons preſent; therefore they ſhould not be indulged.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Walking faſt in the ſtreets is a mark of vulgarity imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurry of buſineſs: it may appear well in a mechanic of tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but it ſuits ill with the character of a gentleman or a man of faſhion.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Staring any perſon you meet, full in the face, is an act alſo of ill-breeding; it looks as if you ſaw ſomething wonderful in his appearance, and is therefore a tacit reprehenſion</p>
               <p n="25">25. Eating quick, or very ſlow at meals is characteriſtic of the vulgar; the firſt infers poverty, that you have not had a good meal for ſome time; the laſt, if abroad, that you diſlike your entertaiment; if at home, that your are rude enough to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your friends what you cannot eat yourſelf. So again, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſoup with your noſe in the plate is vulgar; it has the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of being uſed to hard work, and of courſe an unſteady hand. If it be neceſſary then to avoid this, it is much more ſo that of</p>
               <p n="26">26. Smelling to the meat while on the fork, before you put it in your mouth. I have ſeen many ill-bred fellows do this, and have been ſo angry, that I could have kicked them from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If you diſlike what you have upon your place, leave it; but on no account, by ſmelling to, or examining it, charge your friend with putting unwholeſome proviſions before you.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Spitting on the carpet is a naſty practice, and ſhocking,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027039_0033_0FD2FA06B2631410"/>
in a man of liberal education. Was this to become general, it would be us neceſſary to change the carpets as the table-cloths; beſides, it will lead our acquaintance to ſuppoſe, that we have not been uſed to genteel furniture; for this reaſon alone, if for no other, by all means avoid it.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Keep yourſelf likewiſe free from odd tricks or habits; ſuch as thruſting out your tongue continually, ſnapping your fingers, rubbing your hands, ſighing aloud, an affected ſhivering of your whole body, gaping with a noiſe like a country fellow that has been ſleeping in a hay-loft, or indeed with any noiſe, and many others, which I have noticed before; theſe are imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the manners of the mob, and are degrading to a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</p>
               <p>A very little attention will get the better of all theſe ill-bred habits, and be aſſured, you will find your own account in it.</p>

               <head>DIGNITY OF MANNERS.</head>
               <p>THERE is a certain dignity of manners, without which the very beſt characters would not be valued.</p>

                  </gap>ping, loud and frequent laughing, punning, joking, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mickry, waggery, and too great and indiſcriminate familiarity, will render any man contemptible, in ſpite of all his knowledge or his merit. Theſe may conſtitute a merry fellow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a merry fellow was never yet reſpectable. Indiſcriminate familiarity will either offend your ſuperiors, or make you paſs for their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant or toad-eater, and it will put your inferiors, on a degree of equality with you, that may be troubleſome.</p>
               <p>A joke, if it carries a ſting along with it, is no longer a joke, but an affront; and even if it has no ſting, unleſs its witticiſm is delicate and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> inſtead of giving pleaſure it will diſguſt; or if the company <hi>ſhould</hi> laugh, they will probably laugh at the jeſter rather than the jeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:027039_0035_0FD2FA0841590438"/>
Punning is mere playing upon words, and far from being a mark of ſenſe: thus were we to ſay, ſuch a dreſs is <hi>commodious,</hi> one of theſe wags would anſwer <hi>odious;</hi> or that whatever it has been, it is now be-<hi>com-odious.</hi> Others will give us an anſwer dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what we ſhould expect, without either wit or the leaſt beauty of thought; as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "<hi>Where's my lord?—" In his cloaths, unleſs he is in bed." "How does this wine taſte?—"A little moiſt, I think." "How is this to be eaten?</hi>—<hi>"With your mouth;</hi>" and ſo on, all which (you will readily apprehend) is low and vulgar. If your witticiſms are not inſtantly approved by the laugh of the company, for heaven's ſake, don't attempt to be witty for the future; for you may take it for granted, the defect is in yourſelf, and not in your hearers.</p>
               <p>As to a mimic or wag, he is little elſe than a buffoon, who will diſtort his mouth and his eyes to make people laugh. Be aſſured, no perſon ever demeaned himſelf to pleaſe the reſt, unleſs he wiſhed to be thought the Merry-Andrew of the company, and whether this character is reſpectable, I leave you to judge.</p>
               <p>If a man's company is coveted on any other account than his knowledge, his good ſenſe, or his manners, he is ſeldom reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe who invite him, but made uſe of only to entertain. "Let's have ſuch-a-one, for he ſings a good ſong, or he is always joking or laughing; or, "Let's ſend for ſuch-a-one, for he is a good-bottle companion;" theſe are degrading diſtinctions, that preclude reſpect and eſteem, whoever <hi>is had</hi> (as the phraſe is) for the ſake of any qualification, ſingly, is merely that thing he <hi>is had</hi> for, is never conſidered in any other light, and, of courſe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver properly reſpected, let his intrinſic merits be what they will.</p>
               <p>You may poſſibly ſuppoſe this dignity of manners to border upon pride; but it differs as much from pride, as true courage from bluſtering.</p>
               <p>To flatter a perſon right or wrong, is abject flattery; and to conſent readily to do every thing propoſed by a company, be it ſilly or criminal, is full as degrading as to diſpute warmly upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubject, and to contradict upon all actions. To preſerve dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we ſhould modeſtly aſſert our own ſentiments, though we politely acquieſce in thoſe of others.</p>
               <p>So again, to ſupport dignity of character, we ſhould neither be frivolouſly curious about trifles, nor be laboriouſly intent upon lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle objects that deſerve not a moment's attention; for this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies an incapacity in matters of greater importance.</p>
               <p>A great deal likewiſe depends upon our air, addreſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; an awkward addreſs and vulgar expreſſions infer either a low turn of mind, or a low education.</p>
               <p>Inſolent contempt or low envy is incompatible alſo with dignity of manners. Low-bred perſons fortunately lifted in the world, in fine cloaths and fine equipages, will inſolently look down on all thoſe who cannot afford to make as good an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and they openly envy thoſe who perhaps make a better. They alſo dread the being ſlighted; of courſe are ſuſpicious and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:027039_0036_0FD2FA0ADDEDFCC0"/>
captious; are uneaſy to themſelves, and make every body elſe ſo about them.</p>
               <p>A certain degree of outward ſeriouſneſs in looks and actions, gives dignity, while a conſtant ſmirk upon the face (that inſipid ſilly ſmile, which fools have when they would be civil) and whif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling motions are ſtrong marks of futility.</p>
               <p>But above all; a dignity of character is to be acquired beſt by a certain firmneſs in all our actions. A mean, timid and paſſive complaiſance lets a man down more than he is aware of: but ſtill his firmneſs or reſolution ſhould not extend to brutality, but be accompanied with a peculiar and engaging ſoftneſs or mildneſs.</p>
               <p>If you diſcover any haſtineſs in your temper, and find it apt to break out into rough and unguarded expreſſions, watch it narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and endeavour to curb it; but let no complaiſance, no weak deſire of pleaſing, no wheedling, urge you to do that which diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion forbids; but perſiſt and perſevere in all that is right. In your connexions and friendſhips, you will find this rule of uſe to you. Invite and preſerve attachments, by your firmneſs: but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to keep clear of enemies by a mildneſs of behaviour. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm thoſe enemies you may unfortunately have, (and few are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them) by a gentleneſs of manner, but make them feel the ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your reſentment; for there is a wide difference between bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing malice, and a determined ſelf-defence; the one is imperious, but the other is prudent and juſtifiable.</p>
               <p>In directing your ſervants, or any perſon you have a right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; if you deliver your orders mildly, and in that engaging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which every gentleman ſhould ſtudy to do, you will be cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and conſequently well obeyed: but if tyrannically, you would be very unwillingly ſerved, if ſerved at all. A cool ſteady determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ſhould ſhow that you <hi>will</hi> be obeyed; but a gentleneſs, in the manner of enforcing that obedience, ſhould make ſervice a cheerful one. Thus will you be loved without being deſpiſed, and feared without being hated.</p>
               <p>I hope I need not mention vices. A man who has been patiently kicked out of company, may have as good a pretence to courage, as one rendered infamous by his vices, may to dignity of any kind; however of ſuch conſequence are appearances, that an outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and an affected dignity of manners, will even keep ſuch a man the longer from ſinking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If therefore you ſhould unfortunately have no intrinſic merit of our own, keep up, if poſſible, the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it; and the world will poſſibly give you credit for the reſt. A verſatility of manners is as neceſſary in ſocial life, as a verſatility of parts in political. This is no way blameable, if not uſed with an ill-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. We muſt like the cameleon, often put on the hue of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we wiſh to be well with: and it ſurely can never be blameable, to endeavour to gain the good-will or affection of any one, if when obtained we do not mean to abuſe it.</p>

               <head>RULES FOR CONVERSATION.</head>
               <p>HAVING now given you full and ſufficient inſtructions for making you well received in the beſt of companies: nothing
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027039_0037_0FD2FA0B220E23C0"/>
remains but that I lay before you ſome few rules for your conduct in ſuch company. Many things on this ſubject I have mentioned before; but ſome few matters remain to be mentioned now.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Talk then frequently: but not long together, leſt you tire the perſons you are ſpeaking to; for few perſons talk ſo well upon a ſubject, as to keep up the attention of their hearers for any length of time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Avoid telling ſtories in company, unleſs they are very ſhort indeed, and very applicable to the ſubject you are upon; in this caſe relate them in as few words as poſſible, without the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and with ſome apology; as that you hate the telling of ſtories, but the ſhortneſs of it induced you. And, if your ſtory has any wit in it, be particularly careful not to laugh at it your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Nothing is more tireſome and diſagreeable than a long te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious narrative; it betrays a goſſiping diſpoſition and great want of imagination; and nothing is more ridiculous than to expreſs an approbation of your own ſtory by a laugh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In relating any thing, keep clear of repetitions, or very hackneyed expreſſions, ſuch as, <hi>ſays he,</hi> or <hi>ſays ſhe.</hi> Some people will uſe theſe ſo often, as to take off the hearer's attention from the ſtory: as in an organ out of tune, one pipe ſhall perhaps found the whole time we are playing, and confuſe the piece ſo as not to be underſtood.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Digreſſions likewiſe, ſhould be guarded againſt. A ſtory is always more agreeable without them. Of this kind are, "<hi>the gentleman I am telling you of is the ſon of Sir Thomas—, who lives in Harley-ſtreet;—you muſt know him—his brother had a horſe that won the ſweepſtakes at the laſt New-market meeting—Zounds! if you don't know him, you know nothing.</hi>" Or, "<hi>He was an upright tall old gentleman, who wore his own long hair: don't you recollect him?</hi>"—All this is unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; is very tireſome and provoking, and would be an excuſe for a man's behaviour, if he was to leave us in the midſt of our narrative.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some people have a trick of holding the perſon they are ſpeaking to by the button, or the hand, in order to be heard out; conſcious, I ſuppoſe, that their tale is tireſome. Pray never do this; if the perſon you ſpeak to is not as willing to hear your ſtory as you are to tell it, you had much better break off in the middle, for if you tire them once, they will be afraid to liſten to you a ſecond time.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Others have a way of punching the perſon they are talking to in the ſide, and, at the end of every ſentence, aſking him ſome ſuch queſtions as the following: "Waſn't I right in that?"—"You know I told you ſo?"—"What's your opinion," and the like; or perhaps they will be threading him, or jogging him with their elbow. For mercy's ſake, never give way to this: it will make your company dreaded.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Long talkers are frequently apt to ſingle out ſome unfortunate man preſent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> generally the moſt ſilent one of the company, or probably one who ſits next them. To this man, in a kind of half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiſper, will they run on for half an hour together. Nothing
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027039_0038_0FD2FA0CD4D1AE70"/>
can be more ill-bred. But if one of theſe unmerciful talkers ſhould attack you, if you wiſh to oblige him, I would recommend the hearing him with patience: ſeem to do ſo at leaſt, for you could not hurt him more than to leave him in the middle of his ſtory, or diſcover any impatience in the courſe of it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Inceſſant talkers are very diſagreeable companions. Nothing can be more rude than to engroſs the converſation to yourſelf, or to take the words, as it were, out of another man's mouth. Every man in company has an equal claim to bear his part in the converſation, and to deprive him of it, is not only unjuſt, but a tacit declaration, that he cannot ſpeak ſo well upon the ſubject as yourſelf. You will therefore take it up. And what can be more rude? I would as ſoon forgive a man that ſhould ſtop my mouth when I was gaping, as taking my words from me while I was ſpeaking them. Now, if this be unpardonable, it cannot be leſs ſo,</p>
               <p n="9">9. To help out or foreſtall the ſlow ſpeaker, as if you alone were rich in expreſſions, and he were poor. You may take it for granted, every one is vain enough to think he can talk well, tho' he may modeſtly deny it; helping a perſon out therefore in his expreſſion, is a correction that will ſtamp the corrector with imprudence and ill-manners.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Thoſe who contradict others upon all occaſions and make every aſſertion a matter of diſpute, betray by this behaviour an unacquaintance with good breeding. He therefore who wiſhes to appear amiable with thoſe he converſes with, will be cautious of ſuch expreſſions as theſe, "That can't be true, Sir," "The affair is as I ſay;" "That muſt be falſe, Sir;" "If what you ſay is true, &amp;c." You may as well tell a man he lies at once, as thus indirectly impeach his veracity. It is equally as rude to be proving every trifling aſſertion with a bet or a wager. "I'll bet you fifty of it, and ſo on." Make it then a conſtant rule in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of no great importance, complaiſantly to ſubmit your opinion to that of other; for a victory of this kind often coſts a man the loſs of a friend.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Giving advice unaſked is another piece of rudeneſs; it is, in effect, declaring ourſelves wiſer than thoſe to whom we give it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reproaching them with ignorance and inexperience. It is a freedom that ought not to be taken with any common acquaintance, and yet there are thoſe, who will be offended if their advice is not taken. "Such-a-one," ſay they, "is above being adviſed." "He ſcorns to liſten to my advice;" as if it were not a mark of greater arrogance to expect every one to ſubmit to their opinion, than for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p n="12">12. There is nothing ſo unpardonably rude, as a ſeeming inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the perſon who is ſpeaking to you; though you may meet with it in others, by all means avoid it yourſelf. Some ill-bred peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, while others are ſpeaking to them, will, inſtead of looking at, or attending to them, perhaps ſix their eyes on the cieling, or ſome picture in the room, look out at the window, play with a dog, their watch-chain, or their cane, or probably pick their nails or their noſes. Nothing betrays a more trifling mind than this; nor can any thing be a greater affront to the perſon ſpeaking; it being a tacit declaration,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:027039_0039_0FD2FA0E2B613598"/>
that what he is ſaying is not worth your attention. Conſider with yourſelf, how you would like ſuch treatment, and, I am perſuaded, you will never ſhow it to others.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Surlineſs or moroſeneſs is incompatible alſo with politeneſs. Such as ſhould any one ſay "he was deſired to preſent Mr. Such-a-one's reſpects to you," to reply, "What the devil have I do with his reſpects?"—"My Lord enquired after you lately, and aſked how you did," to anſwer, "if he wiſhes to know, let him come and feel my pulſe;" and the like. A good deal of this often is affected; but whether affected or natural, it is always offenſive. A man of this ſtamp will occaſionally be laughed at, as an oddity; but in the end will be deſpiſed.</p>
               <p n="14">14. I ſhould ſuppoſe it unneceſſary to adviſe you to adapt your converſation to the company your are in. You would not ſurely ſtart the ſame ſubject, and diſcourſe of it in the ſame manner, with the old and with the young, with an officer, a clergyman, a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher and a woman? No; your good ſenſe will undoubtedly teach you to be ſerious with the ſerious, gay with the gay, and to trifle with the triflers.</p>
               <p n="15">15. There are certain expreſſions which are exceedingly rude, and yet there are people of liberal education that ſometimes uſe them; as, "You don't underſtand me, Sir." "It is not ſo." "You miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take" "You know nothing of the matter, &amp;c." Is it not better to ſay, "I believe I do not expreſs myſelf ſo as to be underſtood." "Let us conſider it again; whether we take it right or not." It is much more polite and amiable to make ſome excuſe for another, and even in caſes where he might juſtly be blamed, and to repreſent the miſtake as common to both, rather than charge him with inſenſibility or incomprehenſion.</p>
               <p n="16">16. If any one ſhould have promiſed you any thing, and not have fulfilled that promiſe, it would be very unpolite to tell him he has forfeited his word; or if the ſame perſon ſhould have diſappointed you upon any occaſion, would it not be better to ſay, "You were probably ſo much engaged, that you forgot my affair," or, "perhaps it ſlipped your memory," rather than, "You thought no more about it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" or, "You pay very little regard to your word." For, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this kind leave a ſting behind them. They are a kind of provocation and affront, and very often bring on laſting quarrels.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Be careful not to appear dark and myſterious, leſt you ſhould be thought ſuſpicious, than which nothing can be a more unamiable character. If you appear myſterious and reſerved, others will be truly ſo with you; and in this caſe, there is an end to improvement, for you will gather no information. Be reſerved, but never ſeem ſo.</p>
               <p n="18">18. There is fault extremely common with ſome people, which I would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

When their opinion is aſked upon any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, they will give it with ſo apparent a diffidence and timidity, that one cannot, without the utmoſt pain, liſten to them; eſpecially if they are known to be men of univerſal knowledge. "Your Lordſhip will pardon me," ſays one of this ſtamp, "If I ſhould not be able to ſpeak to the caſe in hand, ſo well as it might be wiſhed"—"I'll venture to ſpeak of this matter, to the beſt of my poor abilities

and dulneſs of apprehenſion."—"I fear I ſhall expoſe myſelf, but in obedience to your lordſhip's commands"—and while they are making theſe apologies, they interrupt the buſineſs and tire the company.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Always look people in the face, when you ſpeak to them, otherwiſe you will be thought conſcious of ſome guilt; beſides you loſe the opportunity of reading their countenances, from which you will much better learn the impreſſion your diſcourſe makes upon them, than you can poſſibly do from their words; for words are at the will of every one, but the countenance is frequently involuntary.</p>
               <p n="20">20. If in ſpeaking to a perſon, you are not heard, and ſhould be deſired to repeat what you ſaid, do not raiſe your voice in the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, leſt you ſhould be thought angry on being obliged to repeat what you had ſaid before; it was probably owing to the hearer's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention.</p>
               <p n="21">21. One word only as to ſwearing. Thoſe who addict themſelves to it, and interlard their diſcourſe with oaths, can never be conſidered as gentlemen; they are generally people of low education, and are unwelcome in what is called good company. It is a vice that has no temptation to plead, but is, in every reſpect, as vulgar as it is wicked.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Never accuſtom yourſelf to ſcandal, nor liſten to it; for though it may gratify the malevolence of ſome people; nine times out of ten, it is attended with great diſadvantages. The very perſons you tell it to, will on reflexion, entertain a mean opinion of you, and it will often bring you into very diſagreeable ſituations. And as there would be no evil ſpeakers, if there were no evil hearers; it is in ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal as in robbery; the receiver is as bad as the thief. Beſides, it will lead people to ſhun your company, ſuppoſing that you will ſpeak ill of <hi>them</hi> to the next acquaintance you meet.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Mimickry, the favourite amuſement of little minds, has ever been the contempt of great ones. Never give way to it yourſelf, nor ever encourage it in others; it is the moſt illiberal of all buffoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery; it is an inſult on the perſon you mimic; and inſults, I have often told you, are ſeldom forgiven.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Carefully avoid talking either of your own or other people's domeſtic concerns. By doing the one, you will be thought vain; by entering into the other, you will be conſidered as officious. Talking of yourſelf is an impertinence to the company; your affairs are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them; beſides, they cannot be kept too ſecret. And as to the affairs of others, what are they to you? In talking of matters that no way concern you, you are liable to commit blunders, and ſhould you touch any one in a ſore part, you may poſſibly loſe his eſteem. Let your converſation then in mixed companies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> always be general.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Jokes, <hi>Bon-mots,</hi> or the little pleaſantries of one company, will not often beat to be told in another; they are frequently local, and take their riſe from certain circumſtances; a ſecond company may not be acquainted with theſe circumſtances, and of courſe your ſtory may be miſunderſtood, or want explaining; and if after you have prefaced it with "I will tell you a good thing," ſhould the ſling not be immediately perceived, you will appear exceedingly ridiculous, and wiſh you had not told it. Never then repeat in one company what you hear in another.</p>

26. In moſt debates, take up the favourable ſide of the queſtion; however, let me caution you againſt being clamorous; that is, never maintain an argument with heat, though you know yourſelf right; but offer your ſentiments, modeſtly and coolly, and if this does not prevail, give it up, and try to change the ſubject by ſaying ſomething to this effect; <q>I find we ſhall hardly convince one another, neither is there any neceſſity to attempt it; ſo let us talk of ſomething elſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27. Not that I would have you give up your opinion always; no, aſſert your own ſentiments, and oppoſe thoſe of others when wrong, but let your manner and voice be gentle and engaging, and yet no ways affected. If you contradict, do it with <hi>I may be wrong, but—I won't be poſitive, but I really think—I ſhould rather ſuppoſe—If I may be permitted to ſay</hi>—and cloſe your diſpute with good humour, to ſhow that you are neither diſpleaſed yourſelf, nor meant to diſpleaſe the perſon you diſpute with.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Acquaint yourſelf with the character and ſituations of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany you go into, before you give a looſe to your tongue; for ſhould you enlarge on ſome virtue, which any one preſent may notoriouſly want; or ſhould you condemn ſome vice, which any of the company may be particularly addicted to, they will be apt to think your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions pointed and perſonal, and you will be ſure to give offence. This conſideration will naturally lead you, not to ſuppoſe things ſaid in general, to be levelled at you.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Low-bred people, when they happen occaſionally to be in good company, imagine themſelves to be the ſubject of every ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate converſation. If any part of the company whiſpers, it is about them; if they laugh, it is at them; and if any thing is ſaid which they do not comprehend, they immediately ſuppoſe it is meant of them. This miſtake is admirably ridiculed in one of our celebrated comedies. "<hi>I am ſure,</hi> ſays Scrub, <hi>they were talking of me, for they laughed conſumedly.</hi>" Now a well-bred perſon never thinks himſelf diſeſteemed by the company, or laughed at, unleſs their reflexions are ſo groſs, that he cannot be ſuppoſed to miſtake them, and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour obliges him to reſent it in a proper manner; however, be aſſured, gentlemen never laugh at or ridicule one another, unleſs they are in joke, or on a footing of the greateſt intimacy. If ſuch a thing ſhould happen once in an age, from ſome pert coxcomb, or ſome ſlippant woman, it is beſt not to ſeem to know it, than to make the leaſt reply.</p>
               <p n="30">30. It is a piece of politeneſs not to interrupt a perſon in a ſtory, whether you have heard it before or not. Nay, if a well-bred man is aſked, whether he has heard it, he will anſwer no, and let the perſon go on, though he knows it already. Some are fond of telling a ſtory, becauſe they think they tell it well, others pride themſelves in being the firſt teller of it, and others are pleaſed at being thought entruſted with it. Now, all theſe perſons you would diſappoint, by anſwering yes. And, as I have told you before, as the greateſt proof of politeneſs is to make every body happy about you, I would never deprive a perſon of any ſecret ſatisfaction of this ſort, when I could gratify him by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p n="31">31. Be not aſhamed of aſking queſtions, if ſuch queſtions lead to information; always accompany them with ſome excuſe, and you never will be reckoned impertinent. But, abrupt queſtions, without
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:027039_0042_0FD2FA15430B01C8"/>
ſome apology, by all means avoid, as they imply deſign. There is a way of fiſhing for facts, which, if done judiciouſly, will anſwer every purpoſe, ſuch as taking things you wiſh to know for granted; this will perhaps lead ſome officious perſon to ſet you right. So again, by ſaying, you have heard ſo and ſo, and ſometimes ſeeming to know more than you do, you will often get an information which you would loſe by direct queſtions, as theſe would put people on their guard and frequently defeat the very end you aim at.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Make it a rule never to reflect on anybody of people, for by this means you will create a number of enemies. There are good and bad of all profeſſions, lawyers, ſoldiers, parſons, or citizens. They are all men, ſubject to the ſame paſſions, differing only in their manner, according to the way they have been bred up in. For this reaſon, it is unjuſt as well as indiſcreet, to attack them as a <hi>corps</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively Many a young man has thought himſelf extremely clever in abuſing the clergy. What are the clergy more than other men? Can you ſuppoſe a black gown can make any alteration in his nature? Fie, fie; think ſeriouſly, and I am convinced you will never do it.</p>
               <p n="33">33. But above all, let no example, no faſhion, no witticiſm, no fooliſh deſire of riſing above what knaves call prejudices, tempt you to excuſe, extenuate or ridicule the leaſt breach of morality, but upon every occaſion, ſhow the greateſt abhorrence of ſuch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and hold virtue and religion in the higheſt veneration.</p>
               <p n="34">34. It is a great piece of ill-manners to interrupt any one while ſpeaking, by ſpeaking yourſelf, or calling off the attention of the company to any foreign matter. But this every child knows.</p>
               <p n="35">35. The laſt thing I ſhall mention is that of concealing your learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, except on particular occaſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reſerve this for learned men, and let them rather extort it from you, than you be too willing to diſplay it. Hence you will be thought modeſt, and to have more knowledge than you really have. Never ſeem wiſe, or more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than the company you are in. He who affects to ſhow his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will be frequently queſtioned: and if found ſuperficial, will be ſneered at; if otherwiſe, he will be deemed a pedant. Real merit will always ſhow itſelf, and nothing can leſſen it in the opinion of the world, but a man's exhibiting it himſelf.</p>
               <p>For God's ſake, revolve all theſe things ſeriouſly in your mind, before you go abroad into life. Recollect the obſervations you have yourſelf occaſionally made upon men and things, compare them with my inſtructions, and act wiſely and conſequentially as they ſhall teach you.</p>

                  <p>Idleneſs is the parent of want, and of pain; but the labour of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue bringeth forth pleaſure.</p>

                  <p>His body is diſeaſed for want of exerciſe: He wiſheth for action, but hath not power to move: his mind is in darkneſs; his thoughts are confuſed; he longeth for knowledge, but hath no application.</p>
                  <p>He would eat of the almond, but hateth the trouble of breaking its ſhell.</p>
                  <p>His houſe is in diſorder, his ſervants are waſteful and riotous, and he runneth on towards ruin: He ſeeth it with his eyes; he heareth it with his ears; he ſhaketh his head, and wiſheth, but hath no reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; till ruin cometh upon him like a whirlwind, and ſhame and repentance deſcend with him to the grave.</p>

                  <p>PERILS, and misfortunes, and want, and pain, and injury, are more or leſs the certain lot of every man that cometh into the world.</p>
                  <p>It behoveth thee, therefore, O child of calamity! early to fortify thy mind with courage and patience, that thou mayeſt ſupport, with a becoming reſolution, thy allotted portion of human evil.</p>

                  <p>A noble ſpirit diſdaineth the malice of fortune; his greatneſs of ſoul is not to be caſt down.</p>
                  <p>He hath not ſuffered his happineſs to depend upon her ſmiles, and therefore with her frowns he ſhall not be diſmayed.</p>
                  <p>As a rock on the ſea-ſhore he ſtandeth firm, and the daſhing of the waves diſturbeth him not.</p>
                  <p>He raiſeth his head like a tower on a hill, and the arrows of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune drop at his feet</p>
                  <p>In the inſtant of danger, the courage of his heart ſuſtaineth him; and the ſteadineſs of his mind beareth him out.</p>
                  <p>He meeteth the evils of life as a man that goeth forth unto battle, and returneth with victory in his hand.</p>
                  <p>Under the preſſure of misfortunes, his calmneſs alleviates their weight; and, by his conſtancy, he ſhall ſurmount them.</p>

                  <p>By ſhrinking under poverty, he ſtoopeth down to meanneſs; and by tamely bearing inſults, he inviteth injuries.</p>

Murmur not therefore at the diſpenſations of God, but correct thine own heart: neither ſay within thyſelf, if I had wealth, or power, or leiſure, I ſhould be happy; for know they all bring to their ſeveral poſſeſſors their peculiar inconveniencies.</p>
                  <p>The poor man ſeeth not the vexations and anxieties of the rich, he feeleth not the difficulties and perplexities of power, neither knoweth he the weariſomeneſs of leiſure; and therefore it is that he repineth at his own lot.</p>

                  <p>To be ſatisfied with a little, is the greateſt wiſdom; and he who encreaſeth his riches, encreaſeth his cares: but a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mind is a hidden treaſure, and trouble findeth it not.</p>
                  <p>Yet if thou ſuffereſt not the allurements of fortune to rob thee of juſtice, or temperance, or charity, or modeſty, even riches themſelves ſhall not make thee unhappy.</p>
                  <p>But hence ſhalt thou learn, that the cup of felicity, pure and unmixed, is by no means a draught for mortal man.</p>

                  <p>Indulge not thyſelf in the paſſion of anger; it is whetting a ſword, to wound thine own breaſt, or murder thy friend.</p>
                  <p>If thou beareſt ſlight provocations with patience, it ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto thee for wiſdom; and if thou wipeſt them from thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, thy heart ſhall feel reſt, and thy mind ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach thee.</p>

                  <p>Be always more ready to forgive, than to return an injury: He that watches for an opportunity of revenge, lieth in wait againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and draweth down miſchief on his own head.</p>
                  <p>A mild anſwer to an angry man, like water caſt upon the fire, abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his heat, and from an enemy he ſhall become thy friend.</p>

                  <p>THE gifts of the underſtanding are the treaſures of God; and he appointeth to every one his portion, in what meaſure ſeemeth good unto himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Hath he endued thee with wiſdom? Hath he enlightened thy mind with the knowledge of truth? Communicate it to the ignorant, for their inſtruction; communicate it to the wiſe, for thine own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
                  <p>True wiſdom is leſs preſuming than folly. The wiſe man doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth often, and changeth his mind: The fool is obſtinate, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not; he knoweth all things, but his own ignorance.</p>

The pride of emptineſs is an abomination; and to talk much, is the fooliſhneſs of folly: Nevertheleſs, it is the part of wiſdom, to bear the impertinence of fools, to hear their abſurdities with patience, and pity their weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>Yet be not puffed up in thine own conceit, neither boaſt of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior underſtanding; the cleareſt human knowledge is but blindneſs and folly.</p>
                  <p>The wiſe man feeleth his imperfections, and is humbled; he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth in vain for his own approbation. But the fool peepeth in the ſhallow ſtream of his own mind, and is pleaſed with the pebbles which he ſeeth at the bottom: He bringeth them up, and ſheweth them as pearls; and with the applauſe of his brethren, delighteth he himſelf.</p>
                  <p>He boaſteth of attainments in things that are of no worth; but where it is a ſhame to be ignorant, there he hath no underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Even in the paths of wiſdom, he toileth after folly; and ſhame and diſappointment are the reward of his labour.</p>
                  <p>But the wiſe man cultivates his mind with knowledge: the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of arts is his delight, and their utility to the public crowneth him with honour.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the attainment of virtue he accounteth as the higheſt learning; and the ſcience of happineſs is the ſtudy of his life.</p>

                  <p>He carrieth on great works, his country is enriched, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer is employed: he formeth new ſchemes, and the arts receive improvement.</p>
                  <p>He conſidereth the ſuperfluities of his table as belonging to the poor of his neighbourhood, and he defraudeth them not.</p>
                  <p>The benevolence of his mind is not checked by his fortune; he rejoiceth therefore in riches, and his joy is blameleſs.</p>
                  <p>But woe unto him that heapeth up wealth in abundance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth alone in the poſſeſſion thereof;</p>

                  <p>The tears of the orphan he drinketh as milk, the cries of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow are muſic to his ear.</p>

His heart is hardened with the love of wealth; no grief nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs can make impreſſion upon it.</p>
                  <p>But the curſe of iniquity purſueth him: He liveth in continual fear; the anxiety of his mind, and the rapacious deſires of his own ſoul, take vengeance upon him, for the calamities he hath brought upon others.</p>
                  <p>O! what are the miſeries of poverty, in compariſon with the gnawings of this man's heart?</p>
                  <p>Let the poor man comfort himſelf, yea, rejoice; for he hath many reaſons.</p>
                  <p>He ſitteth down to his morſel in peace; his table is not crowded with flatterers and devourers.</p>
                  <p>He is not embarraſſed with a train of dependants, nor teaſed with the clamours of ſolicitation.</p>
                  <p>Debarred from the dainties of the rich, he eſcapeth alſo their diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>The bread he eateth, is it not ſweet to his taſte? the water he drinketh, is it not pleaſant to his thirſt? yea, far more delicious than the richeſt draughts of the luxurious.</p>
                  <p>His labour preſerveth his health, and produceth him a repoſe, to which the downy bed of ſloth is a ſtranger.</p>
                  <p>He limiteth his deſires with humility; and the calm of contentment is ſweeter to his ſoul, than the acquirements of wealth and grandeur.</p>
                  <p>Let not the rich therefore preſume on his riches, nor the poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond in his poverty; for the providence of God diſpenſeth happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them both, and the diſtribution thereof is more equally made than the fool can believe.</p>

                  <p>She is immortal; ſhe is unchangeable; ſhe is alike in all. Health called her forth to ſhow her lovelineſs, and application annointeth her with the oil of wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>Although ſhe ſhall live after thee, think not ſhe was born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee. She was concreted with thy fleſh, and formed with thy brain.</p>
                  <p>Juſtice could not give her to thee exalted by virtues, nor mercy deliver her to thee deformed by vices. Theſe muſt be thine, and thou muſt anſwer them.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe not death can ſhield thee from examination; think not corruption can hide thee from enquiry. He who formed thee of thou knoweſt not what, can he not raiſe thee from thou knoweſt not what again?</p>

Yet when theſe die, their ſpirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to the duſt: thine alone ſurviveth.</p>
                  <p>Envy not theſe of their ſenſes, becauſe quicker than thine own. Learn that the advantage lieth not in poſſeſſing good things, but in knowing to uſe them.</p>
                  <p>Hadſt thou the ear of the ſlag, or were thine eye as ſtrong and piercing as the eagle's; didſt thou equal the hound in ſmell, or could the ape reſign to thee his taſte, or the tortoiſe her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet, without reaſon, what would they avail thee? Periſh not all theſe like their kindred?</p>
                  <p>Hath any one of them the gift of ſpeech? Can any ſay unto thee, Therefore did I ſo?</p>
                  <p>The lips of the wiſe are as the doors of a cabinet: no ſooner are they opened, but treaſures are poured but before thee.</p>

                  <p>Learn to eſteem life as it ought; then art thou near the pinnacle of wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>Think not with the fool, that nothing is more valuable; nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with the pretended wiſe, that thou oughteſt to contemn it. Love it not for itſelf, but for the good it may be of to others.</p>

                  <p>Say not, that it were beſt not to have been born; or, if born, that it had been beſt to die early: Neither dare thou to aſk of thy Creator, where had been the evil, had I not exiſted? Good is in thy power;
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:027039_0069_0FD2FA5A902E0378"/>
the want of good is evil; and, if thy queſtion be juſt, lo! it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth thee.</p>
                  <p>Would the fiſh ſwallow the bait, if he knew the hook was hid therein? would the lion enter the toils, if he knew they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him? So neither, were the ſoul to periſh with this clay, would man wiſh to live; neither would a merciful God have created him: Know hence thou ſhalt live afterward.</p>
                  <p>As the bird incloſed in the cage before he ſeeth it, yet teareth not his fleſh againſt its ſides; ſo neither labour thou vainly to run from the ſtate thou art in; but know it is allotted thee, and be content with it.</p>
                  <p>Though its ways are uneven, yet are they not all painful? Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate thyſelf to all; and where there is leaſt appearance of evil, ſuſpect the greateſt danger.</p>
                  <p>When thy bed is ſtraw, thou ſleepeſt in ſecurity; but when thou haſt ſtretched thyſelf on roſes, beware of the thorns.</p>
                  <p>A good death is better than an evil life: Strive to live, therefore, as long as thou oughteſt, not as long as thou canſt.</p>
                  <p>While thy life is to others worth more than thy death, it is thy duty to preſerve it.</p>
                  <p>Complain not, with the fool, of the ſhortneſs of thy time: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that with thy days, thy cares are ſhortened.</p>
                  <p>Take from the period of thy life the uſeleſs parts of it, and what remaineth? Take off the time of thine infancy, the ſecond infancy of age, thy ſleep, thy thoughtleſs hours, thy days of ſickneſs; and, even at the fulneſs of years, how few ſeaſons haſt thou truly num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered?</p>
                  <p>He who gave thee life as a bleſſing, ſhortened it to make it more ſo. To what end would longer life have ſerved thee? Wiſheſt thou to have had an opportunity of more vices? As to the good, will not he who limited thy ſpan, be ſatisfied with the fruits of it?</p>
                  <p>To what end, O child of ſorrow! wouldſt thou live longer? To breathe, to eat, to ſee the world? All this thou haſt done often al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Too frequent repetition, is it not tireſome? or is it not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous?</p>

Are theſe to be compared with thee in the abuſe of life? are they riotous? are they cruel? are they ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? Learn from them rather, that innocence of life and ſimplicity of manners, are the paths to a good old age.</p>

                  <p>The wiſe continueth to live from his firſt period; the fool is always beginning.</p>
                  <p>Labour not after riches firſt, and think thou afterwards wilt enjoy them. He who neglecteth the preſent moment, throweth away all that he hath. As the arrow paſſeth through the heart, while the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior knew not that it was coming; ſo ſhall his life be taken away, before he knoweth that he hath it.</p>
                  <p>What then is life, that men ſhould deſire it? what breathing, that he ſhould covet it?</p>
                  <p>Is it not a ſcene of deluſion, a ſeries of miſadventure, a purſuit of evils linked on all ſides together? In the beginning it is ignorance, pain is in its middle, and its end is ſorrow. As one wave puſheth on another, till both are involved in that behind them, even ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth evil to evil in the life of man; the greater and the preſent ſwallow up the leſſer and the paſt. Our terrors are real evils; our expectations look forward into improbabilities.</p>

                  <p>What part of life is it that we would wiſh to remain with us? Is it youth? Can we be in love with outrage, licentiouſneſs and teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Is it age? then are we fond of infirmities.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid, grey hairs are revered, and in length of days is honour. Virtue can add reverence to the bloom of youth; and without it, age plants more wrinkles in the ſoul than on the forehead.</p>
                  <p>Is age reſpected becauſe it hateth riot? What juſtice is in this, when it is not age deſpiſeth pleaſure, but pleaſure that deſpiſeth age?</p>

                  <p>VAIN and inconſtant as thou art, O child of imperfection! How canſt thou but be weak? Is not inconſtancy connected with frailty? Can there be vanity without infirmity? Avoid the danger of the one, and thou ſhalt eſcape the miſchiefs of the other.</p>
                  <p>Wherein art thou moſt weak? In that wherein thou ſeemeſt moſt ſtrong; in that wherein moſt thou glorieſt; even in poſſeſſing the things which thou haſt; in uſing the good that is about thee.</p>
                  <p>Are not thy deſires alſo frail? or knoweſt thou even what it is thou wouldeſt wiſh? When thou haſt obtained what moſt thou ſoughteſt after, behold it contenteth thee not.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore loſeth the pleaſure that is before thee, its reliſh? and why appeareth that which is yet to come, the ſweeter? Becauſe thou art wearied with the good of this, becauſe thou knoweſt not the evil of that which is not with thee. Know, that to be content, is to be happy.</p>
                  <p>Couldſt thou chuſe for thyſelf, would thy Creator lay before thee all that thine heart could aſk for? Would happineſs then remain with thee? Or would joy dwell always in thy gates?</p>
                  <p>Alas! thy weakneſs forbiddeth it; thy infirmity declareth againſt it. Variety is to thee in the place of pleaſure; but that which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manently delighteth, muſt be permanent.</p>
                  <p>When it is gone, thou repenteſt the loſs of it; though, while it was with thee, thou deſpiſedſt it.</p>

That which ſucceedeth it, hath no more pleaſure for thee; and thou afterwards quarreleſt with thyſelf for preferring it: Behold the only circumſtance in which thou erreſt not!</p>
                  <p>Is there any thing in which thy weakneſs appeareth more than in deſiring things? It is in the poſſeſſing, and in the uſing them.</p>
                  <p>Good things ceaſe to be good in our enjoyment of them. What nature meant pure ſweets, are ſources of bitterneſs to us; from our delights ariſe pain, from our joys, ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Be moderate in the enjoyment, and it ſhall remain in thy poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: let thy joys be founded on reaſon, and to its end ſhall ſorrow be a ſtranger.</p>
                  <p>The delights of love are uſhered in by ſighs, and they terminate in languiſhment and dejection. The object thou burnedſt for, nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeates with ſatiety, and no ſooner hadſt thou poſſeſt it, but thou wert weary of its preſence.</p>
                  <p>Join eſteem to thy admiration, unite friendſhip with thy love; ſo ſhalt thou find, in the end, content ſo abſolute, that it ſurpaſſeth rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, tranquillity more worth than ecſtaſy.</p>
                  <p>God hath given thee no good without its admixture of evil; but he hath given thee alſo the means of throwing off the evil from it.</p>
                  <p>As joy is not without its allay of pain, ſo neither is ſorrow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its portion of pleaſure. Joy and grief, though unlike, are united. Our own choice only can give them to us entire.</p>
                  <p>Melancholy itſelf often giveth delight, and the extremity of joy is mingled with tears.</p>
                  <p>The beſt things in the hands of a fool may be turned to his deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and out of the worſt the wiſe will find the means of good.</p>
                  <p>So blended is weakneſs in thy nature, O man! that thou haſt not ſtrength either to be good, or to be evil entirely. Rejoice that thou canſt not excel in evil, and let the good that is within thy reach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thee.</p>
                  <p>The virtues are allotted to various ſtations. Seek not after impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities, nor grieve that thou canſt not poſſeſs them all.</p>
                  <p>Wouldſt thou at once have the liberality of the rich, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of the poor? or ſhould the wife of thy boſom be deſpiſed, becauſe ſhe ſheweth not the virtues of the widow?</p>
                  <p>If thy father ſink before thee in the diviſions of thy country, can at once thy juſtice deſtroy him, and thy duty ſave his life?</p>
                  <p>If thou behold thy brother in the agonies of a ſlow death, is it not mercy to put a period to his life? and is it not alſo he who takes away his life his murderer?</p>
                  <p>Truth is but one; thy doubts are of thine own raiſing. He who made virtues what they are, planted alſo in thee a knowledge of their pre-eminence. Act as thy ſoul dictates to thee, and the end ſhall be always right.</p>

                  <p>When thy people are numerous, when thy ſons encreaſe about thy table, ſendeſt thou them not out to ſlay the innocent, and to fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſword of him whom they have not offended?</p>
                  <p>If the object of thy deſires demandeth the lives of a thouſand, ſayeſt thou not, I will have it? Surely thou forgetteſt, that he who created thee, created alſo theſe; and that their blood is as rich as thine.</p>
                  <p>Sayeſt thou, that juſtice cannot be executed without wrong? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thine own words condemn thee.</p>
                  <p>Thou who flattereſt with falſe hopes the criminal, that he may confeſs his guilt, art not thou unto him a criminal? or is thy guilt the leſs, becauſe he cannot puniſh it?</p>

                  <p>That thou mayeſt not kill him without cauſe, thou doſt worſe than kill him: That thou mayeſt prove if he be guilty, thou deſtroyeſt him innocent.</p>

                  <p>Wiſh rather to be reproved by the wiſe, than to be applauded by him who hath no underſtanding: when they tell thee of a fault, they ſuppoſe thou canſt improve; the other, when he praiſeth thee, thinketh thee like unto himſelf.</p>

                  <p>Lay not too great obligations on him thou wiſheth thy friend: behold! the ſenſe of them will drive him from thee: a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit allenateth friendſhip, a great one maketh an enemy.</p>

                  <p>PRIDE and meanneſs ſeem incompatible, but man reconcileth contrarieties; he is at once the moſt amiable and the moſt arrogant of all creatures.</p>
                  <p>Preſumption is the bane of reaſon; it is the nurſe of error; yet it is congenial with reaſon in us.</p>
                  <p>Who is there that judgeth not either too highly of himſelf, or thinketh not too meanly of others?</p>

Our Creator himſelf eſcapeth not our preſumption: how then ſhall we be ſafe from one another?</p>
                  <p>What is the origin of ſuperſtition? and whence ariſeth falſe worſhip? From our preſuming to reaſon about what is above our reach, to comprehend what is incomprehenſible.</p>
                  <p>Limited and weak as our underſtandings are, we employ not even their little forces as we ought; we ſoar not high enough in our approaches to God's greatneſs; we give not wing enough to our ideas, when we enter into the adoration of divinity.</p>
                  <p>Man, who fears to breathe a whiſper againſt his earthly ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, trembles not to arraign the diſpenſations of his God; he forgetteth his majeſty, and rejudgeth his judgments.</p>
                  <p>He who dareth not repeat the name of his prince without honour, yet bluſheth not to call that of his Creator to be witneſs to a lye.</p>

                  <p>As the fool, while the images tremble on the boſom of the water, thinketh, the trees, towns, and the wide horizon, are dancing to do him pleaſure: ſo man, while nature performs her deſtined courſe, believes, that all her notions are but to entertain his eye.</p>

                  <p>THE root of revenge, is in the weakneſs of the ſoul: the moſt abject and timorous, are the moſt addicted to it.</p>
                  <p>Who torture thoſe they hate, but cowards? who murder thoſe they rob, but the baſe and timid?</p>
                  <p>The feeling an injury, muſt be previous to the revenging it: but the noble mind diſdaineth to ſay it hurts me.</p>
                  <p>If the injury is not below thy notice, he that doth it unto thee, in that maketh himſelf ſo: wouldſt thou enter the lifts with thine inferior?</p>
                  <p>Requite with kindneſs the man who attempteth to wrong thee: do good to him who would give thee diſquiet.</p>
                  <p>In this thou not only preſerveſt thine own peace, but thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteſt puniſhment, without ſtooping to employ revenge againſt him.</p>
                  <p>As the tempeſt and the thunder affect not the ſun or the ſtars, but ſpend their fury on ſtones and trees below; ſo injuries aſcend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> to the ſouls of the great, but waſte themſelves on ſuch as thoſe are who offer them.</p>
                  <p>Poorneſs of ſpirit will actuate revenge; greatneſs of ſoul deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the offence: nay, it doth good unto him who intended to have diſturbed it.</p>
                  <p>Why ſeekeſt thou vengeance, O man! with what purpoſe is it that thou purſueſt it? Thinkeſt thou to pain thine adverſary by it? Know, that thyſelf feeleſt its greateſt torment.</p>
                  <p>Revenge knaweth the heart of him who is infected with it; while he againſt whom it is intended, remaineth eaſy.</p>
                  <p>It is unjuſt in the anguiſh it inflicts; therefore nature intended it not for thee: needeth he who is injured, more pain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ought he to add force to the affliction which another hath caſt upon him?</p>
                  <p>The man who meditateth revenge, is not content with the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief he hath received, he addeth to his anguiſh the puniſhment due unto another: while he whom he ſeeketh to hurt, goeth his

way laughing; he maketh himſelf merry at this addition to his miſery.</p>
                  <p>Revenge is painful in the intent, and it is dangerous in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſeldom doth the axe fall, where he who lifteth it up intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and lo! he remembereth not that it muſt recoil againſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>While the revengeful ſeeketh his enemy's hurt, be oftentimes procureth his own deſtruction; while he aimeth at one of the eyes of his adverſary, lo! he putteth out both his own.</p>
                  <p>If he attain not his end, he lamenteth it; if he ſucceed, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth of it; the fear of juſtice taketh away the peace of his own ſoul; the care to hide him from it, deſtroyeth that of his friend.</p>
                  <p>Can the death of thine adverſary ſatiate thy hatred? Can the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him at reſt reſtore thy peace?</p>
                  <p>Wouldſt thou make him ſorry for the offence, conquer him, by ſparing him; In death he owneth not thy ſuperiority; nor feeleth he any more the power of thy wrath.</p>
                  <p>In revenge, there ſhould be a triumph of the avenger; and he who hath injured him, ſhould feel his diſpleaſure; he ſhould ſuffer pain from it, and ſhould repent him of the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>This is the revenge inſpired from anger; but that which makes thee greater, is to repay injuries with kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>Murder for injury, ariſeth only from cowardice: He who inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſcareth that the enemy may live, and avenge himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Death endeth the quarrel; but it reſtoreth not the reputation: Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is an act of caution, not of courage; it is ſafe, but it is not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing ſo eaſy as to revenge an offence, but nothing is ſo honourable as to pardon it.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt victory man can obtain, is over himſelf: He that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth to feel an injury, retorteth it upon him who offereth it.</p>
                  <p>When thou meditateſt revenge, thou confeſſeſt that thou feeleſt the wrong; when thou complaineſt, thou acknowledgeſt thyſelf hurt by it: Meaneſt thou to add this triumph to the pride of thine enemy?</p>
                  <p>That cannot be an injury which is not felt: how then can he who deſpiſeth it revenge it?</p>
                  <p>If thou think it diſhonourable to bear an offence, more is in thy power; thou mayeſt conquer it.</p>
                  <p>Good offices will make a man aſhamed to be thine enemy; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſoul will terrify him from the thought of hurting thee.</p>
                  <p>The greater the wrong, the more glory is in pardoning it: and by how much the more juſtifiable would be revenge, by ſo much the more honour is in clemency.</p>
                  <p>Haſt thou a right to be a judge in thine own cauſe; to be a party in the act, and yet to pronounce ſentence on it? Before thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneſt, let another ſay it is juſt.</p>
                  <p>The revengeful is feared, and therefore he is hated; but he that is endued with clemency, is adored: The praiſe of his actions remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for ever; and the love of the world attendeth him.</p>

                  <hi>Our Virtues, moſt commonly, are but Vices diſguiſed.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. WHAT we take for virtues, is commonly nothing elſe but the concurrence of ſeveral actions and ſeveral intereſts, which either fortune or our own induſtry contrive to diſpoſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and it is not always from a principle of valour, that men are valiant, or from a principle of chaſtity, that women are enaſte.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Self-love is of all flatterers the greateſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For all the diſcoveries that have been made into the land of ſelf-love, there ſtill remains a large <hi>Terr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Incognita.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Self-love is more ſubtle than the moſt ſubtle man in the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The duration of our paſſions no more depends on us, than the duration of our lives.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Paſſion often makes a man of ſenſe mad; and often makes a fool ſenſible.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Thoſe great and ſhining actions, whoſe luſtre even dazzles us, we repreſented by the politicians as the effects of great deſigns: whereas, for the moſt part, they are indeed the effects of humour and paſſion: thus the war between <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Antony,</hi> which is attributed to the ambition each had of making himſelf maſter of the world, was perhaps nothing but the effect of jealouſy.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The paſſions are the only orators that are always ſure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade: they are, as it were, nature's art of eloquence, the rules of which are infallible: and the plaineſt man with paſſion, perſuades more than the moſt eloquent without it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There is ſuch an inherent injuſtice and ſelf-intereſt in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that it is dangerous to follow them, and they are moſt to be diſtruſted, even when they appear to be moſt reaſonable.</p>
               <p n="10">10. There is in the heart of man a perpetual ſucceſſion of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, inſomuch, that the ruin of one is almoſt always the riſe of another.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The paſſions often beget other paſſions of a quite contrary nature; avarice ſometimes produces prodigality, and prodigality avarice: weakneſs often makes a man reſolute, and fear, bold.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For all the care we ake to conceal our paſſions under the veil of religion and honour, they always appear through the diſguiſe.</p>

13. Our ſelf-love bears more impatiently the condemnation of our inclinations than of our opinions</p>
               <p n="14">14. Men are not only apt to forget kindneſſes and injuries, but even to hate thoſe who have obliged them, and to ceaſe to hate thoſe who have uſed them ill. The trouble of returning favours and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging wrongs, ſeems a ſlavery to them, which they do not eaſily ſubmit to.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The clemency of princes is often nothing but a piece of policy to gain the affections of their ſubjects.</p>
               <p n="16">16. That clemency which is cried up as a virtue, is practiſed ſometimes out of vanity, ſometimes out of lazineſs, often out of fear, and almoſt always out of a mixture of all three together.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The moderation of perſons in proſperity proceeds from the calm that good fortune gives to their humour and temper.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Moderation is a fear of falling into that envy and contempt, which thoſe deſerve that are intoxicated with their good fortune: it is a vain oſtentation of the force of our mind: and, in ſhort, the moderation of men, in their moſt exalted condition, is a deſire of appearing greater than their fortune.</p>
               <p n="19">19. We have all of us ſtrength enough to bear the misfortunes of other people.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The conſtancy of the wiſe is no more than the art of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining their troubles to their own breaſts.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Criminals, when led to execution, affect ſometimes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and a contempt of death, which, in truth, is nothing but a fear to look it in the face: ſo that this conſtancy and this contempt may be ſaid to be to their mind, what the handkerchief is to their eyes.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Philoſophy makes nothing to triumph over paſt and future evils, but the preſent triumph over that.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Few people are acquainted with death: they generally ſubmit to it, not out of reſolution, but inſenſibility and cuſtom; and the greateſt part of men die, only becauſe they cannot avoid dying.</p>
               <p n="24">24. When great men are dejected with the length of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, they diſcover that it was the force of their ambition, and not of their ſoul, that ſuſtaineth them: and that, bating a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, heroes are made juſt like other men.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Greater virtues are required to bear a good fortune than an ill one.</p>
               <p n="26">26. The ſun and death are two things that cannot ſteadily be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Men are often vain even of the moſt criminal paſſions; but, envy is a cowardly and ſhameful paſſion, which nobody ever dares to own.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Jealouſy is in ſome ſort juſt and reaſonable, ſince it only tends to preſerve a good which belongs to us, or which we believe does belong to us: whereas envy is a madneſs that cannot bear the good of others.</p>
               <p n="29">29. The ill we do, expoſes us, not ſo much to perſecution and hatred, as our good qualities.</p>
               <p n="30">30. We have more power than will; and it is often to excuſe
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:027039_0096_0FD2FAB053A53878"/>
ourſelves to ourſelves, that we fancy things impoſſible to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p n="31">31. If we had no defects of our own, we ſhould not take ſo much pleaſure as we do, to remark defects in others.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Jealouſy is fed by doubts, and either becomes madneſs, or ceaſes, as ſoon as doubt is turned into certainty.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Pride always indemnifies itſelf one way or other, and loſes nothing, even when it renounces vanity.</p>
               <p n="34">34. If we were not proud ourſelves, we ſhould not complain of the pride of others.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Pride is equal in all men, and the difference is only in the means and the manner of ſhowing it.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Nature, who ſo wiſely has fitted the organs of our body to make us happy, ſeems likewiſe to have beſtowed pride on us, on purpoſe, as it were, to ſave us the pain of knowing our imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Pride has a greater ſhare than good nature, in our reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people for their faults; and we reprove them not ſo much to amend them, as to make them believe we are free from thoſe faults ourſelves.</p>
               <p n="38">38. We make promiſes according to our hopes, and keep them according to our fears.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Intereſt ſpeaks all ſorts of languages, and acts all ſorts of parts, even that of the diſintereſted perſon.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Intereſt, which blinds ſome people, enlightens others.</p>
               <p n="41">41. The men that apply themſelves too much to little things, commonly become incapable of great.</p>
               <p n="42">42. We have not ſtrength enough to follow all the dictates of our reaſon.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Man often fancies he governs himſelf when he is governed: and while he, with his underſtanding, aims at one mark, his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inſenſibly carry him off to another.</p>
               <p n="44">44. Strength and weakneſs of mind are improper terms; they are, in reality, nothing but the good or ill diſpoſition of the organs of our body.</p>
               <p n="45">45. The caprice of our humour is more fantaſtical even than that of fortune.</p>
               <p n="46">46. The fondneſs or indifference which the philoſophers had for life, was nothing but a reliſh of ſelf-love, which ought no more to be diſputed, than the reliſh of the palate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the choice of colour.</p>
               <p n="47">47. 'Tis our humour which ſets the price on all the things which we receive from fortune.</p>
               <p n="48">48. Happineſs is in the taſte, and not in the things; and it is a man's having that which he loves that makes him happy, and not what others think lovely.</p>
               <p n="49">49. We are never ſo happy, or unhappy, as we imagine.</p>
               <p n="50">50. Thoſe who are conceited of their merit, take a pride in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unhappy, that they make others and themſelves believe, they are worthy to be the mark of fortune.</p>
               <p n="51">51. Nothing ought ſo much to leſſen the ſatisfaction we take in ourſelves, as to ſee that we diſapprove at one time, what we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved at another.</p>
               <p n="52">52. Whatever difference there may appear to be in men's fortunes,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:027039_0097_0FD2FAB1C6ECD3C0"/>
there is ſtill a certain compenſation of good and ill in all, that makes them equal.</p>
               <p n="53">53. Let nature give never ſo may advantages, 'tis not ſhe alone, but fortune in conjunction with her, that makes a hero.</p>
               <p n="54">54. The contempt of riches was, in the philoſophers, a ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to revenge on fortune the injuſtice ſhe had done to their merit, by deſpiſing thoſe goods which ſhe had denied them: 'twas an art to ſecure themſelves from the diſgrace of poverty; 'twas a by-way to arrive at eſteem, which they could not come at by the ordinary one of riches.</p>
               <p n="55">55. Our hatred of favourites, is nothing but our love of favour: the indignation we conceive at our not poſſeſſing it ourſelves, is ſoothed and ſoftened by the contempt we expreſs for thoſe who do poſſeſs it; and we refuſe them our reſpect, not being able to deprive them of that which procures them the reſpect of all the world.</p>
               <p n="56">56. To make a fortune in the world, men uſe all the means poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to appear to have made it already.</p>
               <p n="57">57. Tho' men value themſelves on their great actions, they are not often the effects of a great deſign, but the effects of chance.</p>
               <p n="58">58. Our actions ſeem to have their lucky and unlucky ſtars, to which is owing a great part of the praiſe or diſpraiſe which is gives them.</p>
               <p n="59">59. There is no accident ſo unfortunate but the prudent will make ſome advantage of it; nor any ſo fortunate that the imprudent will not turn to their prejudice.</p>
               <p n="60">60. Fortune turns every thing to the advantage of thoſe ſhe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
               <p n="61">61. The happineſs and unhappineſs of men depend no leſs on their humour, than on fortune.</p>

Thus, the dead have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of thoſe tears, which are ſhed only for the living. This, I ſay, is a ſpecies of hypocriſy; becauſe, in theſe ſorts of afflictions, men impoſe on themſelves.

After that time, which conſumes all things, has worn out that concern, which they really had, they ſtill grow obſtinate in their tears, complaints, and ſighs: they ſet up for playing a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful part, and take pains, by all their actions, to perſuade us, that their ſorrow will never end, but with their lives. This diſmal and tireſome vanity, is uſual with ambitious women: as their ſex has excluded them from all the ways that lead to glory, they ſtrive to diſtinguiſh themſelves by ſhewing the pomp of an affliction that is not to be comforted. There is yet another kind of tears, which have out ſhallow ſprings, that flow indeed, but are eaſily dried up. There are thoſe that weep to gain the reputation of being tender: thoſe that weep, that they may be pitied: thoſe that weep to be condoled; and thoſe, in ſhort, that weep, to avoid the ſcandal of being thought inſenſible.</p>

The inequality that is remarkable in the courage of a world of brave men, proceeds from this, that death diſcovers itſelf in different ſhapes to them, and appears more preſent to their imagination at one time than another: ſo it happens, that after having deſpiſed what they did not know, they are afraid at laſt of what they do know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If we would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it the greateſt of all evils, we muſt never look it in the face with all its circumſtances.

            <p n="2">2. Mankind differ as much in eſſence, as they do in form, limbs, and ſenſes—and only ſo, and not more.</p>

            <p n="6">6. The more complex yet uniform, the more varied yet harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, the medium of ſelf-enjoyment;—the more exiſtent and real, the more vigorious and dignified, the more bleſt and bleſſing is man.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He, whom common, groſs, or ſtale objects allure, and when obtained, content, is a vulgar being, incapable of greatneſs in thought or action.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Who purſues means of enjoyment—contradictory, irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable and ſelf-deſtructive, is a fool, or what is called a ſinner—Sin and deſtruction of order are the ſame.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The more unharmonious and inconſiſtent your objects of deſire, the more inconſequent, inconſtant, unquiet, the more ignoble, idiot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical, and criminal yourſelf.</p>

The applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is eaſy: of thouſands it may be decided what loſs, what gain would affect them moſt.

The greateſt of characters, no doubt, would be he, who free of all trifling accidental helps, could ſee objects through one grand immutable medium, always at hand, and proof againſt illuſion and time, reflecting every object in its true ſhape and colour through all the fluctuation of things.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Where you find true internal life, conſiſtence of character, principles of real independence, ſympathy for univerſal harmony—where inexorable reſolution againſt all that threatens the real unity of exiſtence and bands of order—where you find theſe, there offer the homage due to humanity.</p>

As the energy of will, ſo the value, the character of man. Inveſtigate then <hi>what</hi> and <hi>how</hi> he loves or hates—as theſe are in perpetual uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, you diſcover his energy of will, and by that himſelf.</p>

            <p n="69">69. Humility and love, whatever obſcurities may involve religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tenets, conſtitute the eſſence of true religion. The humble is formed to adore; the loving to aſſociate with eternal love.</p>

It may be, that graver books have been written on this ſubject, but few more to the point; its author being equally ſkilled in books and in men, in the dead languages and the living; I preſume, therefore, that his obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be generally found true, and his maxims juſt.</hi>

                  <hi>At firſt fight, it may ſeem that this eſſay is calculated only for a few; but I beg leave to obſerve, that in truth there are but few to whom it may not be uſeful. As every man in his ſtation ought to be honeſt, ſo every man in his behaviour may be polite; nay, he ought to be ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe he will be ſure to find his account in it; ſince it is a quality eaſier diſcerned, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſooner rewarded than the former. We muſt know and converſe with a man, to be convinced of his probity; whereas we perceive at firſt ſight whether he has good manners; by this we are prejudiced in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: and who then would not ſtrive to learn an art at once ſo eaſy, and ſo extenſive in its uſe?</hi>

                  <hi>But, if it be beneficial to all, it is peculiarly neceſſary to</hi> Youth. <hi>It is at once a remedy for baſhfulneſs, and a preſervative againſt the contrary vice. A polite perſon ſtands in the middle, between a ſheepiſh modeſty and a diſtaſteful boldneſs. It is the habit which adds the laſt poliſh to education, brightens the man of letters, and ſpreads a gloſs over that ſort of learning which would otherwiſe appear pedantic. The polite man may not only underſtand Latin and Greek, but may alſo introduce them into diſcourſe, provided it be before proper company, and on a proper oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. The unpoliſhed ſcholar lugs them in whenever they occur; quotes</hi> OVID <hi>to his miſtreſs, and repeats a paſſage from</hi> POLYAENEUS <hi>to a captain of the guards. To your youth, therefore, I beg leave to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this conciſe manual, which will coſt them but little time to read, and no great pains to practiſe.</hi>

It is want of attention, not capacity, which leaves us ſo many brutes; and, I flatter myſelf, there will be ſewer of this ſpecies, if any of them can be prevailed on to read this. A deſcription of their faults is ſo ſuch the fitteſt lecture; for few monſters there are who can view themſelves in a glaſs.</p>

               <p>My readers, who have been many of them accuſtomed to think <hi>politeneſs</hi> rather an ornamental accompliſhment, than a thing neceſſary to be acquired in order to an eaſy and happy life, may, from hence pay leſs attention than my inſtructions require, unleſs I can convince them they are in the wrong. In order to which, I muſt put them in mind, that the tranquillity, and even felicity of our days, depends as ſtrongly on ſmall things, as on great; of which men may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily convinced if they but reflect how great uneaſineſs they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced from croſs accidents, although they related but to trifles; and at the ſame time remember, that diſquiet is of all others the greateſt evil, let it ariſe from what it will.</p>
               <p>Now, in the concerns of life, as in thoſe of fortune, numbers are brought into what are called bad circumſtances from ſmall neglects, rather than from any great errors in material affairs. People are too apt to think lightly of ſhillings and pence, forgetting that they are the conſtituent parts of pounds; until the deficiency in the greater article ſhows them their miſtake, and convinces them, by fatal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, of a truth, which they might have learned from a little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that great ſums are made up of ſmall.</p>

Exactly parallel to this, is that wrong notion which many have that nothing more is due from them to their neighbours than what reſults from a principle of honeſty; which commands us to pay our debts, and forbids us to do injuries: whereas a thouſand little civilities, complaiſances, and endeavours to give others pleaſure, are requiſite to keep up the reliſh of life, and procure us that affection and eſteem which every man who has a ſenſe of it muſt deſire.

               <p>
                  <hi>Honorious</hi> is a perſon equally diſtinguiſhed by his birth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. He has naturally good ſenſe; and that too hath been impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a regular education. His wit is lively, and his morals with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſtain.—Is not this an amiable character? Yet <hi>Honorious</hi> is not beloved. He has, ſome way or other, contracted a notion, that it is beneath a man of honour to fall below the height of truth in any degree, or on any occaſion whatſoever. From this principle he ſpeaks bluntly what he thinks, without regarding the company who are by. Some weeks ago, he read a lecture on female hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, before a married couple, though the lady was much ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that head. Two hours after he fell into a warm declamation againſt ſimony and prieſtcraft before two dignitaries of the church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, from a continued courſe of this ſort of behaviour, hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf dreaded as a monitor, inſtead of being eſteemed as a friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Garcia,</hi> on the contrary, came into the world under the greateſt diſadvantages. His birth was mean, and his fortune not to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; yet, though he is ſcarce forty, he has acquired a handſome eſtate in the country, and lives on it with more reputation than moſt of his neighbours. While a ſervitor at the univerſity, he, by his aſſiduities, recommended himſelf to a noble lord, and thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a place of fifty pounds a year in a public office. His behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our there made him as many friends as there were perſons belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this board. His readineſs in doing favours, gained him the hearts of his inferiors; his deference for thoſe in the higheſt charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the office, procured him their good will; and the compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency he expreſſed towards his equals and thoſe immediately above
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:027039_0164_0FD2FB43F58BA828"/>
him, made them eſpouſe his intereſt, with almoſt as much warmth, as they did their own. By this management, in ten years time, he roſe to the poſſeſſion of an office which brought him in a thouſand pounds a-year ſalary, and near double as much in perquiſites. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence hath made no alteration in his manners. The ſame eaſineſs of diſpoſition attends him in that fortune to which it has raiſed him; and he is at this day the delight of all who know him, from an art <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e has of perſuading them, that their pleaſures and their intereſts are equally dear to him with his own. Who, if it were in his power, would refuſe what <hi>Honorious</hi> poſſeſſes? and who would not wiſh that poſſeſſion accompanied with <hi>Garcia'</hi>s diſpoſition?</p>
               <p>I flatter myſelf, that, by this time, moſt of my readers have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a tolerable idea of <hi>politeneſs,</hi> and a juſt notion of its uſe, in their paſſage through life. I muſt, however, caution them of one thing, that under pretence of <hi>politeneſs,</hi> they fall neither into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or careleſſneſs of <hi>ſcience.</hi>

For though exactneſs would not be of a piece, either with the nature or intent of this work, yet ſome order is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe nothing is more unpolite than to be obſcure. Some philoſophers have indeed prided themſelves in a myſterious way of ſpeaking; wrapping their maxims in ſo tough a coat, that the kernel, when found, ſeldom atoned for the pains of the finder.</p>
               <p>The <hi>polite Sage</hi> thinks in a quite different way. Perſpicuity is the garment in which his conceptions appear; and his ſentiments, if they are of any uſe, carry this additional advantage with them, that ſcarce any labour is acquired in attaining them. Graver diſcourſes, like galenical medicines, are often formidable in their figure, and nauſeous in their taſte. Lectures from a doctor in our ſcience, like a chemical extraction, convey knowledge, as it were by drops; and reſtore ſenſe as the other does health, without the <hi>aparatus</hi> of phyſic.</p>

                  </gap> procure, in reſpect to there three things which are eſteemed of the greateſt conſequence in the general opinion of the world. This leads me, in the firſt place, to explain the ſentiments and conduct of a <hi>Polite Philoſopher</hi> in regard to <hi>Religion.</hi> I am not ignorant, that there are a multitude of thoſe who paſs both on the world, and on themſelves, for very polite perſons, who look on this as a topic be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their notice. <hi>Religion</hi> (ſay they with a ſneer) is the companion of melancholy minds; but, for the gayer part of the world, it is ill manners to mention it amongſt them. Be it ſo. But give me leave to add, that there is no ranker ſpecies of ill-breeding, than ſpeaking of it ſarcaſtically, or with contempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Religion,</hi> ſtrictly ſpeaking, means that worſhip which men, from a ſenſe of duty, pay to that Being, unto whom they owe their own exiſtence, with all thoſe bleſſings and benefits which attend it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let a man but reflect on this definition, and it will be impoſſible for him not to perceive, that treating this in a ludicrous way, muſt not only be unpolite, but ſhocking. Who, that has a regard for a man, would not ſtart at the thought of ſaying a baſe thing of his father before him? And yet what a diſtance is there between the notron of a <hi>father</hi> and a <hi>Creator!</hi> Since therefore no further argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are neceſſary to prove the inconſiſtence between <hi>raillery</hi> and <hi>religion,</hi> what can he more cogent to a polite man, than thus ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſuch diſcourſes of his would be <hi>mal a propos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much for thoſe who might be guilty of <hi>unpoliteneſs</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>religion</hi> in general, a fault unaccountably common in an age which pretends to be ſo <hi>polite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to particular religions, or rather tenets in religion, men are generally warm in them, from one of theſe two reaſons, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of conſcience, or a high ſenſe of their own judgments. Men of plain parts, and honeſt diſpoſitions, look on ſalvation as too ſerious a thing to be jeſted with: a <hi>polite</hi> man therefore will be cautious of offending upon that head, becauſe he knows it will give the perſon to whom he ſpeaks pain; a thing ever oppoſite to the character of a <hi>poliſhed philoſopher.</hi> The latter reaſon, which I have aſſigned for men's zeal in religions matters, may ſeem to have leſs weight than the firſt; but he was conſiders it attentively will be of another opinion. Men of ſpeculative religion, who are ſo from the conviction rather of their heads than their hearts, are not a bit leſs vehement than the real devotees. He who ſays a flight or a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere thing of their faith, ſeems to them to have thereby undervalued their underſtandings, and will conſequently incur their averſion; which no man of common ſenſe would hazard for a lively expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: much leſs a perſon of good breeding, who ſhould make it his chief aim to be well with all. As a mark of my own <hi>politeneſs,</hi>

               <p>Next to their concerns in the other world, men are uſually moſt taken up with the concerns of the <hi>public</hi> here. The love of our country is among thoſe virtues to which every man thinks he ſhould pretend; and the way in which this is generally ſhown, is by fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into what we call <hi>parties;</hi> where, if a large ſhare of good ſenſe allay not that heat which is naturally contracted from ſuch engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a man ſoon falls into all the violences of <hi>faction,</hi> and looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every one as his enemy, who does not expreſs himſelf about the public good in the ſame terms he does. This is a harſh picture, but it is a juſt one, of the far greater part of thoſe who are warm in political diſputes. A <hi>polite man</hi> will therefore ſpeak as ſeldom as he can on topics, where, in a mixed company, it is almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſay any thing that will pleaſe all.</p>
               <p>To ſay truth, <hi>patriotiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it ſeems not altogether credible they ſhould, at every turn, prefer their country's intereſt to their own. The thing looks noble indeed; and therefore like a becoming habit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body would put it on. But this is hypocriſy, you'll ſay, and therefore ſhould be detected! Here the <hi>Polite Philoſopher</hi> finds new inducements to caution: ſore places are always tender; and people at a maſquerade are in pain, if you do any thing which may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their faces.</p>
               <p>Our philoſophy is not intended to make a man that four moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor who points out folks faults, but to make them in love with their virtues; that is, to make himſelf and them eaſy while he is with them; and to do, or ſay nothing, which, on reflexion, may make them leſs his friends at their next meeting.</p>
               <p>Let us explain this a little further. The rules we offer, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended rather to guide men in company than when alone. What we advance, tends not ſo directly to amend peoples hearts, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate their conduct; a matter which we have already demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be of no ſmall importance. Yet I beg you'll obſerve, that though morality be not immediately our ſubject, we are far, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, from requiring any in our pupils contrary thereto.</p>
               <p>A <hi>polite man</hi> may yet be religious, and, if his reaſon be convinced, attached to any intereſt which, in his opinion, ſuits beſt with that of the public; provided he conform thus far to our ſyſtem, that on no occaſion he trouble others with the articles of his religious creed, or political engagements; or, by any ſtroke of wit or raillery, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:027039_0167_0FD2FB48AA4F6BC0"/>
for a laugh, that diſpoſition of mind which is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make men eaſy when together.</p>
               <p>Were I indeed to indulge my own ſentiments, I ſhould ſpeak yet with greater freedom on this ſubject. Since there is ſo vaſt a diſproportion when we come to compare thoſe who have really ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a concern in the government, or the ſervice of their country, more particularly at heart, and the men who pretend to either, merely from a deſire of appearing of ſome conſequence themſelves; we ought certainly to avoid making one of this number, and aim rather at being quiet within ourſelves, and agreeable to thoſe among whom we live, let their political notions be what they will; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as this is a direct road to happineſs, which all men profeſs they would reach, if they could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Pomponius Atticus,</hi> whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter appears ſo amiable, from the concurring teſtimony of all who mention him, owed the greateſt part of that eſteem in which he lived, and of the reputation by which he ſtill ſurvives, unto his ſteady ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to this rule. His benevolence made him love mankind in general, and his good ſenſe hindered him from being tainted with thoſe party prejudices which had bewitched his friends. He took not up arms for <hi>Caeſar;</hi> nor did he abandon <hi>Italy</hi> when <hi>Pompey</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew with his forces, and had, in outward form, the ſanction of the commonwealth. He ſaw too plainly the ambition of both: yet he preſerved his complaiſance for his friends in each party, without ſiding with either. Succeſs never made them more welcome to <hi>Pomponius;</hi> nor could any defeat leſſen them in his eſteem. When victorious he viſited them, without ſharing in their power; and when vanquiſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he received them, without conſidering any thing but their diſtreſs. In a few words, he entertained no hopes from the good fortune of his friends, nor ſuffered the reverſe of it to chill his breaſt with fear. His equanimity produced a juſt effect, and his univerſal kindneſs made him univerſally beloved.</p>
               <p>I fancy this picture of a diſpoſition, perfectly free from political ſourneſs, will have an agreeable effect on many of my readers; and prevent their falling into a common miſtake, that the circumſtances of public affairs, and the characters of public perſons, are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt topics for general converſation: whereas they never conſider, that it is hard to find a company wherein ſomebody or other hath not either liking or diſtaſte, or has received injuries or obligations from thoſe who are likelieſt to be mentioned upon ſuch occaſions: and who, conſequently, will be apt to put a ſerious conſtruction on a ſlight expreſſion, and remember afterward in earneſt, what the ſpeaker ment ſo much a jeſt, as never to have thought of it more. Theſe, perhaps, may paſs with ſome for trivial remarks; but thoſe who regard their own eaſe, and have at all obſerved what conduces to make men diſagreeable to one another, I flatter myſelf they will have more weight.</p>
               <p>Behaviour is like architecture; the ſymmetry of the whole plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us ſo much, that we examine not into its parts, which, if we did, we ſhould find much nicety required in forming ſuch a ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: though, to perſons of no taſte, the rules of either art would ſeem to have little connexion with their effects.</p>

               <p>Let us now proceed to ſpeak of raillery in general. Invective is a weapon worn as commonly as a ſword; and, like that, is often in the hands of thoſe who know not how to uſe it. Men of true courage fight but ſeldom, and never draw but in their own defence. Bullies are continually ſquabbling; and, from the ferocity of their behaviour, become the terror of ſome companies, and the jeſt of more. This is juſt the caſe with ſuch as have a livelineſs of thought, directed by a propenſity to ill-nature: indulging themſelves at the
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:027039_0169_0FD2FB500646F6D0"/>
expence of others, they, by degrees, incur the diſlike of all. Meek tempers abhor, men of cool diſpoſition deſpiſe, and thoſe addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to choler, chaſtiſe them. Thus a licentiouſneſs of tongue, like a ſpirit of rapine, ſets one man againſt all; and the defence of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as property, puts the human ſpecies on regarding a malevolent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>It is a thouſand to one my book feels the reſentment of <hi>Draco,</hi> from his ſeeing his own likeneſs in this glaſs.</p>
               <p>A good family, but no fortune, threw <hi>Draco</hi> into the army when he was very young. Dancing, fencing and a ſmattering of <hi>French,</hi> are all the education either his friends beſtowed, or his capacity would allow him to receive. He has now been two years in town, and from ſwearing, drinking, and debauching country wenches (the general route of a military rake) the air of the Capital has given his vices a new turn. By dint of a military uniform, he thruſts himſelf into the beau aſſemblies, where a dauntleſs effrontery, and a natural volubility of tongue, conſpire to make him paſs for a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of wit and ſpirit.</p>
               <p>A baſtard ambition makes him envy every great character; and he has juſt ſenſe enough to know, that this qualification will never recommend him to the eſteem of men of ſenſe, or the favour of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of virtue, he has thence contracted an antipathy to both; and, by giving a boundleſs looſe to univerſal malice, makes continual war againſt honour and reputation, wherever he finds them.</p>

Next to thoſe cautions with reſpect to raillery, which, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine ſtrictly, we ſhall find no better than a well-bred phraſe for ſpeaking ill of folks; it may not be amiſs to warn our readers of a certain vehemence in diſcourſe, exceedingly ſhocking to others, at the ſame time that it not a little exhauſts themſelves.</p>
               <p>If we trace this error to its ſource, we ſhall find that the ſpring of it is an impatience at finding others differ from us in opinion; and can there be any thing more unreaſonable, than to blame that diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in them which we cheriſh in ourſelves?</p>
               <p>If ſubmiſſion be a thing ſo diſagreeable to us, why ſhould we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it from the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As this is a foible more eſpecially indecent in the fair ſex, I think it will be highly neceſſary to offer another, and perhaps a more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent argument to their conſideration. Paſſion is a prodigious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to beauty: it ruffles the ſweeteſt features, diſcolours the fineſt complexion, and, in a word, gives the air of a fury to the face of an angel. Far be it from me to lay reſtraints upon the ladies; but, an diſſuading them from this method of enforcing their ſentiments, I put them upon an eaſier way of effecting what they deſire: for what can be denied to beauty, when ſpeaking with an air of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction? Complaiſance does all that vehemence would extort, as anger alone can abate the influence of their charms.</p>

               <p>Perhaps this ſhort deſcription may ſet many of my readers right; which, whatever they may think of it, I aſſure them is of no ſmall importance. Converſation is a ſort of bank, in which all who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it have their reſpective ſhares.

and, whether they think fit to tell him ſo or no, will of conſequence, be regarded as no fair dealer. Notwithſtanding I conſider conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in this light. I think it neceſſary to obſerve, that it differs from other copartnerſhips in one very material point; which is this, that it is worſe taken if a man pays in more than his proportion, than if he had not contributed his full quota, provided he be not too far deficient: for the prevention of which, let us have <hi>Horace's</hi> caution continually in our eye.</p>

               <p>There was a coffee-houſe in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat end of the town where I lodged ſome time ago, at which ſeveral gentlemen uſed to meet of an eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, who, from a happy correſpondence in their humours and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities entertained one another agreeably, from the cloſe of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon till it was time to go to bed.</p>
               <p>About ſix months this ſociety ſubſiſted with great regularity, though without reſtraint. Every gentleman who frequented the houſe, and converſed with the crectors of this occaſional club, were invited to paſs an evening, when they thought fit, in a room, one pair of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>airs ſet apart for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The report of this meeting drew, one night when I had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being there, three gentlemen of diſtinction, who were ſo well known <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o moſt of the members, that admittance could not be refuſed them. One of them, whom I chooſe to call <hi>Major Ramble,</hi> turned of threeſcore, and who had had an excellent education, ſeized the diſcourſe about an hour before ſupper, and gave us a very
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:027039_0173_0FD2FB55E864F528"/>
copious account of the remarks he had made in three years travels through <hi>Italy.</hi> He began with a geographical deſcription of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of his <hi>Sardinian</hi> majeſty as duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and, after a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion on the fortifications of <hi>Turin,</hi> in ſpeaking of which he ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf a perfect engineer, he proceeded to the ſecret hiſtory of the intrigues of that court, from the propoſal of the match with <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> to the abdication of king <hi>Victor Amadeus.</hi> After this he run over the general hiſtory of <hi>Milan, Parma,</hi> and <hi>Modena:</hi> dwelt half an hour on the adventures of the laſt duke of <hi>Mantua;</hi> gave us a haſty ſketch of the court of <hi>Rome:</hi> transferred himſelf from thence to the kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> repeated the inſurrection of <hi>Maſſaniello,</hi> and, at a quarter before ten, finiſhed his obſervations with the recital of what happened at the reduction of that kingdom to the obedience of the preſent emperor. What contributed to make this conduct of his the more out of the way, was, that every gentleman in the room had been in <hi>Italy</hi> as well as he: and one of them, who was a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, was the very perſon at whoſe houſe the major reſided when at <hi>Naples.</hi> Poſſibly he might imagine the knowledge they had in thoſe things might give them a greater reliſh for his animadverſions; or, to ſpeak more candidly, the deſire of diſplaying his own parts buried every other circumſtance in oblivion.</p>
               <p>Juſt as the major had done ſpeaking, a gentleman called for a glaſs of water; and happened to ſay, after drinking it, that he found his conſtitution much mended ſince he left off malt liquor. Doctor <hi>Hectick,</hi> another of the ſtrangers, immediately laid hold of this opportunity, and gave us a large account of the virtues of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; confirming whatever he advanced from the moſt eminent phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians. From the main ſubject, he made an eaſy tranſition to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical baths and ſprings. Nor were his ſearches bounded by our own country; he condeſcended to acquaint us with the properties of the ſprings of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> particularized the genuine ſmell of <hi>Spa</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, applauded the wonderful effects of the <hi>Pierpont</hi> mineral; and, like a true patriot, wound up his diſquiſitions with preferring <hi>Aſtrop</hi> wells (within three miles of which he was born) to them all. It was now turned of eleven; when the major and the doctor took their leaves and went away together in a hackney-coach.</p>
               <p>The company ſeemed inclinable to extend their uſual time of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in order to divert themſelves after the night's fatigue. When, Mr. <hi>Papilio,</hi> the third new comer, after two or three ſevere reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions on the oddity of ſome people's humours, who were for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their own idle conceits as things worthy the attention of a whole company; though, at the ſame time, their ſubjects are tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial, and their manner of treating them inſipid: for my part, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, gentlemen, moſt people do me the honour to ſay, that few perſons underſtand medals better than I do. To put the muſty ſtories of theſe queer old men out of our heads, I'll give you the hiſtory of a valuable medallion, which was ſent me about three weeks ago from <hi>Venice.</hi> Without ſtaying for any further mark of approbation than ſilence, he entered immediately on a long diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; in which he had ſcarce proceeded ten minutes, before his auditors, loſing all patience, followed the example of an old <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi> merchant, who, takin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever not to diſappoint my readers, or myſelf, by foregoing that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I feel in doing juſtice, to the moſt amiable part of the creation, I will indulge the natural propenſity I have to their ſervice, and paint, though it be but in miniature, the excellencies they poſſeſs, and the accompliſhments which by reflexion they beſtow.</p>

Thoſe who, from wrong ideas of things, have forced themſelves into a diſlike of the ſex, will be apt to cry out, where would this fellow run?

               <p>Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> who knew human nature perhaps as well as any man who ever ſtudied it, has given us a juſt picture of the force of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male charms, in the ſtory of <hi>Cymon</hi> and <hi>Iphigenia. Boccace,</hi> from whom he took it, had adorned it with all the tinſel finery an <hi>Italian</hi> compoſition is capable of. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> poet, like ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, gave <hi>ſterling</hi> ſilver in exchange for that ſuperficial gilding; and beſtowed a moral where he found a tale. He paints, in <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> a ſoul buried in a confuſion of ideas, inflamed with ſo little fire, as ſcarce to ſtruggle under the load, or afford any glimmerings of ſenſe. In this condition, he repreſents him ſtruck with the rays of <hi>Iphigenia'</hi>s beauty; kindled by them, his mind exerts its powers, his intellectual faculties ſeem to awake; and that uncouth ferocity of manners, by which he had hitherto been diſtinguiſhed, gave way to an obliging behaviour, the natural effect of love.</p>
               <p>The moral of this fable is a truth which can never be inculcated too much. It is to the fair ſex we owe the moſt ſhining qualities of which ours is maſter: as the ancients inſinuated, with their uſual addreſs, by painting both the Virtues and Graces as females. Men of true taſte feel a natural complaiſance for women when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

pleaſing; which is the diſpoſition at once the moſt grateful to others, and the moſt ſatisfactory to ourſelves. An intimate acquaintance with the other ſex fixes this complaiſance into a habit, and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit is the very eſſence of <hi>politeneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, I preſume to ſay, <hi>politeneſs</hi> can be no other way attained. Books may furniſh us with right ideas, experience may prove our judgments, but it is the acquaintance of the ladies only, which can beſtow that eaſineſs of addreſs, whereby the <hi>fine gentleman</hi> is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the <hi>ſcholar</hi> and the <hi>man of buſineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That my readers may be perfectly ſatisfied in a point, which I think of ſo great importance, let us examine this a little more ſtrictly.</p>
               <p>There is a certain conſtitutional pride in men, which hinders their yielding in point of knowledge, honour or virtue, to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This immediately forſakes us at the ſight of women. And the being accuſtomed to ſubmit to the ladies gives a new turn to our ideas, and opens a path to reaſon, which ſhe had not trod be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Things appear in another light, and that degree of compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſancy ſeems now a virtue, which heretofore we regarded as a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>I have dwelt the longer on the charms of the ſex, ariſing from the perfection viſible in their exterior compoſition, becauſe there is the ſtrongeſt analogy between them, and excellencies which, from a nicer inquiry, we diſcover in the minds of the fair. As they are diſtinguiſhed from the robuſt make of man by that delicacy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſſed by nature, in their form; ſo the ſeverity of maſculine ſenſe is ſoftened by a ſweetneſs peculiar to the female ſoul.</p>
               <p>A native capacity of pleaſing attends them through every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of life; and, what we improperly call the weakneſs of the ſex, gives them a ſuperiority unattainable by force.</p>
               <p>The fable of the north wind and the ſun, contending to make the man throw off his cloak, is not an improper picture of the ſpecific difference between the powers of either ſex. The bluſtering fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the former, inſtead of producing the effect at which it aimed, made the fellow but wrap himſelf up the cloſer; yet no ſooner did the ſun beams play, than that which before protected, became now an incumbrance.</p>
               <p>Juſt ſo, that pride which makes us tenacious in diſputes between man and man, when applied to the ladies, inſpires us with an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs not to contend, but to obey.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak ſincerely and philoſophically, women ſeem deſigned by Providence to ſpread the ſame ſplendour and cheerfulneſs through the intellectual economy, that the celeſtial bodies diffuſe over the material part of the creation. Without them, we might indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, deſtroy, and triumph over one another. Fraud and force would divide the world between them: and we ſhould paſs our lives, like ſlaves, in continual to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l, without the proſpect of pleaſure or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation.</p>
               <p>It is the converſation of women that gives a proper bias to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and, by abating the ferocity of our paſſions, engages us to that gentleneſs of deportment which we ſtyle <hi>humanity.</hi> The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs we have for them, ſoftens the ruggedneſs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> our own nature;
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:027039_0178_0FD2FB64363D9AD8"/>
and the virtues we put on to make the better figure in their eyes, keep us in humour with ourſelves.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak it without affectation or vanity, that no man has applied more aſſiduouſly than myſelf to the ſtudy of the fair ſex; and I over it with the greateſt ſimplicity of heart, that I have not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the moſt engaging and moſt amiable, but alſo the moſt generous and moſt heroic qualities amongſt the ladies; and that I have diſcovered more of candour, diſintereſtedneſs, and fervour in their friendſhips, than in thoſe of our own ſex, though I have been very careful, and particularly happy in the choice of my acquaintance.</p>
               <p>My readers will, I dare ſay, obſerve, and indeed I deſire they ſhould, a more than ordinary zeal for inculcating a high eſteem of, and a ſincere attachment to the fair. What I propoſe from it, is to rectify certain notions, which are not only deſtructive of all <hi>politeneſs,</hi> but, at the ſame time, detrimental to ſociety, and incompatible with the dignity of human nature. Theſe have, of late years, ſpread much among thoſe who aſſume to themſelves the title of <hi>fine gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> and, in conſequence thereof, talk with great freedom of thoſe from whom they are in no danger of being called to an account. There is ſo much of baſeneſs, cowardice, and contempt of truth, in this way of treating thoſe who are alone capable of making <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Levity is the beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for a tranſient ſlip of this kind: but to perſiſt in it, is evidently deſcending from our own ſpecies, and, as far as we are able, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the brute.</p>

                  </gap>,</hi> which is only able to make thee happy as well in thy death as life; I mean, the true knowledge and worſhip of thy Creator and Redeemer: without which all other things are vain and miſerable. So, that thy youth being guided by ſo ſufficient a teacher, I make no doubt but he will furniſh thy life with divine and moral docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Yet, that I may not caſt off the care beſeeming a parent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his child; or that thou ſhouldſt have cauſe to derive thy whole felicity and welfare rather from others than from whence thou receivedſt thy breath and being; I think it ſit and agreeably to the affection I bear thee, to help thee with ſuch rules and advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ſquaring of thy life, as are rather gained by experience than by reading. To the end, that entering into this exorbitant age, thou mayeſt be the better prepared to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſcandalous courſes where unto the world, and the lack of experience may eaſily draw thee. And, becauſe I will not confound thy memory, I have reduced them into ten precepts; and next to Moſes' tables, if thou imprint them in thy mind, thou ſhalt reap the benefit, and I the content. And they are theſe following:</p>
            <p>I. When it ſhall pleaſe God to bring thee to man's eſtate, uſe great providence and circumſpection in chooſing thy wife; for from thence will ſpring all thy future good or evil. And it is an action of life, like unto a ſtratagem in war; wherein a man can err but once. If thy eſtate be good, match near home and at leiſure; if weak, far off and quickly. Inquire diligently of her diſpoſition, and how her parents have been inclined in their youth. Let her not be poor, how generous ſoever. For a man can buy nothing in the market with gentility. Nor chooſe a baſe and uncomely creature altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for wealth; for it will cauſe contempt in others, and loathing in thee. Neither make choice of a dwarf, or a fool; for, by the one thou ſhalt beget a race of pigmies; the other will be thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual diſgrace; and it will yirke thee to hear her talk. For thou ſhalt find it, to thy great grief, that there is nothing more fulſome than a ſhe-fool.</p>
            <p>And, touching the guiding of thy houſe, let thy hoſpitality be moderate; and, according to the means of thy eſtate, rather plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful than ſparing, but not coſtly. For I never knew a man grow poor by keeping an orderly table. But ſome conſume themſelves through ſecret vices, and their hoſpitality bears the blame. But ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:027039_0181_0FD2FB6A2A495910"/>
ſwiniſh drunkards out of thine houſe, which is a vice impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing health, conſuming much, and makes no ſhow. I never heard praiſe aſcribed to a drunkard, but for the wellbearing of his drink; which is a better commendation for a brewer's horſe or a drayman than either a gentleman, or a ſerving man. Beware that thou ſpend not above three of four parts of thy revenues, nor above a third part of that in thy houſe. For the other two parts will do no more than defray thy extraordinaries, which always ſurmount the ordinary by much: otherwiſe thou ſhalt live, like a rich beggar, in continual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. And the needy man can never live happily nor contentedly. For every diſaſter makes him ready to mortgage or ſell. And that gentleman, who ſells an acre of land, ſells an ounce of credit. For gentility is nothing elſe but ancient riches. So that if the foundation ſhall at any time ſink, the building muſt need follow.—So much for the firſt precept.</p>
            <p>II. Bring thy children up in learning and obedience, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out outward auſterity. Praiſe them openly, reprehend them ſecretly, give them good countenance and convenient maintenance according to thy ability; otherwiſe thy life will ſeem their bondage, and what portion thou ſhalt leave them at thy death, they will thank death for it, and not thee. And I am perſuaded tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

               </gap>ckering of ſome parents, and the over-ſtern carriage of others, cauſe more men and women to take ill courſes, than their own vicious inclinations. Marry thy daughters in time, left they marry themſelves. And ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not thy ſons to paſs the Alps. For they ſhall learn nothing there but pride, blaſphemy and atheiſm. And if by travel they get a few broken languages, that ſhall profit them nothing more than to have one meat ſerved in divers diſhes. Neither, by my conſent, ſhalt thou train them up in wars. For he that ſets up his reſt to live by that profeſſion, can hardly be an honeſt man or a good chriſtian. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is a ſcience no longer in requeſt than uſe. For ſoldiers in peace are like chimneys in ſummer.</p>
            <p>III. Live not in the country without corn and cattle about thee. For he that putteth his hand to the purſe for every expence of houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, is like him that keepeth water in a ſieve. And what proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thou ſhalt want, learn to buy it at the beſt hand. For there is one penny ſaved in four, betwixt buying in thy need, and when the markets and ſeaſons ſerve fitteſt for it. Be not ſerved with kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or friends, or men intreated to ſtay; for they expect much and do little; nor with ſuch as are amorous, for their heads are intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. And keep rather too few, than one too many. Feed them well, and pay them with the moſt; and then thou mayeſt boldly require ſervice at their hands.</p>
            <p>IV. Let thy k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndred and allies be welcome to thy houſe and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Grace them with thy countenance, and father them in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt actions. For by theſe means thou ſhalt find them ſo many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates to plead an apology for thee behind thy back. But ſhake off thoſe glow-worms, I mean paraſites and ſycophants, who will feed and fawn upon thee in the ſummer of proſperity, but in adverſe ſtorms, they will ſhelter thee no more than an arbor in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>V. Beware of ſuretyſhip for thy beſt friends. He that pay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th another man's debts, ſeeketh his own decay. But if thou canſt not otherwiſe chooſe, rather lend thy money thyſelf upon good bonds,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:027039_0182_0FD2FB68CDF07758"/>
although thou borrow it. So ſhalt thou ſecure thyſelf and pleaſure thy friend. Neither borrow money of a neighbour or a friend, but of a ſtranger; where paying for it, thou ſhalt hear no more of it. Otherwiſe thou ſhalt eclipſe thy credit, loſe thy freedom, and pay as dear as to another. But in borrowing of money be precious of thy word. For he that hath care of keeping days of payment, is lord of another man's purſe.</p>
            <p>VI. Undertake no ſuit againſt a poor man without receiving much wrong. For, beſides that thou makeſt him thy compeer, it is a baſe conqueſt to triumph where there is ſmall reſiſtance. Neither at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt law againſt any man before thou be fully reſolved that thou haſt right on thy ſide; and then ſpare not for either money or pains. For a cauſe or two ſo followed and obtained, will free thee from ſuits great part of thy life.</p>
            <p>VII. Be ſure to keep ſome great man thy friend, but trouble him not for trifles. Compliment him often with many, yet ſmall gifts, and of little charge. And if thou haſt cauſe to beſtow any great gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, let it be ſomething which may be daily in ſight. Otherwiſe, in this ambitious age, thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> remain like a hop without a pole; live in obſcurity, and be made a foot-ball for every inſulting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to ſpurn at.</p>
            <p>VIII. Towards thy ſuperiors, be humble, yet generous. With thine equals, familiar, yet reſpective. Towards thine inferiors, ſhow much humanity, and ſome familiarity; as to bow the body, ſtretch forth the hand, and to uncover the head: with ſuch like popular compliments. The firſt prepares thy way to advancement. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> thee known for a man well bred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The third gains a good report; which once got is eaſily kept. For right humanity takes ſuch deep root in the minds of the multitude, as they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier gained by unprofitable curteſies than by churliſh benefits. Yet I adviſe thee not to affect or neglect popularity too much. Seek not to be Eſſex: ſhun to be Rawleigh.</p>
            <p>IX. Truſt not any man with thy life, credit, or eſtate. For it is mere folly for a man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o enthral himſelf to a friend, as though oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion being offered, he ſhould not dare to become thy enemy.</p>
            <p>X. Be not ſcurrilous in converſation, nor ſatyrical in thy jeſts. The one will make thee unwelcome to all company; the other pulls on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>I HAVE heard, that nothing gives an author ſo great a pleaſure, as to find his works reſpectfully quoted by others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Judge, then, how much I muſt have been gratified by an incident I am going to relate you. I ſtopped my horſe lately, where a great number of people were collected at an auction of merchants goods. The hour of ſale not being come, they were converſing on the badneſs of the times, and one of the company called to a plain clean Old Man, with white locks,—'Pray, <hi>Father Abraham,</hi> what think you of the times? Will not theſe heavy taxes quite ruin the country? How ſhall we be ever able to pay them? What would you adviſe us to?—Father Abraham ſtood up, and replied, 'If you would have my advice, I will give it you in ſhort, "for a word to the wiſe is enough", as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays.' They joined in deſiring him to ſpeak his mind, and gathering round him he proceeded as follows:</p>
            <p>'Friends, ſays he, the taxes are indeed very heavy; and if thoſe laid on by the government were the only ones we had to pay, we might more eaſily diſcharge them; but we have many others, and much more grievous to ſome of us. We are taxed twice as much by our idleneſs, three times as much by our pride, and four times as much by our folly; and from theſe taxes the commiſſioners can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſe or deliver us, by allowing an abatement. However, let us hearken to good advice, and ſomething may be done for us: "God helps them that help themſelves," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays.</p>
            <p>I. 'It would be thought a hard government that ſhould tax its people one tenth part of their time, to be employed in its ſervice: but idleneſs taxes many of us much more; ſloth, by bringing on diſeaſes, abſolutely ſhortens life.—"Sloth, like ruſt, conſumes faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than labour wears, while the key uſed is always bright," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays.—"But doſt thou love life, then do not ſquander time, for that is the ſtuff life is made of," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays.—How much more than is neceſſary do we ſpend in ſleep; forgetting that "The ſleeping fox catches no poultry, and that there will be ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough in the grave," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays.</p>
            <p>'If time be of all things the moſt precious, waſting time muſt be', as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays. "the greateſt prodigality;" ſince, as he elſewhere tells us, "Loſt time is never found again; and what we call time enough, always proves little enough:" Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the purpoſe; for by diligence we ſhall do more with leſs perplexity. "Sloth makes all things difficult, but induſtry all eaſy; and, he that riſeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

What though you have found no treaſure, nor has any rich relation left, you a legacy, "Diligence is the mother of good luck, and God gives all things to induſtry.

               </gap>o-day." If you were a ſervant, would you not be aſhamed that a good maſter ſhould catch you idle? Are you then your own maſter? Be aſhamed to catch yourſelf idle, when there is ſo much to be done for yourſelf, your family, and your country. Handle your tools without mittens; remember, that "The cat in gloves catches no mice," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays. It is true, there is much to be done, and, perhaps, you are weak hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but ſtick to it ſteadily, and you will ſee great effects; for, "Conſtant dropping wears away ſtones; and by diligence and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the mouſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>'Methinks I hear ſome of you ſay, "Muſt a man afford him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no leiſure?" I will tell thee, my friend, what <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays; "Employ thy time well, if thou meaneſt to gain leiſure; and, ſince thou art not ſure of a minute, throw not away an hour." <hi>Leiſure</hi> is time for doing ſomething uſeful; this leiſure the diligent man will obtain, but the lazy man never; for, "A life of leiſure and a life of lazineſs are two things. Many without labour, would live by their wits only, but they break for the want of ſtock;" whereas induſtry gives comfort, and plenty, and reſpect. "Fly pleaſures, and they will follow you. The diligent ſpinner has a large ſhift; and now I have a ſheep and a cow, every body bids me good-morrow."</p>
            <p>II. 'But with our induſtry we muſt likewiſe be ſteady, ſettled, and careful, and overſee our own affairs with our own eyes, and not truſt too much to others; for, as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays,
<q>
                  <l>I never ſaw an oft-removed tree,</l>
                  <l>Nor yet an oft-removed family,</l>
                  <l>That throve ſo well as thoſe that ſettled be."</l>
               </q>
And again, "Three removes are as bad as a fire;" and again. "Keep thy ſhop, and thy ſhop will keep thee, and again, "If you would have your buſineſs done, go; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="183" facs="unknown:027039_0185_0FD2FB72B92BC5D0"/>

                  <l>Himſelf muſt either hold or drive.</l>
               </q>
And again. "The eye of a maſter will do more work than both his hands;" and again, "Want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge; and again, "Not to overſee workmen, is to leave them your purſe open; truſting too much to others care is the ruin of many;" for "If you would have a faithful ſervant, and one that you like, ſerve yourſelf. A little neglect may breed great miſchief; for want of a nail the ſhoe was loſt; for want of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>III. 'So much for induſtry, my friends, and attention to one's own buſineſs; but to theſe we muſt add frugality, if we would make our induſtry more certainly ſucceſsful. A man may, if he knows not how to ſave as he gets, "keep his noſe all his life to the grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and die not worth a gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>Since women for tea forſook ſpinning and knitting,</l>
                  <l>And men for punch forſook he wing and ſplitting.</l>
               </q>
"If you would be wealthy, think of ſaving, as well as of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The Indies have not made Spain rich, becauſe her out goes are greater than her incomes."</p>
            <p>'Away, then, with your expenſive follies, and you will not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>Make the wealth ſmall, and the want great.</l>
               </q>
And farther, "What maintains one vice, would bring up two children." You may think, perhaps, that a little tea or a little punch now and then, diet a little more coſtly, cloaths a little finer, and a little entertainment now and then, can be no great matter; but remember, "Many a little makes a mickle." Beware of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle expences; "A ſmall leak will ſink a great ſhip," as <hi>Poor Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> ſays; and again, "Who dainties love, ſhall beggars prove;" and moreover, "Fools make feaſts, and wiſe men eat them." Here you are all got together to this ſale of fineries and nick-nacks. You call them <hi>goods:</hi> but, if you do not take care, they will prove <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to ſome of you. You expect they will be ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d cheap, and, perhaps, they may for leſs than they coſt; but, if you have no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for them, they muſt be dear to you. Remember what <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays, "Buy what thou haſt no need of, and ere long thou ſhalt ſell thy neceſſaries." And again, "At a great pennyworth p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſe a while." He means, that perhaps the cheapneſs is apparent only, and not real; or the bargain, by ſtraitening thee in thy buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may do thee more harm than good. For in another place he ſays, "Many have been ruined by buying good pennyworths." Again, "It is fooliſh to lay out money in a purchaſe of repentance;" and yet this folly is practiſed every day at auctions, for want of minding the Almanac. Many a one, for the ſake of finery on the back, has gone with a hungry belly, and have ſtarved their families; "Silks and ſattins, ſcarlets and velvets, put out the kitchen fire,"
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:027039_0186_0FD2FB73F9822EE8"/>
as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays. Theſe are not the neceſſaries of life; they can ſcarcely be called the conveniences; and yet only becauſe they look pretty, how many want to have them? By theſe, and other extravagancies, the genteel are reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow of thoſe whom they formerly deſpiſed, but, who through induſtry and frugality, have maintained their ſtanding; in which caſe it appears plainly, that "A ploughman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays. Perhaps they have had a ſmall eſtate left them, which they knew not the getting of; they think, "It is day, and will never be night;" that a little to be ſpent out of ſo much is not worth minding; but "Always tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the meal-tub, and never putting in, ſoon comes to the bottom," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays; and then, "When the well is dry, they know the worth of water." But this they might have known before, if they had taken his advice: If you would know the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of money, go and try to borrow ſome; for "He that goes a borrowing goes a ſorrowing," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays; and, indeed, ſo does he that lends to ſuch people, when he does not get it again, <hi>Poor D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>k</hi> farther adviſes and ſays,
<q>
                  <l>Fond pride of dreſs is ſure a very curſe;</l>
                  <l>Ere fancy you conſult, conſult your purſe.</l>
               </q>
And again, "Pride is as loud a beggar as Want, and a great deal more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cy." When you have bought one fine thing, you muſt buy ten more, that your appearance be all of a-piece; but <hi>Poor Dick</hi> ſays, "It is eaſier to ſuppreſs the firſt deſire, than to ſatisfy all that follow it:" And it is as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich, as for the frog to ſwell, in order to equal the ox.
<q>
                  <l>Veſſels large may venture more,</l>
                  <l>But little boats ſhould keep near ſhore.</l>
               </q>
It is, however, a folly ſoon puniſhed: for, as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays, "Pride that dines on vanity, ſups on contempt: Pride breakfaſted with plenty, dined with poverty, and ſupped with infamy." And, after all, of what uſe is this pride of appearance, for which ſo much is riſked, ſo much is ſuffered? It cannot promote health, nor caſe pain; it makes no increaſe of merit in a perſon; it creates envy; it haſtens misfortune.</p>
            <p>'But what madneſs muſt it be to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bt</hi> for theſe ſuperſtui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? We are offered, by the terms of this ſale, ſix months credit; and that, perhaps, has induced ſome of us to attend it, becauſe we cannot ſpare the ready money, and hope now to be fine without it. But ah! think what you do when you run in debt; you give to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power over your liberty. If you cannot pay at the time, you will be aſhamed to ſee your creditor; you will be in fear when you ſpeak to him; you will make poor, pitiful, ſneaking, excuſes; and, by degrees, come to loſe your veracity, and ſink into baſe downright lying; for "The <hi>ſecond</hi> vice is lying, the <hi>firſt</hi> is running in debt," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays; and again to the ſame purpoſe, "Lying rides upon Debt's back;" whereas a free-born American ought not to be aſhamed to ſee or to ſpeak to any man living. But poverty often deprives a man of all ſpirit and virtue. "It is hard for an empty bag to ſtand upright." What would you think of that prince, or of that government, who ſhould iſſue an edict for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding you to dreſs like a gentleman or gentlewoman, on pain of
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:027039_0187_0FD2FB7576CF5B58"/>
impriſonment or ſervitude?—Would you not ſay you were free, have a right to dreſs as you pleaſe, and that ſuch an edict would be a breach of your privileges, and ſuch a government tyrannical? And yet you are about to put yourſelf under that tyranny, when you run in debt for ſuch dreſs! Your creditor has authority, at his pleaſure, to deprive you of your liberty, by confining you in goal for life, or by ſelling you for a ſervant, if you ſhould not be able to pay him. When you have got your bargain, you may, perhaps, think little of payment; but as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays, "Creditors have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter memories than debtors; creditors are a ſuperſtitious ſect, great obſervers of ſet days and times." The day comes round before you are aware, and the demand is made before you are prepared to ſatisfy it: or, if you bear your debt in mind, the term which at firſt ſeemed ſo long, will, as it leſſens, appear extremely ſhort. Time will ſeem to have added wings to his heels as well as his ſhoulders. "Thoſe have a ſhort Lent who owe money to be paid at Eaſter." At preſent, perhaps, you may think yourſelves in thriving circumſtances, and that you can bear a little extravagance without injury: but
<q>
                  <l>For age and want ſave while you may,</l>

               </q>
Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but ever, while you live, expence is conſtant and certain; and, "It is eaſier to build two o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>'Tis the ſtone that will turn all your lead into gold.</l>
               </q>
And when you have got the philoſopher's ſtone, ſure you will no longer complain of bad times or the difficulty of paying taxes.</p>
            <p>IV. 'This doctrine, my friends, is reaſon and wiſdom: but, after all, do not depend too much upon your own induſtry, and frugality, and prudence, though excellent things; for they may all be blaſted without the bleſſing of Heaven; and, therefore, aſk that bleſſing humbly, and be not uncharitable to thoſe that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeem to want it, but comfort and help them. Remember Job ſuffered, and was afterwards proſperous.</p>
            <p>'And now, to conclude, "Experience keeps a dear ſchool, but fools will learn in no other," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays, and ſcarce in that; for, it is true, "We may give advice, but we cannot give conduct;" however, remember this, "They that will not be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled, cannot be helped;" and further, that, "If you will not hear Reaſon, ſhe will ſurely rap your knuckles," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays.'</p>

            <p>The laws of ſelf-defence undoubtedly juſtify us in deſtroying thoſe animals who would deſtroy us, who injure our properties, or annoy our perſons; but not even theſe, whenever their ſituation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitates them from hurting us.

            <p>God has been pleaſed to create numberleſs animals intended for our ſuſtenance; and that they are ſo intended, the agreeable flavour of their fleſh to our palates, and the wholeſome nutriment which it adminiſters to our ſtomachs, are ſufficient proofs: theſe as they are formed for our uſe, propagated by our culture, and fed by our care, we have certainly a right to deprive of life, becauſe it is give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For this, Providence has wiſely and benevolently provided, by forming them in ſuch a manner, that their fleſh becomes rancid and unpalatable by a painful and lingering death; and has thus compelled us to be merciful without compaſſion, and cautious of their ſuffering, for the ſake of our ourſelves: but, if there are any whoſe taſtes are ſo vitiated, and whoſe hearts are ſo hardened, as to delight in ſuch inhuman ſacrifices, and to partake of them without remorſe, they ſhould be looked upon as demons in human ſhapes, and expect a retaliation of thoſe tortures which they have inflicted on the innocent, for the gratification of their own depraved and unnatural appetites.</p>
            <p>So violent are the paſſions of anger and revenge in the human breaſt, that it is not wonderful that men ſhould perſecute their real or imaginary enemies with cruelty and malevolence; but that there ſhould exiſt in nature a being who can receive pleaſure from giving pain, would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

this unaccountable diſpoſition is in ſome manner inherent in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man; for as he cannot be taught by example<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor led to it by temptation, or prompted to it by intereſt, it muſt be derived from his native conſtitution; and is a remarkable confirmation of what revelation ſo frequently inculcates—that he brings into the world with him an original depravity, the effects of a fallen and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſtate; in proof of which we need only obſerve, that the nearer he approaches to a ſtate of nature, the more predominent this diſpoſition appears, and the more violently it operates. We ſee children laughing at the miſeries which they inflict on every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate animal which comes within their power; all ſavages are ingenious in contriving and happy in executing, the moſt exquiſite tortures; and the common people of all countries are delighted with nothing ſo much as bull-beatings, prize-fightings, executions, and all ſpectacles of cruelty and horror. Though civilization may in ſome degree abate this native ferocity, it can never quite extirpate it: the moſt poliſhed are not aſhamed to be pleaſed with ſcenes of little leſs barbarity, and, to the diſgrace of human nature, to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify them with the name of ſports. They arm cocks with artificial weapons, which nature had kindly denied to their malevolence, and, with ſhouts of applauſe and triumph, ſee them plunge them into each other's hearts: they view with delight the trembling deer and defenceleſs hare, flying for hours in the utmoſt agonies of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and deſpair, and at laſt, ſinking under fatigue, devoured by their mercileſs purſuers: they ſee with joy the beautiful pheaſant and harmleſs partridge drop from their flight, weltering in their blood, or perhaps periſhing with wounds and hunger, under the cover of ſome friendly thicket to which they have in vain retreated for ſafety: they triumph over the unſuſpecting fiſh whom they have decoyed by an inſidious pretence of feeding, and drag him from his native element by a hook fixed to and tearing out his entrails: and, to add to all this, they ſpare neither labour nor expence to preſerve and propagate theſe innocent animals, for no other end but to multiply the objects of their perſecution.</p>

I would accept them. So would I, replied Alexander, were I Parmenio. Nobility is to be conſidered only as an imaginary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, unleſs accompanied with the practice of thoſe generous virtues by which it ought to be obtained. Titles of honour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon ſuch as have no perſonal merit, are at beſt but the royal ſtamp ſet upon baſe metal. Though an honourable title may be conveyed to poſterity, yet the ennobling qualities which are the ſoul of greatneſs, are a ſort of incommunicable perfections, and cannot be transferred. If a man could bequeath his virtues by will, and ſettle his ſenſe and learning upon his heirs, as certainly as he can his lands, a noble deſcent would then indeed be a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able privilege. Truth is always conſiſtent with itſelf, and needs nothing to help it out. It is always near at hand, and ſits upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware: whereas a lie is troubleſome, and ſets a man's invention upon the rack; and one trick needs a great many more to make it good. The pleaſure which affects the human mind with the moſt lively and tranſporting touches, is the ſenſe that we act in the eye of infinite wiſdom, power, and goodneſs, that will crown our virtuous endeavours here with a happineſs hereafter, large as our deſires, and laſting as our immortal ſouls: without this the higheſt ſtate of life is inſipid, and with it the loweſt is a paradiſe. Honourable age is not that which ſtandeth in length of time, nor that is meaſured by number of years; but wiſdom is the grey hair unto man, and unſpotted life is old age. Wickedneſs, condemned by her own witneſs, is very timorous, and being preſſed with conſcience, always forecaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth evil things; for fear is nothing elſe but a betraying of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours which reaſon offereth. A wiſe man will fear in every thing. He that contemneth ſmall things, ſhall fall by little and little. A rich man beginning to fall, is held up of his friends: but a poor man being down, is thruſt away by his friends: when a rich man is fallen he hath many helpers; he ſpeaketh things not to be ſpoken, and yet men juſtify him; the poor man ſlipt, and they rebuke him; he ſpoke wiſely, and could have no place. When a rich man ſpeaketh, every man holdeth his tongue, and, look, what he faith they extol it to the clouds; but if a poor man ſpeaks, they ſay, What fellow is this? Many have fallen by the edge of the ſword, but not ſo many as have fallen by the tongue. Well is he that is defended from it, and hath not paſſed through the venom thereof; who hath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor been bound is her bounds; for the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bands thereof are bands of braſs; the death thereof is an evil death. My ſon, blemiſh not thy good deeds, neither uſe uncomfortable words, when thou giveſt any thing. Shall not the dew aſſuage the heat? ſo is a word better than a gift. Lo, is not a word better than a gift? but both are with a gracious man. Blame not, before thou haſt examined the truth; underſtand firſt, and then rebuke. If thou wouldeſt get a friend, prove him firſt, and be not haſty to credit him; for ſome men are friends for their own occaſions, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble. Forſake not an old friend, for the new is not comparable to him: a new friend is as new wine; when it is old, thou ſhalt drink it with pleaſure. A friend cannot be known in proſperity, and an enemy cannot be hidden in
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:027039_0195_0FD2FB7E6F7BCAD0"/>
adverſity. Admoniſh thy friend; it may be he hath not done it; and if he have, that he do it no more. Admoniſh thy friend; it may be he hath not ſaid it; or if he have, that he ſpeak it not again. Admoniſh a friend; for many times it is a ſlander; and believe not every tale. There is one that ſlippeth in his ſpeech, but not from his heart; and who is he that hath not offended with his tongue? Whoſo diſcovereth ſecrets loſeth his credit and ſhall never find a friend to his mind. Honour thy father with thy whole heart, and forget not the ſorrows of thy mother! how canſt thou recompence them the things that they have done for thee? There is nothing ſo much worth as a mind well inſtructed. The lips of talkers will be telling ſuch things as pertain not unto them; but the words of ſuch as have underſtanding are weighed in the balance. The heart of fools is in their mouth, but the tongue of the wiſe is in their heart. To labour, and to be content with that a man hath, is a ſweet life. Be at peace with many; nevertheleſs, have but one counſellor of a thouſand. Be not confident in a plain way. Let reaſon go before every enterprize, and counſel before every action. The latter part of a wiſe man's life is taken up in curing the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, prejudices, and falſe opinions he had contracted in the former. Cenſure is the tax a man pays to the public for being eminent. Very few men, properly ſpeaking, live at preſent, but are providing to live another time. Party is the madneſs of many, for the gain of a few. To endeavour to work upon the vulgar with fine ſenſe, is like attempting to hew blocks of marble with a razor. Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition is the ſpleen of the ſoul. He who tells a lie, is not ſenſible how great a taſk he undertakes; for he muſt be forced to invent twenty more to maintain that one. Some people will never learn any thing, for this reaſon, becauſe they underſtand every thing too ſoon. There is nothing wanting, to make all rational and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted people in the world of one religion, but that they ſhould talk together every day. Men are grateful, in the ſame degree that they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

Oeconomy is no diſgrace; it is better living on a little, than outliving a great deal. Next to the ſatisfaction I receive in the proſperity of an honeſt man, I am beſt pleaſed with the confuſion of a raſcal. What is often termed ſhyneſs, is nothing more than refined ſenſe, and an indifference to common obſervations. The higher character a perſon ſupports, the more he ſhould regard his minuteſt actions. Every perſon inſenſibly fixes upon ſome degree of refinement in his diſcourſe, ſome meaſure of thought which he thinks worth exhibiting. It is wiſe to fix this pretty high, although it occaſions one to talk the leſs. To endeavour all one's days to fortify our minds with learning and philoſophy, is to ſpend ſo much in armour, that one has nothing left to defend. Deference often ſhrinks and withers as much upon the approach of intimacy, as the ſenſitive plant does upon the touch of one's finger. Men are ſometimes accuſed of pride, merely becauſe their accuſers would be proud themſelves if they were in their places. People frequently uſe this expreſſion, I am inclined to think ſo and ſo, not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are then ſpeaking the moſt literal of all truths.

under it, by the prejudice it affords every worthy perſon in their favour. The difference there is betwixt honour and honeſty ſeems to be chiefly in the motive. The honeſt man does that from duty, which the man of honour does for the ſake of character. A liar begins with making falſehood appear like truth, and ends with making truth itſelf appear like falſehood. Virtue ſhould be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a part of taſte; and we ſhould as much avoid deceit, or ſiniſter meanings in diſcourſe, as we would puns, bad language, or falſe grammar. Deference is the moſt complicate, the moſt indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and the moſt elegant of all compliments. He that lies in bed all a ſummer's morning, loſes the chief pleaſure of the day; he that gives up his youth to indolence, undergoes a loſs of the ſame kind. Shining characters are not always the moſt agreeable ones: the mild radiance of an emerald is by no means leſs pleaſing than the glare of the ruby. To be at once a rake, and to glory in the character, diſcovers at the ſame time a bad diſpoſition and a bad taſte. How is it poſſible to expect that mankind will take advice, when they will not ſo much as take warning? Although men are accuſed for not knowing their own weakneſs, yet, perhaps, as few know their own ſtrength. It is in men as in ſoils, where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is a vein of gold which the owner knows not of. Fine ſenſe, and exalted ſenſe, are not half ſo valuable as common ſenſe. There are forty m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n of wit for one man of ſenſe; and he that will carry nothing about him but gold, will be every day at a loſs for want of ready change. Learning is like mercury, one of the moſt powerful and excellent things in the world in ſkilful hands; in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilful, moſt miſchievous. A man ſhould never be aſhamed to own he has been in the wrong; which is but ſaying in other words, that he is wiſer to-day than he was yeſterday. Wherever I find a great deal of gratitude in a poor man, I take it for granted there would be as much generoſity if he were a rich man. Flowers of rhetoric in ſermons or ſerious diſcourſes, are like the blue and red flowers in corn, pleaſing to thoſe who come only for amuſement, but prejudicial to him who would reap the profit. It often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that thoſe are the beſt people, whoſe characters have been muſt injured by ſlanderers: as we uſually find that to be the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fruit which the birds have been pecking at. The eye of a critic is often like a microſcope, made ſo very fine and nice, that it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the atoms, grains, and minuteſt particles, without ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the whole, comparing the parts, or ſeeing all at once the harmony. Men's zeal for religion is much of the ſame kind as that which they ſhow for a foot-ball; whenever it is conteſted for, every one is ready, to venture their lives and limbs in the diſpute: but when that is once at an end, it is no more thought on, but ſleeps in oblivion, buried in rubbiſh, which no one thinks it worth his pains to rake into, much leſs to remove. Honour is but a fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious kind of honeſty; a mean, but a neceſſary ſubſtitute for it, in ſocieties that have none; it is a ſort of paper-credit, with which men are obliged to trade who are deficient in the ſterling caſh of true morality and religion.

What a piece of work is man! how noble in reaſon! how infinite in faculties! inform and mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how expreſs and admirable! in action, how like an angel! in apprehenſion, how like a God! If to do were as eaſy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes palaces. He is a good divine that follows his own inſtructions: I can eaſier teach twenty what were good to be done, than to be one of the twenty to follow my own teaching. Men's evil manners live in braſs; their virtues we write in water.

Keep company with good men, and you'll increaſe their number. He is a good man who is good for himſelf, but he is good indeed who is ſo for others too. When you meet with a virtuous man, draw his picture. He who keeps good men company may very well bear their charges. He begins to grow bad who takes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a good man.

He would be ill ſerved, let him keep good ſtore of ſervants. To do good ſtill make no delay; for life and time ſlide faſt away. A little time will ſerve to do ill. He who would have trouble in this life, let him get either a ſhip or a wife. He who will take no pains, will never build a houſe three ſtories high. The beſt of the game is, to do one's buſineſs, and talk lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of it. The Italian is wiſe before he undertakes a thing, the German while he is doing it, and the Frenchman when it is over. In proſperity we need moderation, in adverſity patience. Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous men ſacrifice not, i.e. they forget God. Great proſperity and modeſty ſeldom go together. Women, wine, and horſes, are ware, men are often deceived in. Give your friend a fig, and your enemy a peach. He who hath not children does not know what love means. He who ſpins hath one ſhirt, he who ſpins not hath two. He who conſiders the end, reſtrains all evil inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He who hath the longeſt ſword is always thought to be in the right. There lies no appeal from the deciſions of fortune. Lucky men need no counſel.

               </gap>. Idleneſs is the mother of vice. The ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother to all virtues. He who is employed is tempted by one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; he who is idle, by an hundred. An idle man is a bolſter for the devil. Idleneſs buries a man alive. He that makes a good war hath a good peace. He who troubles not himſelf with other men's buſineſs, gets peace and eaſe thereby. Where peace is, there God is or dwells. The world without peace is the ſoldier's pay. Arms carry peace along with them. A little in peace and quiet is my heart's wiſh. He bears with others, and ſaith nothing, who would live in peace. One father is ſufficient to govern an hundred children, and an hundred children are not ſufficient to govern one father. The maſter is the eye of the houſe. The firſt ſervice a bad child doth to his father, is to make him a fool; the next is, to make him mad. A rich country and a bad road. A good law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer is a bad neighbour. He who pays well, is maſter of every body's purſe. Another man's bread coſts very dear. Have you bread and wine? ſing and be merry. If there is but little bread, keep it in your hand; if but little wine, drink often; if but a little bed, go to bed early, and clap yourſelf down in the middle. 'Tis good keeping his clothes who goes to ſwim. A man's own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is never in the wrong. He who ſpeaks little, needs but half ſo much brains as a talkative man. He who knows moſt, commonly ſpeaks leaſt. Few men take his advice who talks a great deal. He that is going to ſpeak ill of another, let him conſider himſelf well; and he will hold his peace. Eating little and ſpeaking little, can never do a man hurt. A civil anſwer to a rude ſpeech coſts not much, and is worth a great deal. Speaking without thinking is ſhooting without taking aim. He doth not loſe his labour who counts every word he ſpeaks. One mild word quenches more heat than a whole bucket of water. Yes, good words to put off your rotten apples. Give every man good words, but keep your purſe-ſtrings cloſe. Fine words will not keep a cat from ſtarving. He that hath no patience, hath nothing at all. No patience, no true wiſdom. Make one bargain with other men, but make four with yourſelf. There is no fool to a learned fool. The firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of folly is to think one's ſelf wiſe; the next to tell others ſo: the third to deſpiſe all counſel. If wiſe men play the fool, they do it with a vengeance. One fool in one houſe is enough in all conſcience. He is not a thorough wiſe man who cannnot play the fool on a juſt occaſion. A wiſe man doth that at the firſt which a fool muſt do at the laſt. Men's years and their faults are always more than they are willing to own. Mens' ſins and their debts, are more than they take them to be. Puniſhment, tho' lame, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the ſinner at the laſt He conſiders ill, that conſiders not on both ſides. Think much and often, ſpeak little and write leſs. Conſider well, who you are, what you do; whence you came,
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:027039_0202_0FD2FB8AA39AC2E8"/>
and whither you are to go. Keep your thoughts to yourſelf, let your mien be free and open. Drink wine with pears, and water after figs. When the pear is ripe, it muſt fall of courſe. He that parts with what he ought, loſes nothing by the ſhift. Forgive eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man's faults except your own. To forgive injuries is a noble and God-like revenge. 'Tis a mark of great proficiency, to bear eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the failings of other men. Fond love of a man's ſelf ſhows that he doth not know himſelf. That which a man likes well is half done. He who is uſed to do kindneſſes, always finds them when he ſtands in need. A wiſe lawyer never goes to law him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. A ſluggard takes an hundred ſteps becauſe he would not take one in due time. When you are all agreed upon the time, quoth the curate, I will make it rain. I will do what I can, and a little leſs, that I may hold out the better. Truſt ſome few, but beware of all men. He that knows but little, preſently outs with it. He that doth not mind ſmall things will never get a great deal. John Do-little was the ſon of Good-wife Spin-little. To know how to be content with a little, is not a morſel for a fool's mouth. That is never to be called little, which a man thinks to be enough. Of two cowards, he hath the better who firſt finds the other out. The worſt pig often gets the beſt pear.

Poor folks have neither any kindred nor any friends. Good preachers give their hearers fruit, not flowers. Woe to thoſe preachers who liſten not to themſelves. He who quakes for cold, either wants money to buy him clothes, or wit to put them on. Poverty is a good hated by all men. He that would have a thing done quickly and well, muſt do it himſelf. He who knows moſt is the leaſt preſuming or confident. 'Tis more noble to make your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf great, than to be born ſo. The beginning of an amour (or gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry) is fear, the middle ſin, and the end ſorrow or repentance. The beginning only of a thing is hard, and coſts dear. A fair promiſe catches the fool. He who is bound for another goes in at the wide end of the horn, and muſt come out at the narrow if he can. Promiſing is not with the deſign to give, but to pleaſe fools. Give no great credit to a great promiſer. Proſperity is the worſt enemy men uſually have. Proverbs bear age, and he who would do well may view himſelf in them as in a looking-glaſs. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is the child of experience. He that makes no reckoning of a farthing, will not be worth one half-penny. Avoid carefully the firſt ill or miſchief, for that will breed an hundred more. Reaſon governs the wiſe man, and a cudgel the fool. Suffering is the mother of fools, reaſon of wiſe men. If you would be as happy as any king, conſider not the few that are before, but the many that come behind you. Our religion and our language we ſuck in with our milk. Love, knavery, and neceſſity, make men good orators. There is no fence againſt what comes from heaven. Good huſbandry is the firſt ſtep towards riches. A flock once gotten, wealth grows up of its own accord. Wealth hides many a great fault. Good ware was never dear, nor a miſs ever worth the money ſhe coſts. The fool's eſtate is the firſt ſpent.
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:027039_0203_0FD2FB8D4BC5AC00"/>
Wealth is his that enjoys it, and the world is his who ſcrambles for it. A father with very great wealth, and a ſon with no virtue at all. Little wealth, and little care and trouble. The Roman conquers by ſitting ſtill at home. Between robbing and reſtoring, men commonly get thirty in the hundred. He is learned enough who knows how to live well. The more a man knows, the leſs credulous he is. There is no harm in deſiring to be thought wiſe by others, but a great deal in a man's thinking himſelf to be ſo. Bare wages never made a ſervant rich. Loſing much breeds bad blood. Health without any money is half ſickneſs. When a man is tumbling down, every ſaint lends a hand. He that unſeaſonab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plays the wiſe man is a fool. He that pretends too much to wiſdom is counted a fool. A wiſe man never ſets his heart upon what he cannot have. A lewd batchelor makes a jealous huſband. That crown is well ſpent which ſaves you ten. Love can do much, but ſcorn or diſdain can do more. If you would have a thing kept ſecret, never tell it to any one; and if you would not have a thing known of you, never do it. Whatever you are going to do or ſay, think well firſt what may be the conſequence of it. They are always ſelling wit to others who have leaſt of it for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. He that gains time gains a great point. Every ditch is full of after-wit. A little wit will ſerve a fortunate man. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a court is like fair weather in winter. Neither take for a ſervant him whom you muſt entreat, nor a kinſman, nor a friend, if you would have a good one! A man never loſes by doing good offices to others. He that would be well ſerved, muſt know when to change his ſervants. Ignorance and proſperity make men bold and confident. He who employs <hi>one</hi> ſervant in any buſineſs, hath him <hi>all</hi> there; who employs TWO, hath <hi>half</hi> a ſervant; who THREE <hi>hath never a one.</hi> Either a civil grant, or civil denial. When you have any buſineſs with a man give him title enough. The covetous man is the bailiff, not the maſter, of his own eſtate. Trouble not your head about the weather, or the government. Like with like, looks well, and laſts long. All worldly joy is but a ſhort-lived dream. That is a curſed pleaſure that makes a man a fool. The ſoldier is well paid for doing miſchief. A ſoldier, fire, and water, ſoon make room for themſelves. A conſidering careful man is half a conjurer. A man would not be alone even in paradiſe. One nap finds out, or draws on another.

The table, a ſecret thief, ſends its maſter to the hoſpital. Begin your web, and God will ſupply you with thread. Too much fear is an enemy to good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.

               </gap> as he needs, a knave hath not half enough. A wiſe man changes his mind when there is reaſon for it. From hearing, comes wiſdom; and from ſpeaking, repentance. Old age is an evil deſired by all men, and youth an advantage which no young man underſtands. He that would have a good revenge, let him leave it to God. Would you be revenged on your enemy? live as you ought, and you have done it to purpoſe. He that will revenge every affront, either falls from a good poſt, or never gets up to it. Truth is an inhabitant of heaven. That which ſeems probable is the greateſt enemy to the truth. A thouſand probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities cannot make one truth. 'Tis no great pains to ſpeak the truth. That is moſt true which we leaſt care to hear. Truth hath the plague in his houſe (i. e. is carefully avoided). A wiſe man will not tell ſuch a truth as every one will take for a lie. Long voyages occaſion great lies. The world makes men drunk as much as wine doth. Wine and youth are fire upon fire. Enrich your younger age with virtuous lore. 'Tis virtue's picture which we find in books. Virtue muſt be our trade and ſtudy, not our chance. We ſhall have a houſe without a fault in the next world. Tell me what life you lead, and I will tell you how you ſhall die. He is in a low form who never thinks beyond this ſhort life. Vices are learned without a teacher.

'Tis truth which makes the man angry. He who tells all the truth he knows muſt lie in the ſtreets. Oil and truth will get uppermoſt at the laſt.

All is good that God ſends us. He that hath children, all his morſels are nor his own. Thought is a nimble footman. Many know every thing elſe, but nothing at all of themſelves. We ought not to give the fine flour to the devil, and the bran to God. Six feet of earth make all men of one ſize. He that is born of a hen muſt ſcrape for his living. Afflictions draw men up towards heaven. That which does us good is never too late. Since my houſe muſt be burnt I will warm myſelf at it. Tell every body your buſineſs and the devil will do it for you. A man was hanged for ſaying what was true. Do not all that you can do; ſpend not all that you have; believe not all that you hear; and tell not all that you know. A man ſhould learn to ſail with all winds. He is the man indeed who can govern himſelf as he ought. He that would live long, muſt ſometimes change his courſe of life. When children are little they make their parents heads ake; and when they are grown up, they make their hearts ake. To preach well, you muſt firſt practiſe what you teach others. Uſe or practice of a thing is the beſt maſter. A man that hath learning is worth two who have it not. A fool knows his own buſineſs better than a wiſe man doth anothers. He who underſtands moſt is other men's maſter. Have a care of—Had I known this before.—Command your ſervant, and do it yourſelf, and you will have leſs trouble. You may know the maſter by his man. He who ſerves the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic hath but a ſcurvy maſter; He that would have good offices done to him, muſt do them to others: 'Tis the only true liberty to ſerve our good God. The common ſoldier's blood makes the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral a great man. An huge great houſe is an huge great trouble. Never adviſe a man to go to the wars, nor to marry. Go to the war with as many as you can, and with as few to counſel. 'Tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter keeping out of a quarrel, than to make it up afterwards. Great birth is a very poor diſh on the table. Neither buy any thing of, or ſell to, your friend. Sickneſs or diſeaſes are viſits from God. Sickneſs is a perſonal citation before our Judge. Beauty and folly do not often part company. Beauty beats a call upon a dram. Teeth placed before the tongue give good advice. A great many pair of ſhoes are worn out before men do all they ſay. A great many words will not fill a purſe. Make a ſlow anſwer to an haſty queſtion. Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe is the ground of hatred. Speaking ill of one another is the fifth element men are made up of. When a man ſpeaks you fair, look to your purſe. Play not with a man till you hurt him, nor jeſt till you ſhame him. Eating more than you ſhould at once, makes you eat leſs after wards. He makes his grief light who thinks it ſo. He thinks but ill who does not think twice of a thing. He who goes about a thing himſelf, hath a mind to have it done; who ſends another, cares not whether it be done or no. There is no diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

He who is bad to his relations is worſe to himſelf, 'Tis good to know our friend's failings, but not to publiſh them. A man may ſee his own faults in thoſe which others do. 'Tis the virtue of ſaints to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways going on from one kind and degree of virtue to another. A man may talk like a wiſe man, and yet act like a fool. Every one thinks he hath more than his ſhare of brains. The firſt chapter (or point) of fools is to think they are wiſe men. Diſcretion or a true judgment of things, is the parent of all virtue. Chaſtity is the chief and moſt charming beauty. Little conſcience and great diligence make a rich man. Never count four except you have them in your bag. Open your door to a fair day, but make yourſelf ready for a foul one. A little too late is too late ſtill. A good man is ever at home wherever he chance to be. Building is a word that men pay dear for. If you would be healthful, clothe yourſelf warm, and eat ſparingly. Rich men are ſlaves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the mines. Many men's eſtates come in at the doors, and go out at the chimney. Wealth is more dear to men than their blood or life is. Foul dirty water makes the river great. That great ſaint intereſt rules the world alone. Their power and their will are the meaſures princes take of right and wrong. In govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others you muſt do what you can do, not all you would do. A wiſe man will ſtay for a convenient ſeaſon, and will bend a little, rather than be torn up by the roots. Ever buy your wit at other men's charges. You muſt let your phlegm ſubdue your choler, if you would not ſpoil your buſineſs. Take not phyſic when you are well, leſt you die to be better. Do not do evil to get good by it, which never yet happened to any. That pleaſure's much too dear which is bought with any pain. To live poor that a man may die rich, is to be the king of fools, or a fool in grain. Good wine makes a bad head, and a long ſtory. Be as eaſy as you can in this world, provided you take good care to be happy in the next. Live well and be cheerful. A man knows no more to any purpoſe than he practiſes. He that doth moſt at once, doth leaſt. He is a wretch whoſe hopes are below. Thank you, good puſs, ſtarved my cat. No great good comes without looking after it. Gather the roſe; and leave the thorn behind. He who would be rich in one year is hanged at ſix months end. He who hath a mouth will certainly eat. Go early to the market, and as late as ever you can to a battle. The barber learns to ſhave at the beards of fools. He who is lucky (or rich) paſſes for a wiſe man too. He commands enough who is ruled by a wiſe man. He who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals his ſecret makes himſelf a ſlave. Gaming ſhows what metal a man is made of. How can the cat help it if the maid be a fool? Fools grow up apace without any watering. God ſupplies him with more who lays out his eſtate well. The printing preſs is the mother of errors. Let me ſee your man dead, and I will tell you how rich he is. Men live one half of the year with art and deceit, and the other half with deceit and and art. Do yourſelf a kindneſs, ſir. [The beggar's phraſe for give alms.] I was well; would be better; took phyſic, and died. [On a monument.] All galley-wiſe; every man draws towards himſelf. He who hath

Tell me what company you keep, and I will tell you what you do. At a good penny worth pauſe awhile. He who doth his own buſineſs doth not foul his fingers. 'Tis good feaſting at other men's houſes. A wiſe man makes a virtue of what he cannot help. Talk but little, and live as you ſhould do.</p>

            <p>He is a rich man who hath God for his friend. He is the beſt ſcholar who hath learned to live well. A handful of mother wit is worth a buſhel of learning. When all men ſay you are an aſs, 'tis time to bray. Change of weather finds diſcourſe for fools. A pound of care will not pay an ounce of debt. The ſorrow men have for others hangs upon one hair. A wiſe man changes his mind, a fool never will. That day on which you marry you either manor make yourſelf. God comes to ſee, or look upon us, without a bell. You had better leave your enemy ſomething when you die, than live to beg of your friend. That's a wiſe delay which makes the road ſafe. Cure your ſore eyes only with your elbow. Let us thank God, and be content with what we have. The foot of the owner is the beſt manure for his land. He is my friend who grinds at my mill. Enjoy that little you have while the fool is hunting for more. Saying and doing do not dine together. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney cures all diſeaſes. A life ill-ſpent makes a ſad old-age. 'Tis money that makes men lords. We talk, but God doth what he pleaſes. May you have good luck, my ſon, and a little wit will ſerve your turn. Gifts break through ſtone walls. Go not to your doctor for every all, nor to your lawyer for every quarrel, nor to your pitcher for every thirſt. There is no better looking-glaſs than an old true friend. A wall between both beſt preſerves friendſhip. The ſum of all is, to ſerve God well, and to do no ill thing. The creditor always hath a better memory than the debtor. Setting down in writing is a laſting memory. Repentance always coſts very dear. Good-breeding and money make our ſons gentlemen. As you uſe your father, ſo your children will uſe you. There is no evil, but ſome good uſe may be made of it. No price is great enough for good counſel. Examine not the pedigree nor patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a good man. There is no ill thing in Spain but that which can ſpeak. Praiſe the man whoſe bread you eat. God keep me from him whom I truſt, from him whom I truſt not I ſhall keep myſelf. Keep out of an haſty man's way for a while, out of a ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man's all the days of your life. If you love me, John, your deeds would tell me ſo.

Nothing is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable in this world, except as it tends to the next. Smoke, rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the houſe, and a talking wife, make a man run out of doors.

There was never but one man who never did a fault. He who promiſes runs into debt. He who holds his peace gathers ſtones. Leave your ſon a good reputation and an employment. Receive your money before you give a receipt for it, and take a receipt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you pay it. God doth the cure, and the phyſician takes the money for it. Thinking is very far from knowing the truth, Fools make great feaſts, and wife men eat of them. June, July, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, and Carthagena, are the four beſt ports of Spain. A gentle calf ſucks her own mother, and four cows more (between two own brothers, two witneſſes, and a notary). The devil brings a modeſt man to the court. He who will have a mule without any fault, muſt keep none. The wolves cat the poor aſs that hath many owners. Viſit your aunt, but not every day in the year. In an hundred years time, princes are peaſants; and in an hundred and ten, peaſants grow princes. The poor cat is whipped becauſe our dame will not ſpin. Leave your jeſt whilſt you are moſt pleaſed with it. Whither goeſt thou, grief? Where I am uſed to go. Leave a dog and a great talker in the middle of the ſtreet.

He can never enjoy himſelf one day who fears he may die at night. He who hath done ill once, will do it again. No evil happens to us but what may do us good It I have broke my leg, who knows but 'tis beſt for me. The more honour we have, the more we thirſt after it. If you would be pope, you muſt think of nothing elſe. Make the night night, and the day day, and you will be merry and wiſe. He who eats moſt eats leaſt. If you would live in health be old betimes. I will go warm, and let fools laugh on. Chooſe your wife on a Saturday not on a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. Drinking water neither makes a man ſick nor in debt, nor his wiſe a widow. No pottage is good without bacon no ſermon without St. Auguſtin. Have many acquaintance, and but a few friends. A wondrous fair woman is not all her huſband's own. He who marries a widow, will have a dead man's head often thrown in his diſh. Away goes the devil when he finds the door ſhut againſt him. 'Tis great courage to ſuffer, and great wiſdom to bear patiently. Doing what I ought ſecures me againſt all cenſure, I wept when I was born, and every day ſhows why. Experience and wiſdom are the two beſt fortune-tellers. The beſt ſoldier comes from the plough. Wine wears no breeches. The hole in the wall invites the thief. A wiſe man doth not hang his wiſdom on a peg. A man's love and his belief are ſeen by what he does. A covetous man makes a half-penny of a farthing, and a liberal man makes ſix-pence of it. In December keep yourſelf warm and ſleep. He who will revenge every affront, means not to live long. Keep your money, niggard, live miſerably that your heir may ſquander it away. In war, hunting, and love, you have a thouſand ſorrows for every joy or pleaſure. Honour and profit will not keep both in one ſack.

Do not ſay I will never drink of this water, however dirty it is. He who trifles away his time, perceives not death which ſtands upon his ſhoulders.

To heap freſh kindneſſes upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful men, is the wiſeſt, but withal the moſt cruel revenge. The fool's pleaſures coſt him very dear.

No old age is agreeable but that of a wiſe man. A man's wiſdom is no where more ſeen than in his marrying himſelf. Folly and anger are but two names for the ſame thing. Fortune knocks once at leaſt at every one's door. The father's virtue is the beſt inheritance a child can have. No ſenſual pleaſure ever laſted ſo much as for a whole hour. Riches and virtue do not often keep one another company. Ruling one's anger well, is not ſo good as preventing it. The moſt uſeful learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is that which teaches us how to die well. The beſt men come worſe out of company than they went into it.

Keep yourſelf from the anger of a great man, from a tumult of the mob, from fools in a narrow way, from a man that is marked, from a widow that hath been thrice married, from wind that comes in at a hole, and from a reconciled enemy. One ounce of mirth is worth more than ten thouſand weight of melancholy. A contented mind is a great gift of God. He that would cheat the devil muſt riſe early in the morning. Every fool is in love with his own bauble. Every ill man will have an ill time. Keep your ſword between you and the ſtrength of a clown. Be ye laſt to go over a deep river.

Never deceive your phyſician, your confeſſor, nor your lawyer. Make a bridge of ſilver for a flying enemy. Never truſt him whom you have wronged. Seek for good, and be ready for evil. What you can do alone by yourſelf, expect not from another. Idleneſs in youth makes way for a painful and miſerable old age. He who pretends to be every body's particular friend is nobody's. Conſider well before you tie that knot you never can undo. Neither praiſe nor diſpraiſe any before you know them. A prodigal ſon ſucceeds a covetous father.

An ill blow, or an ill word, is all you will get from a fool. He who lies long in bed, his eſtate pays for it. Conſider well of a buſineſs, and diſpatch it quickly. He who hath no children, hath neither kindred nor friends. May I have a diſpute with a wiſe man, if with any. He who hath loſt ſhame is loſt to all virtue. Being in love brings no reputation to any man, but vexation to all. Giving to the poor leſſens no man's ſtore. He who is idle is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wanting ſomewhat. Evil comes to us by ells, and goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by inches. He whoſe houſe is tiled with glaſs muſt not throw ſtones at his neighbours. The man is fire, the woman tow, and the devil comes to blow the coals. He who doth not look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, finds himſelf behind other men. The love of God prevails for ever, all other things come to nothing. He who is to give an account of himſelf and others, muſt know both himſelf and them. A man's love and his faith appear by his works or deeds. In all

contention put a bridle upon your tongue. In a great froſt a nail is worth a horſe. I went a fool to the court, and came back an aſs. Keep money when you are young, that you may have it when you are old. Speak but little, and to the purpoſe, and you will paſs for ſomebody. If you do evil, expect to ſuffer evil. Sell cheap, and you will ſell as much as four others. An ill child is better ſick than well. He who riſes early in the morning hath ſomewhat in his head. The gallows will have its own at laſt. A lie hath no legs. Women, wind, and fortune, are ever changing. Fools and wilful men make the lawyers great. Never ſign a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting till you have read it, nor drink water till you have ſeen it. Neither is any barber dumb, nor any ſongſter very wiſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give to all nor contend with fools. Do no ill, and fear no harm. He doth ſomething who ſets his houſe on fire; he ſcares away the rats and warms himſelf. I fell nothing on truſt till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow. [Written over the ſhop-doors.] The common people pardon no fault in any man. The ſidler of the ſame town never plays well at their feaſt. Either rich, or hanged in the attempt. The feaſt is over, but here is the fool ſtill. To divide as brothers uſe to do: that which is mine is all my own, that which is yours I go halves in. There will be no money got by loſing your time. He will ſoon be a loſt man himſelf who keeps ſuch men company. By courteſies done to the meaneſt men, you get much more than you can loſe. Trouble not yourſelf about news, it will ſoon grow ſtale and you will have it. That which is well ſaid, is ſaid ſoon enough. When the devil goes to his prayers he means to cheat you. When you meet with a fool, pretend buſineſs to get rid of him. Sell him for an aſs at a fair, who talks much and knows little. He who buys and ſells doth not feel what he ſpends. He who ploughs his land, and breeds cattle, ſpins gold. He who will venture nothing muſt never get on horſeback. He who goes far from home for a wife, either means to cheat, or will be cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He who ſows his land, truſts in God. He who leaves the great road for a by-path, thinks to ſave ground, and he loſes it. He who ſerves the public obliges nobody. He who keeps his firſt innocency eſcapes a thouſand ſins. He who abandons his poor kindred, God forſakes him. He who is not handſome at twenty, nor ſtrong at thirty, nor rich at forty, nor wiſe at fifty, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be handſome, ſtrong, rich, nor wiſe. He who reſolves on the ſudden, repents at leiſure. He who riſes late loſes his prayers, and provides not well for his houſe. He who peeps through a hole may ſee what will vex him.

have a mind to do well, and to put it off at the preſent, are much the ſame. Italy to be born in, France to live in, and Spain to die in. He loſes the good of his afflictions who is not the better for them. It is the moſt dangerous vice which looks like virtue. It is great wiſdom to forget all the injuries we may receive. Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity is the thing in the world we ought to truſt leaſt. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence without learning does more good than learning without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. Virtue is the beſt patrimony for children to inherit. It is much more painful to live ill than to live well. An hearty good-will never wants time to ſhow itſelf. To have done well obliges us to do ſo ſtill. He hath a great opinion of himſelf who makes no compariſon with others. He only is rich enough who hath all that he deſires. The beſt way of inſtruction is to practiſe that which we teach others. It is but a little narrow ſoul which earthly things can pleaſe. The reaſon why parents love the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger children beſt, is becauſe they have ſo little hopes that the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will do well. The deareſt child of all is that which is dead. He who is about to marry ſhould conſider how it is with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. There is a much ſhorter cut from virtue to vice, than from vice to virtue. He is the happy man, not whom other men think, but who thinks himſelf to be ſo. Of ſinful pleaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance only remains. He who hath much wants ſtill more, and then more. The leſs a man ſleeps the more he lives. He can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeak well who knows not when to hold his peace. The tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt content is that which no man can deprive you of. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of wiſe and good men inſtructs as well as their preſence. It is wiſdom in a doubtful caſe, rather to take another man's judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than our own. Wealth betrays the beſt reſolved mind into one vice or other. We are uſually the beſt men when we are worſt in health. Learning is wealth to the poor, an honour to the rich, and a ſupport and comfort to old age. Learning procures reſpect to good fortune, and helps out the bad. The maſter makes the houſe to be reſpected, not the houſe the maſter. The ſhort and ſure way to reputation, is to take care to be in truth what we would have others think us to be. A good reputation is a ſecond, or half an eſtate. He is the better man who comes neareſt to the beſt. A wrong judgment of things is the moſt miſchievous thing in the world. The neglect or contempt of riches makes a man more truly great than the poſſeſſion of them. That only is true honour which he gives who deſerves it himſelf. Beauty and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity have always a mortal quarrel between them. Look always upon life, and uſe it as a thing that is lent you. Civil offers are for all men, and good offers for our friends. Nothing in the world is ſtronger than a man but his own paſſions. When a man comes into troubles, money is one of his beſt friends. He only is the great learned man who knows enough to make him live well An empty purſe with a new houſe finiſhed makes a man want money ſomewhat too late.</p>

            <p>In every work begin and end with God. The grace of God is worth a fair. He is a fool who cannot be angry; but he is a wiſe man who will not. So much of paſſion, ſo much of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe. It is wit to pick a lock and ſteal a horſe; but it is wiſdom to let them alone. Sorrow is good for nothing but for ſin. Love thy neighbour; yet pull not down thy hedge. Half an acre is good land. Cheer up, man, God is ſtill where he was. Of little meddling comes great eaſe. Do well, and have well. He who periſhes in a needleſs danger, is the devil's martyr. Better ſpare at the brim, than at the bottom. He who ſerves God is the true wiſe man. The haſty man never wants woe. There is a God in the almonry. He who will thrive muſt riſe at five. He who has thriven may ſleep till ſeven. Prayer brings down the firſt bleſſing, and praiſe the ſecond. He plays beſt who wins. He is a proper man who hath proper conditions. Better half a loaf than no bread. Beware of HAD-I-WIST. Froſt and fraud have always ſoul ends. Good words coſt nought. A good word is as ſoon ſaid as a bad one. Little ſaid ſoon amended. Fair words butter no parſnips. That penny is well ſpent that ſaves four time its value to its maſter. Penny in pocket is a good companion. For all your kindred make much of your friends. He who hath money in his purſe, cannot want a head for his ſhoulders. Great cry and little wool, quoth the devil when he ſhear'd his hogs. 'Tis ill gaping before an oven. Where the hedge is loweſt all men go over. When ſorrow is aſleep wake it not. Upſtart's a churl that gathered good. From whence did ſpring this noble blood. Provide for the worſt, the beſt will ſave itſelf. A covetous man, like a dog in a wheel, roaſts meat for others to eat. Speak me fair and think what you will. Serve God in thy calling; 'tis better than always praying. A child may have too much of his mother's bleſſing. He who gives alms makes the very beſt uſe of his money.</p>

Croſſes are ladders that do lead up to Heaven. Honour buys no beef in the market. Care-not would have. When it rains pottage you muſt hold up your diſh. He that would thrive muſt aſk leave of his wife. A wonder laſts but nine days. The ſecond meal makes the glutton; and the ſecond blow, or ſecond ill word, makes the quarrel.

Three may keep counſel, if two be away. He who weddeth ere he be wiſe, ſhall die ere he thrives. He who ſtudies his content, wants it moſt.

A gentleman, a grey-hound, and a ſalt-box, look for at the fire-ſide. The ſon full and tattered, the daughter empty and fine. He who riſeth betimes hath ſomething in his head. Fine dreſſing is a foul houſe ſwept before the doors. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content is a man's worſt evil. He who lives well ſees afar off. Love is not to be found in the market.

Fly the pleaſure that will bite to-morrow. Woe be to the houſe where there is no chiding. The greateſt ſtep is that out of doors. Poverty is the mother of health. Wealth, like rheum, falls on the weakeſt parts. If all fools wore white caps, we ſhould look like a flock of geeſe. Living well is the beſt revenge we can take on our enemies. Fair words make me look to my purſe. The ſhorteſt anſwer is doing the thing. He who would have what he hath not, ſhould do what he doth not. He who hath horns in his boſom, needs not put them on his head. Good and quickly ſeldom meet. God is at the end when we think he is fartheſt off. He who contemplates hath a day without night. Time is the rider that breaks youth. Better ſuffer a great evil than do a little one. Talk much and err much. The perſuaſion of the fortunate ſways the doubtful. True praiſe takes root, and ſpreads.

If the beſt man's faults were written in his forehead, it would make him pull his hat over his eyes. A man may be great by chance; but never wiſe, or good, without taking pains for it. Succeſs makes a fool ſeem wiſe. All worldly joys go leſs, to that one joy of doing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. What fools ſay doth not much trouble wiſe men. Money is a good ſervant, but an ill maſter. Pleaſure gives law to fools, God to the wiſe. He lives indeed who lives not to himſelf alone. Good to begin well, better to end well. There would be no ill language if it were not ill taken. Induſtry is fortune's right-hand, and frugality is her left. We ſhall lie all alike in our graves. When flatterers meet, the devil goes to dinner. It is a ſmall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily that hath neither a thief nor a harlot in it. To give and to keep there is need of wit. A man never ſurfeits of too much honeſty. Honour and eaſe are ſeldom bed-fellows. Thoſe huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands are in heaven whoſe wives do not chide. He can want nothing who hath God for his friend. Young men's knocks old men feel. He who is poor when he is married, ſhall be rich when he is buried. Of all tame beaſts, I hate ſluts. Giving much to the poor, doth increaſe a man's ſtore. That is my good that doth me good. An idle brain is the devil's ſhop. God ſend us ſomewhat of our own, when rich men go to dinner.</p>

            <p>Let your purſe ſtill be your maſter. Young men think old men fools; but old men know that young men are fools. Wit once bought, is worth twice taught. A wiſe head makes a cloſe mouth. All fooliſh fancies are bought much too dear. Women's and children's wiſhes are the aim and happineſs of the more weak men. Ignorance is better than pride with greater knowledge. The charitable man gives out at the door and God puts in at the window. Every man is a fool where he hath not conſidered or thought. He who angers others is not himſelf at eaſe. He dies like a beaſt who hath done no good while he lived. Heaven is not to be had by men's barely wiſhing for it. Patch and long ſit, build and ſoon flit. One hour's ſleep before midnight, is worth two hours ſleep after it. Wranglers never want words. War is Death's feaſt. Idle lazy folks have moſt labour.

Knowledge of God and of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves is the mother of true devotion, and the perfection of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Afflictions are ſent us from God for our good.

cares, but very uncertain comſorts. Giving begets love, lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſually leſſens it. He is the wiſe, who is the honeſt man. Take part with reaſon againſt thy own will or humour. Wit is a fine thing in a wiſe man's hand. Speak not of my debts except you mean to pay them. Words inſtruct, but examples perſuade effectually. He who lives in hopes dies a fool. He who gives wiſely fells to advantage. Years know more than books. All earthly joys are empty bubbles, and make men boys.

Always refuſe the advice which paſſion gives; nor lay nor do that thing which anger prompts you to. Bear and forbear is ſhort and good philoſophy. Set out wiſely at firſt; cuſtom will make every virtue more eaſy and pleaſant to you than any vice can be.

            <head>A FABLE.</head>
            <byline>By the Celebrated LINNOEUS, Tranſlated from the Latin.</byline>
            <p>ONCE upon a time the ſeven wiſe men of Greece were met together at Athens, and it was propoſed that every one of them ſhould mention what he thought the greateſt wonder in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. One of them, of higher conceptions than the reſt, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the opinion of ſome of the aſtronomers about the fixed ſtars, which they believed to be ſo many ſuns, that had each their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets rolling about them, and were ſtored with plants and animals like this earth. Fired with this thought, they agreed to ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Jupiter, that he would at leaſt permit them to take a journey to the moon, and ſtay there three days, in order to ſee the wonders of that place, and give an account of them at their return. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter conſented, and ordered them to aſſemble on a high mountain, where there ſhould be a cloud ready to convey them to the place they deſired to ſee. They picked out ſome choſen companions, who might aſſiſt them in deſcribing and painting the objects they
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:027039_0222_0FD2FBB0A63B1818"/>
ſhould meet with. At length they arrived at the moon, and found a palace there well fitted up for their reception. The next day, being very much fatigued with their journey, they kept quiet at home till noon; and being ſtill faint, they refreſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a moſt delicious entertainment, which they reliſhed ſo well, that it overcame their curioſity. This day they only ſaw through the window that delightful ſpot, adorned with the moſt beautiful flowers, to which the beams of the ſun gave an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon luſtre, and heard the ſinging of moſt melodious birds till evening came on. The next day they aroſe very early in order to begin their obſervations; but ſome very beautiful young ladies of that country coming to make them a viſit, adviſed them firſt to recruit their ſtrength before they expoſed themſelves to the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious taſk they were about to undertake.</p>
            <p>The delicate meats, the rich wines, the beauty of theſe damſels, prevailed over the reſolution of theſe ſtrangers. A fine concert of muſic is introduced, the young ones begin to dance, and all is turned to jollity; ſo that this whole day was ſpent in gallantry, till ſome of the neighbouring inhabitants, growing envious at their mirth, ruſhed in with ſwords. The elder part of the company tried to appeaſe the younger, promiſing the very next day they would bring the rioters to juſtice. This they performed, and the third day the cauſe was heard; and what with accuſations, pleadings, exceptions, and the judgment itſelf, the whole day was taken up, on which the term ſet by Jupiter, expired. On their return to Greece, all the country flocked in upon them to hear the wonders of the moon deſcribed, but all they could tell was, for that was all they knew, that the ground was covered with green, intermixed with flowers, and that the birds ſung among the branches of the trees; but what kind of flowers they ſaw, or what kind of birds they heard, they were totally ignorant. Upon which they were treated every where with contempt.</p>
            <p>If we apply this fable to men of the preſent age, we ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a very juſt ſimilitude. By theſe three days the fable denotes the three ages of man. Firſt, Youth, in which we are too feeble in every reſpect to look into the works of the Creator: all that ſeaſon is given up to idleneſs, luxury, and paſtime. Secondly, Manhood, in which men are employed in ſettling, marrying, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating children, providing fortunes for them, and raiſing a family. Thirdly, Old Age, in which after having made their fortunes, they are overwhelmed with law-ſuits and proceedings relating to their eſtates. Thus it frequently happens that men never conſider to to what end they were deſtined, and why they were brought into the world.</p>
