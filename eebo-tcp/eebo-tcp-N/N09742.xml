            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE AMERICAN VILLAGE, &amp;c.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>WHERE yonder stream divides the fertile plain,</l>
               <l>Made fertile by the labours of the swain;</l>
               <l>And hills and woods high tow'ring o'er the rest,</l>
               <l>Behold a village with fair plenty blest:</l>
               <l>Each year tall harvests crown the happy field;</l>
               <l>Each year the meads their stores of fragrance yield,</l>
               <l>And ev'ry joy and ev'ry bliss is there,</l>
               <l>And healthful labour crowns the flowing year.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>THOUGH <hi>Goldsmith</hi> weeps in melancholy strains,</l>
               <l>Deserted Auburn and forsaken plains,</l>
               <l>And mourns his village with a patriot sigh,</l>
               <l>And in that village sees Britannia die:</l>
               <l>Yet shall this land with rising pomp divine,</l>
               <l>In it's own splendor and Britannia's shine.</l>
               <l>O muse, forget to paint her ancient woes,</l>
               <l>Her Indian battles, or her Gallic foes;</l>
               <l>Resume the pleasures of the rural scene,</l>
               <l>Describe the village rising on the green,</l>
               <l>It's harmless people, born to small command,</l>
               <l>Lost in the bosom of this western land:</l>

So shall my verse run gentle as the floods,</l>
               <l>So answer all ye hills, and echo all ye woods;</l>
               <l>So glide ye streams in hollow channels pent,</l>
               <l>Forever wasting, yet not ever spent.</l>
               <l>Ye clust'ring boughs by hoary thickets bore!</l>
               <l>Ye fields high waving with eternal corn!</l>
               <l>Ye woodland nymphs the tender tale rehearse,</l>
               <l>The fabled authors of immortal verse:</l>
               <l>Ye Dryads fair, attend the scene I love,</l>
               <l>And Heav'n shall centre in yon' blooming grove.</l>
               <l>What tho' thy woods, AMERICA, contain</l>
               <l>The howling forest, and the tiger's den,</l>
               <l>The dang'rous serpent, and the beast of prey,</l>
               <l>Men are more fierce, more terrible than they.</l>
               <l>No monster with it's vile contagious breath,</l>
               <l>No flying scorpion darting instant death;</l>
               <l>No pois'nous adder, burning to enrage,</l>
               <l>Has half the venom or has half the rage.</l>
               <l>What tho' the Turk protests to heav'n his ire,</l>
               <l>With lift up hand amidst his realms of fire;</l>
               <l>And Russia's Empress sends her fleets afar,</l>
               <l>To aid the havock of the burning war:</l>
               <l>Their rage dismays not, and their arms in vain,</l>
               <l>In dreadful fury bathe with blood the plain;</l>
               <l>Their terrors harmless, tho' their story heard,</l>
               <l>How this one conquer'd or was nobly spar'd:</l>

Vain is their rage, to us their anger vain,</l>
               <l>The deep Atlantic raves and roars between.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To yonder village then will I descend,</l>
               <l>There spend my days, and there my ev'nings spend;</l>
               <l>Sweet haunt of peace whose mud' wall'd sides delight,</l>
               <l>The rural mind beyond the city bright:</l>
               <l>Their tops with hazles or with alders wove,</l>
               <l>Remurmur magic to the neighb'ring grove;</l>
               <l>And each one lab'ring in his own employ,</l>
               <l>Comes weary home at night, but comes with joy:</l>
               <l>The soil which lay for many thousand years</l>
               <l>O'er run by woods, by thickets and by bears;</l>
               <l>Now reft of trees, admits the chearful light,</l>
               <l>And leaves long prospects to the piercing sight;</l>
               <l>Where once the lynx nocturnal sallies made,</l>
               <l>And the tall chesnut cast a dreadful shade:</l>
               <l>No more the panther stalks his bloody rounds,</l>
               <l>Nor bird of night her hateful note resounds;</l>
               <l>Nor howling wolves roar to the rising moon,</l>
               <l>As pale arose she o'er yon eastern down.</l>
               <l>Some prune their trees, a larger load to bear</l>
               <l>Of fruits nectarine blooming once a year:</l>
               <l>See groaning waggons to the village come</l>
               <l>Fill'd with the apple, apricot or plumb;</l>
               <l>And heavy beams suspended from a tree,</l>
               <l>To press their juice against the winter's day:</l>

Or see the plough torn through the new made field,</l>
               <l>Ordain'd a harvest, yet unknown to yield.</l>
               <l>The rising barn whose spacious floor receives</l>
               <l>The welcome thousands of the wheaten sheaves,</l>
               <l>And spreads it's arms to take the plenteous store,</l>
               <l>Sufficient for its master and the poor:</l>
               <l>For as Eumoeus us'd his beggar guest</l>
               <l>The great Ulysses in his tatters drest:</l>
               <l>So here fair Charity puts forth her hand,</l>
               <l>And pours her blessings o'er the greatful land:</l>
               <l>No needy wretch the rage of winter fears,</l>
               <l>Secure he sits and spends his aged years,</l>
               <l>With thankful heart to gen'rous souls and kind,</l>

               <l>A LOVELY island once adorn'd the sea,</l>
               <l>Between New-Albion and the Mexic' Bay;</l>
               <l>Whose sandy sides wash'd by the ocean wave,</l>
               <l>Scarce heard a murmur but what the ocean gave:</l>
               <l>Small it's circumference, or high it's coast,</l>
               <l>But shady woods the happy isle could boast;</l>
               <l>On ev'ry side new prospects catch'd the eye,</l>
               <l>There rose blue mountains to the arched sky:</l>
               <l>Here thunder'd ocean in conclusive throws,</l>
               <l>And dash'd the island as it's waters rose:</l>
               <l>Yet peaceful all within, no tumults there,</l>
               <l>But fearless steps of the unhunted hare;</l>

               <l>Or blackbird's note, the harbinger of love.</l>
               <l>So peaceful was this haunt that nature gave,</l>
               <l>Still as the stars, and silent as the grave;</l>
               <l>No loud applause there rais'd the patriot breast,</l>
               <l>No shouting armies their mad joy confest,</l>
               <l>For battles gain'd, or trophies nobly won,</l>
               <l>Or nations conquer'd near the rising sun;</l>
               <l>No clam'rous, crews, or wild nocturnal cheer,</l>
               <l>Or murd' rous russians for no men were here.</l>
               <l>On it's east end a grove of oak was seen,</l>
               <l>And shrubby hazels fill'd the space between;</l>
               <l>Dry alders too, and aspin leaves that shook</l>
               <l>With ev'ry wind, conspir'd to shade a brook,</l>
               <l>Whose gentle stream just bubbling from the ground,</l>
               <l>Was quickly in the falter ocean drown'd.</l>
               <l>Beyond whose fount, the center of the isle,</l>
               <l>Wild plumb trees flourishe'd on the shaded soil.</l>
               <l>In the dark bosom of this sacred wood,</l>
               <l>Had fate but smil'd, some village might have stood</l>
               <l>Secluded from the world, and all it's own,</l>
               <l>Of other lands unknowing, and unknown.</l>
               <l>Here might the hunter have destroy'd his prey,</l>
               <l>Transfix'd the goat before the dawn of day;</l>
               <l>And trudging homeward with his welcome load,</l>

               <l>O had the winds been sensible of grief,</l>

Thus far'd the fire through his long days of pain,</l>
               <l>Or with his offspring rov'd the silent plain;</l>
               <l>'Till years approaching, bow'd his sacred head</l>
               <l>Deep in the dust, and sent him to the dead:</l>

               <l>He grasps the airy bow, and flies across the strand;</l>
               <l>Or with his COLMA shares the fragrant grove,</l>

               <l>Where's neither pleasure nor enjoyment:</l>
               <l>Whoe'er to such a life is ty'd,</l>
               <l>Was born the day he should have dy'd;</l>
               <l>Born in an hour when angry spheres</l>
               <l>Were tearing caps, or pulling ears:</l>

And Saturn slow 'gainst swift Mercurius,</l>
               <l>Was meditating battles furious;</l>
               <l>Or comets with their blazing train,</l>
               <l>Decreed their life, a life of pain.</l>

            <head>Upon a very ANCIENT DUTCH HOUSE on LONG-ISLAND.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>BEHOLD this antique dome by envious time,</l>
               <l>Grown crazy, and in ev'ry part decay'd;</l>
               <l>Full well, alas, it claims my humble rhyme,</l>
               <l>For such lone haunts and contemplation made.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Ah see the hearth, where once the chearful fire!</l>
               <l>Blaz'd high, and warm'd the winter trav'lers toes;</l>
               <l>And see the walls, which once did high aspire,</l>
               <l>Admit the storms, and ev'ry wind that blows.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In yonder corner, now to ruin gone,</l>
               <l>The ancient housewife's curtain'd bed appear'd,</l>
               <l>Where she and her man JOHN did sleep alone,</l>
               <l>Nor nightly robber, nor the screach owl fear'd.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:012397_0028_0F893F750EF423E8"/>
There did they snore full oft' the whole night out,</l>
               <l>Smoking the sable pipe, 'till that did fall,</l>
               <l>Rest from their jaws by Somnus' sleepy rout,</l>
               <l>And on their faces pour'd its scorched gall.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And in the compass of yon' smaller gang,</l>
               <l>The swain BATAVIAN once his courtship made,</l>
               <l>To some DUTCH lass, as thick as she was long;</l>
               <l>"Come then, my angel, come, the shepherd said,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>"And let us for the bridal bed prepare;</l>
               <l>For you alone shall case my future life,</l>
               <l>And you alone shall soften all my care,</l>
               <l>My strong, my hearty, and industrious wife."</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus theyâ€”but eating ruin now hath spread</l>
               <l>Its wings destructive o'er the antique dome;</l>
               <l>The mighty fabrick now is all a shed,</l>
               <l>Scarce fit to be the wand'ring beggar's home.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And none but me it's piteous fate lament,</l>
               <l>None, none but me o'er it's sad ashes mourn,</l>
               <l>Sent by the fates, and by APOLLO sent,</l>
               <l>To shed their latest tears upon it's silent urn.</l>
