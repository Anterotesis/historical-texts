            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE AMERICAN EDITION.</head>
            <p>THE success of "THE BOTANIC GARDEN" has been so great in Europe, and its reputation is so well established in America, that it would betray a culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vanity in the Publishers, were they to attempt, by any thing that they could offer in this place, to recommend the Poem to the further patronage of their fellow-citizens. They may be indulged, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in a few remarks on the advantages of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent edition.</p>
            <p>The London copy, in quarto, sells for <hi>twelve dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> and upwards in America; a price which readers of Poetry, and even students of Nature, in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, can seldom conveniently pay. It is, beside, more adapted for a library than for daily use.</p>
            <p>The Dublin edition, in octavo, which has princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally circulated in the United States, is deficient both in correctness and in many plates, essential to the thorough comprehension of several parts of the work. It is in two separate volumes; and bears a price dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate to its value as a book.</p>
            <p>In the present edition, the Publishers have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to reconcile the two extremes; and to attain
<pb facs="unknown:033600_0004_0FF79D535BC56BB8"/>
convenience and cheapness, without any censurable sacrifice of correctness and elegance. In their edition, the Poem is comprized in a single volume of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious form; the type and paper are superior to those of the Irish, and, perhaps, not inferior to those of the English copies; no plates, but such as are merely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental, and of these only four out of twenty-one plates in all, have been omitted; those which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted are executed in the best manner the state of the arts in this city will admit: and there is reason to believe that few errors are discoverable in the letter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press.</p>
            <p>On the whole, the Publishers venture to believe that they shall be found to have fulfilled every expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which they raised by their proposals; and that they shall have acquitted themselves, in this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, to general satisfaction.</p>

               <l>Fond SCIENCE wept; the uncertain toil she view'd</l>

            <p>THE general design of the following sheets is to inlist Imagination under the banner of Science; and to lead her votaries from the looser analogies, which dress out the imagery of poetry, to the stricter ones, which form the ratiocination of philosophy. While their particular design is to induce the ingenious to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the knowledge of Botany, by introducing them to the vestibule of that delightful science, and recommending to their attention the immortal works of the celebrated Swedish Naturalist, LINNAEUS.</p>
            <p>In the first Poem, or Economy of Vegetation, the physiology of Plants is delivered, and the operation of the Elements, as far as they may be supposed to affect the growth of Vegetables. In the second Poem, or Loves of the Plants, the Sexual System of Linnaeus is explained, with the remarkable properties of many particular plants.</p>

                  <head>APOLOGY.</head>
                  <p>IT may be proper here to apologize for many of the subsequent conjectures on some articles of natural philosophy, as not being supported by accurate investigation or conclusive experiments. Extravagant theories, however, in those parts of philosophy where our knowledge is yet imperfect, are not without their use; as they encourage the execution of laborious experiments, or the investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of ingenious deductions, to confirm or refute them. And, since natural objects are allied to each other by many affinities, every kind of theoretic distribution of them adds to our knowledge by developing some of their analogies.</p>
                  <p>The Rosicrucian doctrine of Gnomes, Sylphs, Nymphs, and Salamanders, was thought to afford a proper machinery for a Botanic poem; as it is probable, that they were originally the names of hieroglyphic figures representing the elements.</p>
                  <p>Many of the important operations of Nature were shadowed or allegorized in the heathen mythology, as the first Cupid spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Egg of Night, the marriage of Cupid and Psyche, the Rape of Proserpine, the Congress of Jupiter and Juno, the Death and Resuscitation of Adonis, &amp;c. many of which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously explained in the works of Bacon, vol. v. p. 47. 4th edit. London, 1778. The Egyptians were possessed of many discoveries in philosophy and chemistry, before the invention of letters; these were then expressed in hieroglyphic paintings of men and animals; which, after the discovery of the alphabet, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed and animated by the poets, and became first the deities of Egypt, and afterwards of Greece and Rome. Allusions to those fables were therefore thought proper ornaments to a philosophical poem, and are occasionally introduced either as represented by the poets, or preserved on the numerous gems and medallions of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</p>

The fluid matter of heat is perhaps the most extensive element in nature; all other bodies are immersed in it, and are preserved in their present state of solidity or fluidity by the attraction of their particles to the matter of heat. Since all known bodies are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractible into less space by depriving them of some portion of their heat, and as there is no part of nature totally deprived of heat, there is reason <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

If more of the matter of heat be applied to them, they recede further from each other, and become fluid; if still more be applied, they take an aërial form, and are termed Gasses by the modern che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists. Thus, when water is heated to a certain degree, it would instantly assume the form of steam, but for the pressure of the atmosphere, which prevents this change from taking place so easily; the same is true of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver, diamonds, and of, perhaps, all other bodies in Nature; they would first become fluid, and then aëriform, by appropriated degrees of heat. On the contrary, this elastic matter of heat, termed Calorique in the new no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menclature of the French Academicians, is liable to become consolidated it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in its combinations with some bodies, as perhaps in nitre, and probably in combustible bodies, as sulphur and charcoal. See note on l. 232 of this Canto. Modern philosophers have not yet been able to decide whether light and heat be different fluids, or modifications of the same fluid, as they have many properties in common.

From having observed the gradual evolution of the young animal or plant from its egg or seed; and afterwards its suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive advances to its more perfect state, or maturity; philosophers of all ages seem to have imagined, that the great world itself had likewise its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, and its gradual progress to maturity: this seems to have given origin to the very ancient and sublime allegory of Eros, or Divine Love, produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world from the egg of Night, as it floated in Chaós. See l. 419 of this Canto.</p>
                           <p>The external crust of the earth, as far as it has been exposed to our view, in mines or mountains, countenances this opinion; since these have evidently, for the most part, had their origin from the shells of fishes, the decomposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vegetables, and the recrements of other animal materials, and must, therefore, have been formed progressively from small beginnings. There are likewise some apparently useless or incomplete appendages to plants and animals, which seem to shew they have gradually undergone changes from their original state; such as the stamens without anthers, and styles without stigmas of several plants, as mentioned in the note on Curcuma, vol. ii. of this work, Such as the halteres, or rudiments of wings of some two-wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed insects; and the paps of male animals; thus swine have sour toes, but two of them are imperfectly formed, and not long enough for use.

                              <hi>Through all his realms.</hi> l. 105. Mr. Herschel has given a very sublime and curious account of the construction of the heavens, with his discovery of some thousand nebulae, or clouds of stars; many of which are much larger collections of stars than all those put together, which are visible to our naked eyes, added to those which form the galaxy, or milky zone which surrounds us. He observes, that in the vicinity of these clusters of stars there are proportionally fewer stars than in other parts of the heavens; and hence he concludes, that they have attracted each other, on the supposition that infinite space was at first equally sprinkled with them; as if it had, at the beginning, been filled with a fluid mass, which had coagulated. Mr. Herschel has further shewn, that the whole sidereal system is gradually mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round some centre, which may be an opake mass of matter. Philos. Trans. V. LXXIV. If all these suns are moving round some great central body, they must have had a projectile force, as well as a centripetal one; and may thence be supposed to have emerged or been projected from the material where they were produced. We can have no idea of a natural power which could project a sun out of Chaos, except by comparing it to the explosions or earthquakes owing to the sudden evolution of aqueous or of other more elastic vapours; of the power of which, under immeasurable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of heat and compression, we are yet ignorant.</p>
                           <p>It may be objected, that if the stars had been projected from a Chaos by explosions, they must have returned again into it from the known laws of gravitation; this, however, would not happen if the whole of Chaos, like grains of gunpowder, was exploded at the same time, and dispersed through infinite space at once, or in quick succession, in every possible direction. The same objection may be stated against the possibility of the planets hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been thrown from the sun by explosions; and the secondary planets from the primary ones, which will be spoken of more at large in the second Canto. But if the planets are supposed to have been projected from their suns, and the secondary from the primary ones, at the beginning of their course, they might be so influenced or diverted by the attractions of the suns, or sun, in their vicinity, as to prevent their tendency to return into the body from which they were projected.</p>
                           <p>If these innumerable and immense suns, thus rising out of Chaos, are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have thrown out their attendant planets by new explosions, as they ascended; and those, their respective satellites, filling, in a moment, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity of space with light and motion, a grander idea cannot be conceived by the mind of man.</p>

                              <hi>Where lighter gases.</hi> l. 123. Mr. Cavendish has shewn, that the gas cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led inflammable air, is at least ten times lighter than common air: Mr. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voisier contends, that it is one of the component parts of water, and is by him called hydrogene. It is supposed to afford their principal nourishment to vegetables, and thence to animals, and is perpetually rising from their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composition; this source of it in hot climates, and in summer months, is so great as to exceed estimation. Now, if this light gas passes through the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere, without combining with it, it must compose another atmosphere over the aërial one, which must expand, when the pressure above it is thus taken away, to inconceivable tenuity.</p>
                           <p>If this supernatural gasseous atmosphere floats upon the aërial one, like ether upon water, what must happen? 1. It will flow from the line, where it will be produced in the greatest quantities, and become much accumulated over the poles of the earth. 2. The common air, or lower stratum of the atmosphere, will be much thinner over the poles than at the line; because, if a glass globe be filled with oil and water, and whirled upon its axis, the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifugal power will carry the heavier fluid to the circumference, and the lighter will, in consequence, be found round the axis. 3. There may be a place at some certain latitude between the poles and the line on each side the equator, where the inflammable supernatant atmosphere may end, owing to the greater centrifugal force of the heavier aërial atmosphere. 4. Between the termination of the aërial and the beginning of the gasseous atmosphere, the airs will occasionally be intermixed, and thus become inflammable by the electric spark. These circumstances will assist in explaining the phenomena of fire-balls, northern lights, and of some variable winds, and long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued rains.</p>
                           <p>Since the above note was first written, Mr. Volta, I am informed, has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the supposition of a supernatant atmosphere of inflammable air, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain some phenomena in meteorology. And Mr. Lavoisier has announced his design to write on this subject. Traitè de Chimie, Tom. 1. I am happy to find these opinions supported by such respectable authority.</p>

The crepuscular atmosphere, or the region where the light of the sun ceases to be refracted to us, is estimated by phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers to be between 40 and 50 miles high, at which time the sun is about 18 degrees below the horizon; and the rarity of the air is supposed to be from 4000 to 10,000 times greater than at the surface of the earth. Cotes's Hydrost. p. 123. The duration of twilight differs in different sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and in different latitudes. In England the shortest twilight is about the beginning of October and of March; in more northern latitudes, where the sun never sinks more than 18 degrees below the horizon, the twilight continues the whole night. The time of its duration may also be occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affected by the varying height of the atmosphere. A number of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations on the duration of twilight in different latitudes might afford consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable information concerning the aërial strata in the higher regions of the atmosphere, and might assist in determining whether an exterior atmosphere of inflammable gas, or Hydrogene, exists over the aërial one.</note>

                              <hi>Confine with folds of air.</hi> l. 176. The air, like all other bad conductors of electricity, is known to be a bad conductor of heat; and thence prevents the heat acquired from the sun's rays by the earth's surface from being so soon dissipated, in the same manner as a blanket, which may be considered as a sponge filled with air, prevents the escape of heat from the person wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in it. This seems to be one cause of the great degree of cold on the tops of mountains, where the rarity of the air is greater, and it therefore becomes a better conductor both of heat and electricity. See note on Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metz, Vol. II. of this work.</p>
                           <p>There is, however, another cause to which the great coldness of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and of the higher regions of the atmosphere, is more immediately to be ascribed, explained by Dr. Darwin in the Philos. Trans. Vol. LXXVIII. who has there proved, by experiments with the air-gun and air-pump, that when any portion of the atmosphere becomes mechanically expanded, it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorbs heat from the bodies in its vicinity. And as the air which creeps along the plains expands itself, by a part of the pressure being taken off, when it ascends the sides of mountains, it, at the same time, attracts heat from the summits of those mountains, or other bodies which happen to be immersed in it, and thus produces cold. Hence he concludes, that the hot air at the bottom of the Andes becomes temperate by its own rarefaction when it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends to the city of Quito; and by its further rarefaction becomes cooled to the freezing point when it ascends to the snowy regions on the summits of those mountains. To this also he attributes the great degree of cold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced by the aëronauts in their balloons; and which produces hail in summer at the height of only two or three miles in the atmosphere.</p>

O'er Eve's pale forms diffuse phosphoric light,
<note place="bottom">
                           <hi>Diffuse phosphoric light.</hi> l. 177. I have often been induced to believe, from observation, that the twilight of the evenings is lighter than that of the mornings at the same distance from noon. Some may ascribe this to the greater height of the atmosphere in the evenings, having been rarefied by the sun during the day; but as its density must at the same time be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, its power of refraction would continue the same. I should rather suppose that it may be owing to the phosphorescent quality (as it is called) of almost all bodies; that is, when they have been exposed to the sun, they continue to emit light for a considerable time afterwards. This is generally believed to arise either from such bodies giving out the light which they had previously absorbed, or to the continuance of a slow combustion which the light they had been previously exposed to had excited.

                              <hi>Beccari's shells.</hi> l. 182. Beccari made many curious experiments on the phosphoric light, as it is called, which becomes visible on bodies brought into a dark room, after having been previously exposed to the sunshine. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, from these experiments, that almost all inflammable bodies posses this quality in a greater or less degree; white paper or linen, thus examined, after having been exposed to the sunshine, is luminous to an extraordinary degree. And if a person, shut up in a dark room, puts one of his hands out into the sun's light for a short time, and then retracts it, he will be able to see that hand distinctly, and not the other. These experiments seem to countenance the idea of light being absorbed, and again emitted from bodies when they are removed into darkness. But Beccari further pretended, that some calcareous compositions, when exposed to red, yellow, or blue lights, through coloured glasses, would, on their being brought into a dark room, emit coloured lights. This mistaken fact of Beccari's, Mr. Wilson decidedly refutes: and, among many other curious experiments, discovered, that if oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-shells were thrown into a common fire, and calcined for about half an hour, and then brought to a person who had previously been some minutes in a dark room, that many of them would exhibit beautiful irises of prisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic colours, from whence, probably, arose Beccari's mistake. Mr. Wilson from hence contends, that these kinds of phosphori do not emit the light they had previously received, but that they are set on fire by the sun's rays, and continue for some time a slow combustion after they are withdrawn from the light. Wilson's Experiments on Phosphori. Dodsley, 1775.</p>
                           <p>The Bolognian stone is a selenite, or gypsum, and has been long celebrated for its phosphorescent quality after having been burnt in a sulphurous fire; and exposed, when cold, to the sun's light. It may be thus well imitated: Calcine oyster-shells half an hour, pulverize them when cold, and add one third part of flowers of sulphur, press them close into a small crucible, and calcine them for an hour or longer, and keep the powder in a phial close stopped. A part of this powder is to be exposed for a minute or two to the sunbeams, and then brought into a dark room. The calcined Bolognian stone becomes a calcareous hepar of sulphur; but the calcined shells, as they contain the animal acid, may also contain some of the phosphorus of Kunkel.</p>

Perhaps such lights have no existence; and the reflection of a star on watery ground may have deceived the travellers, who have been said to be bewildered by them: if the fact was established, it would much contribute to explain the phenomena of northern lights.

                              <hi>The dread Gymnotus.</hi> l. 202. The Gymnotus electricus is a native of the river of Surinam, in South-America; those which were brought over to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland about eight years ago were about three or four feet long, and gave an electric shock (as I experienced) by putting one finger on the back, near its head, and another of the opposite hand into the water near its tail. In their native country they are said to exceed twenty feet in length, and kill any man who approaches them in an hostile manner. It is not only to escape its enemies that this surprizing power of the fish is used, but also to take its prey; which it does by benumbing them, and then devouring them before they have time to recover, or by perfectly killing them; for the quantity of the power seemed to be determined by the will of anger of the animal; as it sometimes struck a fish twice before it was sufficiently benumbed to be easily swallowed.</p>
                           <p>The organs productive of this wonderful accumulation of electric matter have been accurately dissected and described by Mr. J. Hunter. Philos. Trans. Vol. LXV. And are so divided by membranes as to compose a very extensive surface, and are supplied with many pairs of nerves larger than any other nerves of the body: but how so large a quantity is so quickly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated as to produce such amazing effects in a fluid ill adapted for the purpose, is not yet satisfactorily explained. The Torpedo possesses a similar power in a less degree, as was shewn by Mr. Walch, and another fish lately described by Mr. Paterson. Philos. Trans. Vol. LXXVI.</p>
                           <p>In the construction of the Leyden-Phial, (as it is called) which is coated on both sides, it is known, that above one hundred times the quantity of positive electricity can be condensed on every square inch of the coating on one side, than could have been accumulated on the same surface if there had been no opposite coating communicating with the earth; because the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive electricity, or that part of it which caused its expansion, is now drawn off through the glass. It is also well known, that the thinner the glass is (which is thus coated on both sides so as to make a Leyden-Phial, or plate) the more electricity can be condensed on one of its surfaces, till it becomes so thin as to break, and thence discharge itself.</p>
                           <p>Now, it is possible that the quantity of electricity condensible on one side of a coated phial may increase in some high ratio in respect to the thinness of the glass, since the power of attraction is known to decrease as the squares of the distances, to which this circumstance of electricity seems to bear some analogy. Hence, if an animal membrane, as thin as the silk-worm spins its silk, could be so situated as to be charged like the Leyden bottle, without bursting, (as such thin glass would be liable to do,) it would be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to calculate the immense quantity of electric fluid which might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated on its surface. No land animals are yet discovered which possess this power, though the air would have been a much better medium for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing its effects; perhaps the size of the necessary apparatus would have been inconvenient to land animals.</p>

                              <hi>Of devouring Fire.</hi> l. 212. The first and most important discovery of mankind seems to have been that of fire. For many ages, it is probable, fire was esteemed a dangerous enemy, known only by its dreadful devastations; and that many lives must have been lost, and many dangerous burns and wounds must have afflicted those who first dared to subject it to the uses of life. It is said that the tall monkies of Borneo and Sumatra lie down with pleasure round any accidental fire in their woods; and are arrived to that degree of reason, that knowledge of causation, that they thrust into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining fire the half-burnt ends of the branches to prevent its going out.—One of the nobles of the cultivated people of Otaheite, when Captain Cook treated them with tea, catched the boiling water in his hand from the cook of the tea-urn, and bellowed with pain, not conceiving that water could become hot, like red fire.</p>
                           <p>Tools of steel constitute another important discovery in consequence of fire; and contributed, perhaps, principally to give the European nations so great superiority over the American world. By these two agents, fire and tools of steel, mankind became able to cope with the vegetable kingdom, and conquer provinces of forest, which, in uncultivated countries, almost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the growth of other vegetables, and of those animals which are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to our existence. Add to this, that the quantity of our food is also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by the use of fire, for some vegetables become salutary food by means of the heat used in cookery, which are naturally either noxious or difficult of digestion; as potatoes, kidney-beans, onions, cabbages. The cassava, when made into bread, is, perhaps, rendered mild by the heat it undergoes, more than by expressing its superfluous juice. The roots of white bryony and of arum, I am informed, lose much of their acrimony by boiling.</p>

The phenomena of chemical explosions cannot be accounted for without the supposition, that some of the bodies employed contain concentrated or solid heat combined with them, to which the French chemists have given the name of Calorique. When air is expanded in the air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pump, or water evaporated into steam, they drink up or absorb a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of heat; from this analogy, when gun-powder is exploded, it ought to absorb much heat; that is, in popular language, it ought to produce a great quantity of cold. When vital air is united with phlogistic matter in respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which seems to be a slow combustion, its volume is lessened; the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonic acid, and perhaps phosphoric acid, are produced; and heat is given out; which, according to the experiments of Dr. Crawford, would seem to be deposited from the vital air. But as the vital air in nitrous acid is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densed from a light elastic gas to that of a heavy fluid, it must possess less heat than before. And hence a great part of the heat which is given out in firing gun-powder, I should suppose, must reside in the sulphur or charcoal.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Lavoisier has shewn, that vital air, or Oxygene, loses less of its heat when it becomes one of the component parts of nitrous acid, than in any other of its combinations; and is hence capable of giving out a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of heat in the explosion of gun-powder; but as there seems to be great analogy between the matter of heat, or Calorique, and the electric matter; and as the worst conductors of electricity are believed to contain the greatest quantity of that fluid; there is reason to suspect, that the worst conductors of heat may contain the most of that fluid: as sulphur, wax, silk, air, glass, See note on l. 174 of this Canto.</p>

                           <hi>Vitrescent sparks.</hi> l. 229. When flints are struck against other flints they have the property of giving sparks of light; but it seems to be an internal light, perhaps of electric origin, very different from the ignited sparks which are struck from flint and steel. The sparks produced by the collision of steel with flint, appear to be globular particles of iron, which have been fused, and imperfectly scorified or vitrisied. They are kindled by the heat produced by the collision; but their vivid light, and their fusion and vitrification are the effects of a combustion continued in these particles during their passage through the air. This opinion is confirmed by an experiment of Mr. Hawks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee, who found that these sparks could not be produced in the exhausted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.

                              <hi>And close an airy ocean,</hi> l. 242. Gun-powder is plainly described in the works of Roger Bacon, before the year 1267. He describes it in a curious manner, mentioning the sulphur and nitre, but conceals the charcoal in an anagram. The words are, sed tamen salis petrae <hi>lure mope can ubre,</hi> et sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phuris; et sic facies tonitrum, et corruscationem, si scias, artificium. The words lure mope can ubre are an anagram of carbonum pulvere. Biograph. Britan. Vol. I. Bacon de Secretis Operibus, Cap. XI. He adds, that he thinks, by an artifice of this kind, Gideon defeated the Midianites with only three hundred men. Judges, Chap. VII. Chamb. Dict. art. Gun-powder. As Bacon does not claim this as his own invention, it is thought, by many, to have been of much more ancient discovery.</p>
                           <p>The permanently elastic fluid, generated in the firing of gun-powder, is calculated by Mr. Robins to be about 244 if the bulk of the powder be 1. And that the heat generated at the time of the explosion occasions the rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied air, thus produced, to occupy about 1000 times the space of the gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. This pressure may therefore be called equal to 1000 atmospheres, or six tons upon a square inch. As the suddenness of this explosion must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much to its power, it would seem that the chamber of powder, to produce its greatest effect, should be lighted in the centre of it; which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, is not attended to in the manufacture of muskets or pistels.</p>
                           <p>From the cheapness with which a very powerful gun-powder is likely soon to be manufactured from aërated marine acid, or from a new method of forming nitrous acid by means of manganese or other calciform ores, it may probably, in time, be applied to move machinery, and supersede the use of steam.</p>
                           <p>There is a bitter invective in Don Quixote against the inventors of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, as it levels the strong with the weak, the knight cased in steel with the naked shepherd, those who have been trained to the sword with those who are totally unskilful in the use of it; and throws down all the splendid distinctions of mankind. These very reasons ought to have been urged to shew that the discovery of gun-powder as been of public utility, by weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tyranny of the few over the many.</p>

The invention of the steam-engine for raising water by the pressure of the air, in consequence of the condensation of steam, is properly ascribed to Capt. Savery; a plate and description of this machine is given in Harris's Lexicon Technicum, art. Engine. Though the Marquis of Worcester, in his Century of Inventions, printed in the year 1663, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed an engine for raising water by the explosive power of steam long before Savery's, Mr. D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>saguliers affirms, that Savery bought up all he could procure of the books of the Marquis of Worcester, and destroyed them, professing himself then to have discovered the power of steam by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, which seems to have been an unfounded slander. Savery applied it to the raising of water to supply houses and gardens, but could not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the draining of mines by it. Which was afterwards done by Mr. Newcomon and Mr. John Cowley, at Dartmouth, in the year 1712, who added the piston.</p>
                           <p>A few years ago Mr. Watt, of Glasgow, much improved this machine, and with Mr. Boulton, of Birmingham, has applied it to variety of purposes, such as raising water from mines, blowing bellows to fuse the ore, supplying town with water, grinding corn, and many other purposes. There is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe it may in time be applied to the rowing of barges, and the moving of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The benevolence of the great Author of all things is greatly manifest in the sum of his works, as Dr. Balguy has well evinced in his pamphlet on Divine Benevolence asserted, printed for Davis, 1781. Yet, if we may compare the parts of nature with each other, there are some circumstances of her economy which seem to contribute more to the general scale of happiness than others. Thus the nourishment of animal bodies is derived from three sources: 1. The milk given from the mother to the offspring: in this excellent contrivance the mother has pleasure in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording the sustenance to the child, and the child has pleasure in receiving it. 2. Another source of the food of animals includes seeds, or eggs; in these the embryon is in a torpid or insensible state, and there is along with it, laid up for its early nourishment, a store of provision, as the fruit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to some seeds, and the oil and starch belonging to others; when these are consumed by animals, the unfeeling seed, or egg, receives no pain, but the animal receives pleasure which consumes it. Under this article may be included the bodies of animals which die naturally. 3. But the last method of supporting animal bodies by the destruction of other living animals, as lions preying upon lambs, these upon living vegetables, and mankind upon them all, would appear to be a less perfect part of the economy of nature than those before mentioned, as contributing less to the sum of general happiness.</note>

Mr. Boulton has lately constructed at Soho, near Birmingham, a most magnificent apparatus for Coining, which has cost him some thousand pounds; the whole machinery is moved by an improved steam-engine, which rolls the copper for half-pence finer than copper has before been rolled for the purpose of making money;—it works the coupoirs, or screw-presses for cutting out the circular piece, of copper, and coins both the faces and edges of the money, at the same time, with such superior ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, and cheapness of workmanship, as well as with marks of such powerful machinery, as must totally prevent clandestine imitation, and, in consequence, save many lives from the hand of the executioner; a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance worthy the attention of a great minister. If a civic crown was given in Rome for preserving the life of one citizen, Mr. Boulton should be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with garlands of oak!

                              <hi>So mighty Hercules</hi> l. 297. The story of Hercules seems of great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, as appears from the simplicity of his dress and armour, a lion's skin and a club; and from the nature of many of his exploits, the destruction of wild beasts and robbers. This part of the history of Hercules seems to have related to times before the invention of the bow and arrow, or of spinning flax. Other stories of Hercules are perhaps of later date, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be allegorical, as his conquering the river-god Achelous, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cerberus up to day-light; the former might refer to his turning the course of a river, and draining a morass, and the latter to his exposing a part of the superstition of the times. The strangling the lion, and tearing his jaws asunder, are described from a statue in the Museum Florentinum, and from an antique gem; and the grasping Anteus to death in his arms, as he lifts him from the earth, is described from another ancient cameo. The famous pillars of Hercules have been variously explained. Pliny asserts that the natives of Spain and of Africa believed that the mountains of Abyla and Calpè, on each side of the straits of Gibraltar, were the pillars of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules; and that they were reared by the hands of that god, and the sea ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted between them. Plin. Hist. Nat. p. 46. Edit. Manut. Venet. 1609.</p>
                           <p>If the passage between the two continents was opened by an earthquake in ancient times, as this allegorical story would seem to countenance, there must have been an immense current of water at first run into the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean from the Atlantic; since there is at present a strong stream sets always from thence into the Mediterranean. Whatever may be the cause, which now constantly operates, so as to make the surface of the Mediterranean lower than that of the Atlantic, it must have kept it very much lower before a passage for the water through the straits was opened. It is probable, before such an event took place, the coasts and islands of the Mediterranean ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended much further into that sea, and were then, for a great extent of country, destroyed by the floods occasioned by the new rise of water, and have since remained beneath the sea. Might not this give rise to the flood of Deucalion? See note Cassia, Vol. II of this work.</p>

The theory of the accumulation of the electric fluid, by means of the glass globe and cushion, is difficult to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.

Some philosophers have endeavoured to account for this phenomenon, by supposing the existence of two electric fluids, which may be called the vitreous and resinous ones, instead of the plus and minus of the same other. But its accumulation on the rubbed glass bears great analogy to its accumulation on the surface of the Leyden bottle, and cannot, perhaps, be explained from any known mechanical or chemical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.

There is probably a system of nerves in animal bodies for the purpose of perceiving heat; since the degree of this fluid is so necessary to health, that we become presently injured, either by its excess or defect; and because almost every part of our bodies is supplied with branches from different pairs of nerves, which would not seem neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for their motion alone. It is therefore probable, that our sensation of electricity is only of its violence in passing through our system, by its sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly distending the muscles, like any other mechanical violence; and that it is general pain alone that we feel, and not any sensation analogous to the specific <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

Paralytic limbs are in general only incapable of being stimulated into action by the power of the will; since the pulse continues to beat, and the fluids to be absorbed in them; and it commonly happens, when paralytic people yawn and stretch themselves (which is not a voluntary motion,) that the affected limb moves at the same time. The temporary motion of a paralytic limb is likewise caused by passing the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric shock through it; which would seem to indicate some analogy between the electric fluid and the nervous fluid, which is separated from the blood by the brain, and thence diffused along the nerves, for the purposes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and sensation. It probably destroys life, by its sudden expansion of the nerves, or fibres of the brain, in the same manner as it fuses metals, and splinters wood or stone, and removes the atmosphere when it passes from one object to another in a dense state.</note>

Dr. Franklin was the first that discovered that lightning consisted of electric matter; he elevated a tall rod with a wire wrapped round it, and fixing the bottom of a rod into a glass bottle, and preserving it from falling by means of silk strings, he found it electrified whenever a cloud passed over it, receiving sparks by his finger from it, and charging coated phials. This great discovery taught us to defend houses, and ships, and temples, from lightning, and also to understand <hi>that people are always perfectly safe in a room during a thunder-storm, if they keep themselves at three or four feet distance from the walls;</hi> for the matter of lightning, in passing from the clouds to the earth, or from the earth to the clouds, runs through the walls of a house, the trunk of a tree, or other elevated object; except there be some moister body, as an animal, in contact with them, or nearly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so; and in that case the lightning leaves the wall or tree, and passes through the animal; but as it can pass through metals with still greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, it will leave animal bodies to pass through metallic ones.</p>
                           <p>If a person, in the open air, be surprised by a thunder-storm, he will know his danger by observing, on a second watch, the time which passes between the flash and crack, and reckoning a mile for every four seconds and a half, and a little more. For found travels at the rate of 1142 feet in a second of time; and the velocity of light, through such small distances, is not to be estimated. In these circumstances a person would be safer by lying down on the ground than erect, and still safer if within a few feet of his horse; which, being then a more elevated animal, will receive the shock in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as the cloud passes over.

Dr. Crawford, in his ingenious work on ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal heat, has endeavoured to prove, that during the combination of the pure part of the atmosphere with the phlogistic part of the blood, that much of the matter of the heat is given out from the air; and that this is the great and perpetual source of the heat of animals; to which we may add, that the phos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoric acid is probably produced by this combination; by which acid the colour of the blood is changed in the lungs from a deep crimson to a bright scarlet. There seems to be, however, another source of animal heat, though of a similar nature; and that is from the chemical combinations produced in all the glands; since, by whatever cause any glandular secretion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, as by friction or topical inflammation, the heat of that part becomes increased at the same time; thus, after the hands have been for a time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersed in snow, on coming into a warm room, they become red and hot, without any increased pulmonary action. BESIDES THIS, there would seem to be another material received from the air by respiration; which is so necessary to life, that the embryon must learn to breathe almost within a minute after its birth, or it dies. The perpetual necessity of breathing shews, that the material thus acquired is perpetually consuming or escap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and, on that account, requires perpetual renovation, Perhaps the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of animation itself is thus acquired from the atmosphere, which, if it be supposed to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

W. wind; the reason of which is, that the N. E. winds consist of regions of air brought from the north, which appear to acquire an easterly direction as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; and the S. W. winds consist of regions of air brought from the south, which appear to acquire a westerly direction as they advance. The surface of the earth nearer the pole moves flower than it does in our latitude; whence the regions of air brought form thence move flower, when they arrive hither, than the earth's surface, with which they now become in contact; that is, they acquire an apparent easterly direction, as the earth moves from west to east faster than this new part of its atmosphere. The S. W. winds, on the contrary, consist of regions of air brought from the south, where the surface of the earth moves faster than in our latitude; and have, therefore, a westerly direction when they arrive hither, by their mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faster than the surface of the earth, with which they are in contact; and, in general, the nearer to the west, and the greater the velocity of these winds, the warmer they should be in respect to the season of the year, since they have been brought more expeditiously from the south than those wind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Sometimes I have observed the thaw to commence immediately on the change of the wind, even within an hour, if I am not mistaken, or sooner. At other times, the S. W. wind has continued a day, or even two, before the thaw has commenced; during which time some of the frosty air, which had gone southwards, is driven back over us; and, in consequence, has taken a westerly direction as well as a southern one. At other times, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served a frost, with a N. E. wind, every morning, and a thaw, with a S. W. wind, every noon, for several days together.

                              <hi>The Fiend of Frost.</hi> l. 439. The principal injury done to vegetation by frost, is from the expansion of the water contained in the vessels of plants. Water, converted into ice, occupies a greater space than it did before, as appears by the bursting of bottles filled with water at the time of their freez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Hence frost destroys those plants of our island first, which are most succulent; and the most succulent parts first of other plants, as their leaves and last year's shoots; the vessels of which are distended and burst by the expansion of their freezing fluids; while the drier, or more resinous plants, as pines, yews, laurels, and other ever-greens, are less liable to injury from cold. The trees in vallies are, on this account, more injured by the vernal frosts than those on eminences, because their early succulent shoots come out sooner. Hence fruit trees, covered by a six-inch coping of a wall, are less injured by the vernal frosts, because their being shielded from showers and the descending night-dews, has prevented them from being moist at the time of their being frozen; which circumstance has given occasion to a vulgar error amongst gardeners, who suppose frost to descend.</p>
                           <p>As the common heat of the earth, in this climate, is 48 degrees, those ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der trees which will bear bending down, are easily secured from the frost, by spreading them upon the ground, and covering them with straw or fern. This particularly suits fig-trees, as they easily bear bending to the ground, and are furnished with an acrid juice, which secures them from the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of insects, but are, nevertheless, liable to be eaten by mice.

                              <hi>In buds imprison'd.</hi> l. 460. The buds and bulbs of plants constitute what is termed by Linnaeus the Hybernaculum, or winter cradle of the embryon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable. The buds arise from the bark on the branches of trees, and the bulbs from the caudex of bulbous-rooted plants, or the part from which the fibres of the root are produced: they are defended from too much moisture, and from frosts, and from the depredations of insects, by various contrivances, as by scales, hairs, resinous varnishes, and by acrid rinds.</p>
                           <p>The buds of trees are of two kinds, either flower-buds or leaf-buds; the former of these produce their seeds, and die; the latter produce other leaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buds, or flower-buds, and die. So that all the buds of trees may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as annual plants, having their embryon produced during the preceding summer. The same seems to happen with respect to bulbs; thus a tulip produces annually one flower-bearing bulb, sometimes two, and several leaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing bulbs; and then the old root perishes. Next year the flower-bearing bulb produces seeds and other bulbs, and perishes; while the leaf-bearing bulb, producing other bulbs only, perishes likewise: these circumstances establish a strict analogy between bulbs and buds.

                              <hi>Viewless foods of heat.</hi> l. 462. The fluid matter of heat, or Calorique, in which all bodies are immersed, is as necessary to vegetable as to animal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence. It is not yet determinable whether heat and light be different ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, or modifications of the same materials, as they have some properties in common. They appear to be both of them equally necessary to vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble health, since, without light, green vegetables become first yellow; that is, they lose their blue colour, which contributed to produce the green; and afterwards they also lose the yellow, and become white; as is seen in cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery blanched or etiolated for the table, by excluding the light from it.</p>
                           <p>The upper surface of leaves, which I suppose to be their organ of respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, seems to require light as well as air; since plants which grow in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, on the inside of houses, are equally solicitous to turn the upper side of their leaves to the light. Vegetables, at the same time, exsude or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire a great quantity from their leaves, as animals do from their lungs; this perspirable matter, as it rises from their fine vessels, (perhaps much finer than the pores of animal skins,) is divided into inconceivable tenuity; and, when acted upon by the sun's light, appears to be decomposed; the hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene becomes a part of the vegetable, composing oils or resins; and the oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene, combined with light or calorique, ascends, producing the pure part of the atmosphere, or vital air, Hence, during the light of the day, vegetables give up more pure air than their respiration injures; but not so in the night, even though equally exposed to warmth. This single fact would seem to shew, that light is essentially different from heat; and it is, perhaps, by its combination with bodies, that their combined or latent heat is set at liberty and becomes sensible.

The influence of electricity in forwarding the germination of plants, and their growth, seems to be pretty well esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, though Mr. Ingenhouz did not succeed in his experiments, and thence doubts the success of those of others; and though Mr. Rouland, from his new experiments, believes that neither positive nor negative elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity increases vegetation, both which philosophers had previously been supporters of the contrary doctrine, for many other naturalists have since repeated their experiments relative to this object, and their new results have confirmed their former ones. Mr. D'Ormoy, and the two Roziers, have found the same success in numerous experiments which they have made in the last two years; and Mr. Carmoy has shewn, in a convincing manner, that electricity accelerates germination.</p>
                           <p>Mr. D'Ormoy not only found various seeds to vegetate sooner, and to grow taller, which were put upon his insulated table, and supplied with elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity, but also, that silk-worms began to spin much sooner which were kept electrified, than those of the same hatch, which were kept in the same place and manner, except that they were not electrified. These ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of M. D'Ormoy are detailed at length in the Journal de Physique of Rozier, Tom. XXXV. p. 270.</p>
                           <p>M. Bartholon, who had before written a tract on this subject, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed ingenious methods for applying electricity to agriculture and garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, has also repeated a numerous set of experiments; and shews, both that natural electricity, as well as the artificial, increases the growth of plants, and the germination of seeds; and opposes Mr. Ingenhouz by very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and conclusive facts. lb.

                           <p>Since, by the late discoveries or opinions of the chemists, there is reason to believe, that water is decomposed in the vessels of vegetables; and that the Hydrogene, or inflammable air, of which it in part consists, contributes to the nourishment of the plant, and to the production of its oils, resins, gums, sugar, &amp;c. and, lastly, as electricity decomposes water into these two airs, termed Oxygene and Hydrogene, there is a powerful analogy to induce us to believe, that it accelerates or contributes to the growth of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation, and, like heat, may possibly enter into combination with many bodies, or form the basis of some yet unanalized acid.</p>

The sympathetic inks made by Zaffre, dissolved in the marine and nitrous acids, have this curious property, that, being brought to the fire, one of them becomes green, and the other red; but what is more wonderful, they again lose these colours (unless the heat has been too great,) on their being again withdrawn from the fire. Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screens have been thus painted, which, in the cold, have shewn only the trunk and branches of a dead tree, and sandy hills, which, on their approach to the fire, have put forth green leaves and red flowers, and grass upon the mountains. The process of making these inks is very easy; take Zaffre, as sold by the druggists, and digest it in aqua-regia, and the calx of Cobalt will be dissolved; which solution must be diluted with a little common water, to prevent it from making too strong an impression on the paper; the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, when the paper is heated, becomes of a fine green-blue. If Zaffre, or Regulus of Cobalt, be dissolved in the same manner in spirit of nitre, or aqua-fortis, a reddish colour is produced on exposing the paper to heat.

                     <l>On ice-built isles
<note place="bottom">
                           <p>
                              <hi>On ice-built isles.</hi> l. 529. There are many reasons to believe, from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of travellers and navigators, that the islands of ice in the higher northern latitudes, as well as the Glaciers on the Alps, continue perpetually to increase in bulk. At certain times in the ice-mountains of Switzerland, there happen cracks which have shown the great thickness of the ice, as some of these cracks have measured three or four hundred ells deep. The great islands of ice in the northern seas near Hudson's bay, have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to have been immersed above one hundred sathoms beneath the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the sea, and to have risen a fifth or sixth part above the surface, and to have measured between three and four miles in circumference. Phil. Trans. No. 465. Sect. 2.</p>
                           <p>Dr. Lister endeavoured to shew, that the ice of sea-water contains some salt, and perhaps less air than common ice, and that it is, therefore, much more difficult of solution; whence he accounts for the perpetual and great increase of these floating islands of ice. Philos. Trans. No. 169.</p>
                           <p>As, by a famous experiment of Mr. Boyle's, it appears, that ice evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates very fast in severe frosty weather, when the wind blows upon it; and as ice, in a thawing state, is known to contain six times more cold than wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the same degree of sensible coldness, it is easy to understand, that winds blowing over islands and continents of ice, perhaps much below no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on Fahrenheit's scale, and coming from thence into our latitude, must bring great degrees of cold along with them. If we add to this the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of cold produced by the evaporation of the water, as well as by the solution of the ice, we cannot doubt but that the northern ice is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal source of the coldness of our winters, and that it is brought hither by the regions of air blowing from the north, and which take an apparent easterly direction, by their coming to a part of the surface of the earth which moves faster than the latitude they come from. Hence the increase of the ice in the polar regions, by increasing the cold of our climate, adds, at the same time, to the bulk of the Glaciers of Italy and Switzerland.</p>
                           <p>If the nations who inhabit this hemisphere of the globe, instead of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying their seamen, and exhausting their wealth in unnecessary wars, could be induced to unite their labours to navigate these immense masses of ice into the more southern oceans, two great advantages would result to mankind; the tropic countries would be much cooled by their solution, and our winters, in this latitude, would be rendered much milder, for perhaps a century or two, till the masses of ice become again enormous.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Bradley ascribes the cold winds and wet weather which sometimes happen in May and June, to the solution of ice-islands accidentally floating from the north. Treatise on Husbandry and Gardening, vol. II. p. 437. And adds, that Mr. Barham, about the year 1718, in his voyage from Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica to England, in the beginning of June, met with ice-islands coming from the north, which were surrounded with so great a fog, that the ship was in danger of striking upon them, and that one of them measured sixty miles in length.</p>
                           <p>We have lately experienced an instance of ice-islands brought from the southern polar regions, on which the Guardian struck at the beginning of her passage from the Cape of Good-Hope towards Botany-Bay, on Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 22, 1789. These islands were involved in mist, were about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty fathoms long, and about fifty fathoms above the surface of the water. A part from the top of one of them broke off, and sell into the sea, causing an extraordinary commotion in the water, and a thick smoke all round it.</p>

The solution of water in air, or in calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique, seems to acquire electric matter, at the same time, as appears from an experiment of Mr. Bennet. He put some live coals into an insulated funnel of metal, and throwing on them a little water, observed, that the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending steam was electrised plus, and the water which descended through the funnel was electrised minus. Hence it appears, that though clouds, by their change of form, may sometimes become electrised minus, yet they have, in general, an accumulation of electricity. This accumulation of electric matter also evidently contributes to support the atmospheric vapour when it is condensed into the form of clouds, because it is seen to descend rapidly after the flashes of lightning have diminished its quantity; whence there is reason to conclude, that very numerous metallic rods, with fine points erected high in the air, might induce it, at any time, to part with some of its water.</p>
                           <p>If we may trust the theory of Mr. Lavoisier concerning the composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and decomposition of water, there would seem another source of thunder-showers; and that is, that the two gasses termed oxygene gas, or vital air, and hydrogene gas, or inflammable air, may exist in the summer atmosphere in a state of mixture, but not of combination, and that the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric spark, or flash of lightning, may combine them, and produce water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantaneously.</p>

The granite, or moor-stone, or porphory, constitute the oldest part of the globe, since the lime-stone, shells, coralloids, and other sea productions, rest upon them; and upon these sea productions are found clay, iron, coal, salt, and siliceous sand, or grit-stone. Thus there seem to be three divisions of the globe distinctly marked: the first I suppose to have been the original nucleus of the earth, or lava projected from the sun; 2. over this lie the recrements of animal and vegetable matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the ocean; and, 3. over these the recrements of animal and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table matter produced upon the land. Besides these there are bodies which owe their origin to a combination of those already mentioned, as siliceous sand, fluor, alabaster, which seem to have derived their acids orginally from the vegetable kingdom, and their earthy bases from sea productions.

The nucleus of the earth, still covered with water, received perpetual increase by the immense quantities of shells and coralloids either annually produced and relinquished, or left after the death of the animals. These would gradually, by their different degrees of cohesion, be, some of them more and others less, removeable, by the influence of solar tides, and gentle tropical breezes, which then must have probably extended from one pole to the other; for it is supposed the moon was not yet produced, and that no storms, or unequal winds, had yet existence.</p>
                           <p>Hence, then, the primeval islands had their gradual origin, were raised but a few feet above the level of the sea, and were not exposed to the great or sudden variations of heat and cold, as is so well explained in Mr. Whitehurst's Theory of the Earth, chap. xvi. Whence the paradise of the sacred writers, and the golden age of the profane ones, seems to have had a real existence. As there can be no rainbow, when the heavens are covered with clouds, because the sun-beams are then precluded from falling upon the rain-drops opposite to the eye of the spectator, the rainbow is a mark of gentle or partial showers. Mr. Whitehurst has endeavoured to show, that the primitive islands were only moistened by nocturnal dews, and not by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

As the salt of the sea has been gradually accumulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being washed down into it from the recrements of animal and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table bodies, the sea must originally have been as fresh as river water; and as it is not yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

As the earth, before the existence of earthquakes, was nearly level, and the greatest part of it covered with sea; when the first great fires began deep in the internal parts of it, those parts would become much expanded; this expansion would be gradually extended, as the heat increased, through the whole terraqueous globe of 7000 miles diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the crust would thence, in many places, open into fissures, which, by admitting the sea to flow in upon the fire, would produce not only a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of steam beyond calculation, by its expansion, but would also, by its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composition, produce inflammable air and vital air in quantities beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, sufficient to effect those violent explosions, the vestiges of which, all over the world, excite our admiration and our study. The difficulty of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding how subterraneous fires could exist without the presence of air, has disappeared since Dr. Priestley's discoveries of such great quantities of pure air, which constitute all the acids, and, consequently, exist in all saline bodies, as sea-salt, nitre, lime-stone, and in all calciform ores, as manganese, calamy, ochre, and other mineral substances.

If the moon had no atmosphere at the time of its elevation from the earth, or if its atmosphere was afterwards stolen from it by the earth's attraction, the water on the moon would rise quickly into vapour, and the cold produced by a certain quantity of this evaporation, would congeal the remainder of it. Hence it is not probable that the moon is at present inhabited, but, as it seems to have suffered, and to continue to suffer much by volcanos, a sufficient quantity of air may, in process of time, be generated to produce an atmosphere, which may prevent its heat from so easily escaping, and its water from so easily evaporating, and thence become fit for the production of vegetables and animals.</p>
                           <p>That the moon possesses little or no atmosphere, is deduced from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diminished lustre of the stars, at the instant when they emerge from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind her disk. That the ocean of the moon is frozen, is confirmed from there being no appearance of lunar tides, which, if they existed, would cover the part of her disk nearest the earth.

The great mass of matter which rests upon the lime-stone strata of the earth or upon the granite, where the lime-stone stratum has been removed by earthquakes, or covered by lava, has had its origin from the recrements of vegetables and of air-breathing animals, as the lime-stone had its origin from sea animals.

Salts of various kinds are produced from the recrements of animal and vegetable bodies, such as phosphoric, ammoniacal, marine salt, and others; these are washed from the earth by rains, and carried down our rivers into the sea; they seem all here to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose each other, except the marine salt, which has, therefore, from the beginning of the habitable world, been perpetually accumulating.</p>
                           <p>There is a town in the immense salt-mines of Cracow, in Poland, with a market-place, a river, a church, and a famous statue, (here supposed to be of Lot's wife) by the moist or dry appearance of which the subterranean in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are said to know when the weather is fair above ground. The gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries in these mines are so numerous and so intricate, that workmen have frequently lost their way, their lights having been burnt out, and have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished before they could be found. Essais, &amp;c. par M. Macquart. And though the arches of these different stories of galleries are boldly executed, yet they are not dangerous, as they are held together, or supported, by large masses of timber of a foot square; and these vast timbers remain perfectly sound for many centuries, while all other pillars, whether of brick, cement, or salt, soon dissolve, or moulder away. Ibid. Could the timbers over wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-mill wheels or cellars, be thus preserved by occasionally soaking them with brine? These immense masses of rock-salt seem to have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the evaporation of sea-water, in the early periods of the world, by subterranean fires. Dr. Hutton's Theory of the Earth. See also Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie des Sources Salees, par M. Struve. Histoire de Sciences de Lausanne, Tom. II. This idea of Dr. Hutton's is confirmed by a fact mentioned in M. Macquart's Essais sur Mineralogie, who found a great quantity of fossil shells, principally bi-valves and madre-pores, in the salt-mines of Wialiczka, near Cracow. During the evaporation of the lakes of salt-water, as in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial salt-works, the salt begins to crystallize near the edge, where the water is shallowest, forming hollow inverted pyramids, which, when they become of a certain size, subside by their gravity; if urged by a stronger fire, the salt fuses, or forms large cubes; whence the salt shaped in hollow pyramids, called flake-salt, in better tasted, and preserves flesh better, than the basket or powder salt; because it is made by less heat, and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains more of the marine acid. The sea-water about our island contains from about one twenty-eighth to one thirtieth part of sea-salt, and about one eightieth of magnesian salt. See Brownrigg on Salt.

Nitre is found in Bengal naturally crystallized, and is swept by brooms from earths and stones, and thence called sweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of nitre. It has lately been found, in large quantities, in a natural ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of calcareous earth at Molfetta, in Italy, both in thin strata between the calcareous beds, and in efflorescences of various beautiful leafy and hairy forms. An account of this nitre-bed is given by Mr. Zimmerman, and abridged in Rozier's Journal de Physique, Fevrier, 1790. This acid appears to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in all situations where animal and vegetable matters are completely decomposed, and which are exposed to the action of the air, as on the walls of stables and slaughter-houses; the crystals are prisms furrowed by longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinal grooves.</p>
                           <p>Dr. Priestley discovered, that nitrous air or gas, which he obtained by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving metals in nitrous acid, would combine rapidly with vital air, and produce with it a true nitrous acid, forming red clouds during the combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the two airs occupy only the space before occupied by one of them, and, at the same time, heat is given out from the new combination. This diminution of the bulk of a mixture of nitrous gas and vital air, Dr. Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley ingeniously used as a test of the purity of the latter; a discovery of the greatest importance in the analysis of airs.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Cavendish has since demonstrated, that two parts of vital air, or oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene, and one part of phlogistic air, or azote, being long exposed to electric shocks, unite, and produce nitrous acid. Philos. Trans. vols. LXXV. and LXXVIII.</p>
                           <p>Azote is one of the most abundant elements in nature, and, combined with calorique, or heat, it forms azotic gas, or phlogistic air, and composes two thirds of the atmosphere, and is one of the principal component parts of animal bodies, and, when united to vital air, or oxygene, produces the nitrous acid.

When thin morasses lie on beds of gravel, the latter are generally stained by the filtration of some of the chalybeate water through them. This formation of iron from vegetable recrements, is further evinced by the fern leaves, and other parts of vegetables, so frequently found in the centre of the knobs or nodules of some iron ores.</p>
                           <p>In some of these nodules there is a nucleus of whiter iron earth, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by many concentric strata of darker and lighter iron earth alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately. In one, which now lies before me, the nucleus is a prism of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular form, with blunted angles, and about half an inch high, and an inch and half broad; on every side of this are concentric strata of similar iron earth, alternately browner and less brown; each stratum is about a tenth of an inch in thickness, and there are ten of them in number. To what known cause can this exactly regular distribution of so many earthy strata of different colours, surrounding the nucleus, be ascribed? I don't know that any mineralogists have attempted an explanation of this wonderful phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon. I suspect it is owing to the polarity of the central nucleus. If iron-filings be regularly laid on paper, by means of a small sieve, and a magnet be placed underneath, the filings will dispose themselves in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centric curves, with vacant intervals between them. Now, if these iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filings are conceived to be suspended in a fluid, whose specific gravity is similar to their own, and a magnetic bar was introduced as an axis into this fluid, it is easy to foresee that the iron-filings would dispose themselves into concentric spheres, with intervals of the circumnatant fluid between them, exactly as is seen in these nodules of iron earth. As all the lavas consist of one fourth of iron, (Kirwan's Mineral.) and almost all other known bodies, whether of animal or vegetable origin, possess more or less of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, may not a distribution of a great portion of the globe of the earth, into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Its property of being rendered hard to so great a degree, and thus constituting such excellent tools It was the discovery of this property of iron, Mr. Locke thinks, that gave such pre-eminence to the European world over the American one. 2. Its power of being welded; that is, when two pieces are made very hot, and applied together by hammering, they unite completely, unless any scale of iron intervenes; and to prevent this it is usual for smiths to dip the very hot bar in sand, a little of which fuses into fluid glass with the scale, and is squeezed out from between the uniting parts by the force of hammering. 3. Its power of acquiring magnetism.</p>
                           <p>It is, however, to be wished, that gold or silver were discovered in as great quantity as iron, since these metals, being indestructible by exposure to air, water, fire, or any common acids, would supply wholesome vessels for cookery, so much to be desired, and so difficult to obtain, and would form the most light and durable coverings for houses, as well as indestructible fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grates, ovens, and boiling vessels.

                              <hi>Last Michel's hands.</hi> l. 193. The discovery of the magnet seems to have been in very early times; it is mentioned by Plato, Lucretius, Pliny, and Galen, and is said to have taken its name of magnes, from Magnesia, a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of ancient Lybia.</p>
                           <p>As every piece of iron which was made magnetical by the touch of a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, became itself a magnet, many attempts were made to improve these artificial magnets, but without much success, till Servingdon Savery, <abbr>Esq.</abbr> made them of <hi>hardened</hi> steel bars, which were so powerful, that one of them, weighing three pounds averdupois, would lift another of the same weight. Philos. Trans.</p>
                           <p>After this Dr. Knight made very successful experiments on this subject, which, though he kept his method secret, seems to have excited others to turn their attention to magnetism. At this time the Rev. Mr. Michel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented an equally efficacious and more expeditious way of making strong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial magnets, which he published in the end of the year 1750, in which he explained his method of what he called "the double touch," and which, since Dr. Knight's method has been known, appears to be somewhat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from it.</p>
                           <p>This method of rendering bars of hardened steel magnetical, consists in holding vertically two or more magnetic bars nearly parallel to each other, with their opposite poles very near each other, (but nevertheless separated to a small distance,) these are to be slided over a line of bars, laid horizontally, a few times backward and forward. See Michel on Magnetism, also a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed account in Chambers' Dictionary.</p>
                           <p>What Mr. Michel proposed by this method was, to include a very small portion of the horizontal bars intended to be made magnetical, between the joint forces of two or more bars already magnetical, and, by sliding them from end to end, every part of the line of bars became successively included, and thus bars, possessed of a very small degree of magnetism to begin with, would, in a few times sliding backwards and forwards, make the other ones much more magnetical than themselves, which are then to be taken up and used to touch the former, which are in succession to be laid down ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontally in a line.</p>
                           <p>There is still a great field remains for future discoveries in magnetism, both in respect to experiment and theory; the latter consists of vague con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, the more probable of which are, perhaps, those of Epinus, as they assimilate it to electricity.</p>
                           <p>One conjecture I shall add, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the polarity of magnetism may be owing to the earth's rotatory motion. If heat, electricity, and magnetism, are supposed to be fluids of different gravities, heat being the heaviest of them, electricity the next heavy, and magnetism the lightest, it is evident, that by the quick revolution of the earth, the heat will be accumulated most over the line, electricity next beneath this, and that the magnetism will be detruded to the poles and axis of the earth, like the atmospheres of common air and inflammable gas, as explained in the note on Canto 1. l. 123.</p>
                           <p>Electricity and heat will both of them displace magnetism, and this shews that they may gravitate on each other; and hence, when too great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the electric fluid becomes accumulated at the poles by descending snows, or other unknown causes, it may have a tendency to rise towards the tropics by its centrifugal force, and produce the northern lights.

                           <p>The great quantities of flint-sand, whether formed in mountains or in the sea, would appear to derive its acid from the new world, as it is found above the strata of lime-stone and granite which constitute the old world, and, as the earthy basis of flint is probably calcareous, a great part of it seems to be produced by a conjunction of the new and old world. The recrements of air-breathing animals and vegetables probably afford the acid, and the shells of marine animals the earthy basis, while another part may have derived its calcareous part also from the decomposition of vegetable and animal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>

Sir Isaac Newton having observed the great power of refracting light, which the diamond possesses above all other crystallized or vitreous matter, conjectured that it was an inflammable body in some manner congealed. Insomuch that all the light is reflected which falls on any of its interior surfaces at a greater angle of incidence than 24 ½ degrees; whereas an artificial gem of glass does not reflect any light from its hinder surface, unless that surface is inclined in an angle of 41 degrees. Hence, the diamond reflects half as much more light as a factitious gem in similar circumstances; to which must be added its great transparency, and the excellent polish it is capable of. The diamond had nevertheless been placed at the head of crystals or precious stones by the mineralogists, till Bergman ranged it of late in the combustible class of bodies, because, by the focus of Vill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The times of its greatest splendour were prior to the foundations of Rome, and the reign of one of its best princes, Janus, was the oldest epoch the Romans knew. The earliest historians speak of the Etruscans as being then of high antiquity, most probably a colony from Phoenicia, to which a Pelasgian colony acceded, and was united soon after D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The peculiar character of their earthen vases consists in the admirable beauty, simplicity, and diversity of forms, which continue the best models of taste to the artists of the present times; and in a species of non-vitreous encaustic painting, which was reckoned, even in the time of Pliny, among the lost arts of antiquity, but which has lately been recovered by the ingenuity and industry of Mr. Wedgwood. It is supposed that the principal manufactories were about Nola, at the foot of Vesuvius, for it is in that neighbourhood that the greatest quantities of antique vases have been found; and it is said that the general taste of the inhabitants is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently influenced by them, insomuch that strangers, coming to Naples, are commonly struck with the diversity and elegance, even of the most ordinary vases, for common uses.

"We descended with great difficulty into the dungeons, which were made too low for our standing upright; and were so dark, that we were obliged at noon-day to visit them by the light of a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. We saw the hooks of those chains by which the prisoners were fastened by their necks to the walls of their cells; many of which, being below the level of the water, were in a constant state of humidity, from which issued a noxious vapour, which more than once extinguished the candles. Since the destruction of the building, many subterraneous cells have been disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered under a piece of ground, which seemed only a bank of solid earth, before the horrid secrets of this prison-house were disclosed.

                              <hi>And pierce the rent roof.</hi> l. 398. The granite rocks and the lime-stone rocks have been cracked to very great depths at the time they were raised up by subterranean fires; in these cracks are found most of the metallic ores, except iron, and perhaps manganese; the former of which is generally found in horizontal strata, and the latter generally near the surface of the earth.</p>
                           <p>Philosophers possessing so convenient a test for the discovery of iron by the magnet, have long since found it in all vegetable and animal matters; and of late Mr. Scheele has discovered the existence of manganese in vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ashes. Scheele, 56 mem. Stock. 1774. Kirwan. Min. 353. Which accounts for the production of it near the surface of the earth, and thence for its calciform appearance, or union with vital air. Bergman has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise shewn, that the lime-stones which become bluish, or dark coloured, when calcined, possess a mixture of manganese, and are thence preferable, as a cement, to other kinds of lime. 2 Bergman, 229. Which impregnation with manganese has probably been received from the decomposition of superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent vegetable matters.</p>
                           <p>These cracks, or perpendicular caverns, in the granite or lime-stone, pass to unknown depths; and it is up these channels that I have endeavoured to shew, that the steam rises, which becomes afterwards condensed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the warm springs of this island, and other parts of the world. (See note on Fucus, vol. II.) And up these cracks I suppose certain vapours arise, which either alone, or by meeting with something descending into them from above, have produced most of the metals, and several of the materials in which they are bedded. Thus the ponderous earth, Barytes, of Derby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, is found in these cracks, and is stratified frequently with lead-ore, and frequently surrounds it. This ponderous earth has been found by Dr. Hoepfner in a granite in Switzerland, and may have thus been sublimed from immense depths by great heat, and have obtained its carbonic or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolic acid from above. Annales de Chimie. There is also reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that something from above is necessary to the formation of many of the metals. At Hawkstone, in Shropshire, the seat of Sir Richard Hill, there is an elevated rock of siliceous sand, which is coloured green with copper in many places high in the air; and I have in my possession a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of lead formed in the cavity of an iron nodule, and another of lead amid spar from a crack of a coal-stratum; all which countenance the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern production of those metals from descending materials. To which should be added, that the highest mountains of granite, which have, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, probably never been covered with marine productions, on account of their early elevation, nor with vegetable or animal matters, on account of their great coldness, contain no metallic ores, whilst the lower ones contain copper and tin in their cracks or veins, both in Saxony, Silesia, and Cornwall. Kirwan's Mineral. p. 374.</p>
                           <p>The transmutation of one metal into another, though hitherto undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the alchymists, does not appear impossible; such transmutations have been supposed to exist in nature; thus lapis calaminaris may have been produced from the destruction of lead-ore, as it is generally sound on the top of the veins of lead, where it has been calcined, or united with air, and because masses of lead-ore are often sound intirely inclosed in it. So silver is found mixed in almost all lead-ores, and sometimes in separate filaments within the cavities of lead-ore, as I am informed by Mr. Michel, and is thence probably a partial transmutation of the lead to silver, the rapid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of modern chemistry having shewn the analogy between metallic cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and acids, may lead to the power of transmuting their bases; a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very much to be wished.</p>

We were here at once surprised and terrified by a sight surely one of the most magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent in the world. In that vast expanse of desert, from W. to N. W. of us, we saw a number of prodigious pillars of sand, at different distances, at times moving with great celerity, at others stalking on with a majestic slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; at intervals we thought they were coming in a very few minutes to overwhelm us; and small quantities of sand did actually more than once reach us. Again they would retreat so as to be almost out of sight, their tops reaching to the very clouds. There the tops often separated from the bodies, and these, once disjoined, dispersed in the air, and did not appear more. Sometimes they were broken in the middle, as if struck with large cannon-shot. About noon they began to advance with considerable swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon us, the wind being very strong at north. Eleven of them ranged along side of us about the distance of three miles. The greatest diameter of the largest appeared to me, at that distance, as if it would measure ten feet. They retired from us with a wind at S. E. leaving an impression upon my mind to which I can give no name, though surely one ingredient in it was fear, with a considerable deal of wonder and astonishment. It was in vain to think of flying; the swiftest horse, or fastest failing ship, could be of no use to carry us out of this danger; and the full persuasion of this riveted me as if to the spot where I stood.</p>
                           <p>"The same appearance of moving pillars of sand presented themselves to us this day in form and disposition like those we had seen at Waad Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boub, only they seemed to be more in number and less in size. They came several times in a direction close upon us, that is, I believe, within less than two miles. They began immediately after sun-rise like a thick wood, and almost darkened the sun. His rays shining through them for near an hour, gave them an appearance of pillars of fire. Our people now became despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; the Greeks shrieked out, and said it was the day of judgment; Ismael pronounced it to be hell; and the Turcorories, that the world was on fire." Bruce's Travels, vol. IV. p. 553-555.</p>
                           <p>From this account it would appear, that the eddies of wind were owing to the long range of broken rocks, which bounded one side of the sandy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, and bent the currents of air, which struck against their sides; and were thus like the eddies in a stream of water which falls against oblique obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. This explanation is probably the true one, as these whirl-winds were not attended with rain or lightning like the tornadoes of the West-Indies.</p>

                              <hi>The transmigrating Ens.</hi> l. 574. The perpetual circulation of matter, in the growth and dissolution of vegetable and animal bodies, seems to have given Pythagoras his idea of the metempsycosis, or transmigration of spirit, which was afterwards dressed out, or ridiculed, in a variety of amusing fables. Other philosophers have supposed, that there are two different materials or essences, which fill the universe. One of these, which has the power of commencing or producing motion, is called spirit; the other, which has the power of receiving and of communicating motion, but not of beginning it, is called matter. The former of these is supposed to be diffused through all space, filling up the interstices of the suns and planets, and constituting the gravitations of the sidereal bodies, the attractions of chemistry, with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of vegetation, and of animation. The latter occupies comparatively but small space, constituting the solid parts of the suns and planets, and their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mospheres. Hence these philosophers have supposed, that both matter and spirit are equally immortal and unperishable; and that, on the dissolution of vegetable or animal organization, the matter returns to the general mass of matter, and the spirit to the general mass of spirit, to enter again into new combinations, according to the original idea of Pythagoras.</p>
                           <p>The small apparent quantity of matter that exists in the universe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to that of spirit, and the short time in which the recrements of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal or vegetable bodies become again vivi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The very ancient story of the beautiful Adonis passing one half of the year with Venus, and the other with Proserpine, alternately, has had variety of interpretations. Some have supposed that it allegorized the summer and winter solstice; but this seems too obvious a fact to have needed an hieroglyphic emblem. Others have believed it to represent the corn, which was supposed to sleep in the earth during the winter months, and to rise out of it in summer. This does not accord with the climate of Egypt, where the harvest soon follows the seed-time.</p>
                           <p>It seems more probably to have been a story explaining some hieroglyphic figures representing the decomposition and resuscitation of animal matter; a sublime and interesting subject, and which seems to have given origin to the doctrine of transmigration, which had probably its birth also from the hieroglyphic treasures of Egypt. It is remarkable that the cypress groves, in the ancient Greek writers, as in Theocritus, were dedicated to Venus, and afterwards became funeral emblems. Which was probably occasioned by the Cypress being an accompaniment of Venus in the annual processions, in which she was supposed to lament over the funeral of Adonis; a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which obtained over all the eastern world from great antiquity, and is supposed to be referred to by Ezekiel, who accuses the idolatrous woman of weeping for Thammuz.</p>

                              <hi>On each broad cloud.</hi> l. 15. The clouds consist of condensed vapour, the particles of which are too small separately to overcome the tenacity of the air, and which, therefore, do not descend. They are in such small spheres as to repel each other; that is, they are applied to each other by such very small surfaces, that the attraction of the particles of each drop to its own centre, is greater than its attraction to the surface of the drop in its vicinity; every one has observed with what difficulty small spherules of quicksilver can be made to unite, owing to the same cause; and it is common to see, on riding through shallow water on a clear day, numbers of very small spheres of water, as they are thrown from the horses feet, run along the surface for many yards before they again unite with it. In many cases these spherules of water, which compose clouds, are kept from uniting by a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of electric fluid, and fall, in violent showers, as soon as that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from them, as in thunder storms. See note on Canto 1. l. 554.</p>
                           <p>If, in this state, a cloud becomes frozen, it is torn to pieces in its descent, by the friction of the air, and falls in white flakes of snow. Or these flakes are rounded by being rubbed together by the winds, and by having their angles thawed off by the warmer air beneath as they descend; and part of the water produced by these angles, thus dissolved, is absorbed into the body of the hail-stone, as may be seen by holding a lump of snow over a candle, and there becomes frozen into ice, by the quantity of cold which the hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone possesses beneath the freezing point, or which is produced by its quick evaporation in falling; and thus hail-stones are often found of greater or less density, according as they consist of a greater portion of snow or ice. If hail-stones consisted of the large drops of showers frozen in their descent, they would consist of pure transparent ice.</p>
                           <p>As hail is only produced in summer, and is always attended with storms, some philosophers have believed, that the sudden departure of electricity from a cloud may effect something yet unknown in this phenomenon; but it may happen in summer independent of electricity, because aqueous vapour is then raised higher in the atmosphere, whence it has further to fall, and there is warmer air below for it to fall through.</p>

During the coldness of the night the moisture before dissolved in the air is gradually precipitated, and, as it subsides, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to the bodies it falls upon. Where the attraction of the body to the particles of water is greater than the attractions of those particles to each other, it becomes spread upon their surface, or slides down them in actual contact, as on the broad parts of the blades of moist grass. Where the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the surface to the water is less than the attraction of the particles of water to each other, the dew stands in drops, as on the points and edges of grass or gorse, where the surface presented to the drop being small, it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts it so little as but just to support it without much changing its globu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar form. Where there is no attraction between the vegetable surface and the dew drops, as on cabbage leaves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the drop does not come into contact with the leaf, but hangs over it repelled, and retains its natural form, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of the attraction and pressure of its own parts, and thence looks like quicksilver, reflecting light from both its surfaces. Nor is this owing to any oiliness of the leaf, but simply to the polish of its surface, as a light needle may be laid on water in the same manner without touching it; for as the attractive powers of polished surfaces are greater when in actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, so the repulsive power is greater before contact.</note>

Mists are clouds resting on the ground; they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally come on at the beginning of night, and either fill the moist vallies, or hang on the summits of hills, according to the degree of moisture previously dissolved, and the eduction of heat from them. The air over rivers, during the warmth of the day, suspends much moisture; and, as the changeful sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of rivers occasions them to cool sooner than the land, at the approach of evening, mists are most frequently seen to begin over rivers, and to spread themselves over moist grounds, and fill the vallies, while the mists on the tops of mountains are more properly clouds, condensed by the coldness of their situation.</p>
                           <p>On ascending up the side of a hill from a misty valley, I have observed a beautiful coloured halo round the moon, when a certain thickness of mist was over me, which ceased to be visible as soon as I emerged out of it; and well remember admiring, with other spectators, the shadow of the three spires of the cathedral church at Lichfield, the moon rising behind it, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently broken off, and lying distinctly over our heads, as if horizontally on the surface of the mist, which arose about as high as the roof of the church. There are some curious remarks on shadows, or reflections seen on the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of mists from high mountains, in Ulloa's Voyages. The dry mist of summer 1783, was probably occasioned by volcanic eruption, as mentioned in note on Chunda, vol. II. and, therefore, more like the atmosphere of smoke, which hangs, on still days, over great cities.</p>
                           <p>There is a dry mist, or rather a diminished transparence of the air, which, according to Mr. Saussure, accompanies fair weather, while great transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of air indicates rain. Thus when large rivers, two miles broad, such as at Liverpool, appear narrow, it is said to prognosticate rain, and when wide, fair weather. This want of transparence of the air, in dry weather, may be owing to new combinations or decompositions of the vapours dissolved in it, but wants further investigation.

                              <hi>Carr'd on the foam.</hi> l. 61. The phenomena of the tides have been well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestigated, and satisfactorily explained, by Sir Isaac Newton and Dr. Halley, from the reciprocal gravitations of the earth, moon, and sun. As the earth and moon move round a centre of motion near the earth's surface, at the same time that they are proceeding in their annual orbit round the sun, it follows, that the water on the side of the earth nearest this centre of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, between the earth and moon, will be more attracted by the moon, and the waters on the opposite side of the earth will be less attracted by the moon, than the central parts of the earth. Add to this, that the centri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugal force of the water on the side of the earth furthest from the centre of the motion, round which the earth and moon move, (which, as was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is near the surface of the earth,) is greater than that on the opposite side of the earth. From both these causes it is easy to comprehend, that the water will rise on two sides of the earth, <abbr>viz.</abbr> on that nearest to the moon, and its opposite side, and that it will be flattened, in consequence, at the quadratures, and thus produce two tides in every lunar day, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of about twenty-four hours and forty-eight minutes.</p>
                           <p>These tides will be also affected by the solar attraction when it coincides with the lunar one, or opposes it, as at new and full moon, and will also be much influenced by the opposing shores in every part of the earth.</p>
                           <p>Now, as the moon, in moving round the centre of gravity between itself and the earth, describes a much larger orbit than the earth describes round the same centre, it follows, that the centrifugal motion of the side of the moon opposite to the earth must be much greater than the centrifugal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the side of the earth opposite to the moon, round the same centre. And, secondly, as the attraction of the earth exerted on the moon's surface next to the earth, is much greater than the attraction of the moon exerted on the earth's surface, the tides on the lunar sea (if such there be) should be much greater than those of our ocean. Add to this, that as the same face of the moon always is turned to the earth, the lunar tides must be permanent, and if the solid parts of the moon be spherical, must always cover the phasis next to us. But as there are evidently hills, and vales, and volcanos, on this side of the moon, the consequence is, that the moon has no ocean, or that it is frozen.</p>

The spiral form of many shells seem to have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a more frugal manner of covering the long tail of the fish with calca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous armour; since a single thin partition between the adjoining circles of the fish was sufficient to defend both surfaces, and thus much cretaceous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is saved; and it is probable, that from this spiral form they are better enabled to feel the vibrations of the element in which they exist. See note on Canto IV. l. 162. This cretaceous matter is formed by a mucous secretion from the skin of the fish, as is seen in crab-fish, and others which annually cast their shells, and is at first a mucous covering (like that of a hen's egg, when it is laid a day or two too soon) and which gradually hardens. This may also be seen in common shell snails; if a part of their shell be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it becomes repaired in a similar manner with mucus, which, by degrees, hardens into shell.</p>
                           <p>It is probable the calculi, or stones found in other animals, may have a similar origin, as they are formed on mucous membranes, as those of the kidney and bladder, chalk-stones in the gout, and gall-stones; and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably owing to the inflammation of the membrane where they are produced, and vary according to the degree of inflammation of the membrane which forms them, and the kind of mucus which it naturally produces. Thus the shelly matter of different shell-fish differs, from the coarser kinds, which form the shells of crabs, to the finer kinds, which produce the mother-pearl.</p>
                           <p>The beautiful colours of some shells originate from the thinness of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minae of which they consist, rather than to any colouring matter, as is seen in mother-pearl, which reflects different colours according to the obliquity of the light which falls on it. The beautiful prismatic colours seen on the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bradore stone, are owing to a similar cause, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the thinness of the laminae of which it consists, and has probably been formed from mother-pearl shells.</p>
                           <p>It is curious that some of the most common fossil shells are not now known in their recent state, as the cornua ammonis; and, on the contrary, many shells which are very plentiful in their recent state, as limpets, sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ears, volutes, cowries, are very rarely found fossil. Da Costa's Conchology, p. 163. Were all the ammoniae destroyed when the continents were raised? Or do some genera of animals perish by the increasing power of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Or do they still reside at inaccessible depths in the sea? Or do some animals change their form gradually, and become new genera?</p>

Mr. Reaumur thinks they are formed like the hard concretions in many land animals, as stones of the bladder, gall-stones, and bezoar, and hence concludes them to be a disease of the fish; but there seems to be a stricter analogy between these and the calcareous productions found in crab-fish, called crab's eyes, which are formed near the stomach of the animal, and constitute a reservoir of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous matter against the renovation of the shell, at which time they are re-dissolved, and deposited for that purpose. As the internal part of the shell of the pearl, oyster, or muscle, consists of mother-pearl, which is a simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar material to the pearl, and, as the animal has annually occasion to enlarge his shell, there is reason to suspect the loose pearls are similar reservoirs of the pearly matter for that purpose.</p>

The immense and dangerous rocks built by the swarms of coral insects, which rise almost perpendicularly in the southern ocean, like walls, are described in Cook's Voyages; a point of one of these rocks broke off, and stuck in the hole which it had made in the bottom of one of his ships, which would otherwise have perished by the admission of water. The numerous lime-stone rocks, which consist of a congeries of the cells of these animals, and which constitute a great part of the solid earth, shew their prodigious multiplication in all ages of the world. Specimens of these rocks are to be seen in the lime-works at Linsel, near Newport, in Shropshire, in Coal-brook Dale, and in many parts of the Peak of Derby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.

Water, in descending down elevated situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if the outlet for it below is not sufficient for its emission, acts with a force equal to the height of the column, as is seen in an experimental ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine called the philosophical bellows, in which a few pints of water are made to raise many hundred pounds. To this cause is to be ascribed many large promontories of ice being occasionally thrown down from the glaciers; rocks have likewise been thrown from the sides of mountains by the same cause, and large portions of earth have been removed many hundred yards from their situations at the foot of mountains. On inspecting the locomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of about thirty acres of earth, with a small house, near Bilder's Bridge, in Shropshire, about twenty years ago, from the foot of a mountain towards the river, I well remember, it bore all the marks of having been thus lifted up, pushed away, and, as it were, crumpled into ridges, by a column of water contained in the mountain.</p>
                           <p>From water being thus confined in high columns, between the strata of mountainous countries, it has often happened, when wells or perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been made into the earth, that springs have arisen much above the surface of the new well. When the new bridge was building at Dublin, Mr. G. Semple found a spring in the bed of the river where he meant to lay the foundation of a pierre, which, by fixing iron pipes into it, he raised many feet. Treatise on Building in Water, by G. Semple. From having observed a valley north-west of St. Alkmond's well, near Derby, at the head of which that spring of water once probably existed, and by its current formed the valley, (but which, in after times, found its way out in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent situation,) I suspect that St. Alkmond's well might, by building round it, be raised high enough to supply many streets in Derby with spring-water, which are now only supplied with river-water. See an account of an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial spring of water, Phil. Trans. vol. LXXV. p. 1.</p>
                           <p>In making a well at Sheerness the water rose 300 feet above its source in the well. Phil. Trans. vol. LXXIV. And at Hartford, in Connecticut, there is a well which was dug seventy feet deep before water was found; then, in boring an auger-hole through a rock, the water rose so fast as to make it difficult to keep it dry by pumps, till they could blow the hole larger by gun-powder, which was no sooner accomplished than it filled, and run over, and has been a brook for near a century.

When from any peculiar situations of land, in respect to sea, the tropic becomes more heated, when the sun is vertical over it, than the line, the periodical winds, called monsoons, are produced, and these are attended by rainy seasons; for as the air at the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic is now more heated than at the line, it ascends by decrease of its specific gravity, and floods of air rush in both from the south-west and north-east, and these being one warmer than the other, the rain is precipitated by their mixture, as observed by Dr. Hutton. See additional notes, No. XXV. All late travellers have ascribed the rise of the Nile to the monsoons which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge Nubia and Abyssinia with rain. The whirling of the ascending air was even seen by Mr. Bruce in Abyssinia: he says, "Every morning a small cloud began to whirl round, and presently after the whole heavens became covered with clouds." By this vortex of ascending air the N. E. winds and the S. W. winds, which flow in to supply the place of the ascending column, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came mixed more rapidly, and deposited their rain in greater abundance.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Volney observes, that the time of the rising of the Nile commences about the 19th of June; and that Abyssinia and the adjacent parts of Africa are deluged with rain in May, June, and July, and produce a mass of water which is three months in draining off. The Abbe Le Pluche observes, that as Sirius, or the dog-star, rose at the time of the commencement of the flood, its rising was watched by the astronomers, and notice given of the approach of inundation, by hanging the figure of Anubis, which was that of a man with a dog's head, upon all their temples.

There seem to be two situations which may be conceived to be exempted from rain falling upon them; one where the constant trade-winds meet beneath the line, for here two regions of warm air are mixed together, and thence do not seem to have any cause to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate their vapour; and the other is, where the winds are brought from col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der climates and become warmer by their contact with the earth of a warmer one. Thus Lower Egypt is a flat country warmed by the sun more than the higher lands on one side of it, and than the Mediterranean on the other; and hence the winds which blow over it acquire greater warmth, which ever way they come, than they possessed before, and in consequence have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to acquire and not to part with their vapour, like the north-east winds of this country. There is said to be a narrow spot upon the coast of Peru, where rain seldom occurs; at the same time, according to Ulloa, on the mountainous regions of the Andes, beyond, there is almost perpetual rain. For the wind blows uniformly upon this hot part of the coast of Peru, but no cause of devaporation occurs till it begins to ascend the mountainous Andes, and then its own expansion produces cold sufficient to condense its vapour.</note>

The boiling column of water at Giesar in Ice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, was nineteen feet in diameter, and sometimes rose to the height of ninety-two feet. On cooling, it deposited a siliceous matter, or chalcedony, forming a bason round its base. The heat of this water before it rose out of the earth could not be ascertained, as water loses all its heat above 212 (as soon as it is at liberty to expand) by the exhalation of a part; but the flinty bason which is deposited from it shews that water, with great degrees of heat, will dissolve siliceous matter.

Since the above account, in the year 1780, this part of Iceland has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by an earthquake, or covered with lava, which was probably effected by the force of aqueous steam, a greater quantity of water falling on the subterraneous fires than could escape by the ancient outlets, and generating an increased quantity of vapour.

The bath at Buxton being of 82 degrees of heat, is called a warm bath, and is so compared with common spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, which possesses but 48 degrees of heat, but is nevertheless a cold bath compared to the heat of the body, which is 98. On going into this bath there is therefore always a chill perceived at the first immersion; but after having been in it a minute, the chill ceases, and a sensation of warmth suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, though the body continues to be immersed in the water. The cause of this curious phenomenon is to be looked for in the laws of animal sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not from any properties of heat. When a person goes from clear day-light into an obscure room, for a while it appears gloomy, which gloom, however, in a little time ceases, and the deficiency of light becomes no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger perceived. This is not solely owing to the enlargement of the iris of the eye, since that is performed in an instant, but to this law of sensation, that when a less stimulus is applied (within certain bounds) the sensibility in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases. Thus, at going into a bath as much colder than the body as that of Buxton, the diminution of heat on the skin is at first perceived; but in about a minute the sensibility to heat, increases and the nerves of the skin are equally excited by the lessened stimulus. The sensation of warmth at emerging from a cold bath, and the pain called the hot-ach, after the hands have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersed in snow, depend on the same principle, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the increased sensibility of the skin after having been previously exposed to a stimulus less than usual.</note>

Until very lately water was esteemed a simple element; nor are all the most celebrated chemists of Europe yet converts to the new opinion of its decomposition. Mr. Lavoisier, and others of the French school, have most ingeniously endeavoured to shew, that water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of pure air, called by them oxygene, and of inflammable air, called hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drogene, with as much of the matter of heat, or calorique, as is necessary to preserve them in the form of gas. Gas is distinguished from steam by its preserving its elasticity under the pressure of the atmosphere, and in the greatest degrees of cold yet known. The history of the progress of this great discovery is detailed in the Memoirs of the Royal Academy for 1781, and the experimental proofs of it are delivered in Lavoisier's Elements of Chemistry. The results of which are, that water consists of eighty-five parts, by weight, of oxygene, and fifteen parts, by weight, of hydrogene, with a sufficient quantity of calorique. Not only numerous chemical phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena, but many atmospherical and vegetable facts receive clear and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful elucidation from this important analysis. In the atmosphere, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable air is probably perpetually uniting with vital air, and producing moisture, which descends in dews and showers; while the growth of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, by the assistance of light, is perpetually again decomposing the water they imbibe from the earth, and while they retain the inflammable air for the formation of oils, wax, honey, resin, &amp;c. they give up the vital air to replenish the atmosphere.</note>

The foamy appearance of water, when the pressure of the air over it is diminished, is owing to the expansion and escape of the air previously dissolved by it, or existing in its pores.—When a child first sucks, it only presses or champs the teat, as observed by the great Harvey, but afterwards it learns to make an incipient vacuum in its mouth, and acts, by removing the pressure of the atmosphere from the nipple, like a pump.</note>

The addition of an air-cell to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines for raising water to extinguish fire, was first introduced by Mr. Newsham, of London, and is now applied to similar engines for washing wall-trees in gardens, and to all kinds of forcing pumps, and might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, with advantage, to lifting pumps, where the water is brought from a great distance horizontally. Another kind of machine was invented by one Greyl, in which a vessel of water was every way dispersed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plosion of gun-powder lodging in the centre of it, and lighted by an adapted match; from this idea Mr. Godfrey proposed a water-bomb of similar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. Dr. Hales, to prevent the spreading of fire, proposed to cover the floors and stairs of the adjoining houses with earth: Mr. Hartley proposed to prevent houses from taking fire, by covering the cieling with thin iron plates; and Lord Mahon, by a bed of coarse mortar, or plaister, between the cieling and floor above it. May not this age of chemical sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence discover some method of injecting or soaking timber with lime-water, and afterwards with vitriolic acid, and thus fill its pores with alabaster? or of penetrating it with siliceous matter, by processes similar to those of Bergman and Achard?

The upper side of the leaf is the organ of vegetable respiration, as explained in the additional notes, No. XXXVII. hence the leaf is liable to injury from much moisture on this surface, and is destroyed by being smeared with oil, in these respects resembling the lungs of animals, or the spiracula of insects. To prevent these injuries, some leaves repel the dew-drops from their upper surfaces, as those of cabbages; other vegetables close the upper surfaces of their leaves together in the night, or in wet weather, as the sensitive plant; others only hang their leaves downwards, so as to shoot the wet from them, as kidney-beans, and many trees. See note on I. 18 of this Canto.</note>

                              <hi>Golden bell.</hi> l. 460. There are muscles placed about the foot-stalks of the leaves or leaflets of many plants, for the purpose of closing their upper sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces together, or of bending them down so as to shoot off the showers or dew-drops, as mentioned in the preceding note. The claws of the petals, or of the divisions of the calyx of many flowers, are furnished in a similar manner with muscles, which are exerted to open or close the corol and calyx of the flower, as in tragopogon, anemone. This action of opening and closing the leaves or flowers, does not appear to be produced simply by <hi>irritation</hi> on the muscles themselves, but by the connection of those muscles with a <hi>sensitive</hi> sensorium, or brain, existing in each individual bud or flower. 1st. Because many flowers close from the defect of stimulus, not by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of it, as by darkness, which is the absence of the stimulus of light; or by cold, which is the absence of the stimulus of heat. Now, the defect of heat, or the absence of food, or of drink, affects, our <hi>sensations,</hi> which had been previously accustomed to a greater quantity of them; but a muscle can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to be stimulated into action by a defect of stimulus. 2d. Because the muscles around the foot-stalks of the subdivisions of the leaves of the sensitive plant are exerted when any injury is offered to the other extremity of the leaf, and some of the stamens of the flowers of the class Syngenesia, contract themselves when others are irritated. See note on Chondrilla, vol. II. of this work.</p>
                           <p>From this circumstance, the contraction of the muscles of vegetables seems to depend on a disagreeable <hi>sensation</hi> in some distant part, and not on the <hi>irritation</hi> of the muscles themselves. Thus, when a particle of dust stimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the ball of the eye, the eye-lids are instantly closed, and when too much light pains the retina, the muscles of the iris contract its aperture, and this not by any connection or consent of the nerves of those parts, but as an effort to prevent or to remove a disagreeable sensation, which evinces that vegetables are endued with sensation, or that each bud has a common sensorium, and is furnished with a brain, or a central place, where its nerves are connected.</p>

Besides the supplying water to the herbage in dryer seasons, it seems to defend it from frost in the early part of the year, and thus doubly advances the vegetation. The waters which rise from springs passing through marl or limestone, are replete with calcareous earth, and when thrown over morasses, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit this earth, and incrust or consolidate the morass. This kind of earth is deposited in great quantity from the springs at Matlock bath, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the soft porous limestone, of which the houses and walls are there constructed; and has formed the whole bank, for near a mile, on that side of the Derwent on which they stand.</p>
                           <p>The water of many springs contains much azotic gas, or phlogistic air, besides carbonic gas, or fixed air, as that of Buxton and Bath; this being set at liberty, may more readily contribute to the production of nitre, by means of the putrescent matters which it is exposed to by being spread upon the surface of the land, in the same manner as frequently turning over heaps of manure facilitates the nitrous process, by imprisoning atmospheric air in the interstices of the putrescent materials. Water, arising by land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floods, brings along with it much of the most soluble parts of the manure from the higher lands to the lower ones. River-water, in its clear state, and those springs which are called soft, are less beneficial for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of watering lands, as they contain less earthy or saline matter; and water, from dissolving snow from its slow solution, brings but little earth along with it, as may be seen by the comparative clearness of the water of snow-floods.</p>

The importance of the nectarium, or honey-gland, in the vegetable economy, is seen from the very complicated apparatus which nature has formed in some flowers, for the preservation of their honey from insects, as in the aconites or monkshoods; in other plants, instead of a great apparatus for its protection, a greater secretion of it is produced, that thence a part may be spared to the depredation of insects. The cacalia suaveolens produces so much honey, that, on some days, it may be smelt at a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the plant. I remember once counting on one of these plants, besides bees of various kinds without number, above two hundred painted butterflies, which gave it the beautiful appearance of being covered with additional flowers.</note>

                              <hi>The enamour'd Oxygene.</hi> l. 34. The common air of the atmosphere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, by the analysis of Dr. Priestley, and other philosophers, to consist of about three parts of an elastic fluid, unfit for respiration or combustion, called azote by the French school, and about one fourth of pure vital air, fit for the support of animal life and of combustion, called oxygene. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal source of the azote is probably from the decomposition of all vegetable and animal matters by putrefaction and combustion: the principal source of vital air, or oxygene, is, perhaps, from the decomposition of water in the organs of vegetables, by means of the sun's light. The difficulty of injecting vegetable vessels seems to shew, that their perspirative pores are much less than those of animals, and that the water which constitutes their perspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is so divided at the time of its exclusion, that, by means of the sun's light, it becomes decomposed; the inflammable air, or hydrogene, which is one of its constituent parts, being retained to form the oil, resin, wax, honey &amp;c. of the vegetable economy; and the other part, which, united with light or heat, becomes vital air, or oxygene gas, rises into the atmosphere, and replenishes it with the food of life.</p>
                           <p>Dr. Priestley has evinced, by very ingenious experiments, that the blood gives out phlogiston, and receives vital air, or oxygene gas, by the lungs. And Dr. Crawford has shewn, that the blood acquires heat from this vital air in respiration. There is, however, still a something more subtil than heat, which must be obtained in respiration from the vital air; a something which life cannot exist a few minutes without, which seems necessary to the vegetable as well as to the animal world, and which, as no organized vessels can confine it, requires perpetually to be renewed.

                              <hi>Arrest Simoom.</hi> I. 65. "At eleven o'clock, while we were, with great pleasure, contemplating the rugged tops of Chiggre, where we expected to solace ourselves with plenty of good water, Idris cried out, with a loud voice, 'fall upon faces, for here is the simoom!' I saw from the S. E. a haze come in colour like the purple part of a rainbow, but not so compressed or thick; it did not occupy twenty yards in breadth, and was about twelve feet high from the ground. It was a kind of a blush upon the air, and it moved very rapidly, for I scarce could turn to fall upon the ground, with my head to the northward, when I felt the heat of its current plainly upon my face. We all lay flat upon the ground, as if dead, till Idris told us it was blown over. The meteor, or purple haze which I saw, was indeed passed, but the light air that still blew, was of heat to threaten suffocation. For my part, I found distinctly in my breast, that I had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed a part of it; nor was I free of an asthmatic sensation till I had been some months in Italy." Bruce's Travels, vol. IV. p. 557.</p>
                           <p>It is difficult to account for the narrow track of this pestilential wind, which is said not to exceed twenty yards, and for its small elevation of twelve feet. A whirlwind will pass forwards, and throw down an avenue of trees, by its quick revolution, as it passes; but nothing like a whirlwind is described as happening in these narrow streams of air, and whirlwind as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to greater heights. There seems but one known manner in which this channel of air could be effected, and that is by electricity.</p>
                           <p>The volcanic origin of these winds is mentioned in the note on Chunda, in vol. II. of this work: it must here be added, that Professor Vairo, at Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, found, that during the eruption of Vesuvius, perpendicular iron bars were electric; and other have observed suffocating damps to attend these eruptions.

And, lastly, that a current of air attends the passage of electric matter, as is seen in presenting an elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trized point to the flame of a candle. In Mr. Bruce's account of this si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moom, it was in its course over a quite dry desert of sand, (and which was, in consequence, unable to conduct an electric stream into the earth beneath it,) to some moist rocks at but a few miles distance, and thence would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a stream of electricity from a volcano, attended with noxious air; and as the bodies of Mr. Bruce and his attendants were insulated on the sand, they would not be sensible of their increased electricity, as it passed over them; to which it may be added, that a sulphurous or suffocating sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation is said to accompany flashes of lightning, and even strong sparks of artificial electricity. In the above account of the simoom, a great redness in the air is said to be a certain sign of its approach, which may be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by the eruption of flame from a distant volcano in these extensive and impenetrable deserts of sand.

All contagious miasmata originate either from animal bodies, as those of the small-pox, or from putrid morasses; these latter produce agues in the colder climates, and malignant fevers in the warmer ones. The volcanic vapours which cause epidemic coughs, are to be ranked amongst poisons, rather than amongst the miasmata, which produce contagious diseases.</note>

                              <hi>Torricell and Boyle. l. 128.</hi> The pressure of the atmosphere was discovered by Torricelli, a disciple of Galileo, who had previously found that the air had weight. Dr. Hook, and M. du Hamel, ascribe the invention of the air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pump to Mr. Boyle, who, however, confesses he had some hints concerning its construction from de Guerick. The vacancy at the summit of the baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter is termed the Torricellian vacuum, and the exhausted receiver of an air-pump, the Boylean vacuum, in honour of these two philosophers.</p>
                           <p>The mist and descending dew which appear at first exhausting the receiver of an air-pump, are explained in the Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXVIII. from the cold produced by the expansion of air. For a thermometer placed in the receiver, sinks some degrees, and in a very little time; as soon as a sufficient quantity of heat can be acquired from the surrounding bodies, the dew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes again taken up. See additional notes, No. VII. Mr. Saussure ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, on placing his hygrometer in a receiver of an air-pump, that though, on beginning to exhaust it, the air became misty, and parted with its moisture, yet the hair of his hygrometer contracted, and the instrument pointed to greater dryness. This unexpected occurrence is explained by M. Monge, (Annales de Chimie, Tom. V.) to depend on the want of the usual pressure of the atmosphere, to force the aqueous particles into the pores of the hair; and M. Saussure supposes, that his vesicular vapour requires more time to be re-dissolved, than is necessary to dry the hair of his thermometer. Essais sur I'Hygrom. p. 226. But I suspect there is a less hypothetical way of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it: when a colder body is brought into warm and moist air, (as a bottle of spring-water, for instance,) a steam is quickly collected on its sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face: the contrary occurs when a warmer body is brought into cold and damp air; it continues free from dew so long as it continues warm; for it warms the atmosphere around it, and renders it capable of receiving, instead of parting with moisture. The moment the air becomes rarefied in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver of the air-pump; it becomes colder, as appears by the thermometer, and deposits its vapour; but the hair of Mr. Saussure's hygrometer is now warmer than the air in which it is immersed, and, in consequence, becomes dryer than before, by warming the air which immediately surrounds it, a part of its moisture evaporating along with its heat.</p>

                              <hi>Where oft your Priestly.</hi> l. 178. The fame of Dr. Priestley is known in every parts of the earth where science has penetrated. His various discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries respecting the analysis of the atmosphere, and the production of a variety of new airs or gasses, can only be clearly understood by reading his Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on Airs, (3 vols. octavo. Johnson. Lond.) The following are amongst his many discoveries. 1. The discovery of nitrous and dephlogisticated airs. 2. The exhibition of the acids and alkalies in the form of air. 3. Ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the purity of respirable air by nitrous air. 4. The restoration of vitiated air by vegetation. 5. The influence of light to enable vegetables to yield pure air 6. The conversion, by means of light, of animal and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable substances, that would otherwise become putrid and offensive, into nourishment of vegetables. 7. The use of respiration by the blood parting with phlogiston, and imbibing dephlogisticated air.</p>
                           <p>The experiments here alluded to are, 1. Concerning the production of nitrous gas from dissolving iron, and many other metals in nitrous acid, which, though first discovered by Dr. Hales, (Static. Ess. Vol. p. 224,) was fully investigated, and applied to the important purpose of distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the purity of atmospheric air by Dr. Priestley. When about two mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of common air, and one of nitrous gas, are mixed together, a red effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence takes place, and the two airs occupy about one-south less space than was previously occupied by the common air alone.</p>
                           <p n="2">Concerning the green substance which grows at the bottom of reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs of water, which Dr. Priestly discovered to yield much pure air when the sun shone on it. His method of collecting this air is by placing over the green substance, which he believes to be a vegetable of the genus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serva, an inverted bell-glass previously filled with water, which subsides as the air arises; it has since been sound that all vegetables give up pure air from their leaves, when the sun shines upon them, but not in the night, which may be owing to the sleep of the plant.</p>
                           <p n="3">The third refers to the great quantity of pure air contained in the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of metals. The calces were long known to weigh much more than the metallic bodies before calcination, insomuch that 100 pounds of lead will produce 112 pounds of minium; the ore of manganese, which is always found near the surface of the earth, is replete with pure air, which is now used for the purpose of bleaching. Other metals, when exposed to the atmosphere, attract the pure air from it, and become calces by its combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as zink, lead, iron; and increase in weight in proportion to the air which they imbibe.</p>

                              <hi>Led by the Sage.</hi> l 207. Dr. Priestley's discovery of the production of pure air from such variety of substances will probably soon be applied to the improvement of the diving-bell, as the substances which contain vital air in immense quantities are of little value, as manganese and minium. See additional notes, No. XXXIII. In every hundred weight of minium there is combined about twelve pounds of pure air; now, as sixty pounds of water are about a cubic foot, and as air is eight hundred times lighter than water, five hundred weight of minium will produce eight hundred cubic feet of air, or about six thousand gallons. Now, as this is at least thrice as pure as atmospheric air, a gallon of it may be supposed to serve for three minutes respiration for one man. At present the air can not be set at liberty from minium, by vitriolic acid, without the application of some heat; this is, however, very likely soon to be discovered, and will then enable adventurers to journey beneath the ocean in large inverted ships, or diving balloons.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Boyle relates, that Cornelius Drebelle contrived not only a vessel to be rowed under water, but also a liquor to be carried in that vessel which would supply the want of fresh air. The vessel was made by order of James I. and carried twelve rowers besides passengers. It was tried in the river Thames, and one of the persons who was in that submarine voyage, told the particulars of the experiments to a person who related them to Mr. Boyle.

Mr. Day perished in a diving-bell, or diving-boat, of his own construction, at Plymouth, in June, 1774, in which he was to have continued, for a wager, twelve hours, one hundred feet deep in water, and probably perished from his not possessing all the hydrostatic knowledge that was necessary. See note on Ulva, vol. 11. of this work. See Annual Register for 1774, p. 245.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Spalding was professionally ingenious in the art of constructing and managing the diving-bell, and had practised the business many years with success. He went down, accompanied by one of his young men, twice, to view the wreck of the Imperial East-Indiaman, at the Kish bank, in Ireland. On descending the third time, in June, 1783, they remained about an hour under water, and had two barrels of air sent down to them; but, on the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals from below not being again repeated, after a certain time, they were drawn up their assistants, and both found dead in the bell. Annual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister for 1783, p. 206. These two unhappy events may, for a time, check the ardor of adventurers in traversing the bottom of the ocean; but, it is probable, in another half century it may be safer to travel under the ocean than over it, since Dr. Priestley's discovery of procuring pure air in such great abundance from the calces of metals.</p>

The pestilential winds of the east are described by various authors under various denominations, as harmattan, samiel, samium, syrocca, kamsin, seravansum, M. de Beauchamp describes a remarkable south wind in the deserts about Bagdad, called scravansum, or poison wind; it burns the face, impedes respiration, strips the trees of their leaves, and is said to pass on in a straight line, and often kills people in six hours.

Vol 1. p. 61. These winds blow in all directions from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts; in Egypt the most violent proceed from the S. S.

                           <p>These winds seem all to be of volcanic origin, as before mentioned, with this difference, that the simoom is attended with a stream of electric matter; they seem to be in consequence of earthquakes caused by the monsoon floods, which fall on volcanic fires in Syria, at the-same time that they inundate the Nile.</p>

                           <hi>One golden secret.</hi> l. 320. The suddenness of the change of the wind from N. E. to S. W. seems to shew that it depends on some minute chemical cause, which, if it was discovered, might probably, like other chemical causes, be governed by human agency, such as blowing up rocks by gun-powder, or extracting the lightning from the clouds. If this could be accomplished, it would be the most happy discovery that ever has happened in these northern latitudes, since in this country the N. E. winds bring frost, and the S W. ones are attended with warmth and moisture; if the inferior currents of air could be kept perpetually from the S. W. supplied by new productions if air at the line, or by superior currents flowing in a contrary directions, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation of this country would be doubled, as in the moist vallies of Africa, which know no frost; the number of its inhabitants would be increased, and their lives prolonged; as great abundance of the aged and infirm of mankind, as well as many birds and animals, are destroyed by severe continued frosts in this climate.</note>

Nature would seem to have been wonderfully prodigal in the seeds of vegetables, and the spawn of fish; almost any one plant, if all its seeds should grow to maturity, would, in a few years, alone people the terrestrial globe. Mr. Ray asserts that 1012 seeds of tobacco weighed only one grain, and that from one tobacco plant the seeds thus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated amounted to 360,000. The seeds of the ferns are by him supposed to exceed a million on a leaf. As the works of nature are governed by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral laws, this exuberant re-production prevents the accidental extinction of the species, at the same time that they serve for food for the higher orders of animation.</p>
                           <p>Every seed possesses a reservoir of nutriment designed for the growth of the future plant; this consists of starch, mucilage, or oil, within the coat of the seed, or of sugar and sub-acid pulp in the fruit, which belongs to it.</p>
                           <p>For the preservation of the immature seed, nature has used many ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous methods; some are wrapped in down, as the seeds of the rose, bean, and cotton-plant; others are suspended in a large air-vessel, as those of the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-sena, staphylaea, and pea.</p>

                           <p>The pith seems to push up or elongate the bud by its elasticity, like the pith in the callow quilis of birds.

                           <p>The lobes are reservoirs of prepared nutriment for the young seed, which is absorbed by its placental vessels, and converted into sugar, till it has pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated with its roots far enough into the earth to extract sufficient moisture, and has acquired leaves to convert it into nourishment. In some plants these lobes rise from the earth, and supply the place of leaves, as in kidney-beans, cucumbers; and hence seem to serve both as a placenta to the soetus, and lungs to the young plant. During the process of germination, the starch of the seed is converted into sugar, as is seen in the process of malting barley for the purpose of brewing. And is, on this account, very similar to the digestion of food in the stomachs of animals, which converts all their ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into a chyle, which consists of mucilage, oil, and sugar; the placenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of buds will be spoken hereafter.</p>

Mr. Whitmill advised to bind some of the most vigorous shoots with strong wire, and even some of the large roots; and Mr. Warner cuts what he calls a wild worm about the body of the tree, or scores the bark quite to the wood, like a screw, with a sharp knife. Bradley on Gardening, vol, II. p. 155. Mr. Fitzgerald produced flowers and fruit on wall-trees by cutting off a part of the bark. Phil. Trans. Ann. 1761. M. Buffon produced the same effect by a straight bandage put round a branch, Act. Paris, Ann. 1738, and concludes that an ingrafted branch bears better from its vessels being compressed by the callus.</p>
                           <p>A complete cylinder of the bark, about an inch in height, was cut off from the branch of a pear-tree, against a wall, in Mr. Howard's garden, at Lichfield, about five years ago; the circumcised part is now not above half the diameter of the branch above and below it, yet this branch has been full of fruit every year since, when the other branches of the tree bore only sparingly. I lately observed that the leaves of this wounded branch were smaller and paler, and the fruit less in size, and ripened sooner than on the other parts of the tree. Another branch has the bark taken off not quite all round, with much the same effect.</p>
                           <p>The theory of this curious vegetable fact has been esteemed difficult, but receives great light from the foregoing account of the individuality of buds. A flower-bud dies, when it has perfected its seed, like an annual plant, and hence requires no place on the bark for new roots to pass downwards; but, on the contrary, leaf-buds, as they advance into shoots, form new buds in the axilla of every leaf, which new buds require new roots to pass down the bark, and thus thicken as well as elongate the branch: now, if a wire or string he tied round the bark, many of these new roots cannot descend, and thence more of the buds will be converted into flower-buds.</p>
                           <p>It is customary to debark oak-trees in the spring, which are intended to be felled in the ensuing autumn, because the bark comes off easier at this season, and the sap-wood, or alburnum, is believed to become harder and more durable, if the tree remains till the end of summer. The trees, thus stripped of their bark, put forth shoots as usual, with acorns, on the 6th, 7th, and 8th joint, like vines; but in the branches I examined, the joints of the debarked trees were much shorter than those of other oak-trees; the acorns were more numerous; and no new buds were produced above the joints which bore acorns. From hence it appears that the branches of debarked oak-trees produce fewer leaf-buds, and more flower-buds, which last circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, I suppose, must depend on their being sooner or later debarked in the vernal months. And, secondly, that the new buds of debarked oak-trees continue to obtain moisture from the alburnum, after the season of the ascent of sap in other vegetables ceases; which, in this unnatural state of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked tree, may act as capillary tubes, like the alburnum of the small de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked cylinder of a pear-tree above-mentioned; or may continue to act as placental vessels, as happens to the animal embryon in cases of superfetation; when the foetus continues a month or two in the womb beyond its usual time, of which some instances have been recorded, the placenta continues to supply, perhaps, the double office both of nutrition and of respiration.</p>

Mr. Hitt, in his treatise on fruit-trees, observes, that if a vigorous branch of a wall-tree be bent to the horizon, or beneath it, it loses its vigour, and becomes a bearing branch. The theory of this I suppose to depend on the difficulty with which the leaf-shoots can protrude the roots necessary for their new progeny of buds upwards, along the bended branch, to the earth, contrary to their natural habits or powers, whence more flower-shoots are produced, which do not require new roots to pass along the bark of the bended branch, but which let their offspring, the seeds, fall upon the earth, and seek roots for themselves.</note>

Thus, if the upper part of a branch be cut away, the buds near the extremity of the remaining stem, having a greater proportional supply of nutriment, or possessing a greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of shooting their roots, or absorbent vessels, down the bark, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leaf-buds, which might otherwise have been flower-buds, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; as explained in note on 1. 479 of this Canto.</note>

The buds did not take; nevertheless, in a fortnight, yellow spots began to shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves about three feet above the inoculation, and in a short time afterwards yellow spots appeared on a shoot which came out of the ground from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other part of the plant. Bradley, vol. II. p. 129. These facts are the more curious, since, from experiments of ingrafting red currants on black, (ib. vol.

This spider is called by Linnaeus arenea avicularia, with a convex orbicular thorax, the centre transversely excavated; he adds, that it catches small birds as well as insects, and has the venomous bite of a serpent. System. Nature Tom. I. p. 1034. M. Lonvilliers de Poincy, (Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoire Nat. des Antilles, Cap. xiv. art. III.) calls it phalange, and describes the body to the size of a pigeon's egg, with a hollow on its back like a navel, and mentions its catching the humming-bird in its strong nets.</p>
                           <p>The similitude of this flower to this great spider, seems to be a vegetable contrivance to prevent the humming-bird from plundering its honey. About Matlock, in Derbyshire, the fly-ophris is produced, the nectary of which so much resembles the small wall-bee, perhaps the apis ichneumonea, that it may be easily mistaken for it at a small distance. It is probable that by this means it may often escape being plundered. See note on lonicera, in the next poem.</p>

There is a disease frequently affects the rye in France, and sometimes in England in moist seasons, which is called Ergot, or horn-seed; the grain becomes considerably elongated, and is either straight or crooked, containing black meal along with the white, and appears to be pierced by insects, which were probably the cause of the disease. Mr. Du Hamel ascribes it to this cause, and compares it to galls on oak-leaves.

The chemists and astronomers, from the earliest an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, have used the same characters to represent the metals and the planets, which were most probably outlines or abstracts of the original hieroglyhic figures of Egypt. These afterwards acquired niches in their temples, and represented Gods as well as metals and planets; whence silver is called Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana, or the moon, in the books of alchemy.</p>
                           <p>The process for making Diana's silver tree is thus described by Lemeri. Dissolve one ounce of pure silver in acid of nitre, very pure, and moderately strong; mix this solution with about twenty ounces of distilled water; add to this two ounces of mercury, and let it remain at rest. In about four days there will form upon the mercury a tree of silver, with branches imitating vegetation.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. As the mercury has a greater affinity than silver with the nitrous acid, the silver becomes precipitated; and, being deprived of the nitrous oxygene by the mercury, sinks down in its metallic form and lustre. 2. The attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between silver and mercury, which causes them readily to amalgamate together, occasions the precipitated silver to adhere to the surface of the mercury in preference to any other part of the vessel. 3. The attraction of the particles of the precipitated silver to each other, causes the beginning branches to thicken and elongate into trees and shrubs rooted on the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury. For other circumstances concerning this beautiful experiment, see Mr. Keir's Chemical Dictionary, art. Arbor Dianae; a work, perhaps, of greater utility to mankind than the lost Alexandrian Library, the continuation of which is so eagerly expected by all who are occupied in the arts, or attached to the sciences.</p>

                     <p>THERE seem to be three concentric strata of our incumbent atmosphere; in which, or between them, are produced four kinds of meteors; lightning, shooting stars, fire-balls, and northern lights. First, the lower region of air, or that which is dense enough to resist, by the adhesion of its particles, the descent of condensed vapour, or clouds, which may extend from one to three or four miles high. In this region the common lightning is produced from the accumulation or defect of electric matter in those floating fields of vapour, either in respect to each other, or in respect to the earth beneath them, or the dissolved vapour above them, which is constantly varying both with the change of the form of the clouds, which thus evolve a greater or less surface; and also with their ever-changing degree of condensation. As the lightning is thus produced in dense air, it proceeds but a short course, on account of the greater resistance which it encounters, is attended with a loud explosion, and appears with a red light.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second region of the atmosphere I suppose to be that which has too little tenacity to support condensed vapour, or clouds; but which yet contains invisible vapour, or water in aerial solution. This aerial solution of water differs from that dissolved in the matter of heat, as it is supported by its adhesion to the particles of air, and is not precipitated by cold. In this stratum it seems probable that the meteors called shooting stars are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; and that they consist of electric sparks, or lightning, passing from one region to another of these invisible fields of aero-aqueous solution. The height of these shooting stars has not yet been ascertained by sufficient ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation. Dr. Blagden thinks their situation is lower down in the atmos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere than that of fire-balls, which he conjectures from their swift apparent motion, and ascribes their smallness to the more minute division of the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric matter of which they are supposed to consist, owing to the greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the denser medium through which they pass, than that in which the fire-balls exist. Mr. Brydone observed that the shooting stars appeared
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:033600_0156_0FF79EBCC32E1E10"/>
to him to be as high in the atmosphere, when he was near the summit of Mount Etna, as they do when observed from the plain. Phil. Trans. vol. LXIII.</p>
                     <p>As the stratum of air in which shooting stars are supposed to exist, is much rarer than that in which lightning resides, and yet much denser than that in which fire-balls are produced, they will be attracted at a greater distance than the former, and at a less than the latter. From this rarity of the air, so small a sound will be produced by their explosion, as not to reach the lower parts of the atmosphere; their quantity of light, from their greater distance, being small, is never seen through dense air at all, and thence does not appear red, like lightning or fire-balls. There are no apparent clouds to emit or to attract them, because the constituent parts of these aero-aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous regions may possess an abundance or deficiency of electric matter, and yet be in perfect reciprocal solution. And, lastly, their apparent train of light is probably owing only to a continuance of their impression on the eye; as when a fire stick is whirled in the dark it gives the appearance of a complete circle of fire: for these white trains of shooting stars quickly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, and do not seem to set any thing on fire in their passage, as seems to happen in the transit of fire-balls.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The second region or stratum of air terminates, I suppose, where the twilight ceases to be refracted, that is, where the air is 3000 times rarer than at the surface of the earth and where it seems probable that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon air ends, and is surrounded by an atmosphere of inflammable gas ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold rarer than itself. In this region I believe fire-balls sometimes to pass, and at other times the northern lights to exist. One of these fire-balls, or draco volans, was observed by Dr. Pringle, and many others, on Nov. 26, 1758, which was afterwards estimated to have been a mile and a half in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, to have been about one hundred miles high, and to have moved towards the north with a velocity of near thirty miles in a second of time. This meteor had a real tail many miles long, which threw off sparks in its course, and the whole exploded, with a sound like distant thunder. Phil. Trans. vol. LI.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Blagden has related the history of another large meteor, or fire-ball, which was seen the 18th August, 1783, with many ingenious observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and conjectures. This was estimated to be between 60 and 70 miles high, and to travel 1000 miles at the rate of about twenty miles in a second. This fire-ball had likewise a real train of light lest behind it in its passage, which varied in colour, and, in some part of its course, gave off sparks or explosions where it had been brightest; and a dusky red streak remained visible perhaps a minute. Phil. Trans. vol. LXXIV.</p>
                     <p>These fire-balls differ from lightning, and from shooting stars, in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable circumstances; as their very great bulk, being a mile and a half in diameter; their travelling 1000 miles nearly horizontally; their throwing off sparks in their passage; and changing colours from bright blue to dusky red; and leaving a train of fire behind them, continuing about a minute. They differ from the northern lights in not being dissused, but passing from one point of the heavens to another in a defined line; and this in a region
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:033600_0157_0FF79EBE8CA83C00"/>
above the crepuscular atmosphere, where the air is 3000 times rarer than at the surface of the earth. There has not yet been even a conjecture which can account for these appearances!—One I shall therefore hazard; which, if it does not inform, may amuse the reader.</p>
                     <p>In the note on l. 123, it was shewn that there is probably a supernatant stratum of inflammable gas or hydrogene, over the common atmosphere; and whose density at the surface where they meet, must be at least ten times less than that upon which it swims; like chemical ether floating upon water, and perhaps without any real contact. 1. In this region, where the aerial atmosphere terminates, and the inflammable one begins, the quantity of tenacity or resistance must be almost inconceivable; in which a ball of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity might pass 1000 miles with greater ease than through a thousandth part of an inch of glass. 2. Such a ball of electricity passing between in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable and common air, would set fire to them in a line as it passed along; which would differ in colour according to the greater proportionate commixture of the two airs; and from the same cause there might occur greater degrees of inflammation, or branches of fire, in some parts of its course.</p>
                     <p>As these fire-balls travel in a defined line, it is pretty evident from the known laws of electricity, that they must be attracted; and as they are a mile or more in diameter, they must be emitted from a large surface of electric matter; because large nobs give larger sparks, less diffused, and more brightly luminous, than less ones or points, and resist more forcibly the emission of the electric matter. What is there in nature can attract them at so great a distance as 1000 miles, and so forceibly as to detach an electric spark of a mile diameter? Can volcanos, at the time of their eruptions, have this effect, as they are generally attended with lightning? Future observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions must discover these secret operations of nature! As a stream of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon air is carried along with the passage of electric aura from one body to another, it is easy to conceive, that the common air and the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble air between which the fire-ball is supposed to pass, will be partially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed by being thus agitated, and so far as it becomes intermixed it will take fire, and produce the linear flame and branching sparks above described. In this circumstance of their being attracted, and thence passing in a defined line, the fire-balls seem to differ from the coruscations of the aurora borealis, or northern lights, which probably take place in the same region of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere; where the common air exists in extreme tenuity, and is covered by a still rarer sphere of inflammable gas, ten times lighter than itself.</p>
                     <p>As the electric streams, which constitute these northern lights, seem to be repelled or radiated from an accumulation of that fluid in the north, and not attracted like the fire-balls; this accounts for the diffusion of their light, as well as the silence of their passage; while their variety of colours, and the permanency of them, and even the breadth of them in different places, may depend on their sitting on fire the mixture of inflammable and common air through which they pass; as seems to happen in the transit of the fire-balls.</p>
                     <p>It was observed by Dr. Priestley, that the electric shock taken through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable air was red, in common air it is blueish; to these circumstances
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:033600_0158_0FF79EC227D05648"/>
perhaps some of the colours of the northern lights may bear analogy; though the density of the medium through which light is seen must principally vary its colour, as is well explained by Mr. Morgan. Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXV. Hence lightning is red when seen through a dark cloud, or near the horizon; because the more refrangible rays cannot permeate so dense a medium. But the shooting stars consist of white light, as they are generally seen on clear nights, and nearly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>; in other situations their light is probably too faint to come to us. But as in some remarkable appearances of the northern lights, as in March, 1716, all the prismatic colours were seen quickly to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed each other, these appear to have been owing to real combustion; as the density of the interposed medium could not be supposed to change so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; and therefore these colours must have been owing to different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of heat, according to Mr. Morgan's theory of combustion. In Smith's Optics, p. 69. the prismatic colours, and optical deceptions of the northern lights, are described by Mr. Cotes.</p>
                     <p>The Torricellian vacuum, if perfectly free from air, is said, by Mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and others, to be a perfect non-conductor. This circumstance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would preclude the electric streams from rising above the atmosphere. But as Mr. Morgan did not try to pass an electric shock through a vacuum, and as air, or something containing air, surrounding the transit of electricity, may be necessary to the production of light, the conclusion may perhaps still be dubious. If, however, the streams of the northern lights were supposed to rise above our atmosphere, they would only be visible at each extremity of their course; where they emerge from, or are again immerged into the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere; but not in their journey through the vacuum; for the absence of electric light in a vacuum is sufficiently proved by the common experiment of shaking a barometer in the dark; the electricity, produced by the friction of the mercury in the glass at its top, is luminous if the barometer has a little air in it; but there is no light if the vacuum be complete.</p>
                     <p>The aurora borealis, or northern dawn, is very ingeniously accounted for by Dr. Franklin, on principles of electricity. He premises the following elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric phenomena: 1. That all new-fallen snow has much positive electricity standing on its surface. 2. That about twelve degrees of latitude round the poles are covered with a crust of eternal ice, which is impervious to the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric fluid. 3. That the dense part of the atmosphere rises but a few miles high; and that in the rarer parts of it the electric fluid will pass to almost any distance.</p>
                     <p>Hence he supposes there must be a great accumulation of positive electric matter on the fresh-fallen snow in the polar regions; which, not being able to pass through the crust of ice into the earth, must rise into the rare air of the upper parts of our atmosphere, which will the least resist its passage; and passing towards the equator, descend again into the denser atmosphere, and thence into the earth in silent streams. And that many of the appearances attending these lights are optical deceptions, owing to the situation of the eye that beholds them; which makes all ascending parallel lines appear to converge to a point.</p>
                     <p>The idea, above explained in note on l. 123, of the existence of a sphere of
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:033600_0159_0FF79EC53AE6C410"/>
inflammable gas over the aerial atmosphere, would much favour this theory of Dr. Franklin; because in that case the dense aerial atmosphere would rise a much less height in the polar regions, diminishing almost to nothing at the pole itself; and thus give an easier passage to the ascent of the electric fluid. And from the great difference in the specific gravity of the two airs, and the velocity of the earth's rotation, there must be a place between the poles and the equator, where the superior atmosphere of inflammable gas would termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; which would account for these streams of the aurora borealis not appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near the equator; add to this, that it is probable the electric fluid may be heavier than the magnetic one; and will thence, by the rotation of the earth's surface, ascend over the magnetic one by its centrifugal force; and may thus be induced to rise through the thin stratum of aerial atmosphere over the poles. See note on Canto II. l. 193. I shall have occasion again to mention this great accumulation of inflammable air over the poles; and to conjecture that these northern lights may be produced by the union of inflammable with common air, without the assistance of the electric spark to throw them into combustion.</p>
                     <p>The antiquity of the appearance of northern lights has been doubted; as none were recorded in our annals since the remarkable one on Nov. 14, 1574. till another remarkable one on March 6, 1716, and the three following nights, which was seen at the same time in Ireland, Russia, and Poland, extending near 30 degrees of longitude, and from about the 50th degree of latitude over almost all the north of Europe. There is, however, reason to believe them of remote antiquity, though inaccurately described; thus the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing curious passage from the book of Maccabees (B. II. c. v.) is such a description of them, as might probably be given by an ignorant and alarmed people. "Through all the city, for the space of almost forty days, there were seen horsemen running in the air, in cloth of gold, and armed with lances, like a band of soldiers; and troops of horsemen in array encountering and running one against another, with shaking of shields and multitude of pikes, and drawing of swords, and casting of darts, and glittering of golden ornaments and harness."</p>

                     <p>THE manner in which the rainbow is produced, was, in some measure, understood before Sir Isaac Newton had discovered his theory of colours. The first person who expressly shewed the rainbow to be formed by the reflection of the sun-beams from drops of falling rain, was Antonio de Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis. This was afterwards more fully and distinctly explained by Des Cartes. But what caused the diversity of its colours was not then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; it was reserved for the immortal Newton to discover that the rays of light consisted of seven combined colours of different refrangibility, which
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:033600_0160_0FF79EC9D3DAA828"/>
could be separated at pleasure by a wedge of glass. Pemberton's View of Newton.</p>
                     <p>Sir Isaac Newton discovered that the prismatic spectrum was composed of seven colours, in the following proportions; violet 80, indigo 40, blue 60, green 60, yellow 48, orange 27, red 45. If all these colours be painted on a circular card, in the proportion above mentioned, and the card be rapidly whirled on its centre, they produce in the eye the sensation of white. And any one of these colours may be imitated by painting a card with the two colours which are contiguous to it, in the same proportions as in the spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum, and whirling them in the same manner.</p>
                     <p>My ingenious friend, Mr. Galton, of Birmingham, ascertained, in this manner, by a set of experiments, the following propositions; the truth of which he had preconceived from the above data.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Any colour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the prismatic spectrum may be imitated by a mixture of the two colours contiguous to it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If any three successive colours in the prismatic spectrum are mixed, they compose only the second or middlemost colour.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If any four successive colours in the prismatic spectrum be mixed, a tint similar to a mixture of the second and third colours will be produced, but not precisely the same, because they are not in the same proportion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If, beginning with any colour in the circular spectrum, you take of the second colour a quantity equal to the first, second, and third; and add to that the fifth colour, equal in quantity to the fourth, fifth, and sixth; and with these combine the seventh colour in the proportion it exists in the spectrum, white will be produced. Because the first, second, and third, compose only the second; and the fourth, fifth, and sixth, compose only the fifth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the seventh be added, the same effect is produced as if all the seven were employed.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Beginning with any colour in the circular spectrum, if you take a tint composed of a certain proportion of the second and third, (equal in quantity to the first, second, third, and fourth,) and add to this the sixth colour, equal in quantity to the fifth, sixth, and seventh, white will be produced.</p>
                     <p>From these curious experiments of Mr. Galton, many phenomena in the chemical changes of colours may probably become better understood; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if, as I suppose, the same theory must apply to transmitted colours, as to reflected ones. Thus it is well known, that if the glass of manganese, which is a tint probably composed of violet and indigo, be mixed in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proportion with the glass of lead, which is yellow, that the mixture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes transparent. Now, from Mr. Galton's experiments, it appears, that in reflected colours such a mixture would produce white, that is, the same as if all the colours were reflected. And, therefore, in transmitted colours the same circumstances must produce transparency, that is, the same as if all the colours were transmitted. For the particles which constitute the glass of manganese will transmit red, violet, indigo, and blue; and those of the glass of lead will transmit orange, yellow, and green; hence all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary colours, by a mixture of these glasses, become transmitted, that is, the glass becomes transparent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="unknown:033600_0161_0FF79ECB89237E28"/>
Mr. Galton has further observed, that five successive prismatic colours may be combined in such proportions as to produce but one colour, a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance which might be of consequence in the art of painting. For if you begin at any part of the circular spectrum above described, and take the first, second, and third colours, in the proportions in which they exist in the spectrum; these will compose only the second colour, equal in quantity to the first, second, and third; add to these the third, fourth and fifth, in the proportion they exist in the spectrum, and these will produce the fourth colour, equal in quantity to the third, fourth, and fifth. Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this is precisely the same thing as mixing the second and fourth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours only; which mixture would only produce the third colour. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if you combine the first, second, fourth and fifth, in the proportions in which they exist in the spectrum, with double the quantity of the third colour, this third colour will be produced. It is probable that many of the unexpected changes in mixing colours on a painter's pallet, as well as in more fluid chemical mixtures, may depend on these principles rather than on a new arrangement or combination of their minute particles.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Galton further observes, that white may universally be produced by the combination of one prismatic colour, and a tint intermediate to two others. Which tint may be distinguished by a name compounded of the two colours to which it is intermediate. Thus white is produced by a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of red with blue-green. Of orange with indigo-blue. Of yellow with violet-indigo. Of green with red-violet. Of blue with orange-red. Of indigo with yellow-orange. Of violet with green-yellow. Which, he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remarks, exactly coincides with the theory and facts mentioned by Dr. Robert Darwin, of Shrewsbury, in his account of ocular spectra; who has shewn, that when one of these contrasted colours has been long viewed, a spectrum, or appearance of the other, becomes visible in the fatigued eye. Phil. Trans. vol. LXXVI. for the year 1786.</p>
                     <p>These experiments of Mr. Galton might much assist the copper-plate prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of callicoes and papers in colours, as three colours, or more, might be produced by two copper-plates. Thus, suppose some yellow figures were put on by the first plate, and upon some parts of these yellow figures, and on other parts of the ground, blue was laid on by another copper-plate. The three colours of yellow, blue, and green, might be produced, as green leaves with yellow and blue flowers.</p>

                     <p>THE rays from the rising and setting sun are refracted by our spherical atmosphere; hence the most refrangible rays, as the violet, indigo, and blue, are reflected in greater quantities from the morning and evening skies; and
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:033600_0162_0FF79ECD23B9EB78"/>
the least refrangible ones, as red and orange, are last seen about the setting sun. Hence Mr. Beguelin observed, that the shadow of his finger on his pocket-book was much bluer in the morning and evening, when the shadow was about eight times as long as the body from which it was projected. Mr. Melville observes, that the blue rays being more refrangible, are bent down in the evenings by our atmosphere, while the red and orange, being less refrangible, continue to pass on, and tinge the morning and evening clouds with their colours. See Priestley's History of Light and Colours, p. 440. But as the particles of air, like those of water, are themselves blue, a blue shadow may be seen at all times of the day, though much more beautifully in the mornings and evenings, or by means of a candle in the middle of the day. For if a shadow on a piece of white paper is produced by placing your finger between the paper and a candle in the day light, the shadow will appear very blue; the yellow light of the candle upon the other parts of the paper apparently deepens the blue by its contrast, these colours being opposite to each other, as explained in note II.</p>
                     <p>Colours are produced from clouds or mists by refraction, as well as by reflection. In riding in the night over an unequal country, I observed a very beautiful coloured halo round the moon, whenever I was covered with a few feet of mist, as I ascended from the vallies, which ceased to appear when I rose above the mist. This I suppose was owing to the thinness of the stratum of mist in which I was immersed; had it been thicker, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours refracted by the small drops, of which a fog consists, would not have passed through it down to my eye.</p>
                     <p>There is a bright spot seen on the cornea of the eye, when we face a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which is much attended to by portrait-painters; this is the light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected from the spherical surface of the polished cornea, and brought to a focus; if the observer is placed in this focus, he sees the image of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; if he is placed before or behind the focus, he only sees a luminous spot, which is more luminous, and of less extent, the nearer he approaches to the focus. The luminous appearance of the eyes of animals in the dusky corners of a room, or in holes in the earth, may arise, in some instances, from the same principle; <abbr>viz.</abbr> the reflection of the light from the spherical cornea, which will be coloured red or blue, in some degree, by the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, evening, or meridian light, or by the objects from which that light is previously reflected. In the cavern at Colebrook Dale, where the mineral far exsudes, the eyes of the horse which was drawing a cart from within towards the mouth of it, appeared like two balls of phosphorus, when he was above 100 yards off, and for a long time before any other part of the animal was visible. In this case I suspect the luminous appearance to have been owing to the light which had entered the eye, being reflected from the back surface of the vitreous humor, and thence emerging again in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel rays from the animal's eye, as it does from the back surface of the drops of the rainbow, and from the water-drops which lie, perhaps without contact, on cabbage-leaves, and have the brilliancy of quick-silver. This accounts for this luminous appearance being best seen in those animals which have large apertures in their iris, as in cats and horses, and is the only part
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:033600_0163_0FF79ECFA7441408"/>
visible in obscure places, because this is a better reflecting surface than any other part of the animal. If any of these emergent rays from the animal's eye can be supposed to have been reflected from the choroid coat, through the semi-transparent retina, this would account for the coloured glare of the eyes of dogs, or cats, and rabits, in dark corners.</p>

                     <p>THERE have been many theories invented to account for the tails of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets. Sir Isaac Newton thinks that they consist of rare vapours raised from the nucleus of the comet, and so rarefied by the sun's heat as to have their general gravitation diminished, and that they, in consequence, ascend oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the sun, and from thence reflect the rays of light. Dr. Halley com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the light of the tails of comets to the streams of the aurora borealis, and other electric effluvia. Phil. Trans. No. 347.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Hamilton observes, that the light of small stars is seen undiminished through both the light of the tails of comets, and of the aurora borealis, and has farther illustrated their electric analogy; and adds, that the tails of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets consist of a lucid self-shining substance, which has not the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracting or reflecting the rays of light. Essays.</p>
                     <p>The tail of the comet of 1744, at one time appeared to extend above 16 degrees from its body, and must have thence been above twenty-three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of miles long. And the comet of 1680, according to the calculations of Dr. Halley, on Nov. the 11th, was not above one semi-diameter of the earth, or less than 4000 miles to the northward of the way of the earth; at which time had the earth been in that part of its orbit, what might have been the consequence! No one would probably have survived to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistered the tremendous effects.</p>
                     <p>The comet of 1531, 1607, and 1682, having returned in the year 1759, according to Dr. Halley's prediction in the Phil. Trans. for 1705, there seems no reason to doubt that all the other comets will return after their proper periods. Astronomers have in general acquiesced in the conjecture of Dr. Halley, that the comets of 1532, and 1661, are one and the same comet, from the similarity of the elements of their orbits, and were, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, induced to expect its return to its perihelium in 1789. As this comet is liable to be disturbed, in its ascent from the sun, by the planets Jupiter and Saturn, Dr. Maskelyne expected its return to its perihelium in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year 1789, or the latter end of the year 1788, and certainly some time before the 27th of April, 1789; which prediction has not been fulfilled. Phil. Trans. vol. LXXVI.</p>
                     <p>As the comets are small masses of matter, and pass in their perihelion very near the sun, and become invisible to us, on these accounts, in a short

space of time, their number has not yet been ascertained, and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably increase with the improvement of our telescopes. M. Bode has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a table of 72 comets, whose orbits are already calculated; of these 60 pass within the earth's orbit, and only twelve without it; and most of them appear between the orbits of Venus and Mercury, or nearly midway between the sun and earth; from whence, and from the planes of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits being inclined to that of the earth and other planets in all possible an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, they are believed to be less liable to interfere with, or injure each other. M. Bode afterwards inquires into the nearest approach it is possible for each of the known comets to make towards the earth's orbit. He finds that only three of them can come within a distance equal to two or three times the distance of the moon from it; and then adds the great improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that the earth should be in that dangerous point of its orbit, at the instant when a comet, which may have been absent some centuries, passes so rapidly past it.

                     <p>THE dispute among philosophers about phlogiston is not concerning the existence of an inflammable principle, but rather whether there be one or more inflammable principles. The disciples of Stahl, which till lately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the whole chemical world, believed in the identity of phlogiston in all bodies which would flame or calcine. The disciples of Lavoisier pay homage to a plurality of phlogistons, under the various names of charcoal, sulphur, metals, &amp;c. Whatever will unite with <hi>pure</hi> air, and thence compose an acid, is esteemed, in this ingenious theory, to be a different kind of phlogistic or inflammable body. At the same time there remains a doubt whether these inflammable bodies, as metals, sulphur, charcoal, &amp;c. may not be compounded of the same phlogiston along with some other material yet undiscovered, and thus an unity of phlogiston exist, as in the theory of Stahl, though very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently applied in the explication of chemical phenomena.</p>
                     <p>Some modern philosophers are of opinion, that the sun is the great fountain from which the earth and other planets derive all the phlogiston which they possess; and that this is formed by the combination of the solar rays with all opake bodies, but particularly with the leaves of vegetables, which they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be organs adapted to absorb them. And that as animals receive their nourishment from vegetables, they also obtain, in a secondary manner, their phlogiston from the sun. And lastly, as great masses of the mineral kingdom, which have been found in the thin crust of the earth which human labour has penetrated, have evidently been formed from the recrements of animal and vegetable bodies, these also are supposed thus to have derived their phlogiston from the sun.</p>
                     <p>Another opinion concerning the sun's rays is, that they are not luminous
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:033600_0165_0FF79ED63457F2B8"/>
till they arrive at our atmosphere; and that there uniting with some part of the air, they produce combustion, and light is emitted; and that an ethereal acid, yet undiscovered, is formed from this combustion.</p>
                     <p>The more probable opinion is, perhaps, that the sun is a phlogistic mass of matter, whose surface is in a state of combustion, which, like other burning bodies, emits light, with immense velocity, in all directions; that these rays of light act upon all opake bodies, and, combining with them, either displace or produce their elementary heat, and become chemically combined with the phlogistic part of them; for light is given out when phlogistic bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies unite with the oxygenous principle of the air, as in combustion, or in the reduction of metallic calxes; thus in presenting to the flame of a candle a letter-wafer (if it be coloured with red-lead) at the time the red-lead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a metallic drop, a flash of light is perceived. Dr. Alexander Wilson very ingeniously endeavours to prove, that the sun is only in a state of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion on its surface, and that the dark spots seen on the disk are excava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or caverns through the luminous crust, some of which are 4000 miles in diameter.

                     <p>M. DE MAIRAN, in a paper published in the Histoire de I' Academic de Sciences, 1765, has endeavoured to shew, that the earth receives but a small part of the heat which it possesses, from the sun's rays, but it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally heated by fires within itself. He thinks the sun is the cause of the vicissitudes of our seasons of summer and winter, by a very small quantity of heat in addition to that already residing in the earth, which, by emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the centre to the circumference, renders the surface habitable, and without which, though the sun was constantly to illuminate two thirds of the globe at once, with a heat equal to that at the equator, it would soon become a mass of solid ice. His reasonings and calculations on this subject are too long and too intricate to be inserted here, but are equally curious and ingenious, and carry much conviction along with them.</p>
                     <p>The opinion that the centre of the earth consists of a large mass of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lava, has been espoused by Boyle, Boerhaave, and many other philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers. Some of whom, considering its supposed effects on vegetation and the formation of minerals, have called it a second sun. There are many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in support of this opinion. 1. Because the power of the sun does not extend much beyond ten feet deep into the earth, all below being, in winter and summer, always of the same degree of heat, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 48, which being much warmer than the mildest frost, is supposed to be sustained by some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal distant fire. Add to this, however, that from experiments made some
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:033600_0166_0FF79ED7DECD0E38"/>
years ago by Dr. Franklin, the spring-water at Philadelphia appeared to be of 52 of heat, which seems farther to confirm this opinion, since the climates in North-America are supposed to be colder than those of Europe under similar degrees of latitude. 2. M. De Luc, in going 1359 feet perpendicular into the mines of Hartz, on July the 5th, 1778, on a very fine day, found the air at the bottom a little warmer than at the top of the shaft. Phil. Trans. vol. LXIX. p. 488. In the mines in Hungary, which are 500 cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits deep, the heat becomes very troublesome when the miners get below 480 feet depth. <hi>Morinus de L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>cis subter.</hi> p. 131. But as some other deep mines, as mentioned by Mr. Kirwan, are said to possess but the common heat of the earth; and as the crust of the globe, thus penetrated by human labour, is so thin compared with the whole, no certain deduction can be made from these facts on either side of the question. 3. The warm-springs in many parts of the earth, at great distance from any volcanos, seem to originate from the condensation of vapours arising from water which is boiled by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous fires, and cooled again in their passage through a certain length of the colder soil; for the theory of chemical solution will not explain the equality of their heat at all seasons, and through so many centuries. See note on Fucus, in vol. II. See a letter on this subject in Mr. Pilkinton's View of Derbyshire, from Dr. Darwin. 4. From the situations of volcanos which are always found upon the summit of the highest mountains. For as these mountains have been lifted up, and lose several of their uppermost strata as they rise, the lowest strata of the earth yet known appear at the tops of the highest hills; and the beds of the volcanos upon these hills must, in consequence, belong to the lowest strata of the earth, consisting, perhaps, of granite or basaltes, which were produced before the existence of animal or vegetable bodies, and might constitute the original nucleus of the earth, which I have supposed to have been projected from the sun; hence the vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canos themselves appear to be spiracula, or chimneys, belonging to great cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral fires. It is probably owing to the escape of the elastic vapours from these spiracula, that the modern earthquakes are of such small extent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with those of remote antiquity, of which the vestiges remain all over the globe. 5. The great size and height of the continents, and the great size and depth of the South-sea, Atlantic, and other oceans, evince that the first earthquakes, which produce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> these immense changes in the globe, must have been occasioned by central fires. 6. The very distant and expeditious communication of the shocks of some great earthquakes. The earthquake at Lisbon, in 1755, was perceived in Scotland, in the Peak of Derbyshire, and in many other distant parts of Europe. The percussions of it travelled with about the velocity of sound, <abbr>viz.</abbr> about thirteen miles in a minute. The earthquake in 1693 extended 2600 leagues. (Goldsmith's History.) These phenomena are easily explained if the central parts of the earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of a fluid lava, as a percussion on one part of such a fluid mass would be felt on other parts of its confining vault, like a stroke on a fluid contained in a bladder, which, however gentle on one side, is perceptible to the hand placed on the other; and the velocity with which such a concussion would travel, would be that of sound, or thirteen miles in a minute. For further

information on this part of the subject, the reader is referred to Mr. Michel's excellent treatise on earthquakes in the Phil. Trans. vol. LI. 7. That there is a cavity at the centre of the earth is made probable by the late experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the attraction of mountains, by Mr. Maskelyne, who supposed, from other considerations, that the density of the earth near the surface should be five times less than its mean density. Phil. Trans. vol. LX<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> probable, the mean density of the earth is but double that of the hill. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>. p. 532. Hence, if the first supposition be well founded, there would appear to be a cavity at the centre of considerable magnitude, from whence the immense beds and mountains of lava, toadstone, basaltes, granite, &amp;c. have been protruded. 8. The variation of the compass can only be accounted for by supposing the central parts of the earth to consist of a fluid mass, and that part of this fluid is iron, which, requiring a greater degree of heat to bring it into fusion than glass or other metals, remains a solid, and the vis inertae of this fluid mass, with the iron in it, occasions it to perform fewer revolutions than the crust of solid earth over it, and thus it is gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally left behind, and the place where the floating iron resides is pointed to by the direct or retrograde motions of the magnetic needle. This seems to have been nearly the opinion of Dr. Halley and Mr. Euler.</p>

                     <p>A CERTAIN quantity of heat seems to be combined with all bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the sensible quantity which gravitates like the electric fluid amongst them. This combined heat, or latent heat, of Dr. Black, when set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of fermentation, inflammation, crystallization, freezing, or other che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical attractions producing new <hi>combination,</hi> passes as a fluid element into the surrounding bodies. And by thawing, diffusion of neutral salts in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, melting, and other chemical <hi>solutions,</hi> a portion of heat is attracted from the bodies in vicinity, and enters into or becomes combined with the new solutions.</p>
                     <p>Hence a <hi>combination</hi> of metals with acids, of essential oils and acids, of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cohol and water, of acids and water, give out heat; whilst a <hi>solution</hi> of snow in water or in acids, and of neutral salts in water, attract heat from the surrounding bodies. So the acid of nitre mixed with oil of cloves unites with it, and produces a most violent flame; the same acid of nitre poured on snow instantly dissolves it, and produces the greatest degree of cold yet known, by which, at Petersburgh, quick-silver was first frozen in 1760.</p>
                     <p>Water may be cooled below 32 degrees without being frozen, if it be placed on a solid floor, and secured from agitation; but when thus cooled below the freezing point, the least agitation turns part of it suddenly into ice, and
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:033600_0168_0FF79EDDFA2A3A70"/>
when this sudden freezing takes place, a thermometer placed in it instantly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as some heat is given out in the act of congelation, and the ice is thus left with the same <hi>sensible</hi> degree of cold as the water had possessed before it was agitated, but is, nevertheless, now combined with less <hi>latent</hi> heat.</p>
                     <p>A cubic inch of water thus cooled down to 32 degrees, mixed with an equal quantity of boiling water at 212 degrees, will cool it to the middle number between these two, or to 132. But a cubic inch of ice, whose sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible cold also is but 32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mixed with an equal quantity of boiling water, will cool it six times as much as the cubic inch of cold water above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as the ice not only gains its share of the sensible or gravitating heat of the boiling water, but attracts to itself also, and combines with the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of latent heat which it had lost at the time of its congelation.</p>
                     <p>So boiling water will acquire but 212 degrees of heat under the common pressure of the atmosphere, but the steam raised from it by its expansion, or by its solution in the atmosphere, combines with and carries away a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious quantity of heat, which it again parts with on its condensation, as is seen in common distillation, where the large quantity of water in the worm tub is so soon heated. Hence the evaporation of ether on a thermometer soon sinks the mercury below freezing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hence a warmth of the air in winter frequently succeeds a shower.</p>
                     <p>When the matter of heat, or calorique, is set at liberty from its combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as by inflammation, it passes into the surrounding bodies, which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess different capacities of acquiring their share of the loose or sensible heat; thus a pint measure of cold water at 48 degrees, mixed with a pint of boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water at 212 degrees, will cool it to the degree between these two numbers, or to 154 degrees, but it requires two pint measures of quick-silver at 48 degrees of heat, to cool one pint of water as above. These and other curious experiment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> are adduced by Dr. Black, to evince the existence of combined or latent heat in bodies, as has been explained by some of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils, and well illustrated by Dr. Crawford. The world has long been in expectation of an account of his discoveries on this subject by the celebrated author himself.</p>
                     <p>As this doctrine of elementary heat in its fluid and combined state is not yet universally received, I shall here add two arguments in support of it, drawn from different sources, <abbr>viz.</abbr> from the heat given out or absorbed by the mechanical condensation or expansion of the air, and perhaps of other bodies, and from the analogy of the various phenomena of heat with those of electricity.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. It a thermometer be placed in the receiver of an air-pump, and the air hastily exhausted, the thermometer will sink some degrees, and the glass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come steamy: the same occurs in hastily admitting a part of the air again. This I suppose to be produced by the expansion of part of the air, both dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exhaustion and re-admission of it; and that the air so expanded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes capable of attracting from the bodies in its vicinity a part of their heat, hence the vapours contained in it, and the glass receiver, are for a time colder, and the steam is precipitated. That the air thus parts with its moisture from the cold occasioned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="149" facs="unknown:033600_0169_0FF79EE08B1D7198"/>
rarefaction itself, is evident, because, in a minute or two, the same rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied air will again take up the dew deposited on the receiver; and because water will evaporate sooner in rare than in dense air.</p>
                     <p>There is a curious phenomenon, similar to this, observed in the fountain of Hiero, constructed on a large scale at the Chemnicensian mines in Hungary. In this machine, the air in a large vessel is compressed by a column of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 260 feet high, a stop-cock is then opened, and as the air issues out with great vehemence, and thus becomes immediately greatly expanded, so much cold is produced, that the moisture from this stream of air is precipitated in the form of snow, and ice is formed, adhering to the nosel of the cock. This remarkable circumstance is described at large, with a plate of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, in Phil. Trans. vol. LII. for 1761.</p>
                     <p>The following experiment is related by Dr. Darwin, in the Phil. Trans. vol. LXXVIII. Having charged an air-gun as forcibly as he well could, the air-cell and syringe became exceedingly hot, much more so than could be ascribed to the friction in working it; it was then left about half an hour to cool down the temperature of the air, and a thermometer having been previously fixed against a wall, the air was discharged in a continual stream on its bulb, and it sunk many degrees. From these three experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the steam in the exhausted receiver being deposited and re-absorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when a part of the air is exhausted or re-admitted, and the snow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the fountain of Hiero, and the extraordinary heat given out in charging, and the cold produced in discharging an air-gun, there is reason to conclude, that when air is mechanically compressed, the elementary fluid heat is pressed out of it, and that when it is mechanically expanded the same fluid heat is re-absorbed from the common mass.</p>
                     <p>It is probable all other bodies as well as air attract heat from their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours when they are mechanically expanded, and give it out when they are mechanically condensed. Thus when a vibration of the particles of hard bodies is excited by friction or by percussion, these particles mutually recede from and approach each other reciprocally; at the times of their recession from each other, the body becomes enlarged in bulk, and is then in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to attract heat from those in its vicinity with great and sudden power, at the times of their approach to each other this heat is again given out; but the bodies in contact having in the mean while received the heat they had thus lost, from other bodies behind them, do not so suddenly or so sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly re-absorb the heat again from the body in vibration; hence it remains on its surface like the electric fluid on a rubbed glass globe, and for the same reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because there is no good conductor to take it up again. Hence at every vibration more and more heat is acquired, and stands loose upon the surface, as in filing metals, or rubbing glass tubes, and thus a smith, with a few strokes on a nail on his anvil, can make it hot enough to light a brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone match; and hence in striking flint and steel together, heat enough is produced to vitrify the parts thus strucken off, the quantity of which heat is again probably increased by the new chemical combination.</p>
                     <p n="2"> II. The analogy between the phenomena of the electric fluid and of heat, furnishes another argument in support of the existence of heat as a gravitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:033600_0170_0FF79EE26EEA4CB8"/>
fluid. 1. They are both accumulated by friction on the excited body. 2. They are propagated easily or with difficulty along the same classes of bodies; with ease by metals, with less ease by water, and with difficulty by resins, bees-wax, silk, air, and glass. Thus glass canes, or canes of sealing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wax, may be melted by a blow-pipe, or a candle, within a quarter of an inch of the fingers which hold them, without any inconvenient heat, while a pin, or other metallic substance, applied to the flame of a candle, so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily conducts the heat as immediately to burn the fingers. Hence clothes of silk keep the body warmer than clothes of linen of equal thickness, by confining the heat upon the body. And hence plains are so much warmer than the summits of mountains, by the greater density of the air confining the acquired heat upon them. 3. They both give out light in their passage through air, perhaps not in their passage through a vacuum. 4. They both of them fuse or vitrify metals. 5. Bodies, after being electrized, if they are mechanically extended, will receive a greater quantity of electricity, as in Dr. Franklin's experiment of the chain in the tankard; the same seems true in respect to heat, as explained above. 6. Both heat and electricity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to suspend steam in the atmosphere, by producing or increasing the repulsion of its particles. 7. They both gravitate, when they have been accumulated, till they find their equilibrium.</p>
                     <p>If we add to the above the many chemical experiments which receive an easy and elegant explanation from the supposed matter of heat, as employed in the works of Bergman and Lavoisier, I think we may reasonably allow of its existence as an element, occasionally combined with other bodies, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally existing as a fluid, like the electric fluid gravitating amongst them, and that hence it may be propagated from the central fires of the earth to the whole mass, and contribute to preserve the mean heat of the earth, which, in this country, is about 48 degrees, but variable from the greater or less effect of the sun's heat in different climates, so well explained in Mr. Kirwan's Treatise on the temperature of different latitudes. 1787.

                     <p>THE gigantic statue of Memnon, in his temple at Thebes, had a lyre in his hands, which, many credible writers assure us, founded when the rising sun shone upon it. Some philosophers have supposed that the sun's light possesses a mechanical impulse, and that the founds above-mentioned might be thence produced. Mr. Michel constructed a very tender horizontal ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, as related by Dr. Priestley in his history of light and colours, for this purpose, but some experiments, with this balance, which I saw made by the late Dr. Powel, who threw the focus of a large reflector on one extremity
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:033600_0171_0FF79EE4ED6F0AE0"/>
of it, were not conclusive either way, as the copper leaf of the balance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached in one experiment and receded in another.</p>
                     <p>There are, however, methods by which either a rotative or alternating motion may be produced by very moderate degrees of heat. If a straight glass tube, such as are used for barometers, be suspended horizontally before a fire, like a roasting spit, it will revolve by intervals; for as glass is a bad conductor of heat, the side next the fire becomes heated sooner than the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite side, and the tube becomes bent into a bow, with the external part of the curve towards the fire; this curve then falls down, and produces a fourth part of a revolution of the glass tube, which thus revolves with intermediate pauses.</p>
                     <p>Another alternating motion I have seen produced by suspending a glass tube about eight inches long, with bulbs at each end, on a centre like a scale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam. This curious machine is filled about one third part with purest spirit of wine, the other two thirds being a vacuum, and is called a pulse-glass: if it be placed on a box before the fire, so that either bulb, as it rises, may become shaded from the fire, and exposed to it when it descends, an alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate libration of it is produced. For spirit of wine in vacuo emits steam by a very small degree of heat, and this steam forces the spirit beneath it up into the upper bulb, which therefore descends. It is probable such a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, on a larger scale, might be of use to open the doors or windows of hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses or melon-frames, when the air within them should become too much heated, or might be employed in more important mechanical purposes.</p>
                     <p>On travelling through a hot summer's day in a chaise, with a box co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with leather on the fore-axle-tree, I observed, as the sun shone upon the black leather, the box began to open its lid, which, at noon, rose above a foot, and could not, without great force, be pressed down; and which gradually closed again as the sun declined in the evening. This, I suppose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might with still greater facility be applied to the purpose of opening melon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frames, or the sashes of hot-houses.</p>
                     <p>The statue of Memnon was overthrown and sawed in two by Cambyses, to discover its internal structure, and is said still to exist. See Savery's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on Egypt. The truncated statue is said, for many centuries, to have saluted the rising sun with cheerful tones, and the setting sun with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ones.</p>

                     <p>THERE are eighteen species of Lampyris, or glow-worm, according to Linnaeus, some of which are found in almost every part of the world. In many of the species the females have no wings, and are supposed to be discovered by the winged males by their shining in the night. They become much more lucid when they put themselves in motion, which would seem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:033600_0172_0FF79EE776C8EAE8"/>
that their light is owing to their respiration; in which process it is probable phosphoric acid is produced by the combination of vital air with some part of the blood, and that light is given out through their transparent bodies, by this slow internal combustion.</p>
                     <p>There is a fire-fly, of the beetle kind, described in the Dict. Raisonné, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Acudia, which is said to be two inches long, and inhabits the West-Indies and South-America; the natives use them instead of candles, putting from one to three of them under a glass. Madam Merian says, that at Surinam the light of this fly is so great, that she saw sufficiently well by one of them to paint and finish one of the figures of them in her work on insects. The largest and oldest of them are said to become four inches long, and to shine like a shooting star as they fly, and are thence called Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern-bearers. The use of this light to the insect itself seems to be, that it may not fly against objects in the night; by which contrivance these insects are enabled to procure their sustenance either by night or day, as their wants may require, or their numerous enemies permit them; whereas some of our beetles have eyes adapted only to the night, and if they happen to come abroad too soon in the evening, are so dazzled that they fly against every thing in their way. See note on Phosphorus, No. X.</p>
                     <p>In some seas, as particularly about the coast of Malabar, as a ship floats along, it seems, during the night, to be surrounded with fire, and to leave a long tract of light behind it. Whenever the sea is gently agitated, it seems converted into little stars; every drop, as it breaks, emits light, like bodies electrified in the dark. Mr. Bomare says, that when he was at the port of Cettes, in Languedoc, and bathing with a companion in the sea, after a very hot day, they both appeared covered with fire after every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersion, and that laying his wet hand on the arm of his companion, who had not then dipped himself, the exact mark of his hand and fingers was seen in characters of fire. As numerous microscopic insects are found in this shining water, its light has been generally ascribed to them, though it seems probable that fish-slime, in hot countries, may become in such a state of incipient putrefaction, as to give light, especially when by agitation it is more exposed to the air; otherwise it is not easy to explain why agitation should be necessary to produce this marine light.

                     <p>KUNKEL, a native of Hamburgh, was the first who discovered to the world the process for producing phosphorus, though Brandt and Boyle were likewise said to have previously had the art of making it. It was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from sal microcosmicum, by evaporation, in the form of an acid, but
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:033600_0173_0FF79EEAEA2AC8D8"/>
has since been found in other animal substances, as in the ashes of bones, and even in some vegetables, as in wheat flour. Keir's Chemical Dict. This phosphoric acid is, like all other acids, united with vital air, and requires to be treated with charcoal or phlogiston to deprive it of this air; it then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a kind of animal sulphur, but of so inflammable a nature, that on the access of air it takes fire spontaneously, and, as it burns, becomes again united with vital air, and re-assumes its form of phosphoric acid.</p>
                     <p>As animal respiration seems to be a kind of slow combustion, in which it is probable that phosphoric acid is produced by the union of phosphorus with the vital air, so it is also probable that phosphoric acid is produced in the excretory or respiratory vessels of luminous insects, as the glow-worm and fire-fly, and some marine insects. From the same principle I suppose the light from putrid flesh, as from the heads of haddocks, and from putrid veal, and from rotten wood, in a certain state of their putrefaction, is produced, and phosphorus, thus slowly combined with air, is changed into phosphoric acid. The light from the Bolognian stone, and from calcined shells, and from white paper, and linen, after having been exposed for a time to the sun's light, seem to produce either the phosphoric or some other kind of acid, from the sulphurous or phlogistic matter which they contain. See note on Beccari's shells, l. 182.</p>
                     <p>There is another process seems similar to this slow combustion, and that is <hi>bleaching.</hi> By the warmth and light of the sun, the water sprinkled upon linen or cotton cloth seems to be decomposed (if we credit the theory of M. Lavoisier), and a part of the vital air thus set at liberty and uncombined, and not being in its elastic form, more easily dissolves the colouring or phlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistic matter of the cloth, and produces a new acid, which is itself colourless, or is washed out of the cloth by water. The new process of bleaching confirms a part of this theory, for by uniting much vital air to marine acid, by distilling it from manganese, on dipping the cloth to be bleached in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter replete with this superaerated marine acid, the colouring matter disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears immediately, sooner indeed in cotton than in linen. See note XXXIV.</p>
                     <p>There is another process which, I suspect, bears analogy to these above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and that is the rancidity of animal fat, as of bacon; if bacon be hung up in a warm kitchen, with much salt adhering on the outside of it, the fat part of it soon becomes yellow and rancid; if it be washed with much cold water after it has imbibed the salt, and just before it is hung up, I am well informed, that it will not become rancid, or in very slight degrees. In the former case I imagine the salt on the surface of the bacon attracts water during the cold of the night, which is evaporated during the day, and that in this evaporation a part of the water becomes decomposed, as in bleaching, and its vital air uniting with greater facility in its unelastic state with the animal fat, produces an acid, perhaps of the phosphoric kind, which being of a fixed nature, lies upon the bacon, giving it the yellow colour and rancid taste. It is remarkable that the superaerated marine acid does not bleach living animal substances, at least it did not whiten a part of my hand which I for some minutes exposed to it.</p>

                     <p>THE expansive force of steam was known in some degree to the ancients. Hero, of Alexandria, describes an application of it to produce a rotative mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the re-action of steam issuing from a sphere mounted upon an axis, through two small tubes bent into tangents, and issuing from the opposite sides of the equatorial diameter of the sphere; the sphere was supplied with steam by a pipe communicating with a pan of boiling water, and entering the sphere at one of its poles.</p>
                     <p>A French writer, about the year 1630, describes a method of raising wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the upper part of a house, by filling a chamber with steam, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it to condense of itself; but it seems to have been mere theory, as his method was scarcely practible as he describes it. In 1655, the Marquis of Worcester mentions a method of raising water by fire, in his Century of Inventions, but he seems only to have availed himself of the expansive force, and not to have known the advantages arising from condensing the steam by an injection of cold water. This latter and most important improvement seems to have been made by Capt. Savery, some time prior to 1698, for in that year his patent for the use of that invention was confirmed by act of parliament. This gentleman appears to have been the first who reduced the machine to practice, and exhibited it in an useful form. This method consisted only in expelling the air from a vessel by steam, and condensing the steam by an injection of cold water, which making a vacuum, the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the atmosphere forced the water to ascend into the steam-vessel through a pipe of 24 to 26 feet high, and by the admission of dense steam from the boiler, forcing the water in the steam-vessel to ascend to the height desired. This construction was defective, because it required very strong vessels to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the force of the steam, and because an enormous quantity of steam was condensed by coming in contact with the cold water in the steam-vessel.</p>
                     <p>About, or soon after that time, M. Papin attempted a steam-engine on similar principles, but rather more defective in its construction.</p>
                     <p>The next improvement was made very soon afterwards by Messrs. New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comen and Cawley, of Dartmouth; it consisted in employing for the steam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessel a hollow cylinder, shut at bottom and open at top, furnished with a piston sliding easily up and down in it, and made tight by oakum or hemp, and covered with water. This piston is suspended by chains from one end of a beam, moveable upon an axis in the middle of its length; to the other end of this beam are suspended the pump-rods.</p>
                     <p>The danger of bursting the vessels was avoided in this machine; as how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever high the water was to be raised, it was not necessary to increase the density of the steam, but only to enlarge the diameter of the cylinder.</p>
                     <p>Another advantage was, that the cylinder, not being made so cold as in
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:033600_0175_0FF79EEEF8A30218"/>
Savery's method, much less steam was lost in filling it after each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densation.</p>
                     <p>The machine, however, still remained imperfect, for the cold water thrown into the cylinder acquired heat from the steam it condensed, and being in a vessel exhausted of air, it produced steam itself, which, in part, resisted the action of the atmosphere on the piston; were this remedied by throwing in more cold water, the destruction of steam in the next filling of the cylinder would be proportionally increased. It has therefore, in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, been found adviseable not to load these engines with columns of water weighing more than seven pounds for each square inch of the area of the piston. The bulk of water, when converted into steam, remained unknown, until Mr. J. Watt, then of Glasgow, in 1764, determined it to be about 1800 times more rare than water. It soon occurred to Mr. Watt, that a perfect engine would be that in which no steam should be condensed in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the cylinder, and in which the steam should be so perfectly cooled as to produce nearly a perfect vacuum.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Watt having ascertained the degree of heat in which water boiled in vacuo, and under progressive degrees of pressure, and instructed by Dr. Black's discovery of latent heat, having calculated the quantity of cold water necessary to condense certain quantities of steam so far as to produce the exhaustion required, he made a communication from the cylinder to a cold vessel previously exhausted of air and water, into which the steam rushed, by its elasticity, and became immediately condensed. He then adapted a cover to the cylinder, and admitted steam above the piston to press it down instead of air, and instead of applying water, he used oil or grease to fill the pores of the oakum, and to lubricate the cylinder.</p>
                     <p>He next applied a pump to extract the injection water, the condensed steam, and the air, from the condensing vessel, every stroke of the engine.</p>
                     <p>To prevent the cooling of the cylinder by the contact of the external air, he surrounded it with a case containing steam, which he again protected by a covering of matters which conduct heat slowly.</p>
                     <p>This construction presented an easy means of regulating the power of the engine, for the steam being the acting power, as the pipe which admits it from the boiler is more or less opened, a greater or smaller quantity can enter during the time of a stroke, and, consequently, the engine can act with exactly the necessary degree of energy.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Watt gained a patent for his engine in 1768, but the further prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his designs was delayed by other avocations till 1775, when, in conjunction with Mr. Boulton, of Soho, near Birmingham, numerous expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments were made, on a large scale, by their united ingenuity, and great improvements added to the machinery, and an act of parliament obtained for the prolongation of their patent for twenty-five years; they have, since that time, drained many of the deep mines in Cornwall, which, but for the happy union of such genius, must immediately have ceased to work. One of these engines works a pump of eighteen inches diameter, and upwards of 100 fathom, or 600 feet high, at the rate of ten to twelve strokes, of seven feet long each, in a minute, and that with one fifth part of the coals which

a common engine would have taken to do the same work. The power of this engine may be easier comprehended by saying, that it raised a weight equal to 81,000 pounds, 80 feet high, in a minute, which is equal to the combined action of 200 good horses. In Newcomen's engine this would have required a cylinder of the enormous diameter of 120 inches, or ten feet; but as in this engine of Mr. Watt and Mr. Boulton the steam acts, and a vacuum is made, alternately above and below the piston, the power exerted is double to what the same cylinder would otherways produce, and is further augmented by an inequality in the length of the two ends of the lever.</p>
                     <p>These gentlemen have also, by other contrivances, applied their engines to the turning of mills for almost every purpose, of which that great pile of machinery, the Albion Mill, is a well known instance.

                     <p>THE cause of the expansion of water during its conversion into ice, is not yet well ascertained; it was supposed to have been owing to the air being set at liberty in the act of congelation, which was before dissolved in the water, and the many air bubbles in ice were thought to countenance this opinion. But the great force with which ice expands during its congelation, so as to burst iron bombs and coehorns, according to the experiments of Major Williams, at Quebec, invalidates this idea of the cause of it, and may some time be brought into use as a means of breaking rocks in mining, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting cannon-balls, or for other mechanical purposes, if the means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing congelation should ever be discovered to be as easy as the means of producing combustion.</p>
                     <p>Mr. de Mairan attributes the increase of bulk of frozen water to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent arrangement of the particles of it in crystallization, as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly joined at an angle of 60 degrees, and must, by this disposition, he thinks, occupy a greater volume than if they were parallel. He found the augmentation of the water, during freezing, to amount to one-fourteenth, one-eighteenth, one-nineteenth, and when the water was previously purged of air, to only one-twenty-second part. He adds, that a piece of ice, which was at first only one-fourteenth part specifically lighter than water, on being exposed some days to the frost, became one-twelfth lighter than water. Hence
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:033600_0177_0FF79EF539CC8240"/>
he thinks ice, by being exposed to greater cold, still increases in volume, and to this attributes the bursting of ice in ponds, and on the glaciers. See Lewis's Commerce of Arts, p. 257, and the note on Muschus, in the second part of this work.</p>
                     <p>This expansion of ice well accounts for the greater mischief done by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal frosts attended with moisture (as by hoar frosts), than by the dry frosts, called black frosts. Mr. Lawrence, in a letter to Mr. Bradley, complains that the dale-mist, attended with a frost, on May-day, had destroyed all his tender fruits; though there was a sharper frost the night before, without a mist, that did him no injury; and adds, that a garden not a stone's throw from his own, on a higher situation, being above the dale-mist, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no damage. Bradley, vol. II. p. 232.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Hunter, by very curious experiments, discovered that the living principle in fish, in vegetables, and even in eggs and seeds, possesses a power of resisting congelation. Phil. Trans. There can be no doubt but that the exertions of animals to avoid the pain of cold, may produce in them a greater quantity of heat, at least for a time; but that vegetables, eggs, or seeds, should possess such a quality, is truly wonderful. Others have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that animals possess a power of preventing themselves from becoming much warmer than 98 degrees of heat, when immersed in an atmosphere above that degree of heat. It is true that the increased exhalation from their bodies will, in some measure, cool them, as much heat is carried off by the evaporation of fluids; but this is a chemical, not an animal process. The experiments made by those who continued many minutes in the air of a room heated so much above any natural atmospheric heat, do not seem conclusive, as they remained in it a less time than would have been neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to have heated a mass of beef of the same magnitude; and the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood in living animals, by perpetually bringing new supplies of fluid to the skin, would prevent the external surface from becoming hot much sooner than the whole mass. And, thirdly, there appears no power of animal bodies to produce cold in diseases, as in scarlet fever, in which the increased action of the vessels of the skin produces heat, and contributes to exhaust the animal power already to much weakened.</p>
                     <p>It has been thought by many that frosts meliorate the ground, and that they are in general salubrious to mankind. In respect to the former, it is now well known that ice or snow contains no nitrous particles, and though frost, by enlarging the bulk of moist clay, leaves it softer for a time after the thaw, yet as soon as the water exhales, the clay becomes as hard as before, being pressed together by the incumbent atmosphere, and by its self-attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, called <hi>setting</hi> by the potters. Add to this, that on the coasts of Africa, where frost is unknown, the fertility of the soil is almost beyond our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of it. In respect to the general salubrity of frosty seasons, the bills of mortality are an evidence in the negative, as in long frosts many weakly and old people perish from debility occasioned by the cold, and many classes of birds, and other wild animals, are benumbed by the cold, or destroyed by the consequent scarcity of food, and many tender vegetables perish from the degree of cold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="158" facs="unknown:033600_0178_0FF79EF6CF123338"/>
I do not think it should be objected to this doctrine, that there are moist days, attended with a brisk cold wind, when no visible ice appears, and which are yet more disagreeable and destructive than frosty weather. For on these days the cold moisture which is deposited on the skin is there eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, and thus produces a degree of cold perhaps greater than the milder frosts. Whence, even in such days, both the disagreeable sensations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salubrious effects belong to the cause above-mentioned, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the intensity of the cold. Add to this, that in these cold moist days, as we pass along, or as the wind blows upon us, a new sheet of cold water is, as it were, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually applied to us, and hangs upon our bodies. Now, as water is 800 times denser than air, and is a much better conductor of heat, we are starved with cold, like those who go into a cold bath, both by the great number of particles in contact with the skin, and their great facility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving our heat.</p>
                     <p>It may nevertheless be true, that snows of long duration, in our winters, may be less injurious to vegetation than great rains and shorter frosts, for two reasons. 1. Because great rains carry down many thousand pounds worth of the best part of the manure off the lands into the sea, whereas snow dissolves more gradually, and thence carries away less from the land. Any one may distinguish a snow-flood from a rain-flood by the transparency of the water. Hence hills or fields, with considerable inclination of surface, should be ploughed horizontally, that the furrows may stay the water from showers till it deposits its mud. 2. Snow protects vegetables from the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the frost, since it is always in a state of thaw where it is in contact with the earth; as the earth's heat is about 48 degrees, and the heat of thawing snow is 32 degrees, the vegetables between them are kept in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat about 40, by which many of them are preserved.

                        <p>THERE was an idle dispute, whether knobs or points were preferable on the top of conductors, for the defence of houses. The design of these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors is to permit the electric matter accumulated in the clouds, to pass through them into the earth in a smaller continued stream as the cloud ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, before it comes to what is termed striking distance. Now, as it is well known that accumulated electricity will pass to points at a much greater distance than it will to knobs, there can be no doubt of their preference; and it would seem, that the finer the points, and the less liable to become rusty, the better, as it would take off the lightning while it was still at a greater distance, and by that means preserve a greater extent of building.
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:033600_0179_0FF77E6829647B38"/>
The very extremity of the point should be of pure silver or gold, and might be branched into a kind of brush, since one small point cannot be supposed to receive so great a quantity as a thicker bar might conduct into the earth.</p>
                        <p>If an insulated metallic ball is armed with a point, like a needle, project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one part of it, the electric fluid will be seen in the dark to pass off from this point, so long as the ball is kept supplied with electricity. The reason of this is not difficult to comprehend: Every part of the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric atmosphere which surrounds the insulated ball, is attracted to that ball by a large surface of it, whereas the electric atmosphere which is near the extremity of the needle, is attracted to it only by a single point; in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the particles of electric matter, near the surface of the ball, approach towards it, and push off, by their greater gravitation, the particles of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric matter over the point of the needle, in a continued stream.</p>
                        <p>Something like this happens in respect to the diffusion of oil on water from a pointed cork, an experiment which was many years ago shewn me by Dr. Franklin. He cut a piece of cork about the size of a letter-wafer, and left on one edge of it a point about a sixth of an inch in length, projecting as a tangent to the circumference. This was dipped in oil, and thrown on a pond of water, and continued to revolve, as the oil left the point, for a great many minutes. The oil descends from the floating cork upon the water, being diffused upon it without friction, and perhaps without contact; but its going off at the point so forcibly as to make that cork revolve in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary direction, seems analogous to the departure of the electric fluid from points.</p>
                        <p>Can any thing similar to either of these happen in respect to the earth's atmosphere, and give occasion to the breezes on the tops of mountains, which may be considered as points on the earth's circumference?</p>

                        <head>FAIRY-RINGS.</head>
                        <p>There is a phenomenon supposed to be electric which is yet unaccounted for; I mean the Fairy-rings, as they are called, so often seen on the grass. The numerous flashes of lightning which occur every summer, are, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, generally discharged on the earth, and but seldom (if ever) from one cloud to another. Moist trees are the most frequent conductors of these flashes of lightning, and I am informed by purchasers of wood, that innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable trees are thus cracked and injured. At other times larger parts or prominences of clouds, gradually sinking as they move along, are discharged on the moister parts of grassy plains. Now, this knob or corner of a cloud, in being attracted by the earth, will become nearly cylindrical, as loose wool would do when drawn out into a thread, and will strike the earth with a stream of electricity, perhaps two or ten yards in diameter. Now, as a stream of electricity displaces the air it passes through, it is plain no part of the grass can be burnt by it, but just the external ring of this cylinder, where the grass can have access to the air, since without air nothing can be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined. This earth, after having been so calcined, becomes a richer soil, and
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:033600_0180_0FF79EFDE00D0460"/>
either funguses or a bluer grass for many years mark the place. That light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning displaces the air in its passage is evinced by the loud crack that succeeds it, which is owing to the sides of the aerial vacuum clapping together when the lightning is withdrawn. That nothing will calcine without air is now well understood from the acids produced in the burning of phlogistic substances, and may be agreeably seen by suspending a paper on an iron prong and putting it into the centre of the blaze of an iron-furnace; it may be held there some seconds, and may be again withdrawn without its being burnt, if it be passed quickly into the flame and out again, through the external part of it, which is in contact with the air. I know some circles of many yards diameter of this kind, near Foremark, in Derbyshire, which annually produce large white funguses, and stronger grass, and have done so, I am informed, above thirty years. This increased fertility of the ground by calcination or charring, and its continuing to operate so many years, is well worth the attention of the farmer, and shews the use of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and burning new turf in agriculture, which produces its effect not so much by the ashes of the vegetable fibres, as by charring the soil which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to them.</p>
                        <p>These situations, whether from eminence or from moisture, which were proper once to attract and discharge a thunder-cloud, are more liable again to experience the same. Hence many fairy-rings are often seen near each other, either without intersecting each other, as I saw this summer in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in Nottinghamshire, or intersecting each other, as described on Arthur's seat, near Edinburgh, in the Edinb. Trans. vol. II. p. 3.</p>

                     <p>A TREE is, properly speaking, a family or swarm of buds, each bud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an individual plant; for if one of these buds be torn or cut out, and planted in the earth, with a glass cup inverted over it, to prevent its exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from being at first greater than its power of absorption, it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a tree similar to its parent; each bud has a leaf, which is its lungs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to it, and the bark of the tree is a congeries of the roots of these individual buds; whence old hollow trees are often seen to have some branches flourish with vigour after the internal wood is almost entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed and vanished. According to this idea, Linnaeus has observed, that trees and shrubs are roots above ground, for if a tree be inverted, leaves will grow from the root-part, and roots from the trunk-part. Phil. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ot. p. 39. Hence it appears that vegetables have two methods of propagating themselves, the oviparous as by seeds, and the viviparous as by their buds and bulbs; and that the individual plants, whether from seeds, or buds, or bulbs, are all annual productions, like many kinds of insects, as the silk-worm
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:033600_0181_0FF79EFF7AD20F48"/>
the parent perishing in the autumn after having produced an embryon, which lies in a torpid state during the winter, and is matured in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding summer. Hence Linnaeus names buds and bulbs the winter cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of the plant, or hybernacula, and might have given the same term to seeds. In warm climates few plants produce buds, as the vegetable life can be completed in one summer, and hence the hybernacle is not wanted; in cold climates also some plants do not produce buds, as philadelphus, fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula, viburnum, ivy, heath, wood-nightshade, rue, geranium.</p>
                     <p>The bulbs of plants are another kind of winter cradle, or hybernacle, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the descending trunk, and are found in the perennial herbaceous plants, which are too tender to bear the cold of the winter. The produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these subterraneous winter lodges, is not yet, perhaps, clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; they have been distributed by Linnaeus, according to their forms, into scaly, solid, coated, and jointed bulbs, which, however, does not elucidate their manner of production. As the buds of trees may be truly esteemed individual annual plants, their roots constituting the bark of the trees, it follows, that these roots (<abbr>viz.</abbr> of each individual bud) spread themselves over the last year's bark, making a new bark over the old one, and thence descending, cover with a new bark the old roots also in the same manner. A similar circumstance I suppose to happen in some herbaceous plants, that is, a new bark is annually produced over the old root, and thus, for some years at least, the old root or caudex increases in size, and puts up new stems. As these roots increase in size, the central part, I suppose, changes like the internal wood of a tree, and does not possess any vegetable life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gives out no fibres or rootlets, and hence appears bitten off, as in vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, plantain, and devil's-bit. And this decay of the central part of the root, I suppose, has given occasion to the belief of the root-fibres drawing down the bulb, so much insisted on by Mr. Milne, in his Botanical Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary, art. Bulb.</p>
                     <p>From the observations and drawings of various kinds, of bulbous roots, at different times of their growth, sent me by a young lady of nice observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it appears probable that all bulbous roots, properly so called, perish annually in this climate. Bradley, Miller, and the author of Spectacle de la Nature, observe that the tulip annually renews its bulb, for the stalk of the old flower is found under the old dry coat, but on the outside of the new bulb. This large new bulb is the flowering bulb; but besides this there are other small new bulbs produced between the coats of this large one, but from the same caudex (or circle from which the root-fibres spring); these small bulbs are leaf-bearing bulbs, and renew themselves annually, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing size, till they bear flowers.</p>
                     <p>Miss <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> favoured me with the following curious experiment: She took a small tulip-root out of the earth when the green leaves were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently high to show the flower, and placed it in a glass of water; the leaves and flower soon withered, and the bulb became wrinkled and soft, but put out one small side bulb, and three bulbs beneath, descending an inch into the water by processes from the caudex; the old bulb in some weeks entirely decayed. On dissecting this monster, the middle descending bulb was found,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:033600_0182_0FF79F015015F738"/>
by its process, to adhere to the caudex, and to the old flower-stem; and the side ones were separated from the flower-stem by a few shrivelled coats, but adhered to the caudex. Whence she concludes that these last were off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets, or leaf-bulbs, which should have been seen between the coats of the new flower-bulb, if it had been left to grow in the earth, and that the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle one would have been the new flower-bulb. In some years (perhaps in wet seasons) the florists are said to lose many of their tulip-roots by a simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar process, the new leaf-bulbs being produced beneath the old ones by an elongation of the caudex, without any new flower-bulbs.</p>
                     <p>By repeated dissections, she observes, that the leaf-bulbs, or off-sets of tulip, crocus, gladiolus, sritillary, are renewed in the same manner as the flowering-bulbs, contrary to the opinion of many writers; this new leaf-bulb is formed on the inside of the coats from whence the leaves grow, and is more or less advanced in size as the outer coats and leaves are more or less shrivelled. In examining tulip, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ris, hyacinth, hare-bell, the new bulb was invariably found <hi>between</hi> the flower-stem and the base of the innermost leaf of those roots which had flowered, and <hi>inclosed by</hi> the base of the innermost leaf in those roots which had not flowered, in both cases adhering to the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex or fleshy circle from which the root-fibres spring.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is probable that the bulbs of hyacinths are renewed annually, but that this is performed from the caudex within the old bulb, the outer coat of which does not so shrivel as in crocus and fritillary, and hence this change is not so apparent. But, I believe, as soon as the flower is advanced, the new bulbs may be seen on dissection; nor does the annual increase of the size of the root of cyclamen, and of aletris capensis, militate against this annual renewal of them, since the leaf-bulbs, or off-sets, as described above, are increased in size as they are annually renewed.

                     <p>DR. ALEXANDER WILSON, Professor of Astronomy at Glasgow, published a paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1774, demonstrating that the spots in the sun's disk are real cavities, excavations through the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous material, which covers the other parts of the sun's surface. One of these cavities he found to be about 4000 miles deep, and many times as wide. Some objections were made to this doctrine by M. De la Lande, in the Memoirs of the French Academy for the year 1776, which, however, have been ably answered by professor Wilson in reply, in the Philos. Trans. for 1783. Keil observes, in his Astronomical Lectures, p. 44, "We fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently see spots in the sun which are larger and broader not only than Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope or Africa, but which even equal, if they do not exceed, the surface of
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:033600_0183_0FF79F03DC07A8C0"/>
the whole terraqueous globe." Now that these cavities are made in the sun's body by a process of nature similar to our earthquakes, does not seem impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable on several accounts. 1. Because, from this discovery of Dr. Wilson, it appears that the internal parts of the sun are not in a state of inflammation or of ejecting light, like the external part or luminous ocean which covers it; and hence that a greater degree of heat or inflammation, and consequent expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or explosion, may occasionally be produced in its internal or dark nucleus. 2. Because the solar spots or cavities are frequently increased or diminished in size. 3. New ones are often produced. 4. And old ones vanish. 5. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are brighter or more luminous parts of the sun's disk, called fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae by Scheiner and Hevelius, which would seem to be volcanos in the sun, or, as Dr. Wilson calls them, "eructations of matter more luminous than that which covers the sun's surface." 6. To which may be added that all the planets added together, with their satellites, do not amount to more than one six hundred and fiftieth part of the mass of the sun, according to Sir Isaac Newton.</p>
                     <p>Now, if it could be supposed that the planets were originally thrown out of the sun by larger sun-quakes than those frequent ones which occasion these spots or excavations above-mentioned, what would happen? 1. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the observations and opinion of Mr. Herschel, the sun itself and all its planets are moving forwards round some other centre with an unknown velocity, which may be of opake matter, corresponding with the very ancient and general idea of a chaos. Whence, if a ponderous planet, as Saturn, could be supposed to be projected from the sun by an explosion, the motion of the sun itself might be at the same time disturbed in such a manner as to prevent the planet from falling again into it. 2. As the sun revolves round its own axis, its form must be that of an oblate spheroid like the earth, and therefore a body prejected from its surface perpendicularly upwards from that surface would not rise perpendicularly from the sun's centre, unless it happened to be projected exactly from either of its poles or from its equator. Whence it may not be necessary that a planet, if thus projected from the sun by explosion, should again fall into the sun. 3. They would part from the sun's surface with the velocity with which that surface was moving, and with the velocity acquired by the explosion, and would therefore move round the sun in the same direction in which the sun rotates on its axis, and perform eliptic or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. 4. All the planets would move the same way round the sun, from this first motion acquired at leaving its surface, but their orbits would be inclined to each other according to the distance of the part, where they were thrown out, from the sun's equator. Hence those which were ejected near the sun's equator would have orbits but little inclined to each other, as the primary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets; the plain of all whose orbits are inclined but seven degrees and a half from each other. Others which were ejected near the sun's poles would have much more eccentric orbits, as they would partake so much less of the sun's rotatory motion at the time they parted from his surface, and would, therefore, be carried further from the sun by the velocity they had gained by the explosion which ejected them, and become comets. 5. They would all obey the same laws of motion in their revolutions round the sun; this has been determined by astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:033600_0184_0FF79FD816EF6238"/>
who have demonstrated that they move through equal areas, in equal times. 6. As their annual periods would depend on the height they rose by the explosion, these would differ in them all. 7. As their diurnal revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would depend on one side of the exploded matter adhering more than the other at the time it was torn off by the explosion, these would also differ in the different planets, and not bear any proportion to their annual periods. Now, as all these circumstances coincide with the known laws of the plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary system, they serve to strenghten this conjecture.</p>
                     <p>This coincidence of such a variety of circumstances induced M. de Buffon to suppose that the planets were all struck off from the sun's surface by the impact of a large comet, such as approached so near the sun's disk, and with such amazing velocity, in the year 1680, and is expected to return in 2255. But Mr. Buffon did not recollect that these comets themselves are only planets with more eccentric orbits, and that therefore it must be asked, what had previously struck off these comets from the sun's body? 2. That if all these planets were struck off from the sun at the same time, they must have been so near as to have attracted each other and have formed one mass. 3. That we shall want new causes for separating the secondary planets from the primary ones, and must therefore look out for some other agent, as it does not appear how the impulse of a comet could have made one planet roll round another at the time they both of them were driven off from the surface of the sun.</p>
                     <p>If it should be asked, why new planets are not frequently ejected from the sun? it may be answered, that after many large earthquakes many vents are left for the elastic vapours to escape, and hence, by the present appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the surface of our earth, earthquakes, prodigiously larger than any recorded in history, have existed; the same circumstances may have affected the sun, on whose surface there are appearances of volcanos, as described above. Add to this, that some of the comets, and even the georgium sidus, may, for aught we know to the contrary, have been emitted from the sun in more modern days, and have been diverted from their course, and thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from returning into the sun, by their approach to some of the older planets, which is somewhat countenanced by the opinion several philosophers have maintained, that the quantity of matter of the sun has decreased. Dr. Halley observed, by comparing the proportion which the periodical time of the moon bore to that of the sun in former times, with the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them at present, that the moon is found to be somewhat accelerated in respect to the sun. Pemberton's View of Sir Isaac Newton, p. 247. And so large is the body of this mighty luminary, that all the planets thus thrown out of it would make scarce any perceptible diminution of it as mentioned above. The cavity mentioned above, as measured by Dr. Wilson, of 4000 miles in depth, not penetrating an hundredth part of the sun's semi-diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and yet as its width was many times greater than its depth, was large enough to contain a greater body than our terrestrial world.</p>
                     <p>I do not mean to conceal, that from the laws of gravity unsolded by Sir Isaac Newton, supposing the sun to be a sphere, and to have no progressive motion, and not liable itself to be disturbed by the supposed projection of
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:033600_0185_0FF77E762D91A258"/>
the planets from it, that such planets must return into the sun. The late Rev. William Ludlam, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, whose genius never met with reward equal to its merits, in a letter to me, dated January, 1787, after having shewn, as mentioned above, that planets so projected from the sun would return to it, adds, <q>That a body as large as the moon so prejected, would disturb the motion of the earth in its orbit, is certain; but the calculation of such disturbing forces is difficult. The body in some circumstances might become a satellite, and both move round their common centre of gravity, and that centre be carried in an annual orbit round the sun.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are other circumstances which might have concurred at the time of such supposed explosions, which would render this idea not impossible. 1. The planets might be thrown out of the sun at the time the sun itself was rising from chaos, and be attracted by other suns in their vicinity rising at the same time out of chaos, which would prevent them from returning into the sun. 2. The new planet, in its course or ascent from the sun, might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode and eject a satellite, or perhaps more than one, and thus, by its course being affected, might not return into the sun. 3. If more planets were ejected at the same time from the sun, they might attract and disturb each others course at the time they left the body of the sun, or very soon afterwards, when they would be so much nearer each other.</p>

                     <p>FROM having observed that many of the highest mountains of the world consist of lime-stone replete with shells, and that these mountains bear the marks of having been lifted up by subterraneous fires from the interior parts of the globe; and as lime-stone replete with shells is found at the bottom of many of our deepest mines, some philosophers have concluded that the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleus of the earth was for many ages covered with water, which was peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with its adapted animals; that the shells and bones of these animals, in a long series of time, produced solid strata in the ocean surrounding the original nucleus.</p>
                     <p>These strata consist of the accumulated exuviae of shell-fish—the animals perished age after age, but their shells remained, and, in progression of time, produced the amazing quantities of lime-stone which almost cover the earth. Other marine animals, called coralloids, raised walls, and even mountains, by the congeries of their calcareous habitations; these perpendicular coral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line rocks make some parts of the southern ocean highly dangerous, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the journals of Capt. Cook. From contemplating the immense strata of lime-stone, both in respect to their extent and thickness, formed from these shells of animals, philosophers have been led to conclude, that much of the water of the sea has been converted into calcareous earth, by passing through their organs of digestion. The formation of calcareous earth
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:033600_0186_0FF77E78F24771D8"/>
seems more particularly to be an animal process, as the formation of clay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the vegetable economy; thus the shells of crabs, and other testaceous fish, are annually re-produced from the mucous membrane beneath them; the shells of eggs are first a mucous membrane, and the calculi of the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and those found in all other parts of our system, which sometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain calcareous earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seem to originate from inflamed membranes; the bones themselves consist of calcareous earth united with the phosphoric or animal acid, which may be separated by dissolving the ashes of calcined bones in the nitrous acid; the various secretions of animals, as their saliva and urine, abound likewise with calcareous earth, as appears by the incrustations about the teeth, and the sediments of urine. It is probable that animal mucus is a previous process towards the formation of calcareous earth; and that all the calcareous earth in the world, which is seen in lime-stones, marbles, spars, alabasters, marls (which make up the greatest part of the earth's crust, as far as it has yet been penetrated), have been formed originally by animal and vegetable bodies from the mass of water, and that by these means the solid part of the terraqueous globe has perpetually been in an increasing state, and the water perpetually in a decreasing one.</p>
                     <p>After the mountains of shells, and other recrements of aquatic animals, were elevated above the water, the upper heaps of them were gradually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by rains and dews, and oozing through, were either perfectly crystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized in smaller cavities, and formed calcareous spar, or were imperfectly crystallized on the roofs of larger cavities, and produced stalactites; or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with other undissolved shells beneath them, formed marbles, which were more or less crystallized and more or less pure; or, lastly, after being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, the water was exhaled from them in such a manner that the external parts became solid, and, forming an arch, prevented the internal parts from approaching each other so near as to become solid, and thus chalk was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. I have specimens of chalk formed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the root of several stalactites, and in their central parts; and of other stalactites, which are hollow like quills, from a similar cause, <abbr>viz.</abbr> from the external part of the stalactite harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first by its evaporation, and thus either attracting the internal dissolved particles to the crust, or preventing them from approaching each other so as to form a solid body. Of these I saw many hanging from the arched roof of a cellar under the high street in Edinburgh.</p>
                     <p>If this dissolved lime-stone met with vitriolic acid, it was converted into alabaster, parting at the same time with its fixable air. If it met with the fluor acid, it became fluor; if with the siliceous acid, flint; and when mixed with clay and sand, or either of them, acquires the name of marl. And under one or other of these forms, composes a great part of the solid globe of the earth.</p>
                     <p>Another mode in which lime-stone appears is in the form of round granu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated particles, but slightly cohering together; of this kind a bed extends over Lincoln heath, perhaps twenty miles long by ten wide. The form of this calcareous sand, its angles having been rubbed off, and the flatness of its bed, evince that that part of the country was so formed under water, the particles of sand having thus been rounded, like all other rounded pebbles.
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:033600_0187_0FF77E8B4CBDF298"/>
This round form of calcareous sand, and of other larger pebbles, is produced under water, partly by their being more or less soluble in water, and hence the angular parts become dissolved; first, by their exposing a larger surface to the action of the menstruum; and, secondly, from their attrition against each other by the streams or tides, for a great length of time, successively, as they were collected, and, perhaps, when some of them had not acquired their hardest state.</p>
                     <p>This calcareous sand has generally been called ketton-stone, and believed to resemble the spawn of fish; it has acquired a form so much rounder than siliceous sand, from its being of so much softer a texture, and also much more soluble in water. There are other soft calcareous stones called tupha, which are deposited from water on mosses, as at Matlock, from which moss it is probable the water may receive something which induces it the readier to part with its earth.</p>
                     <p>In some lime-stones the living animals seem to have been buried, as well as their shells, during some great convulsion of nature. These shells contain a black coaly substance within them, in others some phlogiston or volatile alkali, from the bodies of the dead animals, remains mixed with the stone, which is then called liver-stone, as it emits a sulphurous smell on being struck; and there is a stratum about six inches thick extends a considerable way over the iron-ore at Wingerworth, near Chesterfield, in Derbyshire, which seems evidently to have been formed from the shells of fresh-water muscles.</p>
                     <p>There is, however, another source of calcareous earth besides the aquatic one above described, and that is from the recrements of land animals and vegetables, as found in marls, which consist of various mixtures of calcareous earth, sand, and clay, all of them, perhaps, principally from vegetable origin.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Hutton is of opinion, that the rocks of marble have been softened by fire into a fluid mass, which, he thinks, under immense pressure, might be done without the escape of their carbonic acid or fixed air. Edinb. Trans. vol. I. If this ingenious idea be allowed, it might account for the purity of some white marbles, as during their fluid state there might be time for their partial impurities, whether from the bodies of the animals which produced the shells, or from other extraneous matter, either to sublime to the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most part of the stratum, or to subside to the lowermost part of it. As a confirmation of this theory of Dr. Hutton's, it may be added, that some cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous stones are found mixed with lime, and have thence lost a part of their fixed air, or carbonic gas, as the bath-stone, and, on that account, hardens on being exposed to the air, and, mixed with sulphur, produces cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous liver of sulphur. Falconer on Bath-water, vol. I. p. 156 and p. 257. Mr. Monnet found lime in powder in the mountains of Auvergne, and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it of volcanic origin. Kirwan's Min. p. 22.</p>

                     <p>WHERE woods have repeatedly grown and perished, morasses are, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of time, produced, and by their long roots, fill up the interstices till the whole becomes, for many yards deep, a mass of vegetation. This fact is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously verified by an account given many years ago by the Earl of Cromar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of which the following is a short abstract.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1651, the Earl of Cromartie, being then nineteen years of age, saw a plain in the parish of Lockburn covered over with a firm standing wood, which was so old that not only the trees had no green leaves upon them, but the bark was totally thrown off, which, he was there informed by the old countrymen, was the universal manner in which fir-woods termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and that in twenty or thirty years the trees would cast themselves up by the roots. About fifteen years after he had occasion to travel the same way, and observed that there was not a tree nor the appearance of a root of any of them; but in their place, the whole plain where the wood stood was covered with a flat green moss, or morass, and on asking the country people what was become of the wood, he was informed that no one had been at the trouble to carry it away, but that it had all been overturned by the wind, that the trees lay thick over each other, and that the moss or bog had overgrown the whole timber, which, they added, was occasioned by the moisture which came down from the high hills above it, and stagnated upon the plain, and that nobody could yet pass over it, which, however, his Lordship was so incautious as to attempt, and slipt up to the arm-pits. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the year 1699, that whole piece of ground was become a solid moss, wherein the peasants then dug turf or peat, which, however, was not yet of the best sort. Phil. Trans. No. 330. Abridg. vol. V. p. 272.</p>
                     <p>Morasses in great length of time undergo variety of changes, first by elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triation, and afterwards by fermentation, and the consequent heat. 1. By water perpetually oozing through them the most soluble parts are first washed away, as the essential salts; these, together with the salts from animal recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are carried down the rivers into the sea, where all of them seem to decompose each other except the marine salt. Hence the ashes of peat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain little or no vegetable alkali, and are not used in the countries where peat constitutes the fuel of the lower people, for the purpose of washing linen. The second thing which is always seen oozing from morasses is iron in solution, which produces chalybeat springs, from whence depositions of ochre and variety of iron ores. The third elutriation seems to consist of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable acid, which by means unknown appears to be converted into all other acids. 1. Into marine and nitrous acids as mentioned above. 2. Into vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolic acid, which is found in some morasses so plentifully as to preserve the bodies of animals from putrefaction which have been buried in them, and this acid, carried away by rain and dews, and meeting with calcareous earth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:033600_0189_0FF79F0AA63AB670"/>
gypsum or alabaster, with clay it produces alum, and, deprived of its vital air, produces sulphur. 3. Fluor acid, which being washed away, and meeting with calcareous earth, produces fluor or cubic spar. 4. The siliceous acid, which seems to have been disseminated in great quantity either by solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in water or by solution in air, and appears to have produced the sand in the sea, uniting with calcareous earth, previously dissolved in that element, from which were afterwards formed some of the grit-stone rocks by means of a siliceous or calcareous cement. By its union with the calcareous earth of the morass, other strata of siliceous sand have been produced; and by the mixture of this with clay and lime arose the beds of marl.</p>
                     <p>In other circumstances, probably where less moisture has prevailed, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasses seem to have undergone a fermentation, as other vegetable matter, new hay, for instance, is liable to do from the great quantity of sugar it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. From the great heat thus produced in the lower parts of immense beds of morass, the phlogistic part, or oil, or asphaltum, becomes distilled, and rising into higher strata, becomes again condensed, forming coal-beds of greater or less purity according to their greater or less quantity of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable matter; at the same time the clay-beds become purer or less so, as the phlogistic part is more or less completely exhaled from them. Though coal and clay are frequently produced in this manner, yet I have no doubt, but that they are likewise often produced by elutriation; in situations on decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities the clay is washed away down into the valleys, and the phlogistic part or coal left behind; this circumstance is seen in many valleys near the beds of rivers, which are covered recently by a whitish impure clay, called wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-clay. See note XIX. XX. and XXIII.</p>
                     <p>LORD CROMARTIE has furnished another curious observation on morasses in the paper above refered to. In a moss near the town of Eglin, in Murray, though there is no river or water which communicates with the moss, yet for three or four feet of depth in the moss there are little shell-fish resembling oysters, with living fish in them in great quantities, though no such fish are found in the adjacent rivers, nor even in the water pits in the moss, but only in the solid substance of the moss. This curious fact not only accounts for the shells sometimes found on the surface of coals, and in the clay above them, but also for a thin stratum of shells which sometimes exist over iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore.</p>

                     <p>AS iron is formed near the surface of the earth, it becomes exposed to streams of water and of air more than most other metallic bodies, and thence becomes combined with oxygene, or vital air, and appears very frequently in its calciform state, as in variety of ochres. Manganese and zinc, and
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:033600_0190_0FF79F0C407EE460"/>
sometimes lead, are also found near the surface of the earth, and, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, become combined with vital air, and are exhibited in their calciform state.</p>
                     <p>The avidity with which iron unites with oxygene, or vital air, in which process much heat is given out from the combining materials, is shewn by a curious experiment of M. Ingenhouz. A fine iron wire, twisted spirally, is fixed to a cork, on the point of the spire is fixed a match made of agaric, dipped in solution of nitre; the match is then ignited, and the wire with the cork put immediately into a bottle full of vital air, the match first burns vividly, and the iron soon takes fire, and consumes with brilliant sparks till it is reduced to small brittle globules, gaining an addition of about one third of its weight by its union with vital air.

                        <head>STEEL.</head>
                        <p>It is probably owing to a total deprivation of vital air, which it holds with so great avidity, that iron, on being kept many hours or days in ignit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed charcoal, becomes converted into steel, and thence acquires the faculty of being welded, when red hot, long before it melts, and also the power of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming hard when immersed in cold water; both which I suppose depend on the same cause, that is, on its being a worse conductor of heat than other metals; and hence the surface both acquires heat much sooner, and loses it much sooner, than the internal parts of it, in this circumstance resembling glass.</p>
                        <p>When steel is made very hot, and suddenly immerged in very cold water, and moved about in it, the surface of the steel becomes cooled first, and thus producing a kind of case or arch over the internal part, prevents that internal part from contracting quite so much as it otherwise would do, whence it becomes brittler and harder, like the glass drops called Prince Rupert's drops, which are made by dropping melted glass into cold water. This idea is countenanced by the circumstance that hardened steel is speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically lighter than steel which is more gradually cooled. (Nicholson's Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry, p. 313.) Why the brittleness and hardness of steel or glass should keep pace, or be companions to each other, may be difficult to conceive.</p>
                        <p>When a steel spring is forcibly bent till it break, it requires less power to bend it through the first inch than the second, and less through the second than the third. The same I suppose to happen if a wire be distended till it break, by hanging weights to it. This shews that the particles may be forced from each other, to a small distance, by less power than is necessary to make them recede to a greater distance; in this circumstance, perhaps, the attraction of cohesion differs from that of gravitation, which exerts its power inversely as the squares of the distance. Hence it appears, that if the innermost particles of a steel bar, by cooling the external surface first, are kept from approaching each other so nearly as they otherwise would do, that they become in the situation of the particles on the convex side of a bent spring, and cannot be forced farther from each other except by a greater
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:033600_0191_0FF79F0E641FAE40"/>
power than would have been necessary to have made them recede thus far. And, secondly, that if they be forced a little farther from each other they separate: this may be exemplified by laying two magnetic needles parallel to each other, the contrary poles together, then drawing them longitudinally from each other, they will slide with small force till they begin to separate, and will then require a stronger force to really separate them. Hence it appears, that hardness and brittleness depend on the same circumstance, that the particles are removed to a greater distance from each other, and thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist any power more forcibly which is applied to displace them farther; this constitutes hardness. And, secondly, if they are displaced by such applied force, they immediately separate, and this constitutes brittleness.</p>
                        <p>Steel may be thus rendered too brittle for many purposes, on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count artists have means of softening it again, by exposing it to certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of heat, for the construction of different kinds of tools, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led tempering it. Some artists plunge large tools in very cold water as soon as they are completely ignited, and moving them about, take them out as soon as they cease to be luminous beneath the water; they are then rubbed quickly with a file, or on sand, to clean the surface; the heat which the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal still retains soon begins to produce a succession of colours; if a hard tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be required, the piece is dipped again, and stirred about in cold water as soon as the yellow tinge appears; if it be cooled when the purple tinge appears, it becomes fit for gravers' tools, used in working upon metals; if cooled while blue, it is proper for springs.

                        <head>MODERN PRODUCTION OF IRON.</head>
                        <p>The recent production of iron is evinced from the chalybeate waters which flow from morasses, which lie upon gravel-beds, and which must, therefore, have produced iron after those gravel-beds were raised out of the sea. On the south side of the road between Cheadle and Okeymoor, in Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire, yellow stains of iron are seen to penetrate the gravel from a thin morass on its surface. There is a fissure eight or ten feet wide, in a gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed on the eastern side of the hollow road, ascending the hill about a mile from Trentham, in Staffordshire, leading toward Drayton, in Shropshire, which fissure is filled up with nodules of iron-ore. A bank of sods is now raised against this fissure to prevent the loose iron nodules from falling into the turnpike road, and thus this natural curiosity is at present concealed from travellers. A similar fissure, in a bed of marl, and filled up with iron nodules, and with some large pieces of flint, is seen on the eastern side of the hollow road ascending the hill from the turnpike house, about a mile from Derby, in the road towards Burton. And another such fissure, filled with iron nodes, appears about half a mile from Newton-Solney, in Derbyshire, in the road to Burton, near the summit of the hill. These collections of iron and of flint must have been produced posterior to the elevation of all those hills, and were thence evidently of vegetable or animal origin. To which should be added, that iron is found, in general, in beds either near the surface
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:033600_0192_0FF79F11F5FE5F58"/>
of the earth, or stratified with clay, coals, or argillaceous grit, which are themselves productions of the modern world, that is, from the recrements of vegetables and air-breathing animals.</p>
                        <p>Not only iron, but manganese, calamy, and even copper and lead, appear, in some instances, to have been of recent production. Iron and manganese are detected in all vegetable productions, and it is probable other metallic bodies might be found to exist in vegetable or animal matters, if we had tests to detect them in very minute quantities. Manganese and calamy are found in beds like iron near the surface of the earth, and in a calciform state, which countenances their modern production. The recent production of calamy, one of the ores of zinc, appears from its frequently incrusting calcareous spar, in its descent from the surface of the earth into the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most fissures of the lime-stone mountains of Derbyshire. That the calamy has been carried, by its solution or diffusion in water, into these cavities, and not by its ascent from below in form of steam, is evinced from its not only forming a crust over the dogtooth spar, but by its afterwards dissolving or destroying the sparry crystal. I have specimens of calamy in the form of dogtooth spar two inches high, which are hollow, and stand half an inch above the diminished sparry crystal on which they were formed, like a sheath a great deal too big for it; this seems to shew, that this process was carried on in water, otherwise, after the calamy had incrusted its spar, and dissolved its surface, so as to form a hollow cavern over it, it could not act further upon it except by the interposition of some medium. As these spars and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy are formed in the fissures of mountains, they must both have been formed after the elevations of those mountains.</p>
                        <p>In respect to the recent production of copper, it was before observed, in note on Canto II. l. 398, that the summit of the grit-stone mountain at Hawkstone, in Shropshire, is tinged with copper, which, from the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the blue stains, seems to have descended to the parts of the rock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. I have a calciform ore of copper consisting of the hollow crusts of cubic cells, which has evidently been formed on crystals of fluor, which it has eroded in the same manner as the calamy erodes the calcareous crystals, from whence may be deduced, in the same manner, the aqueous solution or diffusion, as well as the recent production of this calciform ore of copper.</p>
                        <p>Lead, in small quantities, is sometimes found in the fissures of coal-beds, which fissures are previously covered with spar; and sometimes in nodules of iron-ore. Of the former I have a specimen from near Caulk, in Derby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, and of the latter from Colebrook Dale, in Shropshire. Though all these facts shew that some metallic bodies are formed from vegetable or animal recrements, as iron, and perhaps manganese and calamy, all which are found near the surface of the earth; yet as the other metals are found only in fissures of rocks, which penetrate to unknown depths, they may be wholly or in part produced by ascending steams from subterraneous fires, as mentioned in note on Canto II. l. 398.</p>

                        <head>SEPTARIA OF IRON-STONE.</head>
                        <p>Over some lime works at Walfall, in Staffordshire, I observed some years ago a stratum of iron earth about six inches thick, full of very large cavities; these cavities were evidently produced when the material passed from a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-fluid state into a solid one; as the frit of the potters, or a mixture of clay and water, is liable to crack in drying; which is owing to the further contraction of the internal part, after the crust has become hard. These hollows are liable to receive extraneous matter, as, I believe, gypsum, and sometimes spar, and even lead; a curious specimen of the last was presented to me by Mr. Darby, of Colebrook Dale, which contains in its cavity some ounces of lead-ore. But there are other septaria of iron-stone, which seem to have had a very different origin, their cavities having been formed in cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or congealing from an ignited state, as is ingeniously deduced by Dr. Hutton, from their internal structure. Edinb. Trans. vol. l. p. 246. The volcanic origin of these curious septaria, appears to me to be further evinced from their form and the places where they are found. They consist of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late spheroids, and are found in many parts of the earth totally detached from the beds in which they lie, as at East-Lothian, in Scotland. Two of these, which now lie before me, were found, with many others, immersed in argillaceous shale, or shiver, surrounded by broken lime-stone mountains, at Bradbourn, near Ashbourn, in Derbyshire, and were presented to me by Mr. Buxton, a gentleman of that town. One of these is about fifteen inches in its equatorial diameter, and about six inches in its polar one, and contains beautiful starlike septaria, incrusted, and in part filled with calcareous spar. The other is about eight inches in its equatorial diameter, and about four inches in its polar diameter, and is quite solid, but shews on its internal sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face marks of different colours, as if a beginning separation had taken place. Now, as these septaria contain fifty per cent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of iron, according to Dr. Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, they would soften or melt into a semi-fluid globule, by subterraneous fire, by less heat than the lime-stone in their vicinity; and if they were ejected through a hole or fissure, would gain a circular motion along with their progressive one, by their greater friction or adhesion to one side of the hole. This whirling motion would produce the oblate spheroidical form which they possess, and which, as far as I know, can not in any other way be accounted for. They would then harden in the air as they rose into the colder parts of the atmosphere; and as they descended into so soft a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial as shale or shiver, their forms would not be injured in their fall; and their presence in materials so different from themselves becomes accounted for.</p>
                        <p>About the tropics of the large septarium above-mentioned, are circular eminent lines, such as might have been left if it had been coarsely turned in a lath. These lines seem to consist of fluid matter, which seems to have exsuded in circular zones, as their edges appear blunted or retracted; and the septarium seems to have split easier in such sections parrallel to its equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Now, as the crust would first begin to cool and harden after its ejection in a semi-fluid state, and the equatorial diameter would become gradually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:033600_0194_0FF79F170CF72B08"/>
as it rose in the air; the internal parts, being softer, would slide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the polar crust, which might crack, and permit part of the semi-fluid to exsude, and it is probable the adhesion would thus become less in sections parallel to the equator. Which further confirms this idea of the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these curious septaria. A new-cast cannon ball, red-hot, with its crust only solid, if it were shot into the air, would probably burst in its passage, as it would consist of a more fluid material than these septaria; and thus, by discharging a shower of liquid iron, would produce more dreadful combus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if used in war, than could be effected by a ball which had been cooled and was heated again, since, in the latter case, the ball could not have its internal parts made hotter than the crust of it, without first losing its form.</p>

                        <head>1. SILICEOUS ROCKS.</head>
                        <p>THE great masses of siliceous sand which lie in rocks upon the beds of lime-stone, or which are stratified with clay, coal, and iron-ore, are evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced in the decomposition of vegetable or animal matters, as explained in the note on morasses. Hence the impressions of vegetable roots and even whole trees are often found in sand-stone, as well as in coals and iron-ore. In these sand-rocks both the siliceous acid and the calcareous base seem to be produced from the materials of the morass; for though the presence of a sili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous acid and of a calcareous base have not yet been separately exhibited from flints, yet from the analogy of flint to fluor, and gypsum, and marble, and from the conversion of the latter into flint, there can be little doubt of their existence.</p>
                        <p>These siliceous sand-rocks are either held together by a siliceous cement, or have a greater or less portion of clay in them, which in some acts as a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the siliceous crystals, but in others is in such great abundance that in burning them they become an imperfect porcelain, and are then used to repair the roads, as at Chesterfield, in Derbyshire; these are called argillace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous grit by Mr. Kirwan. In other places, a calcareous matter cements the crystals together; and in other places the siliceous crystals lie in loose strata, under the marl, in the form of white sand; as at Normington, about a mile from Derby.</p>
                        <p>The lowest beds of siliceous sand-stone, produced from morasses, seem to obtain their acid from the morass, and their calcareous base from lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone on which it rests. These beds possess a siliceous cement, and from their greater purity and hardness are used for coarse grinding-stones and scythe stones, and are situated on the edges of lime-stone countries, having lost the other strata of coals, or clay, or iron, which were originally produced
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:033600_0195_0FF79F19A0990438"/>
above them. Such are the sand-rocks incumbent on lime-stone near Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, in Derbyshire. As these siliceous sand-rocks contain no marine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions scattered amongst them, they appear to have been elevated, torn to pieces, and many fragments of them scattered over the adjacent country, by explosions, from fires within the morass from which they have been formed, and which dissipated every thing inflammable above and beneath them, except some stains of iron with which they are in some places spotted. If these sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocks had been accumulated beneath the sea, and elevated along with the beds of lime-stone on which they rest, some vestiges of marine shells, either in their siliceous or calcareous state, must have been discerned amongst them.</p>

                        <head>2. SILICEOUS TREES.</head>
                        <p>In many of these sand-rocks are found the impressions of vegetable roots, which seem to have been the most unchangeable parts of the plant, as shells and shark's teeth are found in chalk beds, from their being the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable parts of the animal. In other instances the wood itself is pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, and whole trees converted into flint; specimens of which I have by me, from near Coventry, and from a gravel-pit in Shropshire, near Child's Archal, in the road to Drayton. Other polished specimens of vegetable flints abound in the cabinets of the curious, which evidently shew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centric circles of woody fibres, and their interstices filled with whiter silice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter, with the branching off of the knots when cut horizontally, and the parallel lines of wood when cut longitudinally, with uncommon beauty and variety. Of these I possess some beautiful specimens, which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to me by the Earl of Uxbridge.</p>
                        <p>The colours of these siliceous vegetables are generally brown, from the iron, I suppose, or mangenese, which induced them to crystalize or to fuse more easily. Some of the cracks of the wood in drying are filled with white flint or calcedony, and others of them remain hollow, lined with innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble small crystals, tinged with iron, which I suppose had a share in convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their calcareous matter into siliceous crystals, because the crystals called Peak-diamonds are always found bedded in an ochreous earth; and those called Bristol-stones are situated on lime-stone coloured with iron. Mr. F. French presented me with a congeries of siliceous crystals, which he gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the crater (as he supposes) of an extinguished volcano at Cromach Water, in Cumberland. The crystals are about an inch high, in the shape of dogtooth or calcareous spar, covered with a dark ferruginous matter. The bed on which they rest is about an inch in thickness, and is stained with iron on its under surface. This curious fossil shews the transmutation of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous earth into siliceous, as much as the siliceous shells which abound in the cabinets of the curious. There may some time be discovered in this age of sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, a method of thus impregnating wood with liquid flint, which would produce pillars for the support, and tiles for the covering of houses, which would be uninflammable and endure as long as the earth beneath them.</p>
                        <p>That some siliceous productions have been in a fluid state without much heat at the time of their formation, appears from the vegetable flints above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:033600_0196_0FF79F1C499504A8"/>
not having quite lost their organized appearance; from shells, and coralloids, and entrochi being converted into flint without losing their form; from the bason of calcedony round Giefar, in Iceland, and from the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mr. Bergman, who obtained thirteen regular formed crystals by suffering the powder of quartz to remain in a vessel with fluor acid for two years; these crystals were about the size of small peas, and were not so hard as quartz. Opusc. de Terrâ Siliceâ, p. 33. Mr. Achard procured both calcareous and siliceous crystals, one from calcareous earth, and the other from the earth of alum, both dissolved in water impregnated with fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed air; the water filtrating very slowly through a porous bottom of baked clay. See Journal de Physique, for January, 1778.</p>

                        <p>In small cavities of these sand-rocks, I am informed, the beautiful siliceous nodules are found which are called Scots-pebbles; and which, on being cut in different directions, take the names of agates, onyxes, sardonyxes, &amp;c. according to the colours of the lines or strata which they exhibit. Some of the nodules are hollow and filled with crystals, others have nucleus of less compact siliceous matter, which is generally white, surrounded with many concentric strata, coloured with iron, and other alternate strata of white agate or calcedony, sometimes to the number of thirty.</p>
                        <p>I think these nodules bear evident marks of their having been in perfect fusion by either heat alone, or by water and heat, under great pressure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ingenious theory of Dr. Hutton; but I do not imagine, that they were injected into cavities from materials from without, but that some vegetables or parts of vegetables containing more iron or manganese than others, facilitated the complete fusion, thus destroying the vestiges of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table organization, which were conspicuous in the siliceous trees above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Some of these nodules being hollow and lined with crystals, and others containing a nucleus of white siliceous matter of a looser texture, shew they were composed of the materials then existing in the cavity; which consisting before of loose sand, must take up less space when fused into a solid mass.</p>
                        <p>These siliceous nodules resemble the nodules of iron-stone mentioned in note on Canto II. l. 183, in respect to their possessing a great number of concentric spheres, coloured generally with iron; but they differ in this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, that the concentric spheres generally obey the form of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal crust, and in their not possessing a chalybeate nucleus. The stalactites formed on the roofs of caverns are often coloured in concentric strata, by their coats being spread over each other at different times; and some of them, as the cupreous ones, possess great beauty from this formation; but as these are necessarily more or less of a cylindrical of conic form, the nodu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les or globular flints above described cannot have been constructed in this manner. To what law of nature then is to be referred the production of such numerous concentric spheres? I suspect to the law of congelation.</p>
                        <p>When salt and water are exposed to severe frosty air, the salt is said to be
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:033600_0197_0FF79F1EC9E5E7B0"/>
precipitated as the water freezes; that is, as the heat in which it was dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is withdrawn: where the experiment is tried in a bowl or bason, this may be true, as the surface freezes first, and the salt is found at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. But in a fluid exposed in a thin phial, I found, by experiment, that the extraneous matter previously dissolved by the heat, in the mixture, was not simply set at liberty to subside, but was detruded or pushed backward as the ice was produced. The experiment was this: about two ounces of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of blue vitriol were accidentally frozen in a thin phial, the glass was cracked and fallen to pieces, the ice was dissolved, and I found a pillar of blue vitriol standing erect on the bottom of the broken bottle. Nor is this power of congelation more extraordinary than that, by its powerful and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den expansion, it should burst iron shells and coehorns, or throw out the plugs with which the water was secured in them, above one hundred and thirty yards, according to the experiments at Quebec, by Major Williams.

                        <p>In some siliceous nodules, which now lie before me, the external crust for about the tenth of an inch consists of white agate, in others it is much thinner, and in some much thicker; corresponding with this crust there are from twenty to thirty superincumbent strata, of alternately darker and lighter colour; whence it appears, that the external crust, as it cooled or froze, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from it the iron or manganese which was dissolved in it; this receded till it had formed an arch or vault strong enough to resist its further protru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; then the next inner sphere or stratum, as it cooled or froze, propelled forwards its colouring matter in the same manner, till another arch or sphere produced sufficient resistance to this frigorescent expulsion.

                        <p>The rocks of marble are often alternately intermixed with strata of chert, or coarse flint, and this in beds from one to three feet thick, as at Ilam and Matlock, or of less than the tenth of an inch in thickness, as a mile or two from Bakewell, in the road to Buxton. It is difficult to conceive in what manner ten or twenty strata of either lime-stone or flint, of different shades of white and black, could be laid quite regularly over each other from sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or precipitations from the sea; it appears to me much easier to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, by supposing, with Dr. Hutton, that both the solid rocks of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the flint had been fused by great heat (or by heat and water), under immense pressure; by its cooling, or congealing, the colouring matter might be detruded, and form parallel or curvilinear strata, as above explained.</p>
                        <p>The colouring matter, both of lime-stone and flint, was probably owing to the flesh of peculiar animals, as well as the siliceous acid, which converted some of the lime-stone into flint; or to some strata of shell-fish having been overwhelmed, when alive, with new materials, while others, dying in their natural situations, would lose their fleshy part, either by its putrid solution in the water, or by its being eaten by other sea insects. I have some calca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous fossil shells which contain a black coaly matter in them, which was evidently the body of the animal, and others of the same kind filled with spar instead of it. The Labradore stone has, I suppose, its colours from the nacre, or mother-pearl shells, from which it was probably produced. And there is a stratum of calcareous matter about six or eight inches thick, at Wingerworth, in Derbyshire, over the iron-beds, which is replete with shells of fresh-water muscles, and evidently obtains its dark colour from them, as mentioned in note XVI. Many nodules of flint resemble, in colour, as well in form, the shells of the echinus, or sea-urchin; others resemble some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralloids, both in form and colour; and M. Arduini found in the Monte de Pancrasio, red flints branching like corals, from whence they seem to have obtained both their form and their colour. Ferber's Travels in Italy, p. 42.</p>

                        <head>6. NODULES OF FLINT IN CHALK-BEDS.</head>
                        <p>As the nodules of flint found in chalk-beds possess no marks of having been rounded by attrition or solution, I conclude that they have gained their form, as well as their dark colour, from the flesh of the shell-fish from which they had their origin; but which have been so completely fused by heat, or heat and water, as to obliterate all vestiges of the shell, in the same manner as the nodules of agate and onyx were produced from parts of vegetables, but which had been so completely fused as to obliterate all marks of their organization, or as many iron-nodules have obtained their form and origin from peculiar vegetables.</p>
                        <p>Some nodules in chalk-beds consist of shells of echini filled up with chalk, the animal having been dissolved away by putrescence in water, or eaten by other sea insects; other shells of echini, in which I suppose the animal's body remained, are converted into flint, but still retain the form of the shell. Others, I suppose, as above, being more completely fused, have become flint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured by the animal flesh, but without the exact form either of the flesh or shell of the animal. Many of these are hollow within, and lined with crystals, like the Scots-pebbles above described; but as the colouring matter of animal bodies differs little from each other compared with those of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, these flints vary less in their colours than those above-mentioned. At the same time as they cooled in concentric spheres, like the Scots-pebbles, they often possess faint rings of colours, and always break in conchoide forms like them.</p>
                        <p>This idea of the productions of nodules of flint in chalk-beds, is counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced from the iron which generally appears as these flints become decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the air, which, by uniting with the iron in their composition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces it from a vitrescent state to that of calx, and thus renders it visible. And, secondly, by there being no appearance in chalk-beds of a string or pipe of siliceous matter connecting one nodule with another, which must have happened if the siliceous matter, or its acid, had been injected from without, according to the idea of Dr. Hutton. And, thirdly, because many of them have very large cavities at their centres, which should not have happened had they been formed by the injection of a material from without.</p>
                        <p>When shells or chalk are thus converted from calcareous to siliceous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the flesh of the animal, the new flint being heavier than the shell or chalk, occupies less space than the materials it was produced from; this is the cause of frequent cavities within them, where the whole mass has not been completely fused and pressed together. In Derbyshire there are masses of coralloid and other shells which have become siliceous, and are thus left with large vacuities, sometimes within and sometimes on the outside of the remaining form of the shell, like the French mill-stones, and, I suppose, might serve the same purpose; the gravel of the Derwent is full of speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of this kind.</p>
                        <p>Since writing the above, I have received a very ingenious account of chalk-beds from Dr. Menish, of Chelmsford. He distinguishes chalk-beds
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:033600_0200_0FF79F25A5CA4D18"/>
into three kinds; such as have been raised from the sea with little disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their strata, as the cliffs of Dover and Margate, which he terms <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire</hi> chalk. Another state of chalk is where it has suffered much derangement, as the hanks of the Thames at Gravesend and Dartford. And a third state, where fragments of chalk have been rounded by water, which he terms <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luvial</hi> chalk. In the first of these situations of chalk he observes, that the flint lies in strata horizontally, generally in distinct nodules, but that he has observed two instances of solid plates or strata of flint, from an inch to two inches in thickness, interposed between the chalk-beds; one of these is in a chalk-bank by the road side, at Berkhamstead, the other in a bank on the road from Chatham leading to Canterbury. Dr. Menish has further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that many of the echini are crushed in their form, and yet filled with flint, which has taken the form of the crushed shell, and that though many flint nodules are hollow, yet that in some echini the siliceum seems to have enlarged as it passed from a fluid to a solid state, as it swells out in a protuberance at the mouth and anus of the shell, and that though these shells are so filled with flint, yet that in many places the shell itself remains calcareous. These strata of nodules and plates of flint seem to countenance their origin from the flesh of a stratum of animals which perished by some natural violence, and were buried in their shells.</p>

                        <head>7. ANGLES OF SILICEOUS SAND.</head>
                        <p>In many rocks of siliceous sand the particles retain their angular form, and in some beds of loose sand, of which there is one of considerable purity a few yards beneath the marl at Normington, about a mile south of Derby. Other siliceous sands have had their angles rounded off, like the pebbles in gravel-beds. These seem to owe their globular form to two causes; one to their attrition against each other, when they may for centuries have lain at the bottom of the sea, or of rivers, where they may have been progressively accumulated, and thus progressively at the same time rubbed upon each other by the dashing of the water, and where they would be more easily rolled over each other by their gravity being so much less than in air. This is evidently now going on in the river Derwent; for though there are no lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone rocks for ten or fifteen miles above Derby, yet a great part of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-gravel at Derby consists of lime-stone nodules, whose angles are quite worn off in their descent down the stream.</p>
                        <p>There is, however, another cause which must have contributed to round the angles both of calcareous and siliceous fragments, and that is, their solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in water; calcareous earth is perpetually found suspended in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which pass over it; and the earth of flints was observed by Bergman to be contained in water in the proportion of one grain to a gallon. Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wan's Mineralogy, p. 107. In boiling water, however, it is soluble in much greater proportion, as appears from the siliceous earth sublimed in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillation of fluor acid in glass vessels, and from the basons of calcedony which surrounded the jets of hot water near Mount Hecla, in Iceland.

the world, been long exposed to aqueous steams raised by subterranean fires. And if fragments of stone were long immersed in a fluid menstruum, their angular parts would be first dissolved, on account of their greater surface.</p>
                        <p>Many beds of siliceous gravel are cemented together by a siliceous cement, and are called breccia, as the plumb-pudding stones of Hartfordshire, and the walls of a subterraneous temple excavated by Mr. Curzon, at Hagley, near Rugely, in Staffordshire; these may have been exposed to great heat as they were immersed in water, which water, under great pressure of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incumbent materials, may have been rendered red-hot, as in Papin's digester; and have thus possessed powers of solution with which we are unacquainted.</p>

                        <p>Another source of siliceous stones is from the granite, or basaltes, or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyries, which are of different hardnesses, according to the materials of their composition, or to the fire they have undergone; such are the stones of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur's-hill, near Edinburgh; of the Giant's Causeway, in Ireland; and of Charnwood Forest, in Leicestershire; the uppermost stratum of which last seems to have been cracked either by its elevation, or by its hastily cooling, after ignition, by the contact of dews or snows, and thus breaks into angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fragments, such as the streets of London are paved with, or have had their angles rounded by attrition, or by partial solution; and have thus formed the common paving stones, or bowlers, as well as the gravel, which is often rolled into strata amid the siliceous sand-beds, which are either formed or collected in the sea.</p>
                        <p>In what manner such a mass of crystallized matter as the Giant's Cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and similar columns of basaltes, could have been raised without other volcanic appearances, may be a matter not easy to comprehend; but there is another power in nature besides that of expansile vapour, which may have raised some materials which have previously been in igneous or aqueous so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and that is the act of congelation. When the water, in the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments above related of Major Williams, had, by congelation, thrown out the plugs from the bomb-shells, a column of ice rose from the hole of the bomb six or eight inches high. Other bodies, I suspect, increase in bulk, which crystallize in cooling, as iron and type-metal. I remember pouring eight or ten pounds of melted brimstone into a pot to cool, and was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to see, after a little time, a part of the fluid beneath break a hole in the congealed crust above it, and gradually rise into a promontory several inches high; the basaltes has many marks of fusion and of crystallization, and may thence, as well as many other kinds of rock, as of spar, marble, petrosilex, jasper, &amp;c. have been raised by the power of congelation, a power whose quantity has not yet been ascertained, and, perhaps, greater and more universal than that of vapours expanded by heat. These basaltic columns rise sometimes out of mountains of granite itself, as mentioned by Dr. Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, (Phil. Trans. vol. LXXX.) and as they seem to consist of similar ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, more completely fused, there is still greater reason to believe them to have been elevated in the cooling or crystallization of the mass.

                     <p>THE philosophers who have attended to the formation of the earth, have acknowledged two great agents in producing the various changes which the terraqueous globe has undergone, and these are water and fire. Some of them have, perhaps, ascribed too much to one of these great agents of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and some to the other. They have generally agreed, that the strati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of materials could only be produced from sediments or precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were previously mixed or dissolved in the sea; and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever effects were produced by fire, were performed afterwards.</p>
                     <p>There is, however, great difficulty in accounting for the universal strati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the solid globe of the earth in this manner, since many of the materials, which appear in strata, could not have been suspended in water; as the nodules of flint in chalk-beds, the extensive beds of shells; and, lastly, the strata of coal, clay, sand, and iron-ore, which, in most coal-countries, lie from five to seven times alternately stratified over each other, and none of them are soluble in water. Add to this, if a solution of them, or a mixture of them in water, could be supposed, the cause of that solution must cease be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a precipitation could commence.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The great masses of lava, under the various names of granite, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry, toad-stone, moor-stone, rag, and slate, which constitute the old world, may have acquired the old stratification, which some of them appear to possess, by their having been formed by successive eruptions of a fluid mass, which, at different periods of ancient time, arose from volcanic shafts and covered each other, the surface of the interior mass of lava would cool, and become solid, before the superincumbent stratum was poured over it; to the same cause may be ascribed their different compositions and textures, which are scarcely the same in any two parts of the world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The stratifications of the great masses of lime-stone, which were produced from sea-shells, seem to have been formed by the different times at which the innumerable shells were produced and deposited. A colony of echini, or madrepores, or cornua ammonis, lived and perished in one period of time; in another, a new colony of either similar or different shells lived and died over the former ones, producing a stratum of more recent shells over a stratum of others which had begun to petrify, or to become marble; and thus, from unknown depths to what are now the summits of mountains, the lime-stone is disposed in strata of varying solidity and colour. These have afterwards undergone variety of changes by their solution and deposition from the water in which they were immersed, or from having been exposed to great heat under great pressure, according to the ingenious theory of Dr. Hutton. Edinb. Transact. vol. I. See Note XVI.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In most of the coal-countries of this island, there are from five to seven beds of coal stratified, with an equal number of beds, though of much greater
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:033600_0203_0FF79F2C9F8CE780"/>
thickness, of clay and sand-stone, and occasionally of iron-ores. In what manner to account for the stratification of these materials seems to be a problem of great difficulty. Philosophers have generally supposed that they have been arranged by the currents of the sea; but considering their insolubility in water, and their almost similar specific gravity, an accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them in such distinct beds from this cause is altogether inconceivable, though some coal-countries bear marks of having been, at some time, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersed beneath the waves, and raised again by subterranean fires.</p>
                     <p>The higher and lower parts of morasses were necessarily produced at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent periods of time, see Note XVII. and would thus originally be formed in strata of different ages. For when an old wood perished, and produced a morass, many centuries would elapse before another wood could grow, and perish again, upon the same ground, which would thus produce a new stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum of morass over the other, differing, indeed, principally in its age, and, perhaps, as the timber might be different, in the proportion of its compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts.</p>
                     <p>Now, if we suppose the lowermost stratum of a morass become ignited, like fermenting hay (after whatever could be carried away by solution in water was gone), what would happen? Certainly the inflammable part, the oil, sulphur, or bitumen, would burn away, and be evaporated in air; and the fixed parts would be left, as clay, lime, and iron; while some of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careous earth would join with the siliceous acid, and produce sand; or with the argillaceous earth, and produce marl. Thence, after many centuries, another bed would take fire, but with less degree of ignition, and with a greater body of morass over it; what then would happen? The bitumen and sulphur would rise, and might become condensed under an impervious stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, which might not be ignited, and there form coal of different purities, according to its degree of fluidity, which would permit some of the clay to subside through it into the place from which it was sublimed.</p>
                     <p>Some centuries afterwards another similar process might take place, and either thicken the coal-bed, or produce a new clay-bed, or marl, or sand, or deposit iron upon it, according to the concomitant circumstances above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
                     <p>I do not mean to contend, that a few masses of some materials may not have been rolled together by currents, when the mountains were much more elevated than at present, and, in consequence, the rivers broader and more rapid, and the storms of rain and wind greater both in quantity and force. Some gravel-beds may have been thus washed from the mountains; and some white clay washed from morasses into valleys beneath them; and some ochres of iron dissolved and again deposited by water; and some calcareous depositions from water (as the bank, for instance, on which stand the houses at Matlock-bath); but these are all of small extent or consequence compared to the primitive rocks of granite or porphyry which form the nucleus of the earth or to the immense strata of lime-stone which crust over the greatest part of this granite or porphyry; or, lastly, to the very extensive beds of clay, marl, sand-stone, coal, and iron, which were probably for many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of years the only parts of our continents and islands, which were then

<pb n="184" facs="unknown:033600_0204_0FF79F301C860468"/>
elevated above the level of the sea, and which, on that account, became covered with vegetation, and thence acquired their later or superincumbent strata, which constitute what some have termed the new world.</p>
                     <p>There is another source of clay, and that of the finest kind, from decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed granite; this is of a snowy white, and mixed with shining particles of mica; of this kind is an earth from the country of Cherokees. Other kinds are from less pure lavas; Mr. Ferber asserts that the sulphurous steams from Mount Vesuvius convert the lava into clay.</p>
                     <p>"The lavas of the ancient Solfatara volcano have been undoubtedly of a vitreous nature, and these appear at present argillaceous. Some fragments of this lava are but half, or at one side changed into clay, which either is viscid or ductile, or hard and stony. Clays, by fire, are deprived of their coherent quality, which cannot be restored to them by polverization, nor by humectation. But the sulphureous Solfatara steams restore it, as may be easily observed on the broken pots wherein they gather the sal ammoniac; though very well baked and burnt at Naples, they are mollified again by the acid steams into a viscid clay, which keeps the former fire-burnt colour."

                     <p>THE fine bright purples or rose colours which we see on china cups, are not producible with any other material except gold; manganese indeed gives a purple, but of a very different kind.</p>
                     <p>In Europe, the application of gold to these purposes, appears to be of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern invention. Cassius's discovery of the precipitate of gold by tin, and the use of that precipitate for colouring glass and enamels, are now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known; but though the precipitate with tin be more successful in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the ruby glass, or the colourless glass, which becomes red by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent ignition, the tin probably contributing to prevent the gold from separating (which it is very liable to do during the fusion); yet, for ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, the precipitates made by alkaline salts answer equally well, and give a finer red; the colour produced by the tin precipitate being a bluish purple, but with the others a rose red. I am informed that some of our best artists prefer aurum fulminans, mixing it, before it has become dry, with the white composition, or enamel flux; when once it is divided by the other matter, it is ground with great safety, and without the least danger of explosion, whether moist or dry. The colour is remarkably improved and brought forth by long grinding, which accordingly makes an essential circumstance in the process.</p>
                     <p>The precipitates of gold, and the colcothar, or other red preparations of iron, are called <hi>tender</hi> colours. The heat must be no greater than is just
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:033600_0205_0FF79F31B460D428"/>
sufficient to make the enamel run upon the piece, for if greater, the colours will be destroyed or changed to a different kind. When the vitreous mattes has just become fluid, it seems as if the coloured matallic calx remained barely <hi>intermixed</hi> with it, like a coloured powder of exquisite tennity suspended in water; but by stronger fire the calx is <hi>dissolved,</hi> and metallic colours are altered by <hi>solution</hi> in glass, as well as in acids or alkalies.</p>
                     <p>The Saxon mines have, till very lately, almost exclusively supplied the rest of Europe with cobalt, or rather with its preparations, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>affire and smalt, for the exportation of the ore itself is there a capital crime. Hungary, Spain, Sweden, and some other parts of the continent, are now said to afford, cobalts equal to the Saxon, and specimens have been discovered in our own island, both in Cornwall and in Scotland, but hitherto in no great quantity.</p>
                     <p>Calces of cobalt and of copper differ very materially from those above, mentioned in their application for colouring enamels. In those the calx has previously acquired the intended colour, a colour which hears a red heat, without injury, and all that remains in to fix it on the piece by a vitreous, flux. But the blue colour of cobalt, and the green or bluish green of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, are <hi>produced</hi> by vitrification, that is, by <hi>solution</hi> in the glass, and a strong fire is necessary for their perfection. These calces, therefore, when mixed with the enamel flux, are melted in crucibles, once or oftener, and the deep coloured opake glass, thence resulting, is ground into impalpable pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and used for enamel. One part of either of these calces is put to ten, sixteen, or twenty parts of the flux, according to the depth of colour required. The heat of the enamel-kiln is only a full red, such as is marked on Mr. Wedgwood's thermometer 6 degrees. It is therefore necessary that the flux be so adjusted as to melt in that low heat. The usual materials are flint or flint-glass, with a due proportion of red-led, or borax, or both, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a little tin calx to give opacity.</p>

The only injurious material com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly found in them is iron, which discolours the ware in porportion to its quantity, and which our moor-stones are, perhaps, more frequently tainted with than the Chinese. Very fine porcelain has been made from English mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, but the nature of the manufacture renders the process precarious and the profit hazardous; for the semi-vitrification, which constitutes porcelain, is necessarily accompanied with a degree of softness or semi-fusion, so that the vessels are liable to have their forms altered in the kiln, or to run toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with any accidental augmentations of the fire.</p>

                     <p>THE celebrated funeral vase, long in possession of the Barberini family, and lately purchased by the Duke of Porland for a thousand guineas, is about ten inches high, and fix in diameter in the broadest part. The figures are of most exquisite workmanship in has relief, of white opake glass, raised on a ground of deep blue glass, which appears black, except when held against the light. Mr. Wedgwood is of opinion, from many circumstances, that the figures have been made by cutting away the external crust of white opake glass, in the manner the finest cameos have been produced, and that it must thence have been the labour of a great many years. Some antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, have placed the time of its production many centuries before the chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian aera, as sculpture was said to have been declining, in respect to its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, in the time of Alexander the Great. See an account of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berini, or Portland vase, by M. D'Hancarville, and by Mr. Wedgwood.</p>
                     <p>Many opinions and conjectures have been published concerning the figures on this celebrated vase. Having carefully examined one of Mr. Wedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's beautiful copies of this wonderful production of art, I shall add one more conjecture to the number.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Wedgwood has well observed, that it does not seem probable that the Portland vase was purposely made for the ashes of any particular person deceased, because many years must have been necessary for its production. Hence it may be concluded, that the subject of its embellishments is not private history, but of a general nature. This subject appears to me to be well chosen, and the story to be finely told; and that it represents what in ancient times engaged the attention of philosophers, poets, and heroes; I mean a part of the Eleusinian mysteries.</p>
                     <p>These mysteries were invented in Egypt, and afterwards transferred to Greece, and flourished more particularly at Athens, which was, at the same time, the seat of the fine arts. They consisted of scenical exhibitions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting and inculcating the expectation of a future life after death, and, on this account, were encouraged by the government, in so much that the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian laws punished a discovery of their secrets with death. Dr. Warbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton has, with great learning and ingenuity, shewn, that the descent of AEneas into hell, described in the sixth Book of Virgil, is a poetical account of the representations of the future state in the Eleusinian mysteries. Divine Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, vol. I. p. 210.</p>
                     <p>And though some writers have differed in opinion from Dr. Warburton on this subject, because Virgil has introduced some of his own heroes into the Elysian fields, as Deiphobus, Palinurus, and Dido, in the same manner as Homer had done before him; yet it is agreed, that the received notions about a future state were exhibited in these mysteries; and as these poets described those received notions, they may be said, as far as these religious doctrines were concerned, to have described the mysteries.</p>

Now, as these were emblematic exhibitions, they must have been as well adapted to the purposes of sculpture as of poetry, which, indeed, does not seem to have been uncommon, since one compartment of figures in the shield of AEneas represented the regions of Tartares. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And it is very probable that the beautiful gem representing the marriage of Cupid and Psyche, as described by Apuleus, was originally descriptive of another part of the exhibitions in these mysteries, though afterwards it became a common subject of ancient art. See Divine Legat. vol. I. p. 323. What subject could have been imagined so sublime for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The exhibitions of the mysteries were of two kinds—these which the people were permitted to see, and those which were only shewn to the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated. Concerning the latter, Aristides calls them "the most shocking and most ravishing representations." And Stob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>us asserts, that the initiation into the grand mysteries exactly resembles death. Divine Legat. vol. 1. p. 280, and p. 272. And Virgil, in his entrance to the shades below, amongst other things of terrible form, mentions death. AEn. VI. This part of the exhibition seems to be represented in one of the compartments of the Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land vase.</p>
                     <p>Three figures of exquisite workmanship are placed by the side of a ruined column, whose capital is fallen off, and lies at their feet with other disjointed stones, they sit on loose piles of stone, beneath a tree, which has not the leaves of any evergreen of this climate, but may be supposed to be an elm, which Virgil places near the entrance of the infernal regions, and adds, that a dream was believed to dwell under every leaf to it. AEn. VI. l. 281. In the midst of this group reclines a female figure in a dying attitude, in which extreme languor is beautiful represented; in her hand is an inverted torch, an ancient emblem of extinguished life; the elbow of the same arm resting on a stone, supports her as she sinks, while the other hand is raised, and thrown over her drooping head, in some measure sustaining it, and gives, with great art, the idea of fainting lassitude. On the right of her sits a man, and on the left a woman, both supporting themselves on their arms, as people are liable to do when they are thinking intensely. Then have their backs towards the dying figure, yet with their faces turned towards her, as if seriously contemplating her situation, but without stretching out their hands to assist her.</p>
                     <p>This central figure, then, appears to me to be an hieroglyphic, or Eleusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian emblem of MORTAL LIFE, that is, the lethum, or death, mentioned by Virgil amongst the terrible things exhibited at the beginning of the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The inverted torch shews the figure to be emblematic; if it had been designed to represent a real person in the act of dying, there had been no necessity for the expiring torch, as the dying figure alone would have been
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:033600_0209_0FF79F3B48FEEEC8"/>
sufficiently intelligible;—it would have been as absurd as to have put an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted torch into the hand of a real person at the time of his expiring. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, if this figure had represented a real dying person, would not the other figures, or one of them at least, have stretched out a hand to support her, to have cased her fall among loose stones, or to have smoothed her pillow? These circumstances evince that the figure is an emblem, and, therefore, could not be a representation of the private history of any particular family <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> event.</p>
                     <p>The man and woman on each side of the dying figure must be considered as emblems, both from their similarity of situation and dress to the middle figure, and their being grouped along with it. These, I think, are hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic or Eleusinian emblems of HUMANKIND, with their backs toward the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing figure of MORTAL LIFE, unwilling to associate with her, yet turning back their serious and attentive countenances, curious indeed to behold, yet sorry to contemplate their latter end. These figures bring strongly to one's mind the Adam and Eve of sacred writ, whom some have supposed to have been allegorical or hieroglyphic persons of Egyptian origin, but of more ancient date; amongst whom, I think, is Dr. Warburton. According to this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Adam and Eve were the names of two hieroglyphic figures, represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the early state of mankind; Abel was the name of an hieroglyphic fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, representing the age of pasturage; and Cain, the name of another hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphic symbol, representing the age of agriculture; at which time the uses of iron were discovered. And as the people who cultivated the earth, and built houses, would increase in numbers much faster by their greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of food, they would readily conquer or destroy the people who were sustained by pasturage, which was typified by Cain slaying Abel.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. On the other compartment of this celebrated vase, is exhibited an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of immortality, the representation of which was well known to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute a very principal part of the shews at the Eleusinian mysteries, as Dr. Warburton has proved by variety of authority. The habitation of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or ghosts, after death, was supposed by the ancients to be placed beneath the earth, where Pluto reigned, and dispensed rewards or punishments. Hence the first figure in this group is of the MANES, or GHOST, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing passed through an open portal, is descending into a dusky region, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his toe with timid and unsteady step, feeling, as it were, his way in the gloom. This portal AEneas enters, which is described by Virgil,—patet arti janua Ditls, AEn. VI. l. 126; as well as the easy descent,—facilis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scensus Averni. Ib. The darkness at the entrance to the shades is humor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously described by Lucian. Div. Legat. vol. I. p. 241. And the horror of the gates of hell was, in the time of Homer, become a proverb. Achilles says to Ulysses, "I hate a lyar worse than the gates of hell;" the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is used in Isaiah, ch. xxxviii. v. 10. The MANES, or GHOST, appears lingering and fearful, and wishes to drag after him a part of his mortal garment, which, however, adheres to the side of the portal through which he has passed. The beauty of this allegory would have been expressed by Mr. Pope, by "we feel the ruling passion strong in death."</p>
                     <p>A little lower down in the group, the manes, or ghost, is received by a

beautiful female, a symbol of IMMORTAL LIFE. This is evinced by her fondling between her knees a large and playful serpent, which, from its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually renewing its external skin, has, from great antiquity, even as early as the fable of Prometheus, been esteemed an emblem of renovated youth. The story of the serpent acquiring immortal life from the ass of Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, who carried it on his back, is told in Bacon's Works, vol. V. p. 462. quarto edit. Lond. 1778. For a similar purpose a serpent was wrapped round the large hieroglyphic egg in the temple of Dioscuri, as an emblem of the renewal of life from a state of death. Bryant's Mythology, vol. II. p. 359. sec. edit. On this account also the serpent was an attendant on AEsculapias, which seems to have been the name of the hieroglyphic figure of medicine. This serpent shews this figure to be an emblem, as the torch shewed the central figure of the other compartment to be an emblem; hence they agreeably correspond, and explain each other, one representing MOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAL LIFE, and the other IMMORTAL LIFE.</p>
                     <p>This emblematic figure of immortal life sits down with her feet towards the figure of Pluto, but, turning back her face towards the timid ghost, she stretches forth her hand, and, taking hold of his elbow, supports his totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing steps, as well as encourages him to advance, both which circumstances are thus, with wonderful ingenuity, brought to the eye. At the same time the spirit loosely lays his hand upon her arm, as one walking in the dark would naturally do for the greater certainty of following his conductress; while the general part of the symbol of IMMORTAL LIFE, being turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the figure of Pluto, shews that she is leading the phantom to his realms.</p>
                     <p>In the Pamphili gardens at Rome, Perseus, in assisting Andromeda to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from the rock, takes hold of her elbow to steady or support her step, and she lays her hand loosely on his arm, as in this figure. Admir, Roman Antiq.</p>
                     <p>The figure of PLUTO can not be mistaken, as it is agreed by most of the writers who have mentioned this vase; his grisley heard, and his having one foot buried in the earth, denote the infernal monarch. He is placed at the lowest part of the group, and, resting his chin on his hand, and his arm upon his knee, receives the stranger-spirit with inquisitive attention. It was before observed, that when people think attentively, they naturally rest their bodies in some easy attitude, that more animal power may be employed on the thinking faculty. In this group of figures there is great art shewn in giving an idea of a descending plain, <abbr>viz.</abbr> from earth to Elysium, and yet all the figures are, in reality, on a horizontal one. This wonderful decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is produced, first, by the descending step of the manes, or ghost; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the arm of the sitting figure of Immortal Life being raised up to receive him as he descends; and, lastly, by Pluto having one foot sunk into the earth.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another figure which is concerned in conducting the manes, or ghost, to the realms of Pluto, and this is LOVE. He precedes the descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spirit on expanded wings, lights him with his torch, and turning back his beautiful countenance, beckons him to advance. The ancient God of love
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:033600_0212_0FF79F44532AE7F8"/>
was of much higher dignity than the modern Cupid. He was the first that came out of the great egg of night, (Hesiod. Theog. V. CXX. Briant's Mythol. vol. II. p. 348.) and is said to possess the keys of the sky, sea, and earth. As he, therefore, led the way into this life, he seems to constitute a proper emblem for leading the way to a future life. See Bacon's works, vol. I. p. 568. and vol. III. p. 582. quarto edit.</p>
                     <p>The introduction of Love into this part of the mysteries requires a little further explanation. The Psyche of the Egyptians was one of their most favourite emblems, and represented the soul, or a future life; it was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally no other than the aurelia, or butterfly, but in after time, was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by a lovely female child, with the beautiful wings of that insect. The aurelia, after its first stage as an eruca or caterpillar, lies for a season in a manner dead, and is inclosed in a sort of coffin; in this state of darkness it remains all the winter; but, at the return of spring, it bursts its bonds and comes out with new life, and in the most beautiful attire. The Egyptians thought this a very proper picture of the soul of man, and of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to which it aspired. But as this was all owing to divine Love, of which EROS was an emblem, we find this person frequently introduced as a concomitant of the soul in general, or Psyche. (Bryant's Mythol. vol. II. p. 386.) EROS, or divine Love, is for the same reason as proper attendant on the manes or soul after death, and much contributes to tell the story, that is, to shew that a soul or manes is designed by the descending figure. From this figure of Love, M. D'Hancarville imagines that Orpheus and Eurydice are typified under the figure of the manes, and immortal life as above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. It may be sufficient to answer, first, that Orpheus is always repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented with a lyre, of which there are prints of four different gems in Spence's Polymetis, and Virgil so describes him, AEn. VI. cytharâ fretus. And secondly, that it is absurd to suppose that Eurydice was fondling and playing with a serpent that had slain her. Add to this, that Love seems to have been an inhabitant of the infernal regions, as exhibited in the mysteries; for Claudian, who treats more openly of the Eleusinian mysteries, when they were held in less veneration, invokes the deities to disclose to him their secrets, and amongst other things, by what torch Love softens Pluto.</p>

                     <p>In this compartment there are two trees, whose branches spread over the figures; one of them has smoother leaves, like some evergreens, and might thence be supposed to have some allusion to immortality, but they may perhaps have been designed only as ornaments, or to relieve the figures, or because it was in groves, where these mysteries were originally celebrated. Thus Homer speaks of the woods of Proserpine, and mentions many trees in Tartarus, as presenting their fruits to Tantalus; Virgil speaks of the pleasant groves of Elysium; and in Spence's Polymetis there are prints of two ancient gems, one of Orpheus charming Cerberus with his lyre, and the other of Hercules binding him in a cord; each of them standing by a

tree. Polymet. p. 284. As, however, these trees have all different foliage so clearly marked by the artist, they may have had specific meanings in the exhibitions of the mysteries, which have not reached posterity: of this kind seem to have been the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and the tree of life, in sacred writ, both which must have been emblematic or allegorical. The masks hanging to the handles of the vase, seem to indicate that there is a concealed meaning in the figures besides their general appearance. And the priestess at the bottom, which I come now to describe, seems to shew this concealed meaning to be of the sacred or Eleusinian kind.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The figure on the bottom of the vase, is on a larger scale than the others, and less finely finished, and less elevated; and, as this bottom part was afterwards cemented to the upper part, it might be executed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther artist, for the sake of expedition; but there seems no reason to suppose that it was not originally designed for the upper part of it, as some have conjectured. As the mysteries of Ceres were celebrated by female priests, for Porphyrius says the ancients called, the priestesses of Ceres, Melissai, or bees, which were emblems of chastity, Div. Leg. vol. I. p. 235. and, as in his Satire against the sex, Juvenal says, that few women are worthy to be priestesses of Ceres, Sat. VI. the figure at the bottom of the vase would seem to represent a PRIESTESS, or HIEROPHANT, whose office it was to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the initiated, and point out to them, and explain the exhibitions in the mysteries, and to exclude the uninitiated, calling out to them, "Far, far retire, ye profane!" and to guard the secrets of the temple. Thus the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory hymn sung by the hierophant, according to Eusebius, begins, "I will declare a secret to the initiated, but let the doors be shut against the profane." Div. Leg. vol. I. p. 177. The priestess or hierophant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this figure, with a close hood, and dressed in linen, which sits close about her; except a light cloak, which flutters in the wind. Wool, as taken from slaughtered animals, was esteemed profane by the priests of Egypt, who were always dressed in linen. Apuleus, p. 64. Div. Leg. vol. 1. p. 318. Thus Eli made for Samuel a linen ephod. Samuel i. 3.</p>
                     <p>Secrecy was the foundation on which all mysteries rested; when publicly known, they ceased to be mysteries; hence a discovery of them was not only punished with death by the Athenian law, but in other countries a disgrace attended the breach of a solemn oath. The priestess, in the figure before us, has her finger pointing to her lips, as an emblem of silence. There is a figure of Harpocrates, who was of Egyptian origin, the same as Orus, with the lotus on his head, and with his finger pointing to his lips, not pressed upon them, in Bryant's Mythol. vol. II. p. 398. and another female figure standing on a lotus, as if just risen from the Nile, with her finger in the same attitude; these seem to have been representations or emblems of male and female priests of the secret mysteries. As these sorts of emblems were frequently changed by artists for their more elegant exhibition, it is possible the foliage over the head of this figure may bear some analogy to the lotus above-mentioned.</p>
                     <p>This figure of secrecy seems to be here placed, with great ingenuity, as a caution to the initiated, who might understand the meaning of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:033600_0215_0FF79F4B2A5B5688"/>
round the vase, not to divulge it. And this circumstance seems to account for there being no written explanation extant, and no tradition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these beautiful figures handed down to us along with them.</p>
                     <p>Another explanation of this figure, at the bottom of the vase, would seem to confirm the idea that the basso relievos round its sides are representations of a part of the mysteries; I mean that it is the head of ATIS. Lucian says that Atis was a young man of Phrygia, of uncommon beauty; that he dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated a temple in Syria to Rhea, or Cybele, and first taught her mysteries to the Lydians, Phrygians, and Samothracians, which mysteries he brought from India. He was afterwards made an eunuch by Rhea, and lived like a woman, and assumed a feminine habit, and in that garb went over the world, teaching her ceremonies and mysteries. Dict. par M. Danet, art. Atis. As this figure is covered with clothes, while those on the sides of the vase are naked, and has a Phrygian cap on the head, and as the form and features are so soft, that it is difficult to say whether it be a male or female figure, there is reason to conclude, 1. That it has reference to some particular person of some particular country; 2. That this person is Atis, the first great hierophant, or teacher of mysteries, to whom M. De la Chausse says the figure itself bears a resemblance. Museo. Capitol. Tom. IV. p. 402.</p>
                     <p>In the Museum Etruscum, vol. 1. plate 96, there is the head of Atis with feminine features, clothed with a Phrygian cap, and rising from very broad foliage placed on a kind of term, supported by the paw of a lion. Goreus, in his explanation of the figure, says that it is placed on a lion's foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that animal was sacred to Cybele, and that it rises from very broad leaves, because after he became an eunuch, he determined to dwell in the groves. Thus the foliage, as well as the cap and feminine features, confirm the idea of this figure at the bottom of the vase, representing the head of Atis, the first great hierophant; and that the figures on the sides of the vase are emblems from the ancient mysteries.</p>
                     <p>I beg leave to add, that it does not appear to have been uncommon amongst the ancients, to put allegorical figures on funeral vases. In the Pamphili palace at Rome, there is an elaborate representation of Life and Death, on an ancient sarcophagus. In the first Prometheus is represented making man, and Minerva is placing a butterfly, or the soul, upon his head. In the other compartment, Love extinguishes his torch in the bosom of the dying figure, and is receiving the butterfly, or Psyche, from him, with a great number of complicated emblematic figures grouped in very bad taste. Admir. Roman Antiq.</p>

                     <p>To elucidate the formation of coal-beds, I shall here describe a fountain of fossil tar, or petroleum, discovered lately near Colebrook Dale, in Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, the particulars of which were sent me by Dr. Robert Darwin, of Shrewsbury.</p>
                     <p>About a mile and a half below the celebrated iron-bridge, constructed by the late Mr. Darby, near Colebrook Dale, on the east side of the river Severn, as the workmen, in October, 1786, were making a subterranean canal into the mountain, for the more easy acquisition and conveyance of the coals which lie under it, they found an oozing of liquid bitumen, or petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum; and as they proceeded further, cut through small cavities of different sizes, from which the bitumen issued. From ten to fifteen barrels of this fossil tar, each barrel containing thirty-two gallons, were at first collected in a day, which has since, however, gradually diminished in quantity, so that at present the product is about seven barrels in fourteen days.</p>
                     <p>The mountain into which this canal enters, consists of siliceous sand, in which, however, a few marine productions, apparently in their recent state, have been found, and are now in the possession of Mr. William Reynolds, of Ketly Bank. About three hundred yards from the entrance into the mountain, and about twenty-eight yards below the surface of it, the tar is found oozing from the sand-rock above, into the top and sides of the canal.</p>
                     <p>Beneath the level of this canal, a shaft has been sunk through a grey argillaceous substance, called, in this country, clunch, which is said to be a pretty certain indication of coal; beneath this lies a stratum of coal, about two or three inches thick, of an inferior kind, yielding little flame in burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and leaving much ashes; below this is a rock of a harder texture; and beneath this are found coals of an excellent quality; for the purpose of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing which with greater facility, the canal, or horizontal aperture, is now making into the mountain. July, 1788.</p>
                     <p>Beneath these coals, in some places is found salt water; in other parts of the adjacent country, there are beds of iron-stone, which also contain some bitumen in a less fluid state, and which are about on a level with the new canal, into which the fossil tar oozes, as above described.</p>
                     <p>There are many interesting circumstances attending the situation and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companiments of this fountain of fossil tar, tending to develope the manner of its production. 1. As the canal passing into the mountain runs over the beds of coals, and under the reservoir of petroleum, it appears that a <hi>natural distillation</hi> of this fossil, in the bowels of the earth, must have taken place at some early period of the world, similar to the artificial distillation of coal, which has many years been carried on in this place on a smaller scale above ground. When this reservoir of petroleum was cut into, the slowness of its exsudation into the canal, was not only owing to its viscidity, but to the
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:033600_0217_0FF79F4F48A44BA8"/>
pressure of the atmosphere, or to the necessity there was that air should at the same time insinuate itself into the small cavities from which the petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum descended. The existence of such a distillation at some ancient time, is confirmed by the thin stratum of coal beneath the canal, (which covers the hard rock,) having been deprived of its fossil oil, so as to burn without flame, and thus to have become a natural cock, or fossil charcoal, while the petroleum distilled from it is found in the cavities of the rock above it.</p>
                     <p>There are appearances in other places, which favour this idea of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral distillation of petroleum: thus, at Matlock, in Derbyshire, a hard bitumen is found adhering to the spar in the clefts of the lime-rocks, in the form of round drops about the size of peas; which could, perhaps, only be deposited there in that form by sublimation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second deduction which offers itself is, that these beds of coal have been <hi>exposed to a considerable degree of beat,</hi> since the petroleum above could not be separated, as far as we know, by any other means, and that the good quality of the coals beneath the hard rock, was owing to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permeability of this rock to the bituminous vapour, and to its pressure being too great to permit its being removed by the elasticity of that vapour. Thus, from the degree of heat, the degree of pressure, and the permeability of the superincumbent strata, many of the phenomena attending coal-beds receive an easy explanation, which much accords with the ingenious theory of the earth by Dr. Hutton. Trans. of Edinb. vol. 1.</p>
                     <p>In some coal works, the fusion of the strata of coal has been so light, that there remains the appearance of ligneous sebres and the impression of leaves, as at Bovey, near Exeter, and even seeds of vegetables, of which I have had specimens from the collieries near Polesworth, in Warwickshire. In some, where the heat was not very intense, and the incumbent stratum not permeable to vapour, the fossil oil has only risen to the upper part of the coal-bed, and has rendered that much more inflammable than the lower parts of it, as in the collieries near Beaudesert, the seat of the Earl of Ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, in Staffordshire, where the upper stratum is a perfect cannel, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-coal, and the lower of an inferior quality. Over the coal-beds near Sir H. Harpur's house, in Derbyshire, a thin lamina of asphaltum is found in some places near the surface of the earth, which would seem to be from a distillation of petroleum from the coals below, the more fluid part of which had, in process of time, exhaled, or been consolidated by its absorption of air. In other coal-works the upper part of the stratum is of a worse kind than the lower one, as at Alfreton and Denbigh, in Derbyshire, owing to the superincumbent stratum having permitted the exhalation of a great part of the petroleum; whilst at Widdrington, in Northumberland, there is first a seam of coal about six inches thick of no value, which lies under about four fathom of clay; beneath this is a white free-stone, then a hard stone, which the workmen there call a whin, then two fathoms of clay, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther white stone, and under that a vein of coals three feet nine inches thick, of a similar nature to the Newcastle coal. Phil. Trans. Abridg. vol. VI. plate 2, p. 192. The similitude between the circumstances of this colliery, and of the coal beneath the fountain of tar above described, readers it
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:033600_0218_0FF79F5104D27388"/>
highly probable, that this upper thin seam of coal has suffered a similar dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillation, and that the inflammable part of it had either been received into the clay above, in the form of sulphur, which, when burnt in the open air, would produce alum; or had been dissipated, for want of a receiver, where it could be condensed. The former opinion is, perhaps, in this case, more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, as in some other coal-beds, of which I have procured accounts, the surface of the coal beneath clunch or clay is of an inferior quality, as at West Hallum, in Nottinghamshire. The clunch probably from hence acquires its inflammable part, which, on calcination, becomes vitriolic acid. I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered pieces of clunch, converted partially into alum, at a colliery near Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston, where the ground was still on fire a few years ago.</p>
                     <p>The heat, which has thus pervaded the beds of morass, seems to have been the effect of the fermentation of their vegetable materials; as new hay sometimes takes fire, even in such very small masses, from the sugar it contains, and seems, hence, not to have been attended with any expulsion of lava, like the deeper craters of volcanos situated in the beds of granite.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The marine shells found in the loose sand-rock, above this reservoir of petroleum, and the coal-beds beneath it, together with the existence of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salt beneath these coals, prove that these coal-beds have been <hi>at the bottom of the sea,</hi> during some remote period of time, and were afterwards raised into their present situation by subterraneous expansions of vapour. This doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is further supported by the marks of violence, which some coal-beds received at the time they were raised out of the sea, as in the colleries at Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dip, in Somersetshire. In these are seven strata of coals, equitant upon each other, with beds of clay and stone intervening; amongst which clay are found shells and fern branches. In one part of this hill the strata are disjoined, and a quantity of heterogeneous substances fill up the chasm which disjoins them; on one side of this chasm the seven strata of coal are seen corresponding, in respect to their reciprocal thickness and goodness, with the seven strata on the other side of the cavity, except that they have been elevated several yards higher. Phil. Trans. No. 360. Abridg. vol. V. p. 237.</p>
                     <p>The cracks in the coal-bed near Ticknall, in Derbyshire, and in the sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone rock over it, in both of which specimens of lead-ore and spar are found, confirm this opinion of their having been forcibly raised up by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous fires. Over the colliery at Brown-hills, near Lichfield, there is a stratum of gravel on the surface of the ground, which may be adduced as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof to shew that those coals had some time been beneath the sea, or the bed of a river. Nevertheless, these arguments only apply to the collieries above-mentioned, which are few compared with those which bear no marks of having been immersed in the sea.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, the production of coals from morasses, as described in note XX. is evinced from the vegetable matters frequently found in them, and in the strata over them; as fern-leaves in nodules of iron-ore, and from the bog-shells, or fresh water muscles, sometimes found over them, of both which I have what I believe to be specimens; and is further proved, from some parts of these beds being only in part transformed to coal; and the
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:033600_0219_0FF79F52B02B1DA0"/>
other part still retaining not only the form, but some of the properties of wood; specimens of which are not unfrequent in the cabinets of the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, procured from Loch Neigh, in Ireland, from Bovey, near Exeter, and other places; and from a famous cavern called the Temple of the Devil, near the town of Altorf, in Franconia, at the foot of a mountain covered with pine and savine, in which are found large coals resembling trees of ebony; which are so far mineralized as to be heavy and compact; and so to effloresce with pyrites in some parts as to crumble to pieces; yet from other parts white ashes are produced on calcination, from which <hi>fixed alkali</hi> is procured; which evinces their vegetable origin. (Dict. Raisonné, art. Charbon.) To these may be added another argument, from the oil which is distilled from coals, and which is analogous to vegetable oil, and does not exist in any bodies truly mineral. Keir's Chemical Dictionary, art. Bitumen.</p>
                     <p>Whence it would appear, that though most collieries, with their attendant strata of clay, sand-stone, and iron, were formed on the places where the vegetables grew, from which they had their origin; yet that other collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of vegetable matter were washed down from eminences, by currents of waters, into the beds of rivers, or the neighbouring seas, and were there accumulated at different periods of time, and underwent a great degree of heat, from their fermentation, in the same manner as those beds of morass which had continued on the plains where they were produced. And that, by this fermentation, many of them had been raised from the ocean, with sand and sea-shells over them; and others from the beds of rivers, with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulations of gravel upon them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For the purpose of bringing this history of the products of morasses more distinctly to the eye of the reader, I shall here subjoin two or three ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of sinking or boring for coals, out of above twenty, which I have procured from various places, though the terms are not very intelligible, being the language of the overseers of coal-works.</p>

As these strata generally lie inclined, I suppose, parallel with the lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone on which they rest, the upper edges of them all come out to day, which is termed bassetting; when the whole mass was iginited by its fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, it is probable that the inflammable part of some strata might thus more easily escape than of others, in the form of vapour, as dews are known to slide between such strata in the production of springs; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for some coal-beds being so much worse than others. See note XX.</p>
                     <p>From this account of the production of coals from morasses, it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that coal-beds are not to be expected beneath, masses of lime-stone. Nevertheless, I have been lately informed by my friend, Mr. Michel, of Thornhill, who, I hope, will soon favour the public with his geological investigations, that the beds of chalk are the uppermost of all the lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones; and that they rest on the granulated lime-stone, called ketton-stone; which, I suppose, is similar to that which covers the whole country from Leadenham to Sleaford, and from Sleaford to Lincoln; and that, thirdly, coal-delphs are frequently found beneath these two uppermost beds of lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>
                     <p>Now, as the beds of chalk, and of granulated lime-stone may have been formed by alluviation, on or beneath the shores of the sea, or in vallies of the land, it would seem, that some coal-countries, which, in the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of the earth, had been sunk beneath the water, were thus covered with alluvial lime-stone, as well as others with alluvial basaltes, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gravel-beds. Very extensive plains, which now consist of alluvial ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, were, in the early times, covered with water, which has since di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished, as the solid parts of the earth have increased. For the solid parts of the earth, consisting chiefly of animal and vegetable recrements, must have originally been formed or produced from the water, by animal and vegetable processes; and as the solid parts of the earth may be supposed to be thrice as heavy as water, it follows, that thrice the quantity of water must have vanished, compared with the quantity of earth thus produced. This may account for many immense beds of alluvial materials, as gravel, rounded sand, granulated lime-stone, and chalk, covering such extensive plains as Lincoln-heath, having become dry without the supposition of their having been again elevated from the ocean. At the same time we acquire the knowledge of one of the uses or final causes of the organized world, not indeed very flattering to our vanity; that it converts water into earth, forming islands and continents by its recrements or exuviae.</p>

                     <p>THE lowest stratum of the earth which human labour has arrived to, is granite; and of this, likewise, consists the highest mountains of the world. It is known under variety of names, according to some difference in its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:033600_0221_0FF79F56BB960358"/>
of composition, but is now generally considered by philosophers as a species of lava; if it contains quartz, feltspat, and mica, in distinct crystals, it is called granite; which is found, in Cornwall, in rocks; and in loose stones in the gravel near Drayton, in Shropshire, in the road towards New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle. If these parts of the composition be less distinct, or if only two of them be visible to the eye, it is termed porphyry, trap, whin-stone, moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, slate. And if it appears in a regular angular form, it is called ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saltes. The affinity of these bodies has lately been further well established by Dr. Beddoes, in the Phil. Trans. vol. LXXX.</p>
                     <p>These are all esteemed to have been volcanic productions, that have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone different degrees of heat. It is well known, that in Papin's digester water may be made red-hot by confinement, and will then dissolve many bodies which otherwise are little or not at all acted upon by it. From hence it may be conceived, that under immense pressure of superincumbent materials, and by great heat, these masses of lava may have undergone a kind of aqueous solution, without any tendency to vitrifaction, and might thence have a power of ceystallization; whence all the varieties above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, from the different proportion of the materials, or the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of heat they may have undergone in this aqueous solution. And that the uniformity of the mixture of the original earths, as of lime, argil, silex, magnesia, and barytes, which they contain, was owing to their boiling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a longer or shorter time before their elevation into mountains. See note XIX. art. 8.</p>
                     <p>The seat of volcanos seems to be principally, if not entirely, in these strata of granite, as many of them are situated on granite mountains, and throw up, from time to time, sheets of lava, which run down over the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding strata, from the same origin; and in this they seem to differ from the heat which has separated the clay, coal, and sand, in morasses, which would appear to have risen from a kind of fermentation, and thus to have pervaded the whole mass, without any expuition of lava.</p>
                     <p>All the lavas from Vesuvius contain one fourth part of iron, (Kirwan's Min.) and all the five primitive earths, <abbr>viz.</abbr> calcareous, argillaceous, siliceous, barytic, and magnesian earths, which are also evidently produced now, daily, from the recrements of animal and vegetable bodies. What is to be thence concluded? Has the granite stratum, in very ancient times, been produced like the present calcareous and siliceous masses, according to the ingenious theory of Dr. Hutton, who says new continents are now forming at the bottom of the sea, to rise in their turn; and that thus the terraqueous globe has been, and will be, eternal? Or shall we suppose, that this internal heated mass of granite, which forms the nucleus of the earth, was a part of the body of the sun, before it was separated by an explosion? Or was the sun originally a planet, inhabited like ours, and a satellite to some other greater sun, which has long been extinguished by diffusion of its light, and around which the present sun continues to revolve, according to a conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the celebrated Mr. Herschell, and which conveys to the mind a most sublime idea of the progressive and increasing excellence of the works of the Creator of all things?</p>

For the more easy comprehension of the facts and conjectures concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the situation and production of the various strata of the earth, I shall here subjoin a supposed section of the globe, but without any attempt to give the proportions of the parts, or the number of them, but only their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective situation over each other, and a geological recapitulation.</p>
                     <div type="process">
                        <head>GEOLOGICAL RECAPITULATION.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. The earth was projected along with the other primary planets from the sun, which is supposed to be on sire only on its surface, emitting light without much internal heat, like a ball of burning camphor.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The rotation of the earth round its axis, was occasioned by its greater friction, or adhesion to one side of the cavity from which it was ejected; and from this rotation it acquired its spheroidical form. As it cooled in its ascent from the sun, its nucleus became harder; and its attendant vapours were condensed, forming the ocean.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The masses or mountains of granite, porphyry, basalt, and stones of similar structure, were a part of the original nucleus of the earth, or consist of volcanic productions since formed.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. On this nucleus of granite and basaltes, thus covered by the ocean, were formed the calcareous beds of lime-stone, marble, chalk, spar, from the exuviae of marine animals, with the flints, or chertz, which accompany them. And were stratified by their having been formed at different, and very distant periods of time.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The whole terraqueous globe was burst by central stres; islands and continents were raised, consisting of granite, or lava, in some parts, and of lime-stone in others; and great vallies were sunk, into which the ocean re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. During these central earthquakes the moon was ejected from the earth, causing new tides; and the earth's axis suffered some change in its inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and its rotatory motion was retarded.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. On some parts of these islands and continents of granite or lime-stone, were gradually produced extensive morasses, from the recrements of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables and of land animals; and from these morasses, heated by fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were produced clay, marl, sand-stone, coal, iron (with the bases of variety of acids); all which were stratified by their having been formed at different, and very distant periods of time.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. In the elevation of the mountains, very numerous and deep fissures necessarily were produced. In these fissures many of the metals are formed, partly from descending materials, and partly from ascending ones, raised in vapour by subterraneous fires. In the fissures of granite or porphyry, quartz is formed; in the fissures of lime-stone, calcareous spar is produced.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. During these first great volcanic fires, it is probable the atmosphere was either produced, or much increased; a process which is, perhaps, now going on in the moon; Mr. Herschell having discovered a volcanic crater three miles broad, burning on her disk.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. The summits of the new mountains were cracked into innumerable
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:033600_0224_0FF79F60A8FE08A8"/>
lozenges by the cold dews, or snows, falling upon them when red-hot. From these summits, which were then twice as high as at present, cubes and lozenges of granite, and basalt, and quartz, in some countries, and of marble and flints in others, descended gradually into the valleys, and were rolled together in the beds of rivers (which were then so large as to occupy the whole valleys, which they now only intersect); and produced the great beds of gravel, of which many valleys consist.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. In several parts of the earth's surface, subsequent earthquakes, from the fermentation of morasses, have, at different periods of time, deranged the position of the matters above described. Hence the gravel, which was before in the beds of rivers, has, in some places, been raised into mountains, along with clay and coal strata, which were formed from morasses, and washed down from eminences into the beds of rivers, or the neighbouring seas, and in part raised again with gravel, or marine shells, over them; but this has only obtained in few places, compared with the general distribution of such materials. Hence there seem to have existed two sources of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, which have occurred at great distance of time from each other; one from the granite beds, in the central parts of the earth, and the other from the morasses on its surface. All the subsequent earthquakes and volcanos of modern days, compared with these, are of small extent, and insignificant effect.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Besides the argillaceous sand-stone produced from morasses, which is stratified with clay, and coal, and iron, other great beds of siliceous sand have been formed in the sea, by the combination of an unknown acid from morasses, and the calcareous matters of the ocean.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. The warm waters which are found in many countries, are owing to steam arising from great depths, through the fissures of lime-stone or lava, elevated by subterranean fires, and condensed between the strata of the hills over them, and not from any decomposition of pyrites or manganese near the surface of the earth.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. The columns of basaltes have been raised by the congelation or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion of granite beds, in the act of cooling, from their semi-vitreous fusion.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THE atmosphere will dissolve a certain quantity of moisture, as a che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical menstruum, even when it is much below the freezing point, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the diminution of ice suspended in frosty air; but a much greater quantity of water is evaporated, and suspended in the air, by means of heat, which is, perhaps, the universal cause of fluidity; for water is known to boil with less heat in vacuo, which is a proof that it will evaporate faster in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuo,
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:033600_0225_0FF79F626FDFEBA0"/>
and that the air, therefore, rather hinders than promotes its evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in higher degrees of heat. The quick evaporation occasioned in vacuo by a small degree of heat, is agreeably seen in what is termed a pulse-glass, which consists of an exhausted tube of glass, with a bulb at each end of it, and with about two thirds of the cavity filled with alkohol, in which the spirit is instantly seen to boil, by the heat of the finger-end applied on a bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of steam in the lower bulb, and is condensed again in the upper bulb by the least conceivable comparative coldness.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another circumstance, evincing that heat is the principal cause of eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, is, that at the time of water being converted into steam, a great quantity of heat is taken away from the neighbouring bodies. If a ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer be repeatedly dipped in ether, or in rectified spirit of wine, and exposed to a blast of air, to expedite the evaporation by perpetually remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the saturated air from it, the thermometer will presently sink below freezing. This warmth, taken from the ambient bodies at the time of eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration by the steam, is again given out when the steam is condensed into water. Hence the water in a worm-tub, during distillation, so soon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes hot; and hence the warmth accompanying the descent of rain in cold weather.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third circumstance, shewing that heat is the principal cause of evaporation, is, that some of the steam becomes again condensed when any part of the heat is withdrawn. Thus, when warmer south-west winds, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with moisture, succeed the colder north-east winds, all bodies that are dense and substantial, as stone walls, brick floors, &amp;c. absorb some of the heat from the passing air, and its moisture becomes precipitated on them; while the north-east winds become warmer on their arrival in this latitude, and are thence disposed to take up more moisture, and are termed drying winds.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Heat seems to be the principal cause of the solution of many other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as common salt, or blue vitriol, dissolved in water, which, when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to severe cold, are precipitated, or carried, to the part of the water last frozen; this I observed in a phial filled with a solution of blue vitriol, which was frozen: the phial was burst, the ice thawed, and a blue column of cupreous vitriol was left standing upright on the bottom of the broken glass, as described in note XIX. art. 3.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Hence water may either be dissolved in air, and may then be called an aerial solution of water; or it may be dissolved in the fluid matter of heat, according to the theory of M. Lavoisier, and may then be called steam. In the former case, it is probable, there are many other vapours which may precipitate it, as marine acid gas, or fluor acid gas. So alkaline gas and acid gas, dissolved in air, precipitate each other; nitrous gas precipitates vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal air from its azote; and inflammable gas, mixed with vital air, ignited by an electric spark, either produces or precipitates the water in both of them. Are there any subtle exhalations, occasionally diffused in the atmos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, which may thus cause rain?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. But as water is, perhaps, many hundred times more soluble in the fluid matter of heat than in air, I suppose the eduction of this heat, by
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:033600_0226_0FF79F641065BD18"/>
whatever means it is occasioned, is the principal cause of devaporation. Thus, if a region of air is brought from a warmer climate, as the S. W. winds, it becomes cooled by its contact with the earth in this latitude, and parts with so much of its moisture as was dissolved in the quantity of calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique, or heat, which it now loses, but retains that part which was suspended by its attraction to the particles of air, or by aerial solution, even in the most severe frosts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A second immediate cause of rain a stream of N. E. wind descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a superior current of air, and mixing with the warmer S. W. wind below; or the reverse of this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> a superior current of S. W. wind mixing with an inferior one of N. E. wind: in both th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>se cases the whole heaven becomes instantly clouded, and the moisture contained in the S. W. current is precipitated. This cause of devaporation has been ingeniously explained by Dr. Hutton, in the Transact. of Edinburgh, vol. 1. and seems to arise from this circumstance; the particles of air of the N. E. wind educe part of the heat from the S. W. wind, and therefore the water which was dissolved by that quantity of <hi>beat</hi> is precipitated; all the other part of the water, which was suspended by its attraction to the particles of air, or dissolved in the remainder of the heat, continues unprecipitated.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third method by which a region of air becomes cooled, and, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, deposits much of its moisture, is from the mechanical expansion of air, when part of the pressure is taken off. In this case the expanded air becomes capable of receiving or attracting more of the matter of heat into its interstices; and the vapour, which was previously dissolved in this heat, is deposited, as is seen in the receiver of an air-pump, which becomes dewy, as the air within becomes expanded by the eduction of part of it. See note VII. Hence, when the mercury in the barometer sinks without a change of the wind, the air generally becomes colder. See note VII. on Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heat. And it is probably from the varying pressure of the incumbent air, that in summer days small black clouds are often thus suddenly produced, and again soon vanish. See a paper in Phil. Trans. vol. LXXVIII. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled Frigorific Experiments on the Mechanical Expansion of Air.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Another portion of atmospheric water may possibly be held in solution by the electric fluid, since, in thunder-storms, a precipitation of the water seems to be either the cause or the consequence of the eduction of the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity. But it appears more probable that the water is condensed into clouds by the eduction of its heat, and that then the surplus of electricity prevents their coalescence into larger drops, which immediately succeeds the departure of the lightning.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The immediate cause why the barometer sinks before rain, is, first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a region of warm air, brought to us in the place of the cold air which it had displaced, must weigh lighter, both specifically and absolutely, if the height of the warm atmosphere be supposed to be equal to that of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding cold one. And, secondly, after the drops of rain begin to fall in any column of air, that column becomes lighter, the falling drops only adding to the pressure of the air in proportion to the resistance which they meet with in passing through that fluid.</p>

If we could suppose water to be dissolved in air without heat, or in very low degrees of heat, I suppose the air would become heavier, as happens in many chemical solutions; but if water, dissolved in the matter of heat, or calorique be mixed with an aerial solution of water, there can be no doubt but an atmosphere consisting of such a mixture, must become lighter in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the quantity of calorique. On the same circumstance depends the visible vapour produced from the breath of animals in cold weather, or from a boiling kettle; the particles of cold air with which it is mixed, steal a part of its heat, and become themselves raised in temperature; whence part of the water is precipitated in visible vapour, which if in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, sinks to the ground; if in small quantity, and the surrounding air is not previously saturated, it spreads itself till it becomes again dissolved.</p>

                     <p>THE surface of the earth consists of strata, many of which were formed originally beneath the sea; the mountains were afterwards forced up by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous fires, as appears from the fissures in the rocks of which they consist, the quantity of volcanic productions all over the world, and the numerous remains of craters of volcanos in mountainous countries. Hence the strata which compose the sides of mountains lie slanting downwards, and one or two, or more, of the external strata not reaching to the summit when the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was raised up, the second or third stratum, or a more inferior one, is there exposed to day; this may be well represented by forceably thrusting a blunt instrument through several sheets of paper; a bur will stand up with the lowermost sheet, standing highest in the centre of it. On this upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most stratum, which is colder as it is more elevated, the dews are condensed in large quantities, and, sliding down, pass under the first, or second, or third stratum, which compose the sides of the hill, and either, form a morass below, or a weeping rock, by oozing out in numerous places, or many of these less currents meeting together, burst out in a more copious rill.</p>
                     <p>The summits of mountains are much colder than the plains in their vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, owing to several causes; 1. Their being, in a manner, insulated or cut off from the common heat of the earth, which is always, of 48 degrees, and perpetually counteracts the effect of external cold beneath that degree. 2. From their surfaces being larger in proportion to their solid contents, and hence their heat more expeditiously carried away by the ever-moving atmos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere. 3. The increasing rarity of the air as the mountain rises. All those bodies which conduct electricity well or ill, conduct the matter of heat like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise well or ill. See note VII. Atmosphere air is a bad conductor of electricity, and thence confines it on the body where it is accumulated; but, when it is made very rare, as in the exhausted receiver, the electric aura
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:033600_0228_0FF79F6A0BE9F8F8"/>
passes away immediately to any distance. The same circumstance probably happens in respect to heat, which is thus kept, by the denser air on the plains, from escaping, but is dissipated on the hills, where the air is thinner. 4. As the currents of air rise up the sides of mountains, they become mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically rarefied, the pressure of the incumbent column lessening as they ascend. Hence the expanding air absorbs heat from the mountain as it ascends, as explained in note VII. 5. There is another, and, perhaps, more powerful cause, I suspect, which may occasion the great cold on mountains, and in the higher parts of the atmosphere, and which has not yet been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to; I mean that the fluid matter of heat may probably gravitate round the earth, and form an atmosphere on its surface, mixed with the aerial at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere, which may diminish or become rarer, as it recedes from the earth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> surface, in a greater proportion than the air diminishes.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The great condensation of moisture on the summits of hills has ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause, which is the dashing of moving clouds against them: in misty days this is often seen to have great effect on plains, where an eminent tree, by obstructing the mist as it moves along, shall have a much greater quantity of moisture drop from its leaves, than falls at the same time on the ground in its vicinity. Mr. White, in his History of Selborne, gives an account of a large tree so situated, from which a stream flowed, during a moving mist, so as to fill the cart-ruts in a lane otherwise not very moist; and ingeniously adds, that trees planted about ponds of stagnant water, contribute much, by these means, to supply the reservoir. The spherules which constitute a mist or cloud, are kept from uniting by so small a power, that a little agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the leaves of a tree, or the greater attraction of a flat moist sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, condenses or precipitates them.</p>
                     <p>If a leaf has its surface moistened, and particles of water separate from each other, as in a mist, be brought near the moistened surface of a leaf, each particle will be attracted more by that plain surface of water on the leaf, than it can be by the surrounding particles of the mist; because globules only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract each other in one point, whereas a plain attracts a globule by a greater extent of its surface.</p>
                     <p>The common cold springs are thus formed on elevated grounds by the condensed vapours, and hence are stronger when the nights are cold, after hot days, in spring, than even in the wet days of winter. For the warm atmosphere, during the day, has dissolved much more water than it can support in solution during the cold of the night, which is thus deposited in large quantities on the hills, and yet so gradually as to soak in between the strata of them, rather than to slide off over their surfaces, like showers of rain. The common heat of the internal parts of the earth is ascertained by springs which arise from strata of earth too deep to be affected by the heat of summer or the frosts of winter. Those, in this country, are of 48 degrees of heat; those about Philadelphia were said, by Dr. Franklin, to be 52; whether this variation is to be accounted for by the difference of the sun's heat on that country, according to the ingenious theory of Mr. Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wan, or to the vicinity of subterranean fires, is not yet, I think, decided. There are, however, subterraneous streams of water not exactly produced
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:033600_0229_0FF79F6BA5A6CF28"/>
in this manner, as streams issuing from fissures in the earth, communicating with the craters of old volcanos: in the Peak of Derbyshire are many hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, called swallows, where the land floods sink into the earth, and come out at some miles distant, as at Ilam, near Ashborne. See note on Fica, vol. II.</p>
                     <p>Other streams of cold water arise from beneath the snow on the Alps and Andes, and other high mountains, which is perpetually thawing at its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der surface by the common heat of the earth, and gives rise to large rivers. For the origin of warm springs see note on Fucus, vol. II.</p>

                     <p>THE armour of the Echinus, or Sea hedge-hog, consists generally of moveable spines; (<hi>Linnoei System. Nat.</hi> vol. 1. p. 1102.) and, in that respect, resembles the armour of the land animal of the same name. The irregular protuberances on other sea-shells, as on some species of the Purpura, and Murex, serve them as a fortification against the attacks of their enemies.</p>
                     <p>It is said that this animal foresees tempestuous weather, and, sinking to the bottom of the sea, adheres firmly to sea-plants, or other bodies, by means of a substance which resembles the horns of snails. Above twelve hundred of these fillets have been counted, by which this animal fix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> itself; and when afloat, it contracts these fillets between the basis of its points, the number of which often amounts to two thousand. Dict. Raisonné. art. Oursin. de mer.</p>
                     <p>There is a kind of Nautilus, called, by Linnaeus, Argonauta, whose shell has but one cell: of this animal Pliny affirms, that having exonerated its shell by throwing out the water, it swims upon the surface, extending a web of wonderful tenuity, and bending back two of its arms, and rowing with the rest, makes a sail, and, at length, receiving the water, dives again. Plin IX. 29. Linnaeus adds to his description of this animal, that like the Crab Diogenes, or Bernhard, it occupies a house not its own, as it is not connected to its shell, and is therefore foreign to it; who could have given credit to this if it had not been attested by so many who have, with their own eyes, seen this argonaut in the act of sailing? Syst. Nat. p. 1161.</p>
                     <p>The Nautilus, properly so named by Linnaeus, has a shell, consisting of many chambers, of which cups are made in the East with beautiful paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and carying on the mother-pearl. The animal is said to inhabit only the uppermost or open chamber, which is larger than the rest; and that the rest remain empty, except that the pipe, or siphunculus, which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates from one to the other of them, is filled with an appendage of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:033600_0230_0FF79F6D374A5BA0"/>
like a gut or string. Mr. Hook, in his Philos. Exper. p. 306, imagines this to be a dilatable or compressible tube, like the air bladders of fish, and that, by contracting or permitting it to expand, it renders its shell buoyant, or the contrary. See note on Ulva, vol. II.</p>
                     <p>The Pinna, or Sea-wing, is contained in a two-valve shell, weighing sometimes fifteen pounds, and emits a beard of fine long glossy silk-like fibres, by which it is suspended to the rocks twenty or thirty feet beneath the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the sea. In this situation it is so successfully attacked by the eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed Polypus, that the species, perhaps, could not exist but for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Cancer Pinnotheris, who lives in the same shell as a guard and companion. Amoen. Acad. vol. II. p. 48. Lin. Syst. Nat. vol. I. p. 1159. and p. 1040.</p>
                     <p>The Pinnotheris, or Pinnophylax, is a small crab, naked, like Bernard the Hermit, but is furnished with good eyes, and lives in the same shell with the Pinna; when they want food the Pinna opens it shell, and sends its faithful ally to forage; but if the Cancer sees the Polypus, he returns sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to the arms of his blind hostess, who, by closing the shell, avoids the fury of her enemy; otherwise, when it has procured a booty, it brings it to the opening of the shell, where it is admitted, and they divide the prey. This was observed by Haslequist, in his voyage to Palestine.</p>
                     <p>The Byssus of the ancients, according to Aristotle, was the beard of the Pinna above-mentioned, but seems to have been used by other writers indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately for any spun material, which was esteemed finer or more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than wool. Reaumur says, the threads of this Byssus are not less fine or less beautiful than the silk, as it is spun by the silk-worm; the Pinna on the coast of Italy and Provence (where it is fished up by iron-hooks fixed on long poles) is called the silk-worm of the sea. The stockings and gloves manufactured from it, are of exquisite fineness, but too warm for common wear, and are thence esteemed useful in rheumatism and gout. Dict. Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonné. art. Pinne-marine. The warmth of the Byssus, like that of silk, is probably owing to their being bad conductors of heat, as well as of electricity. When these sibres are broken by violence, this animal, as well as the muscle, has the power to re-produce them like the common spiders, as was observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by M. Adanson. As raw silk, and raw cobwebs, when swallowed, are liable to produce great sickness (as I am informed) it is probable, the part of muscles, which sometimes disagrees with the people who eat them, may be this silky web, by which they attach themselves to stones.

The substance sold under the name of Indian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed, and used at the bottom of fish-lines, is probably a production of this kind; which, however, is scarcely to be distinguished by the eye from the tendons of a rat's tail, after they have been separated by putrefaction in water, and well cleaned and rubbed; a production, which I was once shewn as a great curiosity; it had the uppermost bone of the tail adhering to it; and was said to have been used as an ornament in a lady's hair.</p>

                     <p>THE Sturgeon, <hi>Acipenser, Strurio.</hi> Lin. Syst. Nat. vol. 1. p. 403. is a fish of great curiosity, as well as of great importance; his mouth is placed under the head, without teeth, like the opening of a purse, which he has the power to push suddenly out, or retract. Before this mouth, under the beak, or nose, hang four tendrils, some inches long, and which so resemble earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms, that at first sight they may be mistaken for them. This clumsy toothless fish is supposed, by this contrivance, to keep himself in good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the solidity of his flesh evidently shewing him to be a fish of prey. He is said to hide his large body amongst the weeds near the sea coast, or at the mouths of large rivers, only exposing his cirrhi, or tendrils, which small fish, or sea insects, mistaking for real worms, approach for plunder, and are sucked into the jaws of their enemy. He has been supposed by some to root into the soil at the bottom of the sea or rivers; but the cirrhi, or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drils above-mentioned, which hang from his snout over his mouth, must themselves be very inconvenient for this purpose, and, as it has no jaws, it evidently lives by suction, and, during its residence in the sea, a quantity of sea-insects are sound in its stomach.</p>
                     <p>The flesh was so valued in the time of the Emperor Severus, that it was brought to table by servants with coronets on their heads, and preceded by music, which might give rise to its being, in our country, presented by the Lord Mayor to the King. At present it is caught in the Danube, and the Wolga, the Don, and other large rivers, for various purposes. The skin makes the best covering for carriages; isinglass is prepared from parts of the skin; cavear from the spawn; and the flesh is pickled, or salted, and sent all over Europe.</p>

                     <p>THERE is reason to believe, that when oil is poured upon water, the two surfaces do not touch each other, but that the oil is suspended over the water by their mutual repulsion. This seems to be rendered probable by the following experiment: if one drop of oil be dropped on a bason of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it will immediately diffuse itself over the whole, for there being no friction between the two surfaces. there is nothing to prevent its spreading itself by the gravity of the upper part of it, except its own tenacity, into a pellicle of the greatest tenuity. But if a second drop of oil be put upon
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:033600_0232_0FF79F7339156740"/>
the former, it does not spread itself, but remains in the form of a drop, as the other already occupied the whole surface of the bason; and there is friction in oil passing over oil though none in oil passing over water.</p>
                     <p>Hence, when oil is diffused on the surface of water, gentle breezes have no influence in raising waves upon it; for a small quantity of oil will cover a very great surface of water (I suppose a spoonful will diffuse itself over some acres), and the wind blowing upon this, carries it gradually forwards, and there being no friction between the two surfaces, the water is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. On which account oil has no effect in stilling the agitation of the water after the wind ceases, as was found by the experiments of Dr. Franklin.</p>
                     <p>This circumstance, lately brought into notice by Dr. Franklin, had been mentioned by Pliny, and is said to be in use by the divers for pearls, who, in windy weather, take down with them a little oil in their mouths, which they occasionally give out, when the inequality of the supernatant waves prevents them from seeing sufficiently distinctly for their purpose.</p>
                     <p>The wonderful tenuity with which oil can be spread upon water, is evinced by a few drops projected from a bridge, where the eye is properly placed over it, passing through all the prismatic colours as it diffuses itself. And also from another curious experiment of Dr. Franklin's: he cut a piece of cork to about the size of a letter-wafer, leaving a point standing off like a tangent, at one edge of the circle. This piece of cork was then dipped in oil, and thrown into a large pond of water, and as the oil flowed off at the point, the cork-wafer continued to revolve in a contrary direction for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral minutes. The oil flowing off all that time at the pointed tangent, in coloured streams. In a small pond of water this experiment does not so well succeed, as the circulation of the cork stops as soon as the water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes covered with the pellicles of oil. See additional notes, No. XIII. and note on Fucus, vol. II.</p>
                     <p>The ease with which oil and water slide over each other, is agreeable seen if a phial be about half filled with equal parts of oil and water, and made to oscillate, suspended by a string; the upper surface of the oil, and the lower one of the water, will always keep smooth: but the agitation of the surfaces where the oil and water meet, is curious; for their specific gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being not very different, and their friction on each other nothing, the highest side of the water, as the phial descends in its oscillation, having, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a greater momentum than the lowest side (from its having descended further) would rise the highest on the ascending side of the oscillation, and thence pushes the then uppermost part of the water amongst the oil.</p>

                     <p>THE Teredo, or ship-worm, has two calcareous jaws, hemispherical, flat before, and angular behind. The shell is taper, winding, penetrating ships and submarine wood, and was brought from India into Europe. Linnaei System. Nat. p. 1267. The Tarieres, or sea-worms, attack and erode ships with such fury, and in such numbers, as often greatly to endanger them. It is said that our vessels have not known this new enemy above fifty years; that they were brought from the sea about the Antilles, to our parts of the ocean, where they have increased prodigiously. They bore their passage in the direction of the fibres of the wood, which is their nourishment, and cannot return or pass obliquely, and thence when they come to a knot in the wood, or when two of them meet together, with their stony mouths, they perish for want of food.</p>
                     <p>In the years 1731 and 1732, the United Provinces were under a dreadful alarm concerning these insects, which had made great depredation on the piles which support the banks of Zealand; but it was happily discovered a few years afterwards, that these insects had totally abandoned that island (Dict. Raisonné, art. Vers Rongeurs), which might have been occasioned by their not being able to live in that latitude, when the winter was rather severer than usual.</p>

                     <p>ON the coast of Norway there is an extensive vortex, or eddy, which lies between the islands of Moskoe and Moskenas, and is called Moskoestrom, or Maelstrom; it occupies some leagues in circumference, and is said to be very dangerous, and often destructive, to vessels navigating these seas. It is not easy to understand the existence of a constant descending stream, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out supposing it must pass through a subterranean cavity, to some other part of the earth or ocean which may lie beneath its level; as the Mediterranean seems to lie beneath the level of the Atlantic ocean, which, therefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly flows into it through the Straits; and the waters of the Gulph of Mexico lie much above the level of the sea about the Floridas, and farther northward, which gives rise to the Gulph-stream, as described in note on Cassia, in vol. II.</p>
                     <p>The Maelstrom is said to be still twice in about twenty-four hours, when the tide is up, and most violent at the opposite times of the day. This is
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:033600_0234_0FF79F76CAE5DB20"/>
not difficult to account for, since, when so much water is brought over the subterraneous passage, if such exists as completely to fill it, and stand many feet above it, less disturbance must appear on the surface. The Maelstrom is described in the Memoires of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, and Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topiddan's History of Norway, and in the Universal Museum for 1763, p. 131.</p>
                     <p>The reason why eddies of water become hollow in the middle is, because the water immediately over the centre of the well, or cavity, falls faster, having less friction to oppose its descent, than the water over the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or edges of the well. The circular motion, or gyration of eddies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the obliquity of the course of the stream, or to the friction or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to it being greater on one side of the well than the other: I have observed in water passing through a hole in the bottom of a trough, which was always kept full, the gyration of the stream might be turned either way by increasing the opposition of one side of the eddy with one's finger, or by turning the spout, through which the water was introduced, a little more obliquely to the hole on one side or on the other. Lighter bodies are liable to be retained long in eddies of water, while those rather heavier than water, are soon thrown out beyond the circumference, by their acquired mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum becoming greater than that of the water. Thus, if equal portions of oil and water be put into a phial, and, by means of a string, be whirled in a circle round the hand, the water will always keep at the greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the centre; whence, in the eddies formed in rivers during a flood, a person who endeavours to keep above water, or to swim, is liable to be detained in them, but on suffering himself to sink, or dive, he is said readily to escape. This circulation of water, in descending through a hole in a vessel, Dr. Franklin has ingeniously applied to the explanation of hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricanes, or eddies of air.</p>

                     <p>THE common heat of the interior parts of the earth being always 48 degrees, both in winter and summer, the snow which lies in contact with it is always in a thawing state. Hence, in ice-houses, the external part of the collection of ice is perpetually thawing, and thus preserves the internal part of it, so that it is necessary to lay up many tons for the preservation of one ton. Hence, in Italy, considerable rivers have their source from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the eternal glaciers, or mountains of snow and ice.</p>
                     <p>In our country, when the air, in the course of a frost, continues a day or two at very near 32 degrees, the common heat of the earth thaws the ice on its surface, while the thermometer remains at the freezing point. This circumstance is often observable in the rimy mornings of spring; the ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:033600_0235_0FF79F7951B5AD18"/>
shall continue at the freezing point, yet all the rime will vanish, except that which happens to lie on a bridge, a board, or on a cake of cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung, which, being thus, as it were, insulated or cut off from so free a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the common heat of the earth, by means of air under the bridge, or wood, or dung, which are bad conductors of heat, continues some time longer unthawed. Hence, when the ground is covered thick with snow, though the frost continues, and the sun does not shine, yet the snow is observed to decrease very sensibly. For the common heat of the earth melts the under surface of it, and the upper one evaporates by its solution in the air. The great evaporation of ice was observed by Mr. Boyle, which experiment I repeated some time ago. Having suspended a piece of ice by a wire, and weighed it with care, without touching it with my hand, I hung it out the whole of a clear frosty night, and found, in the morning, it had lost nearly a fifth of its weight. Mr. N. Wallerius has since observed, that ice, at the time of its congelation, evaporates faster than watèr in its fluid form; which may be accounted for from the heat given out at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of freezing; (Saussure's Essais sur Hygromet. p. 249.) but this effect is only momentary.</p>
                     <p>Thus the vegetables that are covered with snow are seldom injured; since, as they lie between the thawing snow, which has 32 degrees of heat, and the covered earth, which has 48, they are preserved in a degree of heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these, <abbr>viz.</abbr> in 40 degrees of heat. Whence the moss on which the rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deer feed, in the northern latitudes, vegetates beneath the snow; (See note on Muschus, vol. II.) and hence many Lapland and Alpine plants perished through cold in the botanic garden at Upsal; for, in their native situations, though the cold is much more intense, yet at its very commencement they are covered deep with snow, which remains till late in the spring. For this fact see Amaenit. Academ. vol. 1. No. 48. In our climate such plants do well covered with dried fern, under which they will grow, and even flower, till the severe vernal frosts cease. For the increase of glaciers see note on Canto I. l. 529.</p>

                     <p>THE theory of the winds is yet very imperfect, in part, perhaps, owing to the want of observations sufficiently numerous of the exact times and places where they begin and cease to blow, but chiefly to our yet imperfect knowledge of the means by which great regions of air are either suddenly produced or suddenly destroyed.</p>
                     <p>The air is perpetually subject to increase or diminution, from its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination with other bodies, or its evolution from them. The vital part of the air, called oxygene, is continually produced in this climate, from the
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:033600_0236_0FF79F7CBADC4490"/>
perspiration of vegetables in the sunshine, and probably from the action of light on clouds, or on water, in tropical climates, where the sun has greater power, and may exert some yet unknown laws of luminous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination. Another part of the atmosphere, which is called azote, is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually set at liberty from animal and vegetable bodies by putrefaction or combustion, from many springs of water, from volatile alkali, and probably from fixed alkali, of which there is an exhaustless source in the water of the ocean. Both these component parts of the air are perpetually again diminished by their contact with the soil, which covers the surface of the earth, producing nitre, The oxygene is diminished in the production of all acids, of which the carbonic and muriatic exist in great abundance. The azote is diminished in the growth of animal bodies, of which it constitutes an important part, and in its combinations with many other natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions.</p>
                     <p>They are both probably diminished, in immense quantities, by uniting with the inflammable air, which arises from the mud of rivers and lakes at some seasons, when the atmosphere is light; the oxygene of the air pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing water, and the azote producing volatile alkali, by their combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with this inflammable air. At other seasons of the year these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples may again change their combinations, and the atmospheric air be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produced.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Lavoisier found that one pound of charcoal, in burning, consumed two pounds nine ounces of vital air, or oxygene. The consumption of vital air, in the process of making red-lead, may readily be reduced to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation; a small barrel contains about twelve hundred weight of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity; 1200 pounds of lead, by calcination, absorb about 144 pounds of vital air: now, as a cubic foot of water weighs 1000 averdupois ounces, and as vital air is above 800 times lighter than water, it follows, that every barrel of red-lead contains nearly 2000 cubic feet of vital air. If this can be performed in miniature in a small oven, what may not be done in the immense elaboratories of nature!</p>
                     <p>These great elaboratories of nature include almost all her fossil, as well as her animal and vegetable productions. Dr. Priestley obtained air of greater or less purity, both vital and azotic, from almost all the fossil sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances he subjected to experiment. Four ounce-weight of lava, from Ice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, heated in an earthen retort, yielded twenty ounce-measures of air.</p>

                     <p>In this account the fixed air was previously extracted from the lime-stones by acids, and the heat applied was much less than was necessary to extract all the air from the bodies employed. Add to this the known quantities of air which are combined with the calciform ores, as the ochres of iron, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganese, calamy, grey ore of lead, and some idea may be formed of the great production of air in volcanic eruptions, as mentioned in note on Chunda, vol. II. and of the perpetual absorptions and evolutions of whole oceans of air from every part of the earth.</p>
                     <p>But there would seem to be an officina aeris, a shop where air is both manufactured and destroyed in the greatest abundance within the polar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as will hereafter be spoken of. Can this be effected by some yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known law of the congelation of aqueous or saline fluids, which may set at liberty their combined heat, and convert a part both of the acid and alkali of sea-water into their component airs? Or, on the contrary, can the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity of the northern lights convert inflammable air and oxygene into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whilst the great degree of cold at the poles unites the azote with some other base? Another officina aeris, or manufacture of air, would seem to exist within the tropics, or at the line, though in a much less quantity than at the poles, owing, perhaps, to the action of the sun's light on the moisture suspended in the air, as will also be spoken of hereafter; but in all other parts of the earth these absorptions and evolutions of air, in a greater or less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, are perpetually going on in inconceivable abundance; increased, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, and diminished, at different seasons of the year, by the approach or retrocession of the sun's light: future discoveries must elucidate this part of the subject. To this should be added, that as heat and electricity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps magnetism, are known to displace air, that it is not impossible but that the increased or diminished quantities of these fluids diffused in the atmos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, may increase its weight as well as its bulk; since their specific attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or affinities to matter, are very strong, they probably also possess ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral gravitation to the earth; a subject which wants further investigation.

                        <head>SOUTH-WEST WINDS.</head>
                        <p>The velocity of the surface of the earth, in moving round its axis, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishes from the equator to the poles. Whence, if a region of air, in this
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:033600_0238_0FF79F7FE67327A8"/>
country, should be suddenly removed a few degrees towards the north, it must constitute a western wind, because, from the velocity it had previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously acquired in this climate, by its friction with the earth, it would, for a time, move quicker than the surface of the country it was removed to. The contrary must ensue when a region of air is transported from this country a few degrees southward, because the velocity it had acquired in this climate would be less than that of the earth's surface where it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to; whence it would appear to constitute a wind from the east, while, in reality, the eminent parts of the earth would be carried against the too slow air. But if this transportation of air from south to north be performed gradually, the motion of the wind will blow in the diagonal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween south and west. And, on the contrary, if a region of air be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually removed from north to south, it would also blow diagonally between the north and east; from whence we may safely conclude, that all our winds in this country which blow from the north or east, or any point between them, consist of regions of air brought from the north; and that all our winds blowing from the south or west, or from any point between them, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of air brought from the south.</p>
                        <p>It frequently happens, during the vernal months, that after a north-east wind has passed over us for several weeks, during which time the barome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has stood at above 30 ½ inches, it becomes suddenly succeeded by a south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west wind, which also continues several weeks, and the barometer sinks to nearly 28 ½ inches. Now, as two inches of the mercury in the barometer balance one-fifteenth part of the whole atmosphere, an important question here presents itself: <hi>What is become of all this air?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. This great quantity of air cannot be carried in a superior current to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the line, while the inferior current flows towards the poles, because then it would equally affect the barometer, which should not, therefore, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side from 30 ½ inches, to 28 ½, for six weeks together.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It cannot be owing to the air having lost all the moisture which was previously dissolved in it, because these warm south-west winds are replete with moisture; and the cold north-east winds, which weigh up the mercury in the barometer to 31 inches, consist of dry air.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It cannot be carried over the polar regions, and be accumulated on the meridian opposite to us, in its passage towards the line, as such an accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation would equal one-fifteenth of the whole atmosphere, and cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to remain in that situation for six weeks together.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It cannot depend on the existence of tides in the atmosphere, since it must then correspond to lunar periods. Nor to accumulations of air from the specific levity of the upper regions of the atmosphere, since its degree of fluidity must correspond with its tenuity, and consequently such great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of air cannot be supposed to exist for so many weeks together as the south-west winds sometimes continue.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. It remains, therefore, that there must be, at this time, a great and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den absorption of air, in the polar circle, by some unknown operation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that the south wind runs in to supply the deficiency. Now, as this south wind consists of air brought from a part of the earth's surface

which moves faster than it does in this climate, it must have, at the same time, a direction from the west, by retaining part of the velocity, it had previously acquired. These south-west winds, coming from a warmer country, and becoming colder by their contact with the earth of this cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and by their expansion (so great a part of the superincumbent atmos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere having vanished), precipitate their moisture; and as they continue for several weeks to be absorbed in the polar circle, would seem to receive a perpetual supply from the tropical regions, especially over the line, as will hereafter be spoken of.</p>
                        <p>It may sometimes happen that a north-east wind, having passes over us, may be bent down, and driven back, before it has acquired any heat from the climate, and may thus, for a few hours, or a day, have a south-west direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from its descending from a higher region of the atmosphere, may possess a greater degree of cold, than an inferior north-east current of air.</p>
                        <p>The extreme cold of Jan. 13, 1709, at Paris, came on with a gentle south wind, and was diminished when the wind changed to the north, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for by Mr. Homberg, from a reflux of air which had been flowing for some time from the north.

                        <p>It may happen that a north-east current may, for a day or two, pass over us, and produce incessant rain, by mixing with the inferior south-west cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; but this, as well as the former, is of short duration, as its friction will soon carry the inferior current along with it; and dry or frosty weather will then succeed.</p>

                        <p>The north-east winds of this country consist of regions of air from the north, travelling sometimes at the rate of about a mile in two minutes, during the vernal months, for several weeks together, from the polar regions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the south, the mercury in the barometer standing above 30. These winds consist of air greatly cooled by the evaporation of the ice and snow over which it passes, and, as they become warmer by their contact with the earth of this climate, are capable of dissolving more moisture as they pass along, and are thence attended with frosts in winter, and with dry hot wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in summer.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. This great quantity of air cannot be supplied by superior currents passing in a contrary direction from south to north, because such currents must, as they arise into the atmosphere a mile or two high, become exposed to so great cold as to occasion them to deposit their moisture, which would fall through the inferior current upon the earth in some part of their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The whole atmosphere must have increased in quantity because it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the barometer that there exists one-fifteenth part more air over us for many weeks together, which could not be thus accumulated by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of temperature in respect to heat, or by any aerostatic laws at present known, or by any lunar influence.</p>

From whence it would appear that immense masses of air were set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from their combinations with solid bodies, along with a sufficient quantity of combined heat, within the polar circle, or in some region to the north of us; and that they thus perpetually increase the quantity of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere; and that this is again, at certain, times, re-absorbed, or enters into new combinations at the line or tropical regions. By which wonderful contrivance the atmosphere is perpetually renewed, and rendered fit for the support of animal and vegetable life.</p>

                        <p>The south-east winds of this country consist of air from the north, which had passed by us, or over us, and before it had obtained the velocity of the earth's surface in this climate, had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> back, owing to a deficiency of air now commencing at the polar regions. Hence these are generally dry or freezing winds, and if they succeed north-east winds, should prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticate a change of wind from north-east to south-west: the barometer is generally about 30. They are sometimes attended with cloudy weather, or rain, owing to their having acquired an increased degree of warmth and moisture before they became retrograde; or to their being mixed with air from the south.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Sometimes these south-east winds consist of a vertical eddy of north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east air, without any mixture of south-west air; in that case the barometer continues above 30, and the weather is dry or frosty for four or five days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</p>
                        <p>It should here be observed, that air being an elastic fluid, must be more liable to eddies than water, and that these eddies must extend into cylinders, or vortexes, of greater diameter, and that if a vertical eddy of north-east air be of small diameter, or has passed but a little way to the south of us before its return, it will not have gained the velocity of the earth's surface to the south of us, and will, in consequence, become a south-east wind. But if the vertical eddy be of large diameter, or has passed much to the south of us, it will have acquired velocity from its friction with the earth's surface to the south of us, and will, in consequence, on its return, become a south-west wind, producing great cold.</p>

                        <head>NORTH-WEST WINDS.</head>
                        <p>There seem to be three sources of the north-west winds of this hemisphere of the earth. 1. When a portion of southern air, which was passing over us, is driven back by accumulation of new air in the polar regions. In this case I suppose they are generally moist or rainy winds, with the barometer under 30; and if the wind had previously been in the south-west, it would seem to prognosticate a change to the north-east.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If a current of north wind is passing over us but a few miles high, without any easterly direction, and is bent down upon us, it must immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately possess a westerly direction, because it will now move faster than the
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:033600_0241_0FF79F879AB186D0"/>
surface of the earth where it arrives; and thus becomes changed from a north-east to a north-west wind. The descent of a north-east current of air producing a north-west wind, may continue some days with clear or freezing weather, as it may be simply owing to a vertical eddy of north-east air, as will be spoken of below. It may otherwise be forced down by a current of south-west wind passing over it; and it this case it will be attended with rain for a few days, by the mixture of the two airs of different degrees of heat; and will prognosticate a change of wind from north-east to south-west, if the wind was previously in the north-east quarter.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. On the eastern coast of North-America the north-west winds bring frost, as the north-east winds do in this country, as appears from variety of testimony. This seems to happen from a vertical spiral eddy made in the atmosphere, between the shore and the ridge of mountains which form the spine, or back-bone, of that continent. If a current of water runs along the hypothenuse of a triangle, an eddy will be made in the included angle, which will turn round like a water-wheel as the stream passes in contract with one edge of it. The same must happen when a sheet of air, flowing along from the north-east, rises from the shore, in a straight line, to the summit of the Apalachian mountains; a part of the stream of north-east air will flow over the mountains, another part will revert, and circulate spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, between the summit of the country and the eastern shore, continuing to move toward the south; and thus be changed from a north-east to a north-west wind.</p>
                        <p>This vertical spiral eddy, having been in contact with the cold summits of these mountains, and descending from higher parts of the atmosphere, will lose part of its heat, and thus constitute one cause of the greater cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the eastern sides of North-America than of the European shores op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to them, which is said to be equal to twelve degrees of north lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which is a wonderful fact, not otherwise easy to be explained, since the heat of the springs at Philadelphia is said to be 52, which is greater than the medium heat of the earth in this country.</p>
                        <p>The existence of vertical eddies, or great cylinders of air rolling on the surface of the earth, is agreeable to the observations of the constructors of wind-mills, who, on this idea, place the area of the sails leaning backwards, inclined to the horizon, and believe that then they have greater power than when they are placed quite perpendicularly. The same kind of rolling cylinders of water obtain in rivers, owing to the friction of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against the earth at their bottoms, as is known by bodies having been observed to float upon their surfaces quicker than when immersed to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain depth, These vertical eddies of air probably exist all over the earth's surface, but particularly at the bottom or sides of mountains, and more so, probably, in the course of the south-west than of the north-east winds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the former fall from an eminence, as it were, on a part of the earth where there is a deficiency of the quantity of air, as is shewn by the sinking of the barometer: whereas the latter are pushed or squeezed forward by an addition to the atmosphere behind them, as appears by the rising of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rometer.</p>

                        <p>A column of heated air becomes lighter than before, and will therefore ascend, by the pressure of the cold air which surrounds it, like a cork in water, or like heated smoke in a chimney.</p>
                        <p>Now, as the sun passes twice over the equator for once over either tropic, the equator has not time to become cool; and, on this account, it is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral hotter at the line than at the tropics; and, therefore, the air over the line, except in some few instances hereafter to be mentioned, continues to ascend at all seasons of the year, pressed upwards by regions of air brought from the tropics.</p>
                        <p>This air, thus brought from the tropics to the equator, would constitute a north wind on one side of the equator, and a south wind on the other; but as the surface of the earth at the equator moves quicker than the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the earth at the tropics, it is evident that a region of air brought from either tropic to the equator, and which had previously only acquired the velocity of the earth's surface at the tropics, will now move too flow for earth's surface at the equator, and will thence appear to move in a direction contrary to the motion of the earth. Hence the trade-winds, though they consist of regions of air brought from the north on one side of the line, and from the south on the other, will appear to have the diagonal direction of north-east and south-east winds.</p>
                        <p>Now, it is commonly believed that there are superior currents of air pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over these north-east and south-east currents in a contrary direction, and which, descending near the tropics, produce vertical whirlpools of air. An important question here again presents itself: <hi>What becomes of the moisture which this heated air ought to deposit, as it cools in the upper regions of the atmos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, in its journey to the tropics?</hi> It has been shewn by Dr. Priestley and Mr. Ingenhouz, that the green matter at the bottom of cisterns, and the fresh leaves of plants immersed in water, give out considerable quantities of vital air in the sunshine; that is, the perspirable matter of plants (which is water much divided in its egress from their minute pores), becomes decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the sun's light, and converted into two kinds of air, the vital and inflammable airs. The moisture contained or dissolved in the ascending heated air at the line, must exist in great tenuity; and, by being exposed to the great light of the sun in that climate, the water may be decomposed, and the new airs spread on the atmosphere from the line to the poles.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From there being no constant deposition of rains in the usual course of the trade-winds, it would appear that the water rising at the line is decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in its ascent.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. From the observations of M. Bougner, on the mountain Pinchinca, one of the Cordelieres immediately under the line, there appears to be no condensible vapour above three or four miles high. Now, though the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere at that height may be cold to a very considerable degree, yet its total deprivation of condensible vapour would seem to shew, that its water was decomposed, as there are no experiments to evince that any degree of
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:033600_0243_0FF79F8C0C719F88"/>
cold hitherto known has been able to deprive air of its moisture; and great abundance of snow is deposited from the air that flows to the polar regions, though it is exposed to no greater degrees of cold in its journey thither than probably exists at four miles height in the atmosphere at the line.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The hygrometer of Mr. Sauffure also pointed to dryness as he ascended into rarer air; the single hair of which it was constructed, contracting from deficiency of moisture. Essais sur l'Hygromet. p. 143.</p>
                        <p>From these observations it appears, either that rare and cold air requires more moisture to saturate it than dense air, or that the moisture becomes decomposed, and converted into air, as it ascends into these cold and rare regions of the atmosphere.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There seems some analogy between the circumstance of air being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced or generated in the cold parts of the atmosphere, both at the line and at the poles.</p>

                        <head>MONSOONS AND TORNADOES.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. In the Arabian and Indian seas are winds which blow six months one way, and six months the other, and are called Monsoons; by the accidental dispositions of land and sea, it happens, that in some places the air near the tropic is supposed to become warmer when the sun is vertical over it, than at the line. The air in these places consequently ascends, pressed upon one side by the north-east regions of air, and on the other side by the south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west regions of air. For as the air brought from the south has previously obtained the velocity of the earth's surface at the line, it moves faster than the earth's surface near the tropic, where it now arrives, and becomes a south-west wind, while the air from the north becomes a north-east wind, as before explained. These two winds do not so quietly join and ascend as the north-east and south-east winds, which meet at the line with equal warmth and velocity, and form the trade-winds; but as they meet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary directions before they ascend, and cannot be supposed accurately to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance each other, a rotatory motion will be produced, as they ascend, like water falling through a hole, and an horizontal or spiral eddy is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence; these eddies are more or less rapid, and are called Tornadoes in their most violent state, raising water from the ocean in the west, or sand from the deserts of the east; in less violent degrees, they only mix together the two currents of north-east and south-west air, and produce, by this means, incessant rains, as the air of the north-east acquires some of the heat from the south-west wind, as explained in Note XXV. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of the eddies produced by the monsoon-winds, was seen by Mr. Bruce in Abyssinia: he relates, that for many successive mornings, at the commencement of the rainy monsoon, he observed a cloud, of apparently small dimension, whirling round with great rapidity, and, in a few minutes, the heavens became covered with dark clouds, with consequent great rains. See note on Canto III. l. 129.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But it is not only at the place where the air ascends, at the northern extremity of the rainy monsoon, and where it forms tornadoes, as observed
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:033600_0244_0FF79F8F8F4C0400"/>
above by Mr. Bruce, but over a great tract of country, several degrees in length, in certain parts, as in the Arabian sea, a perpetual rain for several months descends, similar to what happens, for weeks together, in our own climate, in a less degree, during the south-west winds. Another important question presents itself here: <hi>If the climate to which this south-west wind ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives is not colder than that it comes from, why should it deposit its moisture during its whole journey? If it be a colder climate, why does it come thither?</hi> The tornadoes of air above described can extend but a little way, and it is not easy to conceive, that a superior cold current of air can mix with an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior one, and thus produce showers over ten degrees of country, since, at about three miles high, there is perpetual frost; and what can induce these narrow and shallow currents to flow over each other so many hundred miles?</p>
                        <p>Though the earth, at the northern extremity of this monsoon, may be more heated by certain circumstances of situation than at the line, yet it seems probable that the intermediate country between that and the line, may continue colder than the line (as in other parts of the earth), and hence, that the air coming from the line to supply this ascent, or destruction of air, at the northern extremity of the monsoon, will be cooled all the way in its approach, and, in consequence, deposit its water. It seems proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that at the northern extremity of this monsoon, where the tornadoes or hurricanes exist, that the air not only ascends, but is in part converted into water, or otherwise diminished in quantity, as no account is given of the existence of any superior currents of it.</p>
                        <p>As the south-west winds are always attended with a light atmosphere, an incipient vacancy, or a great diminution of air, must have taken place to the northward of them, in all parts of the earth wherever they exist; and a deposition of their moisture succeeds their being cooled by the climate they arrive at, and not by a contrary current of cold air over them, since, in that case, the barometer would not sink. They may thus, in our own country, be termed monsoons without very regular periods.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Another cause of TORNADOES, independent of the monsoons, is inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously explained by Dr. Franklin; when, in the tropical countries, a stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum of inferior air becomes so heated by its contact with the warm earth, that its expansion is increased more than is equivalent to the pressure of the stratum of air over it; or when the superior stratum becomes more condensed by cold than the inferior one by pressure, the upper region will descend, and the lower one ascend. In this situation, if one part of the atmosphere be hotter, from some fortuitous circumstances, or has less pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure over it, the lower stratum will begin to ascend at this part, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble water falling through a hole, as mentioned above. If the lower re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of air was going forwards with considerable velocity, it will gain an eddy by rising up this hole in the incumbent heavy air, so that the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool, or tornado, has not only its progressive velocity, but its circular one also, which thus lifts up or overturns every thing within its spiral whirl. By the weaker whirlwinds in this country, the trees are sometimes thrown down in a line of only twenty or forty yards in breadth, making a
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:033600_0245_0FF79F912DCEB710"/>
kind of avenue through a country. In the West-Indies the sea rises like a cone in the whirl, and is met by black clouds, produced by the cold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per air and the warm lower air being rapidly mixed; whence are produced the great and sudden rains called water-spouts; while the upper and lower airs exchange their plus or minus electricity in perpetual lightnings.</p>

                        <p>The sea, being a transparent mass, is less heated at its surface by the sun's rays than the land, and its continual change of surface contributes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a greater uniformity in the heat of the air which hangs over it. Hence the surface of the tropical islands is more heated during the day than the sea that surrounds them, and cools more in the night, by its greater elevation; whence, in the afternoon, when the lands of the tropical islands have been much heated by the sun, the air over them ascends, pressed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the cooler air of the incircling ocean; in the morning, again, the land becoming cooled more than the sea, the air over it descends by its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased gravity, and blows over the ocean, near its shores.</p>

                        <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. There are various irregular winds besides those above described, which consist of horizontal or vertical eddies of air, owing to the inequality of the earth's surface, or the juxtaposition of the sea. Other irregular winds have their origin from increased evaporation of water, or its sudden devaporation and descent in showers; others from the partial expansion and condensation of air by heat and cold; by the accumulation or defect of electric fluid, or to the air's new production or absorption, occasioned by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal causes not yet discovered, See notes VII. and XXV.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. There seem to exist only two original winds: one consisting of air brought from the north, and the other of air brought from the south. The former of these winds has also generally an apparent direction from the east, and the latter from the west, arising from the different velocities of the earth's surface. All the other winds above described are deflections or retrogres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of some parts of these currents of air from the north or south.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. One fifteenth part of the atmosphere is occasionally destroyed, and occasionally reproduced, by unknown causes. These causes are brought into immediate activity over a great part of the surface of the earth, at nearly the same time, but always more powerful to the northward than to the southward of any given place, and would hence seem to have their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal effect in the polar circles; existing, nevertheless, though with less power, toward the tropics or at the line.</p>
                        <p>For when the north-east wind blows the barometer rises, sometimes from 28 ½ inches to 30 ½, which shews a great new generation of air in the north; and when the south-west wind blows the barometer sinks as much, which shews a great destruction of air in the north. But as the north-east winds sometimes continue for five or six weeks, the newly generated air must be
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:033600_0246_0FF79F9317321C40"/>
destroyed at those times in the warmer climates to the south of us, or circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in superior currents, which has been shewn to be improbable from its not depositing its water. And as the south-west winds sometimes continue for some weeks, there must be a generation of air to the south at those times, or superior currents, which last has been shewn to be improbable.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The north-east winds, being generated about the poles, are pushed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards the tropics or line, by the pressure from behind, and hence they become warmer, as explained in note VII. as well as by their coming into contact with a warmer part of the earth, which contributes to make these winds greedily absorb moisture in their passage. On the contrary, the south-west winds, as the atmosphere is suddenly diminished in the polar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, are drawn, as it were, into an incipient vacancy, and become, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, expanded in their passage, and thus generate cold, as explained in note VII. and are thus induced to part with their moisture, as well as by their contact with a colder part of the earth's surface. Add to this, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the found of the north-east and south-west winds may depend on the former being pushed forwards by a pressure behind, and the latter fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were, into a partial or incipient vacancy before; whence the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer becomes more condensed, and the latter more rarefied, as it passes. There is a whistle termed a lark-call, which consists of a hollow cylinder of tin-plate, closed at each end, about half an inch in diameter, and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an inch high, with opposite holes, about the size of a goose-quill, through the centre of each end; if this lark-whistle be held between the lips, the found of it is manifestly different when the breath is forcibly blown through it from within outwards, and when it is sucked from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inwards. Perhaps this might be worthy the attention of organ build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. A stop is put to this new generation of air, when about a fifteenth of the whole is produced, by its increasing pressure; and a similar boundary is fixed to its absorption or destruction by the decrease of atmospheric pressure. As water requires more heat to convert it into vapour under a heavy atmos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere than under a light one, so in letting off the water from muddy fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds, great quantities of air-bubbles are seen to ascend from the bottom, which were previously confined there by the pressure of the water.

                        <p n="6">6. The increased absorptions and evolutions of air must, like its simple expansions, depend much on the presence or absence of heat and light, and will hence, in respect to the times and places of its production and destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be governed by the approach or retrocession of the sun, and on the temperature, in regard to heat, of various latitudes, and parts of the same latitude, so well explained by Mr. Kirwan.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Though the immediate cause of the destruction or re-production of great masses of air at certain times, when the wind changes from north to south, or from south to north, cannot yet be ascertained; yet, as there appears greater difficulty in accounting for this change of wind from any other known causes, we may still suspect that there exists in the arctic and

antarctic circles, a BEAR or DRAGON, yet unknown to philosophers, which, at times, suddenly drinks up, and as suddenly, at other times, vomits out one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fifteenth part of the atmosphere; and hope that this or some future age will learn how to govern and domesticate a monster which might be rendered of such important service to mankind.</p>

                        <p>If, along with the usual registers of the weather, observations were made on the winds in many parts of the earth, with the three following instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which might be constructed at no great expence, some useful infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation might be acquired.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To mark the hour when the wind changes from north-east to south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west, and the contrary. This might be managed by making a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the vane of a weather-cock to a clock, in such a manner, that if the vane should revolve quite round, a tooth on its revolving axis should stop the clock, or put back a small bolt on the edge of a wheel, revolving once in twenty-four hours.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To discover whether in a year more air passed from north to south, or the contrary. This might be effected by placing a wind-mill-sail of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, about nine inches diameter, in a hollow cylinder, about six inches long, open at both ends, and fixed on an eminent situation, exactly north and south. Thence only a part of the north-east and south-west currents would affect the sail so as to turn it; and if its revolutions were counted by an adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed machinery, as the sail would turn one way with the north currents of air, and the contrary one with the south currents, the advance of the counting finger either way, would shew which wind had prevailed most at the end of the year.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To discover the rolling cylinders of air, the vane of a weather-cock might be so suspended as to dip or rise vertically, as well as to have its hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal rotation.</p>

They some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times consist of south-west air, which had passed by us or over us, driven back by a new accumulation of air in the north. These continue but a day or two, and are attended with rain. See note XXV.</p>
                        <p>SOUTH-WEST WINDS consist of air flowing from the south, and seeming occasionally absorbed at its arrival to the more northern latitudes. It has a real direction from the west, owing to its not having lost in its journey the greater velocity it had acquired from the earth's surface, from whence it
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:033600_0248_0FF79F98340B1308"/>
came. These winds are analogous to the monsoons between the tropics, and frequently continue for four or six weeks together, with a low barometer, and rainy weather. 2. They sometimes consist of north-east air, which had passed by us or over us, which becomes retrograde by a commencing defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of air in the north. These winds continue but a day or two, attended with severer frost, with a sinking barometer; their cold being increased by their expansion, as they return, into an incipient vacancy.</p>
                        <p>NORTH-WEST WINDS consist, first, of south-west winds, which have passed over us, bent down, and driven back, towards the south, by newly generated northern air. They continue but a day or two, and are attended with rain or clouds. 2. They consist of north-east winds bent down from the higher parts of the atmosphere, and having there acquired a greater velocity than the earth's surface, are frosty and fair. 3.

                        <p>NORTH WINDS consist, first, of air flowing slowly from the north, so that they acquire the velocity of the earth's surface as they approach; are fair or frosty; seldom occur. 2.

                        <p>SOUTH WINDS consist, first, of air flowing slowly from the south, losing their previous western velocity by the friction of the earth's surface as they approach; moist; seldom occur. 2. They consist of retrograde north winds; these continue but a day or two; are preceded by north-east winds; and generally succeeded by south-west winds, colder, barometer sinking.</p>

A part of the southern air, which had passed by us or over us, with the retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade northern air above described, was now in its turn driven back, before it had lost the velocity of the surface of the earth to the south of us, and, consequently, became a north-west wind; and not having lost the warmth it brought from the south, produced a thaw.</p>

The air from the north continuing to blow, after it had driven back the southern air as above described, became a north-east wind, having less velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city than the surface of the earth in this climate, and produced frost from its coldness.</p>

                           <hi>Dec.</hi> 6, 7. Wind now changed to the south-west, with incessant rain and a sinking barometer. From unknown causes, I suppose the quantity of air to be diminished in the polar regions, and the southern air cooled by the earth's surface, which was previously frozen, deposits its moisture for a day or two; afterwards the wind continued south-west without rain, as the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the earth became warmer.</p>

                           <hi>March</hi> 18, 1785. There has been a long frost; a few days ago the barometer sunk to 29 ½, and the frost became more severe. Because the air being expanded, by a part of the pressure being taken off, became colder. This day the mercury rose to 30, and the frost ceased, the wind continuing as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, between north and east. <hi>March</hi> 19. Mercury above 30, weather still milder, no frost, wind north-east. <hi>March</hi> 20. The same; for the mercury rising; shews that the air becomes more compressed by the weight above, and, in consequence, gives out warmth.</p>

                           <hi>April</hi> 4, 5. Frost, wind north-east; the wind changed in the middle of the day to the north-west, without rain, and has done so for three or four days, becoming again north-east at night. For the sun now giving greater degrees of heat, the air ascends as the sun passes the zenith, and is supplied below by the air on the western side, as well as on the eastern side of the zenith, during the hot part of the day; whence, for a few hours, on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the hot part of the day, the air acquires a westerly direction in this longitude. If the north-west wind had been caused by a retrograde mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some southern air, which had passed over us, it would have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with rain or clouds.</p>

                           <hi>April</hi> 10. It rained all day yesterday, the wind north-west; this morning there was a sharp frost. The evaporation of the moisture (which fell yes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday), occasioned by the continuance of the wind, produced so much cold as to freeze the dew.</p>

                           <hi>May</hi> 12. Frequent showers, with a current of colder wind preceding every shower. The sinking of the rain or cloud pressed away the air from beneath it in its descent, which, having been for a time shaded from the sun by the floating cloud, became cooled in some degree.</p>

                           <hi>June</hi> 20. The barometer sunk, the wind became south-west, and the whole heaven was instantly covered with clouds. A part of the incumbent atmosphere having vanished, as appeared by the sinking of the barometer, the remainder became expanded by its elasticity, and thence attracted some of the matter of heat from the vapour intermixed with it, and thus, in a few minutes, a total devaporation took place, as in exhausting the receiver of an air-pump. See note XXV. At the place where the air is destroyed, currents both from the north and south flow in to supply the deficiency (for it has been shewn that there are no other proper winds but these two), and the mixture of these winds produces so sudden condensation of the moisture, both by the coldness of the northern air and the expansion of both of them, that lightning is given out, and an incipient tornado takes place; whence thunder is said frequently to approach against the wind.</p>

It appears from these journals that the mercury at Edinburgh varies sometimes nearly three inches, or one-tenth of the whole atmosphere. From the journals kept by the Royal Society at London, it appears seldom to vary more than two inches, or one-fifteenth of the whole atmosphere. The quantity of the variation is said still to decrease nearer the line, and to increase in the more northern latitudes; which much confirms the idea that there exists, at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times, a great destruction or production of air within the polar circle.</p>

                           <hi>July</hi> 2, 1732. The westerly winds in the journal in the Medical Essays, vol. II. above referred to, are frequently marked with the number three, to shew their greater velocity, whereas the easterly winds seldom approach to the number two. The greater velocity of the westerly winds than the easterly ones is well known, I believe, in every climate of the world; which may be thus explained, from the theory above delivered. 1. When the air is still, the higher parts of the atmosphere move quicker than those parts which touch the earth, because they are at a greater distance from the axis of motion. 2. The part of the atmosphere where the north or south wind comes from, is higher than the part of it where it comes to; hence the more elevated parts of the atmosphere continue to descend towards the earth as either of those winds approach. 3. When southern air is brought to us it possesses a westerly direction also, owing to the velocity it has previously acquired from the earth's surface; and if it consists of air from the higher parts of the atmosphere descending nearer the earth, this westerly velocity becomes increased. But when northern air is brought to us, it possesses an apparent easterly direction also, owing to the velocity which it has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viously acquired from the earth's surface being less than that of the earth's surface in this latitude: now, if the north-east wind consists of air descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from higher parts of the atmosphere, this deficiency of velocity will be less, in consequence of the same cause, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the higher parts of the atmos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere descending, as the wind approaches, increases the real velocity of the western winds, and decreases the apparent velocity of the eastern ones.</p>

                           <hi>October</hi> 22. Wind changed from south-east to south-west. There is a popular prognostication that if the wind changes from the north towards
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:033600_0251_0FF79F9E1A901838"/>
the south, passing through the east, it is more likely to continue in the south, than if it passes through the west, which may be thus accounted for. If the north-east wind change to a north-west wind, it shews either that a part of the northern air descends upon us in a spiral eddy, or that a superior current of southern air is driven back; but if a north-east wind be changed into a south-east wind, it shews that the northern air is become retrograde, and that in a day or two, as soon as that part of it has passed which has not gained the velocity of the earth's surface in this latitude, it will become a south wind for a few hours, and then a south-west wind.</p>

                     <p>WHEN points or hairs are put into spring-water, as in the experiments of Sir B. Thompson, (Phil. Trans. LXXVII.) and exposed to the light of the sun, much air, which loosely adhered to the water, rises in bubbles, as explained in the note on Fucus, vol. II. A still greater quantity of air, and of a purer kind, is emitted by Dr. Priestley's green matter, and by vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble leaves growing in water in sunshine, according to Mr. Ingenhouz's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments; both which I suspect to be owing to a decomposition of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perspired by the plant; for the edge of a capillary tube of great tenuity may be considered as a circle of points, and as the oxygene, or principle of vital air, may be expanded into a gas by the sun's light, the hydrogene, or inflammable air, may be detained in the pores of the vegetable.</p>
                     <p>Hence plants growing in the shade are white, and become green by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exposed to the sun's light; for their natural colour being blue, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of hydrogene adds yellow to this blue, and <hi>tans</hi> them green. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a similar circumstance takes place in animal bodies; their perspirable matter, as it escapes in the sunshine, becomes decomposed by the edges of their pores, as in vegetables, though in less quantity, as their perspiration is le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, and by their hydrogene being retained the skin becomes <hi>tanned</hi> yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. In proof of this it must be observed, that both vegetable and animal substances become bleached white by the sun-beams when they are dead, as cabbage-stalks, bones, ivory, tallow, bees-wax, linen and cotton cloth; and hence, I suppose, the copper-coloured natives of sunny countries might become etiolated, or blanched, by being kept from their infancy in the dark, or removed, for a few generations, to more northerly climates.</p>
                     <p>It is probable that on a sunny morning much pure air becomes separated from the dew, by means of the points of vegetables, on which it adheres,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:033600_0252_0FF79FA2AC8579E8"/>
and much inflammable air imbibed by the vegetable, or combined with it; and by the sun's light thus decomposing water, the effects of it in bleach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing linen seems to depend (as described in note X.): the water is decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the light at the ends or points of the cotton or thread, and the vital air unites with the phlogistic or colouring matters of the cloth, and produces a new acid, which is either itself colourless, or washes out; at the same time the inflammable part of the water escapes. Hence there seems a reason why cotton bleaches so much sooner than linen, <abbr>viz.</abbr> because its fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres are three or four times shorter, and therefore protrude so many more points, which seem to facilitate the liberation of the vital air from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable part of the water.</p>
                     <p>Bees-wax becomes bleached by exposure to the sun and dews, in a simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner as metals become calcined or rusty, <abbr>viz.</abbr> by the water on their surface being decomposed; and hence the inflammable material, which caused the colour, becomes united with vital air, forming a new acid, and is washed away.</p>
                     <p>Oil, close stopped in a phial not full, and exposed long to the sun's light, becomes bleached, as I suppose, by the decomposition of the water it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; the inflammable air rising above the surface, and the vital air unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the colouring matter of the oil. For it is remarkable, that by shutting up a phial of bleached oil in a dark drawer, it, in a little time, becomes coloured again.</p>
                     <p>The following experiment shews the power of light in separating vital air from another basis, <abbr>viz.</abbr> from azote. Mr. Scheele inverted a glass ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, filled with colourless nitrous acid, into another glass, containing the same acid, and, on exposing them to the sun's light, the inverted glass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came partly filled with pure air, and the acid, at the same time, became co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured. Scheele, in Crell's Annal. 1786. But if the vessel of colourless nitrous acid be quite full, and stopped, so that no space is left for the air produced to expand itself into, no change of colour takes place. Priestley's Exp. VI. p. 344. See Keir's very excellent Chemical Dictionary, p. 99. new edition.</p>
                     <p>A sun-flower, three feet and a half high, according to the experiment of Dr. Hales, perspired two pints in one day (Vegetable Statics), which is many times as much, in proportion to its surface, as is perspired from the surface and lungs of animal bodies; it follows, that the vital air liberated from the surfaces of plants by the sunshine, must much exceed the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it absorbed by their respiration, and that hence they improve the air in which they live during the light part of the day; and thus blanched ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables will sooner become <hi>tanned into green</hi> by the sun's light, than etiolated animal bodies will become <hi>tanned yellow</hi> by the same means.</p>
                     <p>It is hence evident, that the curious discovery of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dr. Priestley, that his green vegetable matter, and other aquatic plants, gave out vital air when the sun shone upon them, and the leaves of other plants did the same when immersed in water, as observed by Mr. Ingenhouz, refer to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of vegetables, not to their respiration. Because Dr. Priestley ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the pure air to come from both side of the leaves, and even from
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:033600_0253_0FF79FA441C73728"/>
the stalks of a water-flag, whereas one side of the leaf only serves the office of lungs, and certainly not the stalks. Exper. on Air, vol. III. And thus, in respect to the circumstance in which plants and animals seemed the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest removed from each other, I mean in their supposed mode of respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which one was believed to purify the air which the other had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, they seem to differ only in degree, and the analogy between them remains unbroken.</p>
                     <p>Plants are said, by many writers, to grow much faster in the night than in the day, as is particularly observable in seedlings, at their rising out of the ground. This probably is a consequence of their sleep rather than of the absence of light; and in this, I suppose, they also resemble animal bodies.</p>

                     <p>AS buds are the viviparous offspring of vegetables, it becomes necessary that they should be furnished with placental vessels for their nourishment, till they acquire lungs, or leaves, for the purpose of elaborating the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon juices of the earth into nutriment. These vessels exist in bulbs and in seeds, and supply the young plant with a sweet juice, till it acquires leaves, as is seen in converting barley into malt, and appears from the sweet taste of onions and potatoes, when they begin to grow.</p>
                     <p>The placental vessels belonging to the buds of trees are placed about the roots of most, as the vine; so many roots are furnished with sweet or mealy matter, as fern-root, bryony, carrot, turnip, potatoe, or in the albur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, or sap-wood, as in those trees which produce manna, which is depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited about the month of August, or in the joints of sugar-cane, and grasses; early in the spring the absorbent mouths of these vessels drink up moisture from the earth, with a saccharine matter lodged for that purpose during the preceding autumn, and push this nutritive fluid up the vessels of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnum, to every individual bud, as is evinced by the experiments of Dr. Hales, and of Mr. Walker, in the Edinburgh Philosophical Trans. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer observed, that the sap from the stump of a vine, which he had cut off in the beginning of April, arose twenty-one feet high, in tubes affixed to it for that purpose; but in a few weeks it ceased to bleed at all, and Dr. Walker marked the progress of the ascending sap, and found likewise that as soon as the leaves became expanded, the sap ceased to rise; the ascending juice of some trees is so copious and so sweet during the sap-season, that it is used to make wine, as the birch, betula, and sycamore, acer pseudo-platanus, and particularly the palm, and maple acer.</p>
                     <p>During this ascent of the sap-juice, each individual leaf-bud expands its new leaves, and shoots down new roots, covering, by their intermixture, the old bark with a new one; and as soon as these new roots (or bark) are capable of absorbing sufficient juices from the earth for the support of each
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:033600_0254_0FF79FA5EAC89748"/>
bud, and the new leaves are capable of performing their office of exposing these juices to the influence of the air, the placental vessels cease to act, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alesce, and are transformed from sap-wood, or alburnum, into inert wood, serving only for the support of the new tree, which grows over them.</p>
                     <p>Thus from the pith of the new bud of the horse-chesnut five vessels pass out through the circle of the placental vessels above described, and carry with them a minuter circle of those vessels; these five bundles of vessels unite after their exit, and form the foot-stalk or petiole of the new five-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered leaf, to be spoken of hereafter. This structure is well seen by cutting off a leaf of the horse-chesnut(AEsculus Hippocastanum) in September, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it falls, as the buds of this tree are so large that the flower may be seen in them with the naked eye.</p>
                     <p>After a time, perhaps about midsummer, another bundle of vessels pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses from the pith through the alburnum, or sap-vessels, in the bosom of each leaf, and unites, by the new bark, with the leaf, which becomes either a flower-bud or leaf-bud, to be expanded in the ensuing spring, for which purpose an apparatus of placental vessels is produced, with proper nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, during the progress of the summer and autumn; and thus the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table becomes annually increased, ten thousand buds often existing on one tree, according to the estimate of Linnaeus. Phil. Bot.</p>
                     <p>The vascular connection of vegetable buds with the leaves in whose bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms they are formed, is confirmed by the following experiment,(Oct. 20, 1781.) On the extremity of a young bud of the Mimosa (sensitive plant) a small drop of acid of vitriol was put, by means of a pen, and, after a few seconds, the leaf in whose axilla it dwelt closed, and opened no more, though the drop of vitriolic acid was so small as apparently only to injure the summit of the bud. Does not this seem to shew that the leaf and its bud have connecting vessels, though they arise at different times, and from different parts of the medulla, or pith? And, as it exists previously to it, that the leaf is the parent of the bud?</p>
                     <p>This placentation of vegetable buds is clearly evinced from the sweetness of the rising sap, and from its ceasing to rise as soon as the leaves are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded, and thus completes the analogy between buds and bulbs. Nor need we wonder at the length of the umbilical cords of buds, since that must correspond with their situation on the tree, in the same manner as their lymphatics and arteries are proportionally elongated.</p>
                     <p>It does not appear probable that any umbilical artery attends these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cental absorbents, since, as there seems to be no system of veins in vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to bring back the blood from the extremities of their arteries (except their pulmonary veins), there could not be any vegetable fluids to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their placenta, which, in vegetables, seems to be simply an organ for nutrition, whereas the placenta of the animal foetus seems likewise to serve as a respiratory organ, like the gills of fishes.</p>

                     <p>THE individuality of vegetable buds was spoken of before, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the method of raising all kinds of trees, by Mr. Barnes. (Method of propagating Fruit Trees. 1759. Lond. Bladwin.) He cut a branch into as many pieces as there were buds or leaves upon it, and wiping the two wounded ends dry, he quickly applied to each a cement, previously warmed a little, which consisted principally of pitch, and planted there in the earth. The use of this cement I suppose to consist in its preventing the bud from bleeding to death, though the author ascribes it to its antiseptic quality.</p>
                     <p>These buds of plants, which are thus each an individual vegetable, in many circumstances resemble individual animals; but as animal bodies are detached from the earth, and move from place to place in search of food, and take that food at considerable intervals of time, and prepare it for their nourishment within their own bodies after it is taken, it is evident they must require many organs and powers which are not necessary to a stationary bud. As vegetables are immoveably fixed to the soil from whence they draw their nourishment ready prepared, and this uniformly, not at returning intervals, it follows, that in examining their anatome, we are not to look for muscles of locomotion, as arms and legs; nor for organs to receive and prepare their nourishment, as a stomach and bowels; nor for a reservoir for it after it is prepared, as a general system of veins, which, in locomotive animals, contains and returns the superfluous blood which is left after the various organs of secretion have been supplied, by which contrivance they are enabled to live a long time without new supplies of food.</p>
                     <p>The parts which we may expect to find in the anatome of vegetables, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent to those in the animal economy, are, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. A system of absorbent vessels, to imbibe the moisture of the earth similar to the lacteal vessels, as in the roots of plants; and another system of absorbents, similar to the lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatics of animal bodies, opening its mouths on the internal cells and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal surfaces of vegetables; and a third system of absorbent vessels, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent with those of the placentation of the animal foetus, 2. A pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary system, correspondent to the lungs or gills of quadrupeds and fish, by which the fluid absorbed by the lacteals and lymphatics may be exposed to the influence of the air: this is done by the green leaves of plants, those in the air resembling lungs, and those in the water resembling gills; and by the petals of flowers. 3. Arterial systems to convey the fluid thus elaborated to the various glands of the vegetable, for the purposes of its growth, nutrition, and various secretions. 4. The various glands which separate from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable blood the honey, wax, gum, resin, starch, sugar, essential oil, &amp;c. 5. The organs adapted for their propagation or reproduction. 6. Muscles to perform several motions of their parts.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The existence of that branch of the absorbent vessels of vegetables which resembles the lacteals of animal bodies, and imbibes their nutriment

from the moist earth, is evinced by their growth so long as moisture is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to their roots, and their quickly withering when it is withdrawn,</p>
                     <p>Besides these absorbents in the roots of plants there are others, which open their mouths on the external surfaces of the bark and leaves, and on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal surfaces of all the cells, and between the bark and the alburnum, or sap-wood; the existence of these is shewn, because a leaf plucked off, and laid with its under side on water, will not wither so soon as if left in the dry air,—the same if the bark alone of a branch which is separated from a tree <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e kept moist with water,—and, lastly, by moistening the alburnum or sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood alone of a branch detached from a tree, it will not so soon wither as if left in the dry air. By the following experiment these vessels were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably visible by a common magnifying glass: I placed, in the summer of 1781, the foot-stalks of some large fig-leaves about an inch deep in a decoction of madder (rubia tinctorum) and others in a decoction of logwood (haematoxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum campechense), along with some sprigs cut off from a plant of picris; these plants were chosen because their blood is white; after some hours, and on the next day, on taking out either of these, and cutting off from its bottom about a quarter of an inch of the stalk, an internal circle of red points ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, which were the ends of absorbent vessels, coloured red with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, while an external ring of arteries was seen to bleed out hastily a milky juice, and, at once, evinced both the absorbent and arterial system. These absorbent vessels have been called by Grew, and Malphigi, and some other philosophers, bronchi, and erroneously supposed to be air-vessels. It is probable that these vessels, when cut through, may effuse their fluids, and receive air, their sides being too stiff to collapse; since dry wood emits air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bubbles in the exhausted receiver in the same manner as moist wood.</p>
                     <p>The structure of these vegetable absorbents consists of a spiral line, and not of a vessel interrupted with valves like the animal lymphatics, since on breaking almost any tender leaf, and drawing out some of the fibres, which adhere longest, this spiral structure becomes visible, even to the naked eye, and distinctly so by the use of a common lens. See Grew, plate 51.</p>
                     <p>In such a structure it is easy to conceive how a vermicular or peristaltic motion of the vessel, beginning at the lowest part of it, each spiral ring successively contracting itself till it fills up the tube, must forcibly push for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its contents, as from the roots of vines in the bleeding season; and if this vermicular motion should begin at the upper end of the vessel, it is as easy to see how it must carry its contained fluid in a contrary direction. The retrograde motion of the vegetable absorbent vessels is shewn by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a forked branch from a tree, and immersing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> part of one of the forks in water, which will, for many days, prevent the other from withering; or, it is shewn by planting a willow branch with the wrong end upwards. This structure, in some degree, obtains in the oesophagus, or throat of cows, who, by similar means, convey their food first downwards, and afterward upwards, by a retrograde motion of the annular muscles, or cartilages, for the purpose of a second mastication of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The fluids thus drank up by the vegetable absorbent vessels from the earth, or from the atmosphere, or from their own cells and interstices, are
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:033600_0257_0FF79FADCE5A0E98"/>
carried to the foot-stalk of every leaf, where the absorbents belonging to each leaf unite into branches, forming so many pulmonary arteries, and are thence dispersed to the extremities of the leaf, as may be seen in cutting away, slice after slice, the foot-stalk of a horse-chesnut in September, before the leaf falls. There is then a complete circulation in the leaf; a pulmonary vein receiving the blood from the extremities of each artery, on the upper side of the leaf, and joining again in the foot-stalk of the leaf, these veins produce so many arteries, or aortas, which disperse the new blood over the new bark, elongating its vessels, or producing its secretions; but as a reservoir of blend could not be wanted by a vegetable bud which takes in its nutriment at all times, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine there is no venous system, no veins, properly so called, which receive the blood which was to spare, and return it into the pulmonary or arterial system.</p>
                     <p>The want of a system of veins was countenanced by the following experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I cut off several stems of tall spurge (Euphorbia helioscopia) in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, about the centre of the plant, and observed tensold the quantity of milky juice ooze from the upper than from the lower extremity, which could hardly have happened if there had been a venous system of vessels to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the blood from the roots to the leaves.</p>
                     <p>Thus the vegetable circulation, complete in the lungs, but, probably, in the other part of the system deficient, in respect to a system of returning veins, is carried forwards without a heart, like the circulation through the livers of animals, where the blood brought from the intestines and mesen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery by one vein, is dispersed through the liver by the vena portarum, which assumes the office of an artery. See note XXXVII.</p>
                     <p>At the same time so minute are the vessels in the intertexture of the barks of plants, which belong to each individual bud, that a general circulation may possibly exist, though we have not yet been able to discover the venous part of it.</p>
                     <p>There is, however, another part of the circulation of vegetable juices vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the naked eye, and that is in the corol or petals of flowers, in which a part of the blood of the plant is exposed to the influence of the air and light in the same manner as in the foliage, as will be mentioned more at large in notes XXXVII and XXXIX.</p>
                     <p>These circulations of their respective fluids seem to be carried on in the vessels of plants precisely as in animal bodies, by their irritability to the stimulus of their adapted fluids, and not by any mechanical or chemical at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, for their absorbent vessels propel the juice upwards, which they drink up from the earth, with great violence; I suppose with much greater than is exerted by the lacteals of animals, probably owing to the greater minuteness of these vessels in vegetables, and the greater rigidity of their coats. Dr. Hales, in the spring season, cut off a vine near the ground, and, by fixing tubes on the remaining stump of it, found the sap to rise twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one feet in the tube, by the propulsive power of these absorbents of the roots of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Veget. Stat. p. 102. Such a power cannot be produced by capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary attraction, as that could only raise a fluid nearly to the upper edge of the attracting cylinder, but not enable it to flow over that edge, and much
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:033600_0258_0FF79FAF6A1FF750"/>
less to rise at feet above it. What then can this power be owing to? Doubtless to the living activity of the absorbent vessels, and to their increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vivacity, from the influence of the warmth of the spring succeeding the winter's cold, and their thence greater susceptibility to irritation from the juices which they absorb, resembling, in all circumstances, the action of the living vessels of animals.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THERE have been various opinions concerning the use of the leaves of plants in the vegetable economy. Some have contended that they are perspiratory organs; this does not seem probable from an experiment of Dr. Hales. Veget. Stat. p. 30. He found, by cutting off branches of trees with apples on them, and taking off the leaves, that an apple exhaled about as much as two leaves, the surfaces of which were nearly equal to the apple; whence it would appear that apples have as good a claim to be termed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiratory organs as leaves. Others have believed them excretory organs of excrementitious juices; but as the vapour exhaled from vegetables has no taste, this idea is no more probable than the other; add to this, that in moist weather they do not appear to perspire or exhale at all.</p>
                     <p>The internal surface of the lungs or air-vessels in men, is said to be equal to the external surface of the whole body, or about fifteen square feet; on this surface the blood is exposed to the influence of the respired air, through the medium, however, of a thin pellicle; by this exposure to the air it has its colour changed from deep red to bright scarlet, and acquires something so necessary to the existence of life, that we can live scarcely a minute without this wonderful process.</p>
                     <p>The analogy between the leaves of plants and the lungs or gills of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, seems to embrace so many circumstances, that we can scarcely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our assent to their performing similar offices.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The great surface of the leaves, compared to that of the trunk and branches of trees, is such, that it would seem to be an organ well adapted for the purpose of exposing the vegetable juices to the influence of the air; this, however, we shall see afterwards, is probably performed only by their upper surfaces; yet even in this case the surface of the leaves in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral bears a greater proportion to the surface of the tree, than the lungs of animals to their external surfaces.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the lungs of animals, the blood, after having been exposed to the air in the extremities of the pulmonary artery, is changed in colour from deep red to bright scarlet, and certainly in some of its essential properties; it is then collected by the pulmonary vein, and returned to the heart. To shew a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milarity of circumstances in the leaves of plants, the following experiment was made, June 24, 1781. A stalk, with leaves and seed-vessels, of large
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:033600_0259_0FF79FB1C27FADD0"/>
spurge (Euphorbia helioscopia) had been several days placed in a decoction of madder (Rubia tinctorum), so that the lower part of the stem, and two of the undermost leaves, were immersed in it. After having washed the immersed leaves in clear water, I could readily discern the colour of the madder passing along the middle rib of each leaf. This red artery was beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully visible both on the under and upper surface of the leaf; but on the upper side many red branches were seen going from it to the extremities of the leaf, which, on the other side, were not visible, except by looking through it against the light. On this under side a system of branching vessels, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a pale milky fluid, were seen coming from the extremities of the leaf, and covering the whole under side of it, and joining into two large veins, one on each side of the red artery, in the middle rib of the leaf, and along with it descending to the foot-stalk or petiole. On flitting one of these leaves with sciffars, and having a common magnifying lens ready, the milky blood was seen oozing out of the returning veins on each side of the red ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, in the middle rib, but none of the red fluid from the artery.</p>
                     <p>All these appearances were more easily seen in a leaf of picris treated in the same manner; for in this milky plant the stems and middle rib of the leaves are sometimes naturally coloured reddish, and hence the colour of the madder seemed to pass further into the ramifications of their leaf-arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and was there beautifully visible, with the returning branches of milky veins on each side.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From these experiments, the upper surface of the leaf appeared to be the immediate organ of respiration, because the coloured fluid was carried to the extremities of the leaf by vessels most conspicuous on the upper sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and there changed into a milky fluid, which is the blood of the plant, and then returned, by concomitant veins, on the under surface, which were seen to ooze when divided with scissars, and which, in picris particularly, render the under surface of the leaves greatly whiter than the upper one.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As the upper surface of leaves constitutes the organ of respiration, on which the sap is exposed, in the terminations of arteries, beneath a thin pellicle, to the action of the atmosphere, these surfaces, in many plants, strongly repel moisture, as cabbage-leaves; whence the particles of rain ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over their surfaces without touching them, as observed by Mr. Melville (Essays Literary and Philosoph. Edinburgh), have the appearance of globu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of quick-silver. And hence leaves, laid with the upper surface on wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wither as soon as in the dry air, but continue green many days if placed with the under surfaces on water, as appears in the experiments of Mons. Bonnet (Usage des Feuilles). Hence some aquatic plants, as the water-lily (Nymphoea), have the lower sides of their leaves floating on the water, while the upper surfaces remain dry in the air.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As those insects which have many spiracula, or breathing apertures, as wasps and flies, are immediately suffocated by pouring oil upon them, I carefully covered with oil the surfaces of several leaves of Phlomis, of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Laurel, and Balsams; and though it would not regularly adhere, I found them all die in a day or two.</p>
                     <p>Of aquatic leaves, see note on Trapa and on Fucus, in vol II. to which
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:033600_0260_0FF79FB627455070"/>
must be added, that many leaves are furnished with muscles about their foot-stalks, to turn their upper surfaces to the air or light, as Mimosa and Hedysarum gyrans. From all these analogies, I think there can be no doubt but that leaves of trees are their lungs, giving out a phlogistic material to the atmosphere, and absorbing oxygene or vital air.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The great use of light to vegetation would appear, from this theory, to be, by disengaging vital air from the water which they perspire, and thence to facilitate its union with their blood, exposed beneath the thin sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of their leaves; since, when pure air is thus applied, it is probable that it can be more readily absorbed. Hence, in the curious experiments of Dr. Priestley and Mr. Ingenhouz, some plants purified air less than others, that is, they perspired less in the sunshine; and Mr. Scheele found, that by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting peas into water which about half covered them, they converted the vital air into fixed air, or carbonic acid gas, in the same manner as in ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal respiration. See note XXXIV.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The circulation in the lungs or leaves of plants is very similar to that of fish. In fish, the blood, after having passed through their gills, does not return to the heart, as from the lungs of air-breathing animals, but the pulmonary vein, taking the structure of an artery, after having received the blood from the gills, which there gains a more florid colour, distributes it to the other parts of their bodies. The same structure occurs in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of fish, whence we see, in those animals, two circulations independent of the power of the heart, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that beginning at the termination of the veins of the gills, and branching through the muscles, and that which passes through the liver; both which are carried on by the action of those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective arteries and veins. Monro's Physiology of Fish, p. 19.</p>
                     <p>The course of the fluids in the roots, leaves, and buds of vegetables, seems to be performed in a manner similar to both these. First the absorbent vessels of the roots and surfaces unite at the foot-stalk of the leaf, and then, like the vena portarum, an artery commences without the intervention of a heart, and spreads the sap, in its numerous ramifications, on the upper surface of the leaf: here it changes its colour and properties, and becomes vegetable blood; and is again collected by a pulmonary vein on the under surface of the leaf. This vein, like that which receives the blood from the gills of fish, assumes the office and name of an artery, and, branching again, disperses the blood upward to the bud, from the foot-stalk of the leaf, and downward to the roots; where it is all expended in the various secretions, the nourishment and growth of the plant, as fast as it is prepared.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The organ of respiration already spoken of belongs particularly to the shoots or buds; but there is another pulmonary system, perhaps totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the green foliage, which belongs to the fructification only; I mean the corol or petals. In this there is an artery belonging to each pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, which conveys the vegetable blood to its extremities, exposing it to the light and air under a delicate membrane, covering the internal surface of the petal, where it often changes its colour, as is beautifully seen in some party-coloured poppies; though it is probable some of the iridescent colours of flowers may be owing to the different degrees of tenuity of the exterior
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:033600_0261_0FF79FB7D2408FC8"/>
membrane of the leaf, refracting the light like soap-bubbles; the vegetable blood is then returned by correspondent vegetable veins, exactly as in the green foliage; for the purposes of the important secretions of honey, wax, the finer essential oil, and the prolific dust of the anthers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The vascular structure of the corol, as above described, and which is visible to the naked eye, and its exposing the vegetable juices to the air and light during the day, evinces that it is a pulmonary organ.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As the gland which produce the prolific dust of the anthers, the honey, wax, and frequently some odoriferous essential oil, are generally attached to the corol, and always fall off, and perish with it, it is evident that the blood is elaborated or oxygenated in this pulmonary system, for the purpose of these important sercretions.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Many flowers, as the Colchicum, and Hamamelis, arise naked in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, no green leaves appearing till the ensuing spring; and many others put forth their flowers, and complete their impregnation, early in the spring, before the green foliage appears, as Mezerion, cherries, pears, which shews that these corols are the lungs belonging to the fructification.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This organ does not seem to have been necessary for the defence of the stamens and pistils, since the calyx of many flowers, as Tragopogon, performs this office; and, in many flowers, these petals themselves are so tender as to require being shut up in the calyx during the night; for what other use then can such an apparatus of vessels be designed?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In the Helleborus niger, Christmas-rose, after the seeds are grown to a certain size, the nectaries and stamens drop off, and the beautiful large white petals change their colour to a deep green, and gradually thus become a calyx, inclosing and defending the ripening seeds; hence it would seem that the white vessels of the corol served the office of exposing the blood to the action of the air, for the purposes of separating or producing the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, wax, and prolific dust; and when these were no longer wanted, that these vessels coalesced like the placental vessels of animals, after their birth, and thus ceased to perform that office, and lost, at the same time, their white colour. Why should they lose their white colour, unless they, at the same time, lost some other property besides that of defending the seed-ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, which they still continue to defend?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. From these observations I am led to doubt whether green leaves be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary to the progress of the fruit-bud, after the last year's leaves are fallen off. The green leaves serve as lungs to the shoots, and foster the new buds in their bosoms, whether these buds be leaf-buds or fruit-buds; but in the early spring the fruit-buds expand their corols, which are their lungs, and seem no longer to require green leaves; hence the vine bears fruit at one joint without leaves, and puts out a leaf-bud at another joint without fruit. And, I suppose, the green leaves which rise out of the earth, in the spring, from the Colchicum, are for the purpose of producing the new bulb and its placenta, and not for the giving maturity to the seed. When currant or goosberry trees lose their leaves by the depredation of insects, the fruit still continues to be formed, though less sweet and less in size.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="238" facs="unknown:033600_0262_0FF79FB963CDD908"/>
7. From these facts it appears, that the flower-bud, after the corol falls off (which is its lungs), and the stamens and nectary along with it, becomes simply an uterus for the purpose of supplying the growing embryon with nourishment, together with a system of absorbent vessels, which bring the juices of the earth to the foot-stalk of the fruit, and which there changes into an artery, for the purpose of distributing the sap for the secretion of the saccharine, or farinaceous, or acescent materials, for the use of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyon. At the same time as all the vessels of the different buds of trees inosculate or communicate with each other, the fruit becomes sweeter and larger when the green leaves continue on the tree, but the mature flowers themselves (the succeeding fruit not considered), perhaps suffer little injury from the green leaves being taken off, as some florists have observed.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That the vessels of different vegetable buds inosculate in various parts of their circulation, is rendered probable by the increased growth of one bud, when others in its vicinity are cut away; as it thus seems to receive the nourishment which was before divided amongst many.</p>

                     <p>FROM the accurate experiments and observations of Spallanzani, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that in the Spartium Junceum, rush-broom, the very minute seeds were discerned in the pod at least twenty days before the flower is in full bloom, that is, twenty days before fecùndation. At this time also the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the anthers was visible, but glued fast to their summits. The seeds, however, at this time, and for ten days after the blossom had fallen off, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to consist of a gelatinous substance. On the eleventh day after the falling of the blossom, the seeds became heart-shape, with the basis attached by an appendage to the pod, and a white point at the apex; this white point was, on pressure, sound to be a cavity including a drop of liquor.</p>
                     <p>On the 25th day, the cavity, which at first appeared at the apex, was much enlarged, and still full of liquor; it also contained a very small semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>transparent body, of a yellowish colour, gelatinous, and fixed by its two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite ends to the sides of the cavity.</p>
                     <p>In a month the seed was much enlarged, and its shape changed from a heart to a kidney; the little body contained in the cavity was increased in bulk, and was less transparent and gelatinous, but there yet appeared no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization.</p>
                     <p>On the 40th day, the cavity, now grown larger, was quite filled with the body, which was covered with a thin membrance; after this membrance was removed, the body appeared of a bright green, and was easily divided, by the point of a needle, into two portions, which manifestly formed the two lobes, and within these, attached to the lower part, the exceedingly small plantule was easily perceived.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="239" facs="unknown:033600_0263_0FF79FBB1039E670"/>
The foregoing observations evince, 1. That the seeds exist in the ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium many days before fecundation. 2. That they remain for some time solid, and then a cavity, containing a liquid, is formed in them. 3. That after fecundation a body begins to appear within the cavity, fixed by two points to the sides, which, in process of time, proves to be two lobes contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a plantule. 4. That the ripe seed consists of two lobes adhering to a plantule, and surrounded by a thin membrane, which is itself covered with a husk or cuticle. Spallanzani's Dissertations, vol. II. p. 253.</p>
                     <p>The analogy between seeds and eggs has long been observed, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the mode of their production. The egg is known to be formed within the hen long before its impregnation. C. F. Wolf asserts, that the yolk of the egg is nourished by the vessels of the mother, and that it has from those its arterial and venous branches, but that after impregnation these vessels gradually become impervious and obliterated, and that new ones are produced from the foetus, and dispersed into the yolk. Haller's Physiolog. Tom. VIII. p. 94. The young seed, after fecundation, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, is nourished in a similar manner, from the gelatinous liquor, which is previously deposited for that purpose; the uterus of the plant producing or secreting it into a reservoir or amnios, in which the embryon is lodged, and that the young embryon is furnished with vessels to absorb a part of it, as in the very early embryon in the animal uterus.</p>
                     <p>The spawn of frogs and of fish is delivered from the female before its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnation. M. Bonnet says, that the male salamander darts his semen into the water, where it forms a little whitish cloud, which is afterwards received by the swoln anus of the female, and she is fecundated.—He adds, that marine plants approach near to these animals, as the male does not project a fine powder, but a liquor, which, in like manner, forms a little cloud in the water.—And further adds, who knows but the powder of the stamina of certain plants may make some impression on certain germs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the animal kingdom! Letter XLIII, to Spallanzani, Oeuvres Philos.</p>
                     <p>Spallanzani found that the seminal fluid of frogs and dogs, even when diluted with much water, retained its prolific quality. Whether this quality be simply a stimulus exciting the egg into animal action, which may be called a vivifying principle, or whether part of it be actually conjoined with the egg, is not yet determined, though the latter seems more probable, from the frequent resemblance of the foetus to the male parent. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, however, of both the male and female influence seems necessary for the purpose of reproduction throughout all organized nature, as well in hermaphrodite insects, microscopic animals, and polypi, and exists as well in the formation of the buds of vegetables, as in the production of their seeds, which is ingeniously conceived and explained by Linnaeus. After having compared the flower to the larva of a butterfly, consisting of petals instead of wings, calyxes instead of wing-sheaths, with the organs of reproduction; and having shewn the use of the farina in fecundating the egg or seed, he proceeds to explain the production of the bud. The calyx of a flower, he says, is an expansion of the outer bark; the petals proceed from the inner
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:033600_0264_0FF79FBDD1CBCD28"/>
bark, or rind, the stamens from the alburnum, or woody circle, and the style from the pith. In the production and impregnation of the seed, a commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the secretions of the stamens and style are necessary; and for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a bud, he thinks the medulla, or pith, bursts its integuments, and mixes with the woody part, or alburnum, and these, forcing their passage through the rind and bark, constitute the bud, or viviparous progeny of the vegetable. System of Vegetables translated from Linnaeus, p. 8.</p>
                     <p>It has been supposed that the embryon vegetable, after fecundation, by its living activity, or stimulus exerted on the vessels of the parent plant, may produce the fruit or feed-lobes, as the animal foetus produces its pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa, and as vegetable buds may be supposed to produce their umbilical vessels or roots, down the bark of the tree. This, in respect to the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fruit surrounding the seeds of trees, has been assimilated to the gall-nuts or oak-leaves, and to the bedeguar on briars; but there is a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful objection to this doctrine, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the fruit of figs, all which are female in this country, grow nearly as large without fecundation, and, therefore, the embryon has in them no self-living principle.</p>

                     <p>THE glands of vegetables, which separate from their blood the mucilage, starch, or sugar, for the placentation or support of their seeds, bulbs, and buds; or those which deposit their bitter, acrid, or narcotic juices for their defence from depredations of insects or larger animals; or those which secrete resins or wax for their protection from moisture or frosts, consist of vessels too fine for the injection or absorption of coloured fluids, and have not, therefore, yet been exhibited to the inspection even of our glasses, and can, therefore, only be known by their effects; but one of the most curious and important of all vegetable secretions, that of honey, is apparent to our naked eyes, though, before the discoveries of Linnaeus, the nectary, or honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, had not even acquired a name.</p>
                     <p>The odoriferous essential oils of several flowers seem to have been design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their defence against the depredations of insects, while their beautiful colours were a necessary consequence of the size of the particles of their blood, or of the tenuity of the exterior membrane of the petal. The use of the prolific dust is now well ascertained; the wax which covers the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers prevents this dust from receiving moisture, which would make it burst prematurely, and thence prevent its application to the stigma, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens in moist years, and is the cause of deficient fecundation, both of our fields and orchards.</p>
                     <p>The universality of the production of honey in the vegetable world, and the very complicated apparatus which nature has constructed in many flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as well as the acrid or deleterious juices she has furnished those flowers
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:033600_0265_0FF79FC177FE2EC8"/>
with (as in the Aconite) to protect this honey from rain, and from the depredations of insects, seem to imply that this fluid is of very great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the vegetable economy; and also, that it was necessary to expose it to the open air previous to its re-absorption into the vegetable vessels.</p>
                     <p>In the animal system the lachrymal gland separates its fluid into the open air, for the purpose of moistening the eye; of this fluid, the part which does not exhale is absorbed by the puncta lachrymalia, and carried into the nostrils; but as this is not a nutritive fluid, the analogy goes no further than its secretion into the open air, and its re-absorption into the system; every other secreted fluid in the animal body is in part absorbed again into the system; even those which are esteemed excrementitious, as the urine and perspirable matter, of which the latter is secreted, like the honey, into the external air. That the honey is a nutritious fluid, perhaps the most so of any vegetable production, appears from its great similarity to sugar, and from its affording sustenance to such numbers of insects, which live upon it solely during summer, and lay it up for their winter provision. These proofs of its nutritive nature evince the necessity of its re-absorption into the vegetable system, for some useful purpose.</p>
                     <p>This purpose, however, has, as yet, escaped the researches of philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal botanists. M. Pontedera believes it designed to lubricate the vegetable uterus, and compares the horn-like nectaries of some flowers to the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicle of the caecum intestinum of animals. (Antholog. p. 49.) Others have supposed, that the honey, when re-absorbed, might serve the purpose of the liquor amnii, or white of the egg, as a nutriment for the young embryon, or fecundated seed, in its early state of existence. But as the nectary is found equally general in male flowers as in female ones; and as the young embryon, or seed, grows before the petals and nectary are expanded and after they fall off; and, thirdly, as the nectary so soon falls off after the fecundation of the pistillum; these seem to be insurmountable objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to both the above-mentioned opinions.</p>
                     <p>In this state of uncertainty, conjectures may be of use so far as they lead to further experiment and investigation. In many tribes of insects, as the silk-worm, and, perhaps, in all the moths and butterflies, the male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male parents die as soon as the eggs are impregnated and excluded; the eggs remaining to be perfected and hatched at some future time. The same thing happens in regard to the male and female parts of flowers; the anthers and filaments, which constitute the male parts of the flower, and the stigma and style, which constitute the female parts of the flower, fall off, and die, as soon as the seeds are impregnated, and along with these the petals and nectary. Now, the moths and butterflies above-mentioned, as soon as they acquire the passion and the apparatus for the reproduction of their species, lose the power of seeding upon leaves as they did before, and become nourished by what?—by honey alone.</p>
                     <p>Hence we acquire a strong analogy for the use of the nectary, or secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of honey in the vegetable economy, which is, that the male parts of flowers, and the female parts, as soon as they leave their soetus-state, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding their petals (which constitute their lungs), become sensible to the
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:033600_0266_0FF79FC32B4D8A70"/>
passion, and gain the apparatus for the reproduction of their species, and are sed and nourished with honey, like the insects above described; and that hence the nectary begins its office of producing honey, and dies, or ceases to produce honey, at the same time with the birth and death of the stamens and the pistils; which, whether existing in the same or in different flowers, are separate and distinct animated beings.</p>
                     <p>Previous to this time, the anthers with their filaments, and the stigmas with their styles, are, in their foetus-state, sustained by their placental ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, like the unexpanded leaf-bud, with the seeds existing in the vegetable womb, yet unimpregnated, and the dust, yet unripe, in the cells of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. After this period they expand their petals, which have been shewn above to constitute the lungs of the flower; the placental vessels, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nourished the anthers and the stigmas, coalesee, or cease to nourish them; and they now acquire blood more oxygenated by the air, obtain the passion and power of reproduction, are sensible to heat, and cold, and moisture, and to mechanic stimulus, and become, in reality, insects fed with honey, similar in every respect, except their being attached to the tree on which they were produced.</p>
                     <p>Some experiments I have made this summer, by cutting out the nectaries of several flowers of the aconites, before the petals were open, or had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come much coloured: some of these flowers, near the summit of the plants, produced no seeds; others, lower down, produced seeds; but they were not sufficiently guarded from the farina of the flowers in their vicinity; nor have I had opportunity to try if these seeds would vegetate.</p>
                     <p>I am acquainted with a philosopher, who, contemplating this subject, thinks it not impossible, that the first insects were the anthers or stigmas of flowers; which had, by some means, loosed themselves from their parent plant, like the male flowers of Vallisneria; and that many other insects have gradually, in long process of time, been formed from these; some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring wings, others sins, and others claws, from their ceaseless efforts to procure their food, or to secure themselves from injury. He contends, that none of these changes are more incomprehensible than the transformation of tadpoles into frogs, and caterpillars into butterflies.</p>
                     <p>There are parts of animal bodies which do not require oxygenated blood for the purpose of their secretions, as the liver, which, for the production of bile, takes its blood from the mesenteric veins, after it must have lost the whole or a great part of its oxygenation, which it had acquired in its passage through the lungs. In like manner the pericarpium, or womb of the flower, continues to secrete its proper juices for the present nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the newly animated embryon-seed; and the saccharine, acescent, or starchy matter of the fruit or seed-lobes, for its future growth, in the same manner as these things went on before fecundation; that is, without any circulation of juices in the petals, or production of honey in the nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; these having perished, and fallen off, with the male and female ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratus for impregnation.</p>
                     <p>It is probable that the depredations of insects on this nutritious fluid, must be injurious to the products of vegetation, and would be much more so,
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:033600_0267_0FF79FC605D0EC10"/>
but that the plants have either acquired means to desend their honey in part, or have learned to make more than is absolutely necessary for their own economy. In the same manner the honey-dew on trees is very inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to them; in which disease the nutritive fluid, the vegetable sap-juice, seems to be exsuded by a retrograde motion of the cutaneous lymphatics, as in the sweating sickness of the last century. To prevent the depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of insects on honey, a wealthy man in Italy is said to have poisoned his neighbour's bees, perhaps by mixing arsenic with honey, against which there is a most flowery declamation in Quintilian, No. XIII. As the use of the wax is to preserve the dust of the anthers from moisture, which would prematurely burst them, the bees which collect this for the construc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the combs or cells, must, on this account, also injure the vegetation of a country where they too much abound.</p>
                     <p>It is not easy to conjecture why it was necessary that this secretion of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney should be exposed to the open air in the nectary, or honey-cup, for which purpose so great an apparatus for its defence from insects and from showers became necessary. This difficulty increases when we recollect that the sugar in the joints of grass, in the sugar-cane, and in the roots of beets, and in ripe fruits, is produced without exposure to the air.—On supposition of its serving for nutriment to the anthers and stigmas, it may thus acquire greater oxygenation, for the purpose of producing greater powers of sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, according to a doctrine lately advanced by a French philosopher, who has endeavoured to shew, that the oxygene, or base of vital air, is the constituent principle of our power of sensibility.</p>
                     <p>So caterpillars are fed upon the common juices of vegetables found in their leaves, till they acquire the organs of reproduction, and then they feed on honey; all, I believe, except the silk-worm, which, in this country, takes no nourishment after it becomes a butterfly. Thus also the maggot of the bee, according to the observations of Mr. Hunter, is fed with raw vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter, called bee-bread, which is collected from the anthers of flowers, and laid up in cells for that purpose, till the maggot becomes a winged bee, acquires greater sensibility, and is fed with honey.

                     <p>From this provision of honey for the male and female parts of flowers, and from the provision of sugar, starch, oil, and mucilage, in the fruits, seed-cotyledons, roots, and buds of plants, laid up for the nutriment of the expanding foetus, not only a very numerous class of insects, but a great part of the larger animals procure their food, and thus enjoy life and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure without producing pain to others; for these seeds or eggs, with the nutriment laid up in them, are not yet endued with sensitive life.</p>
                     <p>The secretions from various vegetable glands, hardened in the air, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce gums, resins, and various kinds of saccharine, saponaceous, and wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like substances, as the gum of cherry or plumb trees, gum tragacanth from the astragulus tragacantha, camphor from the laurus camphora, elemi from amyris elemifera, aneme from hymenoea courbaril, turpentine from pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacia terebinthus, balsam of Mecca from the buds of amyris opobalsamum, branches of which are placed in the temples of the East, on account of their

fragrance; the wood is called xylobalsamum, and the fruit carpohalsamum; aloe from a plant of the same name, myrrh from a plant not yet described; the remarkably elastic resin is brought into Europe principally in the form of flasks, which look like black leather, and are wonderfully elastic, and not penetrable by water; rectified ether dissolves it; its inflexibility is increased by warmth, and destroyed by cold; the tree which yields this juice is the jatropha elastica; it grows in Guaiana and the neighbouring tracts of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; its juice is said to resemble wax, in becoming soft by heat, but that it acquires no elasticity till that property is communicated to it by a secret art, after which it is poured into moulds, and well dried, and can no longer be rendered fluid by heat.—Mr. de la Borde, physician at Cayenne, has given this account. Manna is obtained at Naples from the fraxinus ornus, or manna-ash; it partly issues spontaneously, which is preferred, and partly exsudes from wounds made purposely in the month of August; many other plants yield manna more sparingly. Sugar is properly made from the sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charum officinale, or sugar-ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e, but is found in the roots of beet and many other plants; American wax is obtained from the myrica cerifera, candle-berry myrtle; the berries are boiled in water, and a green wax separates; with luke-warm water, the wax is yellow: the seeds of croton febiferum are lodged in tallow: there are many other vegetable exsudations used in the various arts of dyeing, varnishing, tanning, lacquering, and which supply the shop of the druggist with medicines and with poisons.</p>
                     <p>There is another analogy, which would seem to associate plants with ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and which, perhaps, belongs to this note on Glandulation; I mean the similarity of their digestive powers. In the roots of growing vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as in the process of making malt, the farinaceous part of the seed is converted into sugar by the vegetable power of digestion, in the same manner as the farinaceous matter of seeds is converted into sweet chyle by the animal digestion. The sap-juice which rises in the vernal months from the roots of trees, through the alburnum, or sap-wood, owes its sweetness, I suppose, to a similar digestive power of the absorbent sys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of the young buds. This exists in many vegetables in great abundance, as in vines, sycamore, birch, and most abundantly in the palm-tree (Isert's Voyage to Guinea), and seems to be a similar fluid in all plants, as chyle is similar in all animals.</p>
                     <p>Hence, as the digested food of vegetables consists principally of sugar, and from that is produced again their mucilage, starch, and oil, and since ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are sustained by these vegetable productions, it would seem, that the sugar-making process carried on in vegetable vessels was the great source of life to all organized beings. And that, if our improved chemistry should ever discover the art of making sugar from fossile or aerial matter, without the assistance of vegetation, food for animals would then become as plentiful as water, and mankind might live upon the earth as thick as blades of grass, with no restraint to their numbers but the want of local room.</p>
                     <p>It would seem, that roots fixed in the earth, and leaves, innumerable, waving in the air, were necessary for the decomposition of water, and the conversion of it into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="245" facs="unknown:033600_0269_0FF79FCC8FFCF8C8"/>
cumberous, but totally incompatible with the locomotion of animal bodies. For how could a man or quadruped have carried on his head or back a forest of leaves, or have had long branching lacteal or absorbent vessels terminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the earth? Animals, therefore, subsist on vegetables; that is, they take the matter so far prepared, and have organs to prepare it further for the purposes of higher animation, and greater sensibility. In the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the apparatus of green leaves and long roots were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ound inconvenient for the more animated and sensitive parts of vegetable flowers; I mean the anthers and stigmas, which are, therefore, separate beings, endued with the passion and power of reproduction, with lungs of their own, and fed with honey, a food ready prepared by the long roots and green leaves of the plant, and presented to their absorbent mouths.</p>
                     <p>From this outline, a philosopher may catch a glimpse of the general eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of nature; and, like the mariner cast upon an unknown shore, who rejoiced when he saw the print of a human foot upon the sand, he may cry out with rapture, "A GOD DWELLS HERE."</p>

                     <p>THERE are four strata of the atmosphere, and four kinds of meteors. 1. Lightning is electric, exists in visible clouds, its short course, and red light. 2. Shooting stars exist in visible vapour, without found, white light, have no luminous trains. 3. Twilight; fire-balls move thirty miles in a second, and are about sixty miles high; have luminous trains, occasioned by an electric spark passing between the aerial and inflammable strata of the atmosphere, and mixing them and setting them on fire in its passage; attracted by volcanic eruptions; one thousand miles through such a medium resists less than the tenth of an inch of glass. 4. Northern lights not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to a point, but diffused; their colours; passage of electric fire in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuo dubious; Dr. Franklin's theory of northern lights countenaced in part by the supposition of a superior atmosphere of inflammable air; antiquity of their appearance; described in Maccabees.</p>

                  <p>The Classes are distinguished from each other in this inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious system, by the number, situation, adhesion, or recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal proportion of the males in each flower. The Orders, in many of these Classes, are distinguished by the number, or other circumstances of the females. The Families, or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera, are characterized by the analogy of all the parts of the flower or fructification. The Species are distinguished by the foliage of the plant; and the Varieties by any accidental circumstance of colour, taste, or odour; the seeds of these do not always produce plants similar to the parent; as in our numerous fruit-trees and garden flowers; which are propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by grafts or layers.</p>
                  <p>The first eleven Classes include the plants, in whose flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers both the sexes reside; and in which the Males or Stamens are neither united, nor unequal in height when at maturity; and are, therefore, distinguished from each other simply by the number of males in each flower, as is seen in the annexed PLATE, copied from the Dictionaire Botanique of M. BUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIARD, in which the numbers of each division refer to the Botanic Classes.</p>
                  <list>

                  </list>
                  <p>The next two Classes are distinguished not only by the number of equal and disunited males, as in the above eleven Classes, but require an additional circumstance to be attended to <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> whether the males or stamens be situated on the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyx, or not</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. TWENTY MALES, <hi>Icosandria.</hi> Twenty Stamens inserted on the calyx, or flower-cup; as is well seen in the last Figure of No. xii. in the annexed Plate.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. MANY MALES, <hi>Polyandria.</hi> From 20 to 100 Stamens, which do not adhere to the calyx; as is well seen in the first figure of No. xiii. in the annexed Plate.</p>
                  <p>In the next two Classes, not only the number of stamens are to be observed, but the reciprocal proportions in respect to height.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. TWO POWERS, <hi>Didynamia.</hi> Four Stamens, of which two are lower than the other two; as is seen in the two first Figures of No. xiv.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. FOUR POWERS, <hi>Totradynamia.</hi> Six Stamens, of which four are taller, and the two lower ones opposite to each other; as is seen in the third Figure of the upper row, in No. xv.</p>
                  <p>The five subsequent Classes are distinguished not by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the males, or stamens, but by their union or adhesion, either by their anthers or filaments, or to the female, or pistil.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. ONE BROTHERHOOD, <hi>Monadelphia.</hi> Many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens united by their filaments into one company; as in the second Figure below of NO. xvi.</p>

XVII. TWO BROTHERHOODS, <hi>Diadelphia.</hi> Many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens united by their filaments into two companies; as in the uppermost Figure, No. xvii.</p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. MANY BROTHERHOODS, <hi>Polyadelphia.</hi> Many Stamens united by their filaments into three or more compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; as in No. xviii.</p>
                  <p n="19">XIX. CONFEDERATE MALES, <hi>Syngenesia.</hi> Many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens united by their anthers; as in the first and second Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, NO. xix.</p>
                  <p n="20">XX. FEMININE MALES, <hi>Gynandria.</hi> Many Stamens attached to the pistil.</p>
                  <p>The next three Classes consist of plants, whose flowers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain but one of the sexes; or if some of them contain both sexes, there are other flowers accompanying them of but one sex.</p>
                  <p n="21">XXI. ONE HOUSE, <hi>Monoecia.</hi> Male flowers and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male flowers separate, but on the same plant.</p>
                  <p n="22">XXII. TWO HOUSES, <hi>Dioecia.</hi> Male flowers and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male flowers separate, on different plants.</p>
                  <p n="23">XXIII. POLYGAMY, <hi>Polygamia.</hi> Male and female flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on one or more plants, which have, at the same time, flowers of both sexes.</p>
                  <p>The last Class contains the plants whose flowers are not discernible.</p>
                  <p n="24">XXIV. CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE, <hi>Cryptogamia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Orders of the first thirteen Classes are founded on the number of Females, or Pistils, and distinguished by the names, ONE FEMALE, <hi>Monogynia.</hi> TWO FEMALES, <hi>Digynia.</hi> THREE FEMALES, <hi>Trigynia, &amp;c.</hi> as is seen in No. i. which represents a plant of one male, one female; and in the first Figure of No. xi. which represents a flower with twelve males, and three females; (for, where the pistils have no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent styles, the summits, or stigmas, are to be numbered,) and in the first Figure of No. xii. which represents a flower with twenty males, and many females; and in the last Figure of the same No. which has twenty males, and one female;
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:033600_0285_0FF79FEBC02BBF38"/>
and in No. xiii. which represents a flower with many males, and many females.</p>
                  <p>The Class of TWO POWERS, is divided into two natural Orders; into such as have their seeds naked at the bottom of the calyx, or flower-cup; and such as have their seeds co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; as is seen in No. xvi. Fig. 3 and 5.</p>
                  <p>The Class of FOUR POWERS, is divided also into two Orders; in one of these the seeds are inclosed in a silicule, as in <hi>Shepherd's purse,</hi> No. xv. Fig. 5. In the other they are inclosed in a silique; as in <hi>Wall-flower,</hi> Fig. 4.</p>
                  <p>In all the other Classes, excepting the Classes Confederate Males and Clandestine Marriage, as the character of each Class is distinguished by the situations of the males; the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Orders is marked by the numbers of them. In the Class ONE BROTHERHOOD, No. xvi. Fig. 3. the Order of ten males is represented. And in the Class TWO BRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERHOODS, No. xvii. Fig. 2. the Order of ten males is represented.</p>
                  <p>In the Class CONFEDERATE MALES, the Orders are chiefly distinguished by the fertility or barrenness of the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets of the disk, or ray of the compound flower.</p>
                  <p>And in the Class of CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE, the four Orders are termed FERNS, MOSSES, FLAGS, and FUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUSSES.</p>
                  <p>The Orders are again divided into Genera, or Families, which are all natural associations, and are described from the general resemblances of the parts of fructification, in respect to their number, form, situation, and reciprocal proportion. These are the Calyx, or Flower-cup; as seen in No. iv. Fig. 1. No. x. Fig. 1, and 3. No. xiv. Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the Corol, or Blossom; as seen in No. i, ii. &amp;c. Third, the Males, or Stamens; as in No. iv. Fig. 1. and No. viii. Fig. 1. Fourth, the Females or Pistils; as in No. i.
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:033600_0286_0FF79FEF622CA070"/>
No. xii. Fig. 1. No. xiv. Fig. 3. No. xv. Fig. 3. Fifth, the Pericarp, or Fruit-vessel; as in No. xv. Fig. 4, 5. No. xvii. Fig. 2. Sixth, the Seeds.</p>
                  <p>The illustrious author of the Sexual System of Botany, in his preface to his account of the Natural Orders, ingeniously imagines, that one plant of each Natural Order was created in the beginning; and that the intermarriages of these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced one plant of every Genus, or Family; and that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarriages of these Generic, or Family plants, produced all the species: and, lastly, that the intermarriages of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals of the species produced the Varieties.</p>
                  <p>In the following POEM, the name or number of the Class or Order of each plant is printed in Italics as <hi>"Two</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther swains." <hi>"One</hi> house contains them;" and the word <hi>"secret,</hi> expresses the class of Clandestine Marriage.</p>
                  <p>The Reader who wishes to become further acquainted with this delightful field of science, is advised to study the works of the Great Master, and is apprized that they are exactly and literally translated into English, by a Society at LICH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIELD, in four Volumes Octavo.</p>
                  <p>To the SYSTEM OF VEGETABLES is prefixed a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious explanation of all the Terms used in Botany, translated from a thesis of Dr. ELMSGREEN, with the plates and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences from the Philosophia Botannica of LINNAEUS.</p>
                  <p>To the FAMILIES OF PLANTS is prefixed a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the names of plants, and other Botanic Terms, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accented, to shew their proper pronunciation; a work of great labour, and which was much wanted, not only by beginners, but by proficients in BOTANY.</p>

The males are generally united at the bottom in two sets, whence Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus has named the class "two brotherhoods." In the Genista, however, they are united in but one set. The flowers of this class are called papilio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naceous, from their resemblance to a butterfly, as a pea-blossom. In the Spartium Scoparium, or common broom, I have lately observed a curious circumstance; the males, or stamens, are in two sets, one set rising a quarter of an inch above the other; the upper set does not arrive at their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity so soon as the lower, and the stigma, or head of the female, is produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst the upper or immature set; but as soon as the pistil grows tall enough to burst open the keel-leaf, or hood of the flower, it bends itself round in an instant, like a French horn, and inserts its head, or stigma, amongst the lower or mature set of males. The pistil, or female, continues to grow in length; and in a few days the stigma arrives again amongst the upper set, by the time they become mature. This wonderful contrivance is readily seen by opening the keel-leaf of the flowers of broom before they burst spontaneously. See note on Collinsonia, Gloriosa, Draba.</note>

The uncommon beauty of this flower occasioned Linnaeus to give it a name signifying the twelve heathen gods; and Dr. Mead to affix his own name to it. The pistil is much longer than the stamens; hence the flower-stalks have their elegant bend, that the stigma may hang downwards to receive the fecundating dust of the anthers. And the petals are so beautifully turned back to prevent the rain or dew-drops from sliding down and washing off this dust prema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely; and at the same time exposing it to the light and air. As soon as the seeds are formed, it erects all the flower-stalks to prevent them from falling out, and thus loses the beauty of its figure. Is this a mechanical ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or does it indicate a vegetable storgé to preserve its offspring? See note on Ilex, and Gloriosa.</p>
                           <p>In the Meadia, the Borago, Cyclamen, Solanum, and many others, the filaments are very short compared with the style. Hence it became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, 1st. To furnish the stamens with long anthers. 2d. To lengthen and bend the peduncle or flower-stalk, that the flower might hang downwards. 3d. To reflect the petals. 4th. To erect these peduncles when the germ was fecundated. We may reason upon this by observing, that all this appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus might have been spared, if the filaments alone had grown longer; and that thence, in these flowers, that the filaments are the most unchangeable parts; and that thence their comparative length, in respect to the style, would afford a most permanent mark of their generic character.</p>

In like manner the florets, which form the rays of the flowers of the order frustraneous polygamy of the class synge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesia, or confederate males, as the sun-flower, are furnished with a style only, and no stigma, and are thence barten. There is also a style without a stigma in the whole order dioecia gynandria; the male flowers of which are thence barren. The Opulus is another plant which contains some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prolific flowers.

                           <p>There is a curious circumstance belonging to the class of insects which have two wings, or diptera, analogous to the rudiments of stamens above described; <abbr>viz.</abbr> two little knobs are found placed, each on a stalk or pedun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, generally under a little arched scale; which appear to be rudiments of hinder wings; and are called by Linnaeus halteres, or poisers, a term of his introduction.

Other animals have marks of having, in a long process of time, undergone changes in some parts of their bodies, which may have been effected to accommodate them to new ways of procuring their food.

The double flowers, so much admired by the florists, are termed, by the botanist, vegetable monsters: in some of these the petals are multiplied three or four times, but without excluding the stamens; hence they produce some seeds, as Campanula and Stramonium; but in others the petals become so numerous as totally to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the stamens, or males, as Caltha, Peonia, and Alcea; these produce no seeds, and are termed eunuchs. Philos. Botan. No. 150.</p>
                           <p>These vegetable monsters are formed in many ways: 1st. By the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of the petals, and the exclusion of the nectaries, as in larkspur. 2d. By the multiplication of the nectaries, and exclusion of the petals, as in columbine. 3d. In some flowers growing in cymes, the wheel-shape flowers in the margin are multiplied to the exclusion of the bell-shape flowers in the centre, as in gelder-rose. 4th. By the elongation of the florets in the centre. Instances of both these are found in daisy and feverfew: for other kinds of vegetable monsters, see Plantago.</p>
                           <p>The perianth is not changed in double flowers; hence the genus, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, may be often discovered by the calyx, as in Hepatica, Ranunculus, Alcea.

This dust, on a fine day, may often be seen like a cloud hanging round the common nettle. The males and females of all the cone-bearing plants are in separate flowers, either on the same or on different plants; they produce resins, and many of them are supposed to supply the most durable timber: what is called Venice-turpentine is obtained from the larch by wounding the bark about two feet from the ground, and catching it as it exsudes; Sandarach is procured from common juniper; and incense from a juniper with yellow fruit. The unperishable chests, which contain the Egyptian mummies, were of Cypress; and the Cedar, with which black-lead pencils are covered, is not liable to be eaten by worms. See Miln's Bot.

The flowers of this grass give the fragrant scent to hay. I am informed it is frequently viviparous, that is, that it bears sometimes roots or bulbs instead of seeds, which, after a time, drop off, and strike root into the ground. This circumstance is said to obtain in many of the alpine grasses, whose seeds are perpetually devoured by small birds. The Festuca Dumetorum, fescue grass of the bushes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces bulbs from the sheaths of its straw. The Allium Magicum, or magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal onion, produces onions on its head, instead of seeds. The Polygonum. Viviparum, viviparous bistort, rises about a foot high, with a beautiful spike of flowers, which are succeeded by buds or bulbs, which fall off, and take root. There is a bush frequently seen on birch-trees, like a bird's nest, which seems to be a similar attempt of nature, to produce another tree, which, falling off, might take root in spongy ground.</p>

He adds, that if one filament be touched after it is separated from the floret, that it will contract like the muscular fibres of animal bodies: his experiments were tried on the Centauréa Calcitrapoides, and on artichokes and globe-thistles.

The petals of this beautiful flower, with three of the stamens, which are first mature, stand up in apparent disorder; and the pistil bends at nearly a right angle, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert its stigma amongst them. In a few days, as these decline, the other three stamens bend over, and approach the pistil. In the Fritillaria Persica, the six stamens are of equal lengths, and the anthers lie at a distance from the pistil, and three alternate ones approach first; and, when these decline, the other three approach: in the Lithrum Salicaria (which has twelve males and one female), a beautiful red flower, which grows on the banks of rivers, six of the males arrive at maturity, and surround the female some time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other six; when these decline, the other six rise up, and supply their places. Several other flowers have, in a similar manner, two sets of stamens of different ages, as Adoxa, Lychnis, Saxifraga. See Genista. Perhaps a difference in the time of their maturity obtains in all these flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which have numerous stamens. In the Kalmia, the ten stamens lie round the pistil like the radii of a wheel; and each anther is concealed in a nich of the corol, to protect it from cold and moisture; these anthers rise separately from their niches, and approach the pistil for a time, and then recede to their former situations.</note>

Three females and ten males inhabit each flower; the viscous material, which surrounds the stalks under the flowers of this plant, and of the Cucúbalus Otites, is a curious contrivance to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent various insects from plundering the honey, or devouring the seed. In the Dionaea Muscipula there is a still more wonderful contrivance to prevent the depredations of insects: the leaves are armed with long teeth, like the antennae of insects, and lie spread upon the ground round the stem; and are so irritable, that when an insect creeps upon them, they fold up, and crush of pierce it to death. The last Professor Linnaeus, in his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementum Plantarum, gives the following account of the Arum Musci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorum. The flower has the smell of carrion; by which the flies are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to lay their eggs in the chamber of the flower, but, in vain, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to escape, being prevented by the hairs pointing inwards, and thus pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in the flower; whence its name of fly-eater. P. 411. In the Dypsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus is another contrivance for this purpose: a bason of water is placed round each joint of the stem. In the Drosera is another kind of fly-trap. See Dypsacus and Drosera. The flowers of Silene and Cucúbalus are closed all day, but are open, and give an agreeable odour in the night. See Cerea.

                           <p>
                              <hi>Amaryllis.</hi> l. 152. Formosissima. Most beautiful Amaryllis. Six males, one female. Some of the bell-flowers close their apertures at night, or in rainy or cold weather, as the convolvulus, and thus protect their included stamens and pistils. Other bell-flowers hang their apertures downwards, as many of the lilies; in those the pistil, when at maturity, is longer than the stamens; and by this pendant attitude of the bell, when the anthers burst, their dust falls on the stigma; and these are, at the same time, shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered as with an umbrella from rain and dews. But, as a free exposure to the air is necessary for their fecundation, the style and filaments in many of these flowers continue to grow longer after the bell is open, and hang down below its rim. In others, as in the Martagon, the bell is deeply divided, and the divisions are reflected upwards, that they may not prevent the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of air, and, at the same time, afford some shelter from perpendicular rain or dew. Other bell-flowers, as the Hemerocallis and Amaryllis, have their bells nodding only, as it were, or hanging obliquely towards the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon; which, as their stems are slender, turn like a weathercock from the wind, and thus very effectually preserve their inclosed stamens and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the rain and cold. Many of these flowers, both before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their season of fecundation, erect their heads perpendicular to the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, like the Meadia, which cannot be explained from mere mechanism.</p>
                           <p>The Amaryllis Formosissima is a flower of the last-mentioned kind, and affords an agreeable example of <hi>art</hi> in the vegetable economy. 1. The pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til is of great length compared with the stamens; and this I suppose to have been the most unchangeable part of the flower, as in Meadia, which see. 2. To counteract this circumstance, the pistil and stamens are made to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline downwards, that the prolific dust might sall from the anthers on the stigma. 3. To produce this effect, and to secure it when produced, the corol is lacerated, contrary to what occurs in other flowers of this genus, and the lowest division, with the two next lowest ones, are wrapped closely over the style and filaments, binding them forcibly down lower towards the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, than the usual inclination of the bell in this genus, and thus consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes a most elegant flower. There is another contrivance for this purpose in the Hemerocallis Flava: the long pistil often is bent somewhat like the capital letter <hi>N,</hi> with design to shorten it, and thus to bring the stigma amongst the anthers.</p>

<note place="bottom">
                           <hi>Ilex.</hi> l. 161. Holly. Four males, four females. Many plants, like many animals, are furnished with arms for their protection; these are either aculei, prickles, as in rose and barberry, which are formed from the outer bark of the plant; or spinae, thorns, as in hawthorn, which are an elonga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wood, and hence more difficult to be torn off than the former; or stimuli, stings, as in the nettles, which are armed with a venomous fluid for the annoyance of naked animals. The shrubs and trees which have prickles or thorns, are grateful food to many animals, as gooseberry and gorse; and would be quickly devoured if not thus armed; the stings seem a protection against some kinds of insects, as well as the naked mouths of quadrupeds. Many plants lose their thorns by cultivation, as wild animals lose their ferocity, and some of them their horns. A curious circumstance attends the large hollies in Needwood forest; they are armed with thorny leaves about eight feet high, and have smooth leaves above, as if they were conscious that horses and cattle could not reach their upper branches. See note on Meadia, and on Mancinella. The numerous clumps of hollies in Needwood forest serve as land-marks to direct the travellers across it in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious directions; and as a shelter to the deer and cattle in winter; and, in scarce seasons, supply them with much food. For when the upper branches, which are without prickles, are cut down, the deer crop the leaves and peel off the bark. The bird-lime made from the bark of hollies seems to be a very similar material to the elastic gum, or Indian rubber, as it is called. There is a fossile elastic bitumen found at Matlock, in Derbyshire, which much resembles these substances in its elasticity and inflammability. The thorns of the Mimosa Cornigera resemble cows' horns in appearance as well as in use. System of Vegetables, p. 782.</note>

What is, in common language, called a bulb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous-root, is, by Linnaeus, termed the Hybernacle, or Winter-lodge of the young plant. As these bulbs, in every respect, resemble buds, except in their being produced under ground, and include the leaves and flower in miniature, which are to be expanded in the ensuing spring. By cautiously cutting, in winter, through the concentric coats of a tulip-root, longitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from the top to the base, and taking them off successively, the whole flower of the next summer's tulip is beautifully seen by the naked eye, with its petals, pistil, and stamens; the flowers exist in other bulbs in the same manner as in Hyacinths; but the individual flowers of these being less, they are not so easily dissected, or so conspicuous to the naked eye.</p>

Other seeds again disperse themselves by means of an elastic seed-vessel, as oats, geranium, and impatiens; and the seeds of aquatic plants, and of those which grow on the banks of rivers, are carried many miles by the currents, into which they fall.

And, which is curious, at the point of every thread of this erect fringe stands a pellucid drop of mucilage, resembling a ducal coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net. This mucus is a secretion from certain glands, and, like the viscous material round the flower-stalks of Silene (catchfly) prevents small insects from infesting the leaves. As the ear-wax, in animals, seems to be in part designed to prevent fleas and other insects from getting into their ears. See Silene. Mr. Wheatley, an eminent surgeon in Cateaton-street, London, observed these leaves to bend upwards, when an insect settled on them, like the leaves of the Muscipula Veneris, and, pointing all their globules of mucus to the centre, that they completely intangled and destroyed it. M. Broussonet, in the Mem. de I'Acad. des Sciences, for the year 1784, p. 615. after having described the motion of the Dionaea, adds, that a similar ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance has been observed in the leaves of two species of Drosera.</note>

<note place="bottom">
                           <p>
                              <hi>Lonicera.</hi> l. 241. Caprifolium, Honeysuckle. Five males, one female. Nature has, in many flowers, used a wonderful apparatus to guard the nectary, or honey-gland, from insects. In the honeysuckle the petal ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in a long tube, like a cornucopiae, or horn of plenty; and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is produced at the bottom of it. In Aconitum, monks-hood, the nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries stand upright, like two horns covered with a hood, which abounds with such acrid matter that no insects penetrate it. In Helleborus, hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore, the many nectaries are placed in a circle like little pitchers, and add much to the beauty of the flower. In the columbine, Aquilegia, the nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary is imagined to be like the neck and body of a bird, and the two pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals standing upon each side to represent wings; whence its name of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbine, as if resembling a nest of young pigeons fluttering whilst their parent seeds them. The importance of the nectary in the economy of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation, is explained at large in the notes on part the first.</p>
                           <p>Many insects are provided with a long and pliant proboscis, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of acquiring this grateful food, as a variety of bees, moths, and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terflies; but the Sphinx Convolvuli, or unicorn moth, is furnished with the most remarkable proboscis in this climate. It carries it rolled up in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centric circles under its chin, and occasionally extends it to above three inches in length. This trunk consists of joints and muscles, and seems to have more versatile movements than the trunk of the elephant; and near its termination is split into two capillary tubes. The excellence of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance for robbing the flowers of their honey, keeps this beautiful insect sat and bulky, though it flies only in the evening, when the flowers have closed their petals, and are thence more difficult of access; and, at the same time, the brilliant colours of the moth contribute to its safety, by making it mistaken by the late sleeping birds for the flower it rests on.</p>
                           <p>Besides these, there is a curious contrivance attending the Ophrys, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Bee-orchis, and the Fly-orchis, with some kinds of the Delphinium, called Bee-larkspurs, to preserve their honey; in these the nectary and petals resemble, in form and colour, the insects which plunder them; and thus it may be supposed, they often escape these hourly robbers, by having the appearance of being pre-occupied.

This plant never grows upon the ground; the foliage is yellow, and the berries milk-white: the berries are so viscous as to serve for bird-lime; and when they fall, adhere to the branches of the tree on which the plant grows, and strike root into its bark, or are carried to distant trees by birds. The Tillandsia, or wild pine, grows on other trees, like the Misletoe, but takes little or no nourishment from them, having large buckets in its leaves to collect and retain the rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water. See note on Dypsacus. The mosses, which grow on the bark of trees, take much nourishment from them; hence it is observed, that trees which are annually cleared from moss by a brush, grow nearly twice as fast. (Phil.

It grows at the bottom of the sea, and, rising to the surface when in flower, covers many leagues; and is driven, at length, to the shore. During its time of floating on the sea, numberless animals live on the under surface of it; and, being specifically lighter than the sea-water, or being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by it, have legs placed, as it were, on their backs, for the purpose of walking under it, as the Scylloea. See Bathut's Genera Vermium. It seems necessary that the marriages of plants should be celebrated in the open air, either because the powder of the anther, or the mucilage on the stigma, or the reservoir of honey, might receive injury from the water. Mr. Needham observed, that in the ripe dust of every flower, examined by the microscope, some vesicles are perceived, from which a fluid had escaped; and that those which still retain it, explode if they be wetted, like an eolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile suddenly exposed to a strong heat. These observations have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by Spallanzani and others. Hence rainy seasons make a scarcity of grain, or hinder its fecundity, by bursting the pollen before it arrives at the moist stigma of the flower. Spallanzani's Dissertations, v. xi. p. 321. Thus the flowers of the male Vallisneria are produced under water, and, when ripe, detach themselves from the plant, and, rising to the surface, are wafted by the air to the female flowers.

This species of Fern is a native of China, with a decumbent root, thick, and every where covered with the most soft and dense wool, intensely yellow. Lin. Spec. Plant.</p>
                           <p>This curious stem is sometimes pushed out of the ground in its horizontal situation, by some of the inferior branches of the root, so as to give it some resemblance to a Lamb standing on four legs; and has been said to destroy all other plants in its vicinity. Sir Hans Sloane describes it under the name of Tartarian Lamb, and has given a print of it. Philos. Trans. abridged, v. xi. p. 646. but thinks some art had been used to give it an animal appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Dr. Hunter, in his edition of the Terra of Evelyn, has given a more curious print of it, much resembling a sheep. The down is used in India ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally for stopping haemorrhages, and is called golden moss.</p>
                           <p>The thick downy clothing of some vegetables seems designed to protect them from the injuries of cold, like the wool of animals. Those bodies, which are bad conductors of electricity, are also bad conductors of heat, as glass, wax, air. Hence, either of the two former of these may be melted by the flame of a blow-pipe very near the fingers which hold it, without burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and the last, by being confined on the surface of animal bodies, in the interstices of their fur or wool, prevents the escape of their natural warmth; to which should be added, that the hairs themselves are imperfect conductors. The fat or oil of whales, and other northern animals, seems de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for the same purpose of preventing the too sudden escape of the heat of the body in cold climates. Snow protects vegetables which are covered by it from cold, both because it is a bad conductor of heat itself, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains much air in its pores. If a piece of camphor be immersed in a snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball, except one extremity of it, on setting fire to this, as the snow melts, the water becomes absorbed into the surrounding snow by capillary attraction; on this account, when living animals are buried in snow, they are not mois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by it; but the cavity enlarges as the snow dissolves, affording them both a dry and warm habitation.</p>

Now, as their situation after being exposed to external violence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles their sleep, but with a greater degree of collapse, may it not be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a numbness or paralysis consequent to too violent irritation, like the faintings of animals from pain or fatigue?

During the night the upper or smoother surfaces of the leaves are appressed together; this would seem to shew that the office of this surface of the leaf was to expose the fluids of the plant to the light as well as to the air.

                              <hi>The Swallow.</hi> l. 320. There is a wonderful conformity between the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation of some plants, and the arrival of certain birds of passage. Linnaeus observes, that the wood anemone blows in Sweden on the arrival of the swallow; and the marsh mary-gold, Caltha, when the cuckoo sings. Near the same coincidence was observed in England by Stillingfleet. The word Coccux in Greek signifies both a young fig and a cuckoo, which is supposed to have arisen from the coincidence of their appearance in Greece. Perhaps a similar coincidence of appearance in some part of Asia gave occasion to the story of the love of the rose and nightingale, so much celebrated by the eastern poets. See Dianthus. The times, however, of the appearance of vegetables in the spring seem occasionally to be influenced by their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired habits, as well as by their sensibility to heat; for the roots of pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes, onions, &amp;c. will germinate with much less heat in the spring than in the autumn; as is easily observable where these roots are stored for use; and hence malt is best made in the spring. 2d. The grains and roots brought from more southern latitudes germinate here sooner than those which are brought from more northern ones, owing to their acquired habits. Fordyce on Agriculture. 3d. It was observed by one of the scholars of Linnaeus, that the apple-trees sent from hence to New-England blossomed for a few years too early for that climate, and bore no fruit; but afterwards learnt to accommodate themselves to their new situation. (Kalm's Travels.) 4th. The parts of animals become more sensible to heat after having been previously exposed to cold, as our hands glow on coming into the house after having held snow in them: this seems to happen to vegetables; for vines in grape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, which have been exposed to the winter's cold, will become for warder and more vigorous than those which have been kept during the winter in the house. (Kennedy on Gardening.) This accounts for the very rapid ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation in the northern latitudes after the solution of the snows.</p>
                           <p>The increase of the irritability of plants in respect to heat, after having been previously exposed to cold, is further illustrated by an experiment of Dr. Walker's. He cut apertures into a birch-tree at different heights; and on the 26th of March some of these apertures bled, or oozed with the sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juice, when the thermometer was at 39; which same apertures did not bleed on the 13th of March, when the thermometer was at 44. The reason of this, I apprehend, was, because, on the night of the 25th the thermometer was as low as 34; whereas, on the night of the 12th it was at 41; though the ingenious author ascribes it to another cause.

The colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing materials of vegetables, like those which serve the purpose of tanning, varnishing, and the various medicinal purposes, do not seem essential to the life of the plant; but seem given it as a defence against the depredations of insects, or other animals, to whom these materials are nauseous or deleteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The colours of insects, and many smaller animals, contribute to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal them from the larger ones which prey upon them. Caterpillars, which feed on leaves, are generally green; and earth-worms the colour of the earth which they inhabit; butterflies, which frequent flowers, are coloured like them; small birds, which frequent hedges, have greenish backs like the leaves, and light coloured bellies like the sky, and are hence less visible to the hawk, who passes under them or over them. Those birds which are much amongst flowers, as the goldsinch (Fringilla Carduelis), are furnished with vivid colours. The lark, partridge, hare, are the colour of dry vegetables, or earth on which they rest. And frogs vary their colour with the mud of the streams which they frequent; and those which live on trees are green. Fish, which are generally suspended in water, and swallows, which are generally suspended in air, have their backs the colour of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ground, and their bellies of the sky. In the colder climates many of these become white during the existence of the snows. Hence there is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent design in the colours of animals, whilst those of vegetables seem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to the other properties of the materials which possess them.</note>

The words <hi>relaxation and bracing,</hi> which are generally thought expressive of the effects of warm and cold bathing, are mechanical terms, properly applied to drums or strings; but are only metaphors when applied to the effects of cold or warm bathing on animal bodies. The immediate cause of old age seems to reside in the inirritability of the finer vessels, or parts of our sys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; hence these cease to act, and collapse, or become horny or bony. The warm bath is peculiarly adapted to prevent these circumstances by its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing our irritability, and by moistening and softening the skin, and the extremities of the finer vessels, which terminate in it. To those who are past the meridian of life, and have dry skins, and begin to be emaciated, the warm bath, for half an hour twice a week, I believe to be eminently serviceable in retarding the advances of age.</note>

They have their roots at the bottom of the Rhone; the flowers of the female plant float on the surface of the water, and are furnished with an elastic spiral stalk, which extends, or contracts, as the water rises and falls. This rise or fall, from the rapid descent of the river, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain torrents which flow into it, often amounts to many feet in a few hours. The flowers of the male plant are produced under water, and as soon as their farina, or dust, is mature, they detach themselves from the plant, and rise to the surface, continue to flourish, and are wafted by the air, or borne by the currents to the female flowers. In this resembling those tribes of insects, where the males at certain seasons acquire wings, but not the females, as ants, Coccus, Lampyris, Phalaena, Brumata, Lichanella. These male flowers are in such numbers, though very minute, as frequently to cover the surface of the river to considerable extent. See Families of Plants, translated from Linnaeus, p. 677.</note>

This kind of sea-weed is buoyed up by bladders of air, which are formed in the duplicatures of its leaves, and forms immense floating fields of vegetation; the young ones, branching out from the larger ones, and borne on similar little air-vessels. It is also found in the warm baths of Patavia; where the leaves are formed into curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cells or labyrinths, for the purpose of floating on the water. See ulva labyrinthi-formis Lin. Spec. Plant. The air contained in these cells was found by Dr. Priestley to be sometimes purer than common air, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times less pure; the air-bladders of fish seem to be similar organs, and serve to render them buoyant in the water. In some of these, as in the Cod and Haddock, a red membrane, consisting of a great number of leaves or dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catures, is found within the air-bag, which probably secretes this air from the blood of the animal. (Monro. Physiol. of Fish, p. 28.) To determine whether this air, when first separated from the blood of the animal or plant, be dephlogisticated air, is worthy inquiry. The bladder-sena (Colutea), and bladder-nut (Staphylaea), have their seed-vessels distended with air; the Ketmia has the upper joint of the stem immediately under the receptacle of the flower, much distended with air: these seem to be analogous to the air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessel at the broad end of the egg, and may, probably, become less pure as the seed ripens: some, which I tried, had the purity of the surrounding at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere. The air at the broad end of the egg is probably an organ serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the purpose of respiration to the young chick; some of whose vessels are spread upon it like a placenta, or permeate it. Many are of opinion that even the placenta of the human foetus, and cotyledons of quadrupeds, are respiratory organs rather than nutritious ones.</p>
                           <p>The air in the hollow stems of grasses, and of some umbelliferous plants, bears analogy to the air in the quills, and in some of the bones of birds; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the place of the pith, which shrivels up after it has performed its office of protruding the young stem or feather. Some of these cavities of the bones are said to communicate with the lungs in birds. Phil. Trans.</p>
                           <p>The air-bladders of fish are nicely adapted to their intended purpose; for though they render them buoyant near the surface, without the labour of using their fins, yet, when they rest at greater depths, they are no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, as the increased pressure of the water condenses the air which they contain, into less space. Thus, if a cork or bladder of air was immersed a very great depth in the ocean, it would be so much compressed, as to become specifically as heavy as the water, and would remain there. It is probable the unfortunate Mr. Day, who was drowned in a diving-ship of his own construction, miscarried from not attending to this circumstance: it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the quantity of air he took down with him, if he descended much lower than he expected, was condensed into so small a space as not to render the ship buoyant when he endeavoured to ascend.</p>

I suspected that the Tremella Nostoc, or star-jelly, also had been thus produced; but have since been well informed, that the Tremella Nostoc is a mucilage voided by Herons after they have eaten frogs; hence it has the appearance of having been pressed through a hole; and limbs of frogs are said sometimes to be found amongst it: it is always seen upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                           <p>Some of the fungusses are so acrid, that a drop of their juice blisters the tongue; others intoxicate those who eat them.

As all acrid plants become less so, if exposed to a boiling heat, it is probable the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mushroom may sometimes disagree from being not sufficiently stewed.

                     <p>I am only a flower-painter, or occasionally attempt a landskip; and leave the human figure, with the subjects of history, to abler artists.</p>

                     <p>It is well to know what subjects are within the limits of your pencil; many have failed of success from the want of this self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. But pray tell me, what is the essential difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Poetry and Prose? is it solely the melody or measure of the language?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>I think not solely; for some prose has its melody, and even measure. And good verses, well spoken in a language unknown to the hearer, are not easily to be distinguished from good prose.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B.</speaker>
                     <p>Is it the sublimity, beauty, or novelty of the sentiments?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>Not so; for sublime sentiments are often better expressed in prose. Thus when Warwick, in one of the plays of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speare, is left wounded on the field, after the loss of the battle, and his friend says to him, "O, could you but fly!" what can be more sublime than this answer, "Why, then, I would not fly." No measure of verse, I imagine, could add dignity to this sentiment. And it would be easy to select examples of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful or new from prose writers, which, I suppose, no measure of verse could improve.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B.</speaker>
                     <p>In what, then, consists the essential difference between Poetry and Prose?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>Next to the measure of the language, the principal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction appears to me to consist in this: that Poetry admits of but few words expressive of very abstracted ideas, whereas Prose abounds with them. And as our ideas derived from visible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are more distinct than those derived from the objects of our other senses, the words expressive of these ideas belonging to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, make up the principal part of poetic language. That is,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:033600_0325_0FF7A04B179A5BC0"/>
the Poet writes principally to the eye, the Prose writer uses more abstracted terms. Mr. Pope has written a bad verse in the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor Forest:
<q>
                           <l>"And Kennet swift for silver Eels <hi>renown'd."</hi>
                           </l>
                        </q>
The word renown'd does not present the idea of a visible object to the mind, and is thnece prosaic. But change this line thus:
<q>
                           <l>"And Kennet swift, where silver Graylings <hi>play,"</hi>
                           </l>
                        </q>
and it becomes poetry, because the scenery is then brought before the eye.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B.</speaker>
                     <p>This may be done in prose.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>And when it is done in a single word, it animates the prose; so it is more agreeable to read in Mr. Gibbon's History, "Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many was at this time <hi>over-shadowed</hi> with extensive forests," than Germany was at this time <hi>full</hi> of extensive forests. But where this mode of expression occurs too frequently, the prose approaches to poetry: and in graver works, where we expect to be instructed rather than amused, it becomes tedious and impertinent. Some parts of Mr. Burke's eloquent orations become intricate and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by superfluity of poetic ornament; which quantity of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have been agreeable in poem, where much orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is expected.</p>

                     <speaker>B.</speaker>
                     <p>Is, then the office of Poetry only to amuse?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>The Muses are young Ladies; we expect to see them dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; though not like some modern beauties, with so much gauze and feather, that "the Lady herself is the least part of her." There are, however, didactic pieces of poetry, which are much admired, as the Georgics of Virgil, Mason's English Garden, Haley's Epistles; nevertheless, Science is best delivered in prose, as its mode of reasoning is from stricter analogies than metaphors or similies.</p>

                     <p>Do not Personifications and Allegories distinguish Poetry?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>These are other arts of bringing objects before the eye; or of expressing sentiments in the language of vision; and are, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, better suited to the pen than the pencil.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B.</speaker>
                     <p>That is strange, when you have just said they are used to bring their objects before the eye.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>In Poetry the personification or allegoric figure is generally
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033600_0326_0FF7A04DA11957C8"/>
indistinct, and therefore does not strike us so forcibly as to make us attend to its improbability; but in painting, the figures being all much more distinct, their improbability becomes apparent, and seizes our attention to it. Thus the person of Concealment is very indistinct, and therefore does not compel us to attend to its improbability, in the following beautiful lines of Shakespeare:
<q>
                           <l>"—She never told her love;</l>
                           <l>But let Concealment, like a worm i' th' bud,</l>
                           <l>Feed on her damask cheek."—</l>
                        </q>
But in these lines below the person of Reason obtrudes itself into our company, and becomes disagreeable by its distinctness, and consequent improbability:
<q>
                           <l>"To Reason I flew, and intreated her aid,</l>
                           <l>Who paused on my case, and each circumstance weigh'd;</l>
                           <l>Then gravely reply'd, in return to my prayer,</l>
                           <l>That Hebe was fairest of all that were fair.</l>
                           <l>That's a truth, reply'd I, I've no need to be taught,</l>
                           <l>I came to you, Reason, to find out a fault.</l>
                           <l>If that's all, says Reason, return as you came,</l>
                           <l>To find fault with Hebe would forfeit my name."</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Allegoric figures are, on this account, in general, less manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in painting and in statuary than in poetry; and can seldom be introduced in the two former arts in company with natural figures, as is evident from the ridiculous effect of many of the paintings of Rubens, in the Luxemburgh gallery; and for this reason, because their improbability becomes more striking, when there are the figures of real persons by their side to compare them with.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Angelica Kauffman, well apprised of this circumstance, has introduced no mortal figures amongst her Cupids and her Graces. And the great Roubiliac, in his unrivalled monument of Time and Fame struggling for the trophy of General Wade, has only hung up a medallion of the head of the hero of the piece. There are, however, some allegoric figures, which we have so often heard described or seen delineated, that we almost forget that they do not exist in common life; and thence view them without astonishment; as the figures of the heathen mythology,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:033600_0327_0FF7A0512A4E1018"/>
of angels, devils, death, and time; and almost believe them to be realities, even when they are mixed with representations of the natural forms of man. Whence I conclude, that a certain degree of probability is necessary to prevent us from revolting with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taste from unnatural images, unless we are otherwise so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested in the contemplation of them as not to perceive their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability.</p>

                     <p>Is this reasoning about degrees of probability just?—When Sir Joshua Reynolds, who is unequalled both in the theory and practice of his art, and who is a great master of the pen as well as the pencil, has asserted, in a discourse delivered to the Royal Academy, December 11, 1786, that "the higher styles of paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like the higher kinds of the Drama, do not aim at any thing like deception; or have any expectation that the spectators should think the events there represented as really passing before them." And he then accuses Mr. Fielding of bad judgment, when he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to compliment Mr. Garrick in one of his novels, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing an ignorant man, mistaking the representation of a scene in Hamlet for a reality; and thinks, because he was an ignorant man, he was less liable to make such a mistake.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>It is a metaphysical question, and requires more attention than Sir Joshua has bestowed upon it.—You will allow that we are perfectly deceived in our dreams: and that even in our wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reveries, we are often so much absorbed in the contemplation of what passes in our imaginations, that, for a while, we do not attend to the lapse of time, or to our own locality; and thus suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a similar kind of deception, as in our dreams. That is, we believe things present before our eyes, which are not so.</p>
                     <p>There are two circumstances which contribute to this complete deception in our dreams: First, because, in sleep, the organs of sense are closed or inert, and hence the trains of ideas associated in our imaginations are never interrupted or dissevered by the irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of external objects, and cannot, therefore, be contrasted with our sensations. On this account, though we are affected with a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of passions in our dreams, as anger, love, joy, yet we never experience surprize. For surprize is only produced when any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal irritations suddenly obtrude themselves, and dissever our passing trains of ideas.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, because, in sleep, there is a total suspension of our voluntary power, both over the muscles of our bodies, and the ideas of our minds; for we neither walk about, nor reason in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:033600_0328_0FF7A052C5DC84D0"/>
sleep. Hence, as the trains of our ideas are passing in our imaginations in dreams, we cannot compare them with our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious knowledge of things, as we do in our waking hours; for this a voluntary exertion, and thus we cannot perceive their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity.</p>
                     <p>Thus we are deprived, in sleep, of the only two means by which we can distinguish the trains of ideas passing in our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, from those excited by our sensations; and are led by their vivacity to believe them to belong to the latter. For the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity of these trains of ideas, passing in the imagination, is greatly increased by the causes above-mentioned; that is, by their not being disturbed or dissevered either by the appulses of external bodies, as in surprize, or by our voluntary exertions in compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with our previous knowledge of things, as in reasoning upon them.</p>

                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>When, by the art of the Painter or Poet, a train of ideas is suggested to our imaginations, which interests us so much by the pain or pleasure it affords, that we cease to attend to the irritations of common external objects, and cease also to use any voluntary efforts to compare these interesting trains of ideas with our previous knowledge of things, a complete reverie is produced: during which time, however short, if it be but for a moment, the objects themselves appear to exist before us. This, I think, has been called, by an ingenious critic, "the ideal presence" of such objects. (Elements of Criticism, by Lord Kaimes.) And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the compliment intended by Mr. Fielding to Mr. Garrick, it would seem that an ignorant rustic at the play of Hamlet, who has some previous belief in the appearance of Ghosts, would sooner be liable to fall into a reverie, and continue in it longer, than one who possessed more knowledge of the real nature of things, and had a greater facility of exercising his reason.</p>

                     <p>It must require great art in the Painter or Poet to produce this kind of deception.</p>

                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>The matter must be interesting from its sublimity, beauty, or novelty; this is the scientific part; and the art consists in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these distinctly before the eye, so as to produce (as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned) the ideal presence of the object, in which the great Shakespeare particularly excells.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>B.</speaker>
                     <p>Then it is not of any consequence whether the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions correspond with nature?</p>

                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>Not if they so much interest the reader or spectator as to induce the reverie above described. Nature may be seen in the market-place, or at the card-table; but we expect something more than this in the play-house or picture-room. The farther the artist recedes from nature, the greater novelty he is likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; if he rises above nature, he produces the sublime; and beauty is probably a selection and new combination of her most agreeable parts. Yourself will be sensible of the truth of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, by recollecting over in your mind the works of three of our celebrated artists. Sir Joshua Reynolds has introduced sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity even into its portraits; we admire the representation of persons, whose reality we should have passed by unnoticed. Mrs. Angelica Kauffman attracts our eyes with beauty, which, I suppose, no where exists; certainly few Grecian faces are seen in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And the daring pencil of Fuseli transports us beyond the boundaries of nature, and ravishes us with the charm of the most interesting novelty. And Shakespeare, who excells in all these together, so far captivates the spectator, as to make him unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of every kind of violation of time, place, or existence. As, at the first appearance of the Ghost of Hamlet, "his ear must be dull as the fat weed which roots itself on Lethe's brink," who can attend to the improbability of the exhibition. So, in many scenes of the Tempest, we perpetually believe the action passing before our eyes, and relapse, with somewhat of distaste, into common life, at the intervals of the representation.</p>

The seeds of this and of many other plants of the same class are furnished with a plume, by which admirable mechanism they perform long aerial journeys, crossing lakes and deserts, and are thus disseminated far from the original plant, and have much the appearance of a Shuttlecock as they fly. The wings are of different construction, some being like a divergent tuft of hairs, others are branched like feathers, some are elevated from the crown of the seed by a slender foot-stalk, which gives them a very elegant appearance, others sit immediately on the crown of the seed.</p>
                           <p>Nature has many other curious vegetable contrivances for the dispersion of seeds: see note on Helianthus. But perhaps none of them has more the appearance of design than the admirable apparatus of Tillandsia for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. This plant grows on the branches of trees, like the misletoe, and never on the ground; the seeds are furnished with many long threads on their crowns; which, as they are driven forwards by the winds, wrap round the arms of the trees, and thus hold them fast till they vegetate. This is very analogous to the migration of Spiders on the gossamer, who are said to attach themselves to the end of a long thread, and rise thus to the tops of trees or buildings, as the accidental breezes carry them.</p>

                              <hi>Gossypia.</hi> l. 87. Gossypium. The cotton plant. On the river Derwent, near Matlock, in Derbyshire, Sir RICHARD ARKWRIGHT has erected his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and magnificent machinery for spinning cotton, which had been in vain attempted by many ingenious artists before him. The cotton-wool is first picked from the pods and seeds by women. It is then carded by <hi>cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical cards,</hi> which move against each other, with different velocities. It is taken from these by an <hi>iron-band</hi> or comb, which has a motion similar to that of scratching, and takes the wool off the cards longitudinally in respect to the fibres or staple, producing a continued line loosely cohering, called the <hi>Rove</hi> or <hi>Roving.</hi> This Rove, yet very loosely twisted, is then received or drawn into a <hi>whirling canister,</hi> and is rolled by the centrifugal force in spiral lines within it; being yet too tender for the spindle. It is then passed between <hi>two pairs of rollers;</hi> the second pair moving faster than the first elongate the thread with greater equality than can be done by the hand; and is then twisted on spoles or bobbins.</p>
                           <p>The great fertility of the Cotton-plant in these fine flexile threads, while those from Flax, Hemp, and Nettles, or from the bark of the Mulberry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, require a previous putrefaction of the parenchymatous substance, and much mechanical labour, and afterwards bleaching, renders this plant of great mportance to the world. And since Sir Richard Arkwright's inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious machine has not only greatly abbreviated and simplified the labour and art of carding and spinning the Cotton-wool, but performs both these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances <hi>better</hi> than can be done by hand, it is probable, that the clothing of this small seed will become the principal clothing of mankind; though animal wool and silk may be preferable in colder climates, as they are more imperfect conductors of hear, and are thence a warmer clothing.</p>

Before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of letters mankind may be said to have been perpetually in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, as the arts of one age or country generally died with their inventors. Whence arose the policy, which still continues in Indostan, of obliging the son to practise the profession of his father. After the discovery of letters, the facts of Astronomy and Chemistry became recorded in written language, though the ancient hieroglyphic characters for the planets and metals conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in use at this day. The antiquity of the invention of music, of astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical observations, and the manufacture of Gold and Iron, are recorded in Scripture.</p>

Mrs. Delany has finished nine hundred and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty accurate and elegant representations of different vegetables, with the parts of their flowers, fructification, &amp;c. according with the classification of Linnaeus, in what she terms paper-mosaic. She began this work at the age of 74, when her sight would no longer serve her to paint, in which she much excelled; between her age of 74 and 82, at which time her eyes quite failed her, she executed the curious Hortus siccus above-mentioned, which I suppose contains a greater number of plants than were ever before drawn from the life by any one person. Her method consisted in placing the leaves of each plant with the petals, and all the other parts of the flowers, on coloured paper, and cutting them with scissars accurately to the natural size and form, and then pasting them on a dark ground; the effect of which is wonderful, and their accuracy less liable to fallacy than drawings. She is at this time (1788) in her 89th year, with all the powers of a fine understanding still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impaired. I am informed another very ingenious lady, Mrs. North, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing a similar Hortus siccus, or Paper-garden; which she executes on a ground of vellum with such elegant taste and scientific accuracy, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to become a work of inestimable value.</note>

He enumerates 46 flowers, which possess this kind of sensibility. I shall mention a few of them, with their respective hours of rising and setting, as Linnaeus terms them. He divides them first into <hi>meteoric</hi> flowers, which less accurately observe the hour of unfolding, but are expanded sooner or later, according to the cloudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, moisture, or pressure of the atmosphere. 2d. <hi>Tropical</hi> flowers open in the morning and close before evening every day; but the hour of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding becomes earlier or later, as the length of the day increases or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases. 3dly. <hi>AEquinoctial</hi> flowers, which open at a certain and exact hour of the day, and for the most part close at another determinate hour.</p>

The Helleborus niger, or Christmas rose, has a large beautiful white flower, adorned with a circle of tubular two-lip'd nectaries. After impregnation the flower undergoes a remarkable change, the nectaries drop off, but the white corol remains, and gradually becomes quite green. This curious metamorphose of the corol, when the nectaries fall off, seems to shew that the white juices of the corol were before carried to the nectaries, for the purpose of producing honey: because when these nectaries fall off, no more of the white juice is secreted in the corol, but it becomes green, and degenerates into a calyx. See note on Lonicera. The nectary of the Tropaeolum, garden nasturtium, is a coloured horn growing from the calyx.</note>

                           <hi>Papaver.</hi> l. 270. Poppy. Many males, many females. The plants of this class are almost all of them poisonous; the finest opium is procured by wounding the heads of large poppies with a three-edged knife, and tying muscle-shells to them to catch the drops. In small quantities it exhilarates the mind, raises the passions, and invigorates the body: in large ones it is succeeded by intoxication, languor, stupor and death. It is customary in India for a messenger to travel above a hundred miles without rest or food, except an appropriated bit of opium for himself, and a larger one for his horse at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain stages. The emaciated and decrepid appearance, with the ridiculous and idiotic gestures, of the opium-eaters in Constantinople, is well described in the Memoirs of Baron de Tott.</note>

The most beautiful flowers of the Cactus grandiflo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus (see Cerea) are of equally short duration, but have their existence in the night. And the flowers of the Hibiscus trionum are said to continue but a single hour. The courtship between the males and females in these flowers might be easily watched; the males are said to approach and recede from the females alternately. The flowers of the Hibiscus sinensis, mutable rose, live in the West-Indies, their native climate, but one day; but have this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable property, they are white at their first expansion, then change to deep red, and become purple as they decay.</p>
                           <p>The gum or resin of this fragrant vegetable is collected from extensive underwoods of it in the East by a singular contrivance. Long leathern thongs are tied to poles and cords, and drawn over the tops of these shrubs about noon; which thus collect the dust of the anthers, which adheres to the leather, and is occasionally scraped off. Thus, in some degree, is the manner imitated, in which the bee collects on his thighs and legs the same mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial for the construction of his combs.</p>

The effect of this plant in that kind of Dropsy, which is termed anasarca, where the legs and thighs are much swelled, attended with great difficulty of breathing, is truly astonishing, In the ascites, accompanied with anasarca, of people past the meridian of life, it will also sometimes suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. The method of administering it requires some caution, as it is liable, in greater doses, to induce very violent and debiliating sickness, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues one or two days, during which time the dropsical collection, however, disappears. One large spoonful, or half an ounce, of the following decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, given twice a day, will generally succeed in a few days. But in more robust people, one large spoonful every two hours, till four spoonfuls are taken, or till sickness occurs, will evacuate the dropsical swellings with greater certainty, but is liable to operate more violently. Boil four ounces of the fresh leaves of purple Foxglove (which leaves may be had at all seasons of the year) from two pints of water to twelve ounces; add to the strained li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, while yet warm, three ounces of rectified spirit of wine. A theory of the effects of this medicine, with many successful cases, may be seen in a pamphlet, called, "Experiments on Mucilaginous and Purulent Matter," published by Dr. Darwin in 1780.

During the great Plague at London in the year 1665, Sir John Lawrence, the then Lord Mayor, continued the whole time in the city; heard complaints, and redressed them; enforced the wisest regulations then known, and saw them executed. The day after the disease was known with certainty to be the Plague, above 40,000 servants were dismissed, and turned into the streets to perish, for no one would receive them into their houses; and the villages near London drove them away with pitch-forks and fire-arms. Sir John Lawrence supported them all, as well as the needy who were sick, at first by expending his own fortune, till subscriptions could be solicited and received from all parts of the nation. <hi>Journal of the Plague-year.

In this, at least, they resemble the monsters in Ovid's Metamorphoses; but your similies, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, are Homeric?</p>

                     <p>The great Bard well understood how to make use of this kind of ornament in Epic Poetry. He brings his valiant heroes into the field with much parade, and sets them a fighting with great fury; and then, after a few thrusts and parries, he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a long string of similies. During this the battle is supposed to continue; and thus the time necessary for the action is gained in our imaginations, and a degree of probability produced, which contributes to the temporary deception or reverie of the reader.</p>
                     <p>But the similies of Homer have another agreeable characteristic; they do not quadrate, or go upon all fours (as it is called), like the more formal similies of some modern writers; any one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling feature seems to be, with him, a sufficient excuse for the introduction of this kind of digression. He then proceeds to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver some agreeable poetry on this new subject, and thus converts every similie into a kind of short episode.</p>

                     <p>No; it would then become a philosophical analogy; it would be ratiocination instead of poetry: it need only so far resemble the subject, as poetry itself ought to resemble nature.

                     <p>Certainly; he will endeavour to rouse himself from a disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable reverie, as from the nightmare. And from this may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the line of boundary between the Tragic and the Horrid; which line, however, will veer a little this way or that, according to the prevailing manners of the age or country, and the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar association of ideas, or idiosyncracy of mind, of individuals. For instance, if an artist should represent the death of an officer in battle, by shewing a little blood on the bosom of his shirt, as if a bullet had there penetrated, the dying figure would affect the beholder with pity; and if fortitude was at the same time expressed in his countenance, admiration would be added to our pity. On the contrary, if the artist should chuse to represent his thigh as shot away by a cannon ball, and should exhibit the bleeding flesh and shattered bone of the stump, the picture would introduce into our minds ideas from a butcher's shop, or a surgeon's operation room, and we should turn from it with disgust. So if characters were brought upon the stage with their limbs disjointed by tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing instruments, and the floor covered with clotted blood and scattered brains, our theatric reverie would be destroyed by disgust, and we should leave the play-house with detestation.</p>
                     <p>The Painters have been more guilty in this respect than the Poets. The cruelty of Apollo in flaying Marsyas alive is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite subject with the ancient artists: and the tortures of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring martyrs have disgraced the modern ones. It requires little genius to exhibit the muscles in convulsive action, either by the pencil or the chissel, because the interstices are deep, and the lines strongly defined: but those tender gradations of muscular action, which constitute the graceful attitudes of the body, are difficult to conceive or to execute, except by a master of nice dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment and cultivated taste.</p>

                     <p>I suppose the latter consists of Distress attended with Pity, which is said to be allied to Love, the most agreeable of all our passions; and the former, in Distress, accompanied with Disgust, which is allied to Hate, and is one of our most disagreeable sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Hence, when horrid scenes of cruelty are represented in pictures, we wish to disbelieve their existence, and voluntarily exert ourselves to escape from the deception: whereas the bitter cup of true Tragedy is mingled with some sweet consolatory drops, which endear our tears, and we continue to contemplate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresting delusion with a delight which is not easy to explain.</p>

                     <p>Has not this been explained by Lucretius, where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes a shipwreck, and says, the spectators receive pleasure from feeling themselves safe on land? and by Akenside, in his beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful poem on the Pleasures of Imagination, who ascribes it to our finding objects for the due exertion of our passions?</p>

                     <p>We must not confound our sensations at the contemplation of real misery with those which we experience at the scenical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of tragedy. The spectators of a shipwreck may be attracted by the dignity and novelty of the object; and from these may be said to receive pleasure; but not from the distress of the sufferers. An ingenious writer, who has criticised this dialogue in the English Review, for August, 1789, adds, that one great source of our pleasure from scenical distress, arises from our, at the same time, generally contemplating one of the noblest objects of nature, that of Virtue triumphant over every difficulty and oppression, or supporting its votary under every suffering: or, where this does not occur, that our minds are relieved by the justice of some signal punishment awaiting the delinquent. But, besides this, at the exhibition of a good tragedy, we are not only amused by the dignity, and novelty, and beauty, of the objects before us, but, if any distressful circumstances occur too forcibly for our sensibility, we can voluntarily exert ourselves, and recollect, that the scenery is not real; and thus not only the pain, which we had received from the apparent distress, is lessened, but a new source of pleasure is opened to us, similar to that which we frequently have felt on awaking from a distressful dream: we are glad that it is not true. We are, at the same time, unwilling to relinquish the pleasure which we receive from the other interesting circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the drama; and, on that account, quickly permit our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to relapse into the delusion; and thus alternately believe and disbelieve, almost every moment, the existence of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects represented before us.</p>

                     <p>The descriptions of the mangled carcases of the companions of Ulysses, in the cave of Polypheme, is, in this respect, certainly objectionable, as is well observed by Scaliger. And in the play of Titus Andronicus, if that was written by Shakespeare (which, from its internal evidence, I think very improbable), there are many horrid and disgustful circumstances.

And even at this day bits of dried root of Peony are rubbed smooth, and strung, and sold under the name of Anodyne necklaces, and tied round the necks of children, to faciliate the growth of their teeth: add to this, that in Price's History of Cornwall, a book published about ten years ago, the Virga Divinatoria, or Divining Red, has a degree of credit given to it. This rod is of hazle, or other light wood, and held horizontally in the hand, and is said to bow towards the ore whenever the Conjuror walks over a mine. A very few years ago, in France, and even in England, another kind of divining rod has been used to discover springs of water in a similar manner, and gained some credit. And in this very year, there were many in France, and some in England, who underwent an enchantment without any divining rod at all, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves to be affected by an invisible agent, which the Enchanter called Animal Magnetism!</note>

The Pythian priestess is supposed to have been made drunk with infusion of lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel-leaves when she delivered her oracles. The intoxication or inspiration is finely described by Virgil. AEn. lib. vi. The distilled water from laurel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves is, perhaps, the most sudden poison we are acquainted with in this country. I have seen about two spoonfuls of it destroy a large pointer dog in less than ten minutes. In a smaller dose it is said to produce intoxication: on this account there is reason to believe it acts in the same manner as opium and vinous spirit; but that the dose is not so well ascertained. See note on Tremella. It is used in the Ratafie of the distillers, by which some dram-drinkers have been suddenly killed. One pint of water, distilled from fourteen pounds of black cherry stones braised, has the same deleterious effect, destroying as suddenly as laurel-water. It is probable Apricot-kernels, Peach-leaves, Walnut-leaves, and whatever possesses the kernel-flavour, may have similar qualities.</note>

                              <hi>The Will presides not.</hi> l. 74. Sleep consists in the abolition of all voluntary power, both over our muscular motions and our ideas; for we neither walk nor reason in sleep. But, at the same time, many of our muscular motions, and many of our ideas, continue to be excited into action in consequence of internal irritations and of internal sensations; for the heart and arteries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to beat, and we experience variety of passions, and even hunger and thirst, in our dreams. Hence I conclude, that our nerves of sense are not torpid or inert during sleep; but that they are only precluded from the perception of external objects, by their external organs being rendered unfit to transmit to them the appulses of external bodies, during the suspension of the power of volition; thus the eye-lids are closed in sleep, and, I suppose, the tympanum of the ear is not stretched, because they are deprived of the voluntary exertions of the muscles appropriated to these purposes; and it is probable something similar happens to the external apparatus of our other organs of sense, which may render them unfit for their office of perception during sleep; for milk put into the mouths of sleeping babes occasions them to swallow and suck; and, if eye-lid is a little opened in the day-light by the exertions of disturbed sleep, the person dreams of being much dazzled. See first Interlude.</p>
                           <p>When there arises in sleep a painful desire to exert the voluntary motions, it is called the Nightmare, or Incubus. When the sleep becomes so imperfect that some muscular motions obey this exertion of desire, people have walked about, and even performed some domestic offices in sleep; one of these sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walkers I have frequently seen; once she smelt of a tube-rose, and sung, and drank a dish of tea in this state; her awaking was always attended with prodigious surprize, and even fear: this disease had daily periods, and seemed to be of the epileptic kind.</p>

Near the village of Wetton, a mile or two above Dove-Dale, near Ashburn, in Derbyshire, there is a spacious cavern about the middle of the ascent of the mountain, which still retains the name of Thor's house; below it is an extensive and romantic common, where the rivers Hamps and Manifold sink into the earth, and rise again in Ilam gardens, the seat of John Port, <abbr>Esq.</abbr> about three miles below. Where these rivers rise again, there are impressions resemblimg Fish, which appear to be of Jasper bedded in Lime-stone. Calcareous Spars, Shells converted into a kind of Agate, corallines in Marble, ores of Lead, Copper, and Zinc, and many strata of Flint, or Chert, and of Toadstone, or Lava, abound in this part of the country. The Druids are said to have offered human sacrifices inclosed in wicker idols to Thor. Thursday had its name from this Deity.</p>
                           <p>The broken appearance of the surface of many parts of this country; with the Swallows, as they are called, or basons on some of the mountains, like vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canic Craters, where the rain-water sinks into the earth; and the numerous large stones, which seem to have been thrown over the land by volcanic ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plosions; as well as the great masses of Toadstone or Lava; evince the exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of violent earthquakes at some early period of the world. At this time the channels of these subterraneous rivers seem to have been formed when a long tract of rocks were raised by the sea flowing in upon the central fires, and thus producing an irresistible explosion of steam; and when these rocks again subsided, their parts did not exactly correspond, but left a long cavity arched over in this operation of nature. The cavities at Castleton and Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in Derbyshire, seem to have had a similar origin, as well as this cavern termed Thor's house.

The seed-vessel consists of one cell with five divisions; each of these, when the seed is ripe, on being touched suddenly folds itself into a spiral form, leaps from the stalk, and disperses the seeds to a great distance by its elasticity. The capsule of the geranium and the beard of wild oats are twisted for a similar purpose, and dislodge their seeds on wet days, when the ground is best sitted to receive them.

That very ingenious Mechanic Philosopher, Mr. Edgworth, once made on this principle a wooden automaton; its back consisted of soft Fir-wood, about an inch square and four feet long, made of pieces cut the cross way in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the fibres of the wood, and glued together: it had two feet before, and two behind, which supported the back horizontally; but were placed with their extremities, which were armed with sharp points of iron, bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backwards. Hence, in moist weather, the back lengthened, and the two foremost feet were pushed forwards; in dry weather the hinder feet were drawn after, as the obliquity of the points of the feet prevented it from receding. And thus, in a month or two, it walked across the room which it inhabited. Might not this machine be applied as an Hygrometer to some meteorological purpose?</p>

                           <p>The odours of many flowers, so delightful to our sense of smell, as well as the disagreeable scents of others, are owing to the exhalation of their essential oils. These essential oils have greater or less volatility, and are all inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable; many of them are poisons to us, as those of Laurel and Tobacco; others possess a narcotic quality, as is evinced by the oil of cloves instantly relieving slight tooth-achs; from oil of cinnamon relieving the hiccup; and balsam of peru relieving the pain of some ulcers. They are all deleterious to certain insects, and hence their use in the vegetable economy being produced in flowers or leaves to protect them from the depredations of their voraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemies. One of the essential oils, that of turpentine, is recommended by M. de Thosse, for the purpose of destroying insects which infect both vegetables and animals. Having observed that the trees were attacked by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of small insects of different colours (pucins o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He adds, that he destroyed the fleas of his puppies by once bathing them in warm water, impregnated with oil of turpentine. Mem. d'Agriculture, An. 1787. Tremest. Printemp. p. 109. I sprinkled some oil of turpentine, by means of a brush, on some branches of a nectarine tree, which was covered with the aphis, but it killed both the insect and the branches: a solution of arsenic much diluted did the same. The shops of medicine are supplied with resins, balsams, and essential oils; and the tar and pitch, for mechanical purposes, are produced from these vegetable se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions.</p>

With the milky juice of this tree the Indians poison their arrows; the dew-drops, which fall from it, are so caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic as to blister the skin, and produce dangerous ulcers; whence many have found their death by sleeping under its shade. Variety of noxious plants abound in all countries; in our own, the deadly nightshade, henbane, hounds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongue, and many others, are seen in almost every high road, untouched by animals. Some have asked, what is the use of such abundance of poisons? The nauseous or pungent juices of some vegetables, like the thorns of others, are given them for their defence from the depredations of animals; hence the thorny plants are, in general, wholesome and agreeable food to grani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorous animals. See note on Ilex. The flowers or petals of plants are, perhaps, in general, more acrid than their leaves; hence they are much sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domer eaten by insects. This seems to have been the use of the essential oil in the vegetable economy, as observed above, in the notes on Dictamnus and Ilex. The fragrance of plants is thus a part of their defence.

Is the fluid contained in this bag, and pressed through the perforation into the wound made by the point, a caustic essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial oil, or a concentrated vegetable acid! The vegetable poisons, like the animal ones, produce more sudden and dangerous effects, when instilled into a wound, than when taken into the stomach; whence the families of Marsi and Psilli, in ancient Rome, sucked the poison, without injury, out of wounds made by vipers, and were supposed to be indued with superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural powers for this purpose. By the experiments related by Beccaria, it appears, that four or five times the quantity, taken by the mouth, had about equal effects with that infused into a wound. The male flowers of the nettle are separate from the female, and the anthers are seen, in fair weather, to burst with force, and to discharge a dust, which hovers about the plant like a cloud.</note>

The exhalations from ripe fruit, or withering leaves, are proved much to injure the air in which they are confined; and, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, all those vegetables which emit a strong scent may do this in a greater or less degree, from the Rose to the Lobelia; whence the unwholesomeness in living perpetually in such an atmosphere of perfume as some people wear about their hair, or carry in their handkerchiefs. Either Boerhaave or Dr. Mead have affirmed, they were acquainted with a poisonous fluid whose vapour would presently destroy the person who sat near it.

There is a poison-tree in the island of Java, which is said, by its effluvia, to have depopulated the country for 12 or 14 miles round the place of its growth. It is called, in the Malayan language, Bohon-Upas; with the juice of it the most poisonous arrows are prepared; and, to gain this, the condemned criminals are sent to the tree, with proper direction both to get the juice, and to secure themselves from the malignant exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the tree; and are pardoned if they bring back a certain quantity of the poison. But, by the registers there kept, not one in four are said to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Not only animals of all kinds, both quadrupeds, fish, and birds, but all kinds of vegetables also, are destroyed by the effluvia of the noxions tree; so that, in a district of 12 or 14 miles round it, the face of the earth is quite barren and rocky, intermixed only with the skeletons of men and animals, affording a scene of melancholy beyond what poets have described or painters delineated. Two younger trees of its own species are said to grow near it. See London Magazine for 1784 or 1783. Translated from a description of the poison-tree of the island of Java, written in Dutch, by N. P. Foersch. For a further account of it, see a note at the end of the work.</note>

                              <hi>Orchis.</hi> l. 259. The Orchis morio in the circumstance of the parent-root shrivelling up and dying, as the young one increases, is not only analogous to other tuberous or knobby roots, but also to some bulbous roots, as the tulip. The manner of the production of herbaceous plants from their various pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennial roots, seems to want further investigation, as their analogy is not yet clearly established. The caudex, or true root, in the orchis, lies above the knob; and from this part the fibrous roots and the new knob are produced. In the tulip the caudex lies below the bulb; from whence proceed the fibrous roots and the new bulbs; the root, after it has flowered, dies like the orchis-root; for the stem of the last year's tulip lies on the outside, and not in the centre of the bulb; which, I am informed, does not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the three or four first years when raised from seed, when it only produces a stem, and slender leaves without flowering. In the tulip-root dissected in the early spring, just before it begins to shoot, a perfect flower is seen in its centre; and between the first and second coat the large next year's bulb is, I believe, produced; between the second and third coat, and between this and the fourth coat, and perhaps further, other less and less bulbs are visible, all adjoining to the caudex at the bottom of the mother bulb; and which, I am told, require as many years before they will flower as the number of the coats with which they are covered. This annual re-production of the tulip-root induces some florists to believe that tulip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roots never die naturally, as they lose so few of them; whereas the hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth-roots, I am informed, will not last above five or seven years after they have flowered.</p>
                           <p>The hyacinth-root differs from the tulip-root, as the stem of the last year's flower is always found in the centre of the root, and the new offsets arise from the caudex below the bulb, but not beneath any of the concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric coats of the root, except the external one; hence Mr. Eaton, an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious florist of Derby, to whom I am indebted for most of the observations in this note, concludes, that the hyacinth-root does not perish annually after it has flowered, like the tulip. Mr. Eaton gave me a tulip-root which had been set too deep in the earth, and the caudex had elongated itself near an inch, and the new bulb was formed above the old one, and detached from it, instead of adhering to its side. See addit. notes to Part 1. No. XIV.</p>
                           <p>The caudex of the ranunculus, cultivated by the florists, lies above the claw-like root; in this the old root or claws die annually, like the tulip and orchis, and the new claws, which are seen above the old ones, draw down the caudex lower into the earth. The same is said to happen to Scabiosa, or Devil's bit, and some other plants, as valerian and greater plantain; the new fibrous roots rising round the caudex above the old ones, the inferior end of the root becomes stumped, as if cut off, after the old fibres are decayed, and the caudex is drawn down into the earth by these new roots. See Arum and Tulipa.</p>

This parasite plant (the seed splitting without cotyledons) protrudes a spiral body, and not endeavouring to root itself in the earth, ascends the vegetables in its vicinity, spirally W. S. E. or contrary to the movement of the sun; and absorbs its nourishment by vessels apparently inserted into its supporters. It bears no leaves, except here and there a scale, very small, membranous, and close under the branch. Lin. Spec. Plant. edit. a Reichard, vol. i. p. 352. The Rev. T. Martyn, in his elegant letters on botany, adds, that, not content with support, where it lays hold, there it draws its nourishment; and at length, in gratitude for all this, strangles its entertainer. Let. xv. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test for air and light obtains throughout the whole vegetable world; shrubs rise above herbs; and, by precluding the air and light from them, injure or destroy them; trees suffocate or incommode shrubs; the parasite climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plants, as lvy, Clematis, incommode the taller trees; and other parasites, which exist without having roots on the ground, as Misletoe, Tillandsia, Epidendrum, and the mosses and funguses, incommode them all.</p>
                           <p>Some of the plants with voluble stems ascend other plants spirally east<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>south-west, as Humulus, Hop, Lonicera, Honey-suckle, Tamus, black Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony, Helxine. Others turn their spiral stems west-south-east, as Convolvu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Corn-bind, Phaseolus, Kidney-bean, Basella, Cynanche, Euphorbia, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patorium. The proximate or final causes of this difference have not been investigated. Other plants are furnished with tendrils for the purpose of climbing; if the tendril meets with nothing to lay hold of in its first revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it makes another revolution; and so on till it wraps itself quite up like a cork-screw; hence, to a careless observer, it appears to move gradually backwards and forwards, being seen sometimes pointing eastward and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times westward. One of the Indian grasses, Panicum arborescens, whose stem is no thicker than a goose-quill, rises as high as the tallest trees in this contest for light and air. Spec. Plant. a Reichard, vol. i. p. 161. The tops of many climbing plants are tender from their quick growth; and, when deprived of their acrimony by boiling, are an agreeable article of food. The Hop-tops are in common use. I have eaten the tops of white Bryony, Bryonia alba, and found them nearly as grateful as Asparagus, and think this plant might be profitably cultivated as an early garden-vegetable. The Tamus (called black Bryony) was less agreeable to the taste when boiled. See Galanthus.</p>

Some philosophers have believed that the continent of America was not raised out of the great ocean at so early a period of time as the other continents. One reason for this opinion was, because the great lakes, perhaps nearly as large as the Mediterranean Sea, consist of fresh water. And, as the sea-salt seems to have its origin from the destruction of vegetable and animal bodies, washed down by rains, and carried by rivers into lakes or seas, it would seem that this source of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salt had not so long existed in that country. There is, however, a more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory way of explaining this circumstance; which is, that the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can lakes lie above the level of the ocean, and are hence perpetually desalited by the rivers which run through them; which is not the case with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean, into which a current from the main ocean perpetually passes.</note>

                           <p>Sir Hans Sloane has given an account of four kinds of seeds, which are frequently thrown by the sea upon the coasts of the islands of the northern parts of Scotland. Phil. Trans. abridged, vol. iii. p. 540. Which seeds are natives of the West-Indies, and seem to be brought thither by the Gulph-stream described below. One of these is called, by Sir H. Sloane, Phaseolus maximus perennis, which is often thrown also on the coast of Kerry, in Ireland; another is called, in Jamaica, Horse-eye-bean; and a third is called Niker, in Jamaica. He adds, that the Lenticula marina, or Sargosso, grows on the rocks about Jamaica, is carried by the winds and current towards the coasts of Florida, and thence into the North-American ocean, where it lies very thick on the surface of the sea.</p>
                           <p>Thus a rapid current passes from the Gulph of Florida to the N. E. along the coast of North-America, known to seamen by the name of the GULPH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STREAM. A chart of this was published by Dr. Franklin in 1768, from the information principally of Capt. Folger. This was confirmed by the ingenious experiments of Dr. Blagden, published in 1781; who found that the water of the Gulph-stream was from six to eleven degrees warmer than the water of the sea through which it ran; which must have been occasioned by its being brought from a hotter climate. He ascribes the origin of this current to the power of the trade-winds, which, blowing always in the same direction, carry the waters of the Atlantic ocean to the westward, till they are stopped by the opposing continent on the west of the Gulph of Mexico, and are thus accumulated there, and run down the Gulph of Florida. Phil. Trans. vol. lxxi. p. 335. Governor Pownal has given an elegant map of this Gulph-stream, tracing it from the Gulph of Florida, northward, as far as Cape-Sable, in Nova-Scotia, and then across the Atlantic ocean to the coast of Africa, between the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Islands and Senegal, increasing in breadth, as it runs, till it occupies five or six degrees of latitude. The Governor likewise ascribes this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the force of the trade-winds <hi>protruding</hi> the waters westward, till they are opposed by the continent, and accumulated in the Gulph of Mexico. He very ingeniously observes, that a great eddy must be produced in the Atlantic ocean, between this Gulph-stream and the westerly current pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded by the tropical winds; and in this eddy are found the immense fields of floating vegetables, called Saragosa weeds, and Gulph weeds, and some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

It is probable that, in process of time, the narrow tract of land on the west of the Gulph of Mexico, may be worn away by this elevation of water dashing against it, by which this immense current would cease to exist, and a wonderful change take place in the Gulph of Mexico and West-Indian islands, by the subsiding of the sea, which might probably lay all those islands into one, or join them to the continent.</p>

                     <p>It has been already observed, that the principal part of the language of poetry consists of those words, which are expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of the ideas, which we originally receive by the organ of sight; and, in this, it nearly indeed resembles painting; which can express itself in no other way, but by exciting the ideas or sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions belonging to the sense of vision. But besides this essential similitude in the language of the poetic pen and pencil, these two sisters resemble each other, if I may so say, in many of their habits and manners. The painter, to produce a strong ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, makes a few parts of his picture large, distinct, and luminous, and keeps the remainder in shadow, or even beneath its natural size and colour, to give eminence to the principal figure. This is similar to the common manner of poetic composition, where the subordinate characters are kept down, to elevate and give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Does not this resemble one of the arts both of the painter and the poet? The former often shews a muscular arm amidst a group of figures, or an impassioned face; and, hiding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the body behind other objects, leaves the imagination to complete it. The latter, describing a single feature or attitude in picturesque words, produces before the mind an image of the whole.</p>

                     <p>There is a third sister-feature, which belongs both to the picto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and poetic art; and that is, the making sentiments and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions visible, as it were, to the spectator: this is done in both arts by describing or pourtraying the effects or changes which those sentiments or passions produce upon the body. At the end of the unaltered play of Lear, there is a beautiful example of poetic painting: the old King is introduced as dying from grief for the loss of Cordelia: at this crisis, Shakespeare, conceiving the robe of the King to be held together by a clasp, represents him as only saying to an attendant courtier, in a faint voice, "Pray, Sir, undo this button,—thank you, Sir," and dies. Thus, by the art of the poet, the oppression at the bosom of the dying King is made visible, not described in words.</p>

                     <p>The ingenious Bishop Berkeley, in his Treatise on Vision, a work of great ability, has evinced, that the colours which we see, are only a language suggesting to our minds the ideas of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity and extension, which we had before received by the sense of touch. Thus, when we view the trunk of a tree, our eye can only acquaint us with the colours or shades; and from the previous experience of the sense of touch, these suggest to us the cylindrical form, with the prominent or depressed wrinkles on it. From hence it appears, that there is the strictest analogy between
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:033600_0377_0FF7A0C06B57CB70"/>
colours and sounds; as they are both but languages, which do not represent their correspondent ideas, but only suggest them to the mind, from the habits or associations of previous experience. It is, therefore, reasonable to conclude, that the more artificial ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements of these two languages, by the poet and the painter, bear a similar analogy.</p>
                     <p>But, in one circumstance, the pen and the pencil differ widely from each other; and that is, the quantity of time which they can include in their respective representations. The former can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel a long series of events, which may constitute the history of days or years; while the latter can exhibit only the actions of a moment. The poet is happier in describing successive scenes; the painter in representing stationary ones: both have their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</p>
                     <p>Where the passions are introduced, as the poet, on one hand, has the power gradually to prepare the mind of his reader by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious climacteric circumstances, the painter, on the other hand, can throw stronger illumination and distinctness on the principal moment or catastrophe of the action; besides the advantage he has in using an universal language, which can be <hi>read</hi> in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of time. Thus, where a great number of figures are all seen together, supporting or contrasting each other, and contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to explain or aggrandize the principal effect, we view a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with agreeable surprize, and contemplate it with unceasing admiration. In the representation of the sacrifice of Jephtha's daughter, a print done from a painting of Ant. Coypel, at one glance of the eye we read all the interesting passages of the last act of a well-written tragedy; so much poetry is there condensed into a moment of time.</p>

                     <p>In the poetry of our language I don't think we are to look for any thing analogous to the notes of the gamut: for, except, perhaps, in a few exclamations or interrogations, we are at liberty to raise or sink our voice an octave or two at pleasure, without altering the sense of the words. Hence, if either poetry or prose be read in melodious tones of voice, as is done in recitativo, or in chaunting, it must depend on the speaker, not on the writer: for though words may be selected which are less harsh than others, that is, which have fewer sudden stops, or abrupt consonants amongst the vowels, or with fewer sibilant letters, yet this does
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:033600_0378_0FF7A0C3DA9999D0"/>
not constitute melody, which consists of agreeable successions of notes referable to the gamut; or harmony, which consists of agreeable combinations of them. If the Chinese language has many words of similar articulation, which yet signify different ideas, when spoken in a higher or lower musical note, as some travellers affirm, it must be capable of much finer effect, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the audible part of poetry, than any language we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with.</p>
                     <p>There is, however, another affinity in which poetry and music more nearly resemble each other than has generally been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, and that is in their measure or time. There are but two kinds of time acknowledged in modern music, which are called <hi>triple time</hi> and <hi>common time.</hi> The former of these is divided by bars, each bar containing three crotchets, or a proportional num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their subdivisions into quavers and semiquavers. This kind of time is analogous to the measure of our heroic or iambic verse. Thus the two following couplets are each of them divided into five bars of <hi>triple time,</hi> each bar consisting of two crotchets and two quavers; nor can they be divided into bars analogous to <hi>common time,</hi> without the bars interfering with some of the crotchets, so as to divide them.</p>

                     </lg>
                     <p>In these lines there is a quaver and a crotchet alternately in every bar, except in the last, in which <hi>the in</hi> make two semiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; the <hi>e</hi> is supposed, by Grammarians, to be cut off, which any one's ear will readily determine not to be true.</p>

                     </lg>
                     <p>In these lines there is a quaver and a crotchet alternately in the first bar; a quaver, two crotchets, and a quaver, make the second bar. In the third bar there is a quaver, a crotchet, and a rest after the crotchet, that is, after the word <hi>poles,</hi> and two quavers begin the next line. The fourth bar consists of quavers and crotchets alternately. In the last bar there is a quaver, and a rest after it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> after the word <hi>kindles;</hi> and then two quavers and a crotchet. You will clearly perceive the truth of this, if you prick the musical characters above-mentioned under the verses.</p>
                     <p>

The <hi>common time</hi> of musicians is divided into bars, each of which contains four crotchets, or a proportional number of their subdivision into quavers and semiquavers. This kind of musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal time is analogous to the dactyle verses of our language, the most popular instances of which are in Mr. Anstie's Bath-Guide. In this kind of verse the bar does not begin till after the first or second syllable; and where the verse is quite complete, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a good ear, these first syllables, added to the last, complete the bar, exactly, in this also, corresponding with many pieces of music:
<q>
                           <l>2/4 Yet | if one may guess by the | size of his calf, Sir,</l>
                           <l>He | weighs above twenty-three | stone and a half, Sir.</l>
                        </q>
                        <q>

                           <l>For it | took up the barber a | whole afternoon.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In these lines each bar consists of a crotchet, two quavers, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other crotchet, and two more quavers; which are equal to four crotchets, and, like many bars of <hi>common time</hi> in music, may be subdivided into two, in beating time without disturbing the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                     <p>The following verses from Shenstone belong likewise to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon time:
<q>
                           <l>2/4 A | river or a sea |</l>
                           <l>Was to him a dish | of tea,</l>
                           <l>And a king | dom bread and butter.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first and second bars consist each of a crotchet, a quaver, a crotchet, a quaver, a crotchet. The third bar consists of a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, two crotchets, a quaver, a crotchet. The last bar is not complete without adding the letter A, which begins the first line, and then it consists of a quaver, a crotchet, a quaver, a crotchet, two quavers.</p>
                     <p>It must be observed, that the crotchets in triple time are, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, played by musicians slower than those of common time, and hence minuets are generally pricked in triple time, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try dances generally in common time. So the verses above related, which are analogous to <hi>triple time,</hi> are generally read slower than those analogous to <hi>common time;</hi> and are thence generally used for
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:033600_0380_0FF7A0C7529AFC38"/>
graver compositions. I suppose all the different kinds of verses to be found in our odes, which have any measure at all, might be arranged under one or other of these two musical times; allowing a note or two sometimes to precede the commencement of the bar, and occasional rests, as in musical compositions: if this was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to by those who set poetry to music, it is probable the sound and sense would oftener coincide. Whether these musical times can be applied to the lyric and heroic verses of the Greek and Latin poets, I do not pretend to determine; certain it is, that the dactyle verse of our language, when it is ended with a double rhime, much resembles the measure of Homer and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil, except in the length of the lines.</p>

                     <p>There is at least a mathematical relationship, or, perhaps, I ought rather to have said, a metaphysical relationship, between them. Sir Isaac Newton has observed, that the breadths of the seven primary colours in the Sun's image, refracted by a prism, are proportional to the seven musical notes of the gamut, or to the intervals of the eight sounds contained in an octave, that is, proportional to the following numbers:

                     <p>Newton's Optics, Book I. part 2. prop. 3 and 6. Dr. Smith, in his Harmonics, has an explanatory note upon this happy disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, as he terms it, of Newton. Sect. 4. Art. 7.</p>
                     <p>From this curious coincidence, it has been proposed to produce a luminous music, consisting of successions or combinations of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, analogous to a tune in respect to the proportions above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. This might be performed by a strong light, made by means of Mr. Argand's lamps, passing through coloured glasses, and falling on a defined part of a wall, with moveable blinds before them, which might communicate with the keys of a harpsichord, and thus produce, at the same time, visible and audible music in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with each other.</p>
                     <p>The execution of this idea is said, by Mr. Guyot, to have been attempted by Father Caffel, without much success.</p>

If this should be again attempted, there is another curious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidence between sounds and colours, discovered by Dr. Darwin, of Shrewsbury, and explained in a paper on what he calls <hi>Ocular Spectra,</hi> in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. lxxvi. which might much facilitate the execution of it. In this treatise the Doctor has demonstrated, that we see certain colours, not only with greater ease and distinctness, but with relief and pleasure, after having for some time contemplated other certain colours; as green after red, or red after green; orange after blue, or blue after orange; yellow after violet, or violet after yellow. This, he shews, arises from the <hi>ocular spectrum</hi> of the colour last viewed coinciding with the <hi>irritation</hi> of the colour now under contemplation. Now, as the pleasure we receive from the sensation of melodious notes, independent of the previous associations of agreeable ideas with them, must arise from our hearing some proportions of sounds after others more easily, distinctly, or agreeably; and as there is a coincidence between the proportions of the primary colours, and the primary sounds, if they may be so called; he argues, that the same laws must govern the sensations of both. In this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, therefore, consists the sisterhood of Music and Painting; and hence they claim a right to borrow metaphors from each other; musicians to speak of the brilliancy of sounds, and the light and shade of a concerto; and painters of the harmony of colours, and the tone of a picture. Thus it is not quite so absurd as was ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, when the blind man asked if the colour scarlet was like the sound of a trumpet. As the coincidence or opposition of these <hi>ocular spectra</hi> (or colours which remain in the eye after we have, for some time, contemplated a luminous object), are more easily and more accurately ascertained, now their laws have been investigated by Dr. Darwin, than the <hi>relicts</hi> of evanescent sounds upon the ear, it is to be wished that some ingenious musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian would further cultivate this curious field of science: for if visible music can be agreeably produced, it would be more easy to add sentiment to it, by representations of groves and Cupids, and sleeping Nymphs amid the changing colours, than is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly done by the words of audible music.</p>

                     <p>It is probable, that the introduction of philosophy into a country must gradually affect the language of it; as philosophy
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:033600_0382_0FF7A0CD90A3D3A0"/>
converses in more appropriated and abstracted terms; and thus by degrees, eradicates the abundance of metaphor, which is used in the more early ages of society. Otherwise, though the Greek compound words have more vowels, in proportion to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonants, than the English ones, yet the modes of compounding them are less general, as may be seen by variety of instances given in the preface of the translators, prefixed to the SYSTEM OF VE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GETABLES by the Lichfield Society; which happy property of our own language rendered that translation of Linnaeus as expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and as concise, perhaps more so than the original.</p>
                     <p>And, in one respect, I believe the English language serves the purpose of poetry better than the ancient ones; I mean in the greater ease of producing personifications; for as our nouns have, in general, no genders affixed to them in prose-compositions, and in the habits of conversation, they become easily personified only by the addition of a masculine or feminine pronoun, as,
<q>
                           <l>Pale Melancholy sits, and round <hi>her</hi> throws</l>
                           <l>A death-like silence, and a dread repose.</l>
                           <bibl>
                              <hi>Pope's Abelard.</hi>
                           </bibl>
                        </q>
And, secondly, as most of our nouns have the article <hi>a</hi> or <hi>the</hi> prefixed to them in prose-writing and in conversation, they, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, become personified even by the omission of these articles; as in the bold figure of Shipwreck in Miss Seward's Elegy on Capt. Cook:
<q>
                           <l>But round the steepy rocks and dangerous strand</l>
                           <l>Rolls the white surf, and SHIPWRECK guards the land.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Add to this, that if the verses in our heroic poetry be shorter than those of the ancients, our words likewise are shorter; and, in respect to their measure or time, which has erroneously been called melody and harmony, I doubt, from what has been said above, whether we are so much inferior as is generally believed; since many passages, which have been stolen from ancient poets, have been translated into our language without losing any thing of the beauty of the versification. The following line, translated from Juvenal by Dr. Johnson, is much superior to the original:
<q>
                           <l>Slow rises Worth by Poverty depress'd.</l>

                     <p>It may be difficult to mark the exact boundary of what should be termed plagiarism: where the sentiment and expression are both borrowed without due acknowledgment, there can be no doubt;—single words, on the contrary, taken from other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, cannot convict a writer of plagiarism: they are lawful game, wild by nature, the property of all who can capture them;—and, perhaps, a few common flowers of speech may be gathered, as we pass over our neighbour's inclosure, without stigmatising us with the title of thieves; but we must not, therefore, plunder his culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated fruit.</p>
                     <p>The four lines at the end of the plant Upas are imitated from Dr. Young's Night Thoughts. The line in the episode adjoined to Cassia, "The salt tear mingling with the milk he sips," is from an interesting and humane passage in Langhorne's Justice of Peace. There are probably many others, which, if I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect them, should here be acknowledged. As it is, like exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic plants, their mixture with the native ones, I hope, adds beauty to my Botanic Garden: and such as it is, <hi>Mr. Bookseller,</hi> I now leave it to you to desire the Ladies and Gentlemen to walk in; but, please to apprize them, that, like the spectators at an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful exhibition in some village-barn, I hope they will make Good-humour one of their party; and thus theirselves supply the defects of the representation.</p>

                              <hi>Cerea.</hi> l. 15. Cactus grandiflorus, or Cercus. Twenty males, one female. This flower is a native of Jamaica and Veracrux. It expands a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitely beautiful corol, and emits a most fragrant odour for a few hours in the night, and then closes to open no more. The flower is nearly a foot in diameter; the inside of the calyx of a splendid yellow, and the numerous petals of a pure white: it begins to open about seven or eight o'clock in the evening, and closes before sun-rise in the morning. Martyn's Letters, p. 294. The Cistus labdaniserus, and many other flowers, lose their petals after having been a few hours expanded in the day-time; for in these plants the stigma is soon impregnated by the numerous anthers: in many flowers of the Cistus labdaniferus, I observed two or three of the stamens were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually bent into contact with the pistil.</p>
                           <p>The Nyctanthes, called Arabian Jasmine, is another flower, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pands a beautiful corol, and gives out a most delicate perfume during the night, and not in the day, in its native country, whence its name; botanical philosophers have not yet explained this wonderful property; perhaps the plant sleeps during the day as some animals do; and its odoriferous glands only emit their fragrance during the expansion of the petals; that is, during its waking hours; the Geranium triste has the same property of giving up its fragrance only in the night. The flowers of the Cucurbita lagenaria are said to close when the sun shines upon them. In our climate many flowers, as tragopogon, and hibiscus, close their flowers before the hottest part of the day comes on; and the flowers of some species of cucubalus, and Silene, vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous campion are closed all day; but when the sun leaves them they expand, and emit a very agreeable scent; whence such plants are termed noctiflora.</p>

<note place="bottom">
                           <hi>Tropaeolum.</hi> l. 45. Majus. Garden Nasturtion, or greater Indian cress. Eight males, one female. Miss E. C. Linnaeus first observed the Tropaeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Majus to emit sparks or flashes in the mornings before sun-rise, during the months of June or July, and also during the twilight in the evening, but not after total darkness came on; these singular scintillations were shewn to her father and other philosophers; and Mr. Wilcke, a celebrated electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, believed them to be electric. Lin. Spec. Plantar. p. 490. Swedish Acts for the year 1762. Pulteney's View of Linnaeus, p. 220. Nor is this more wonderful than that the electric eel and torpedo should give voluntary shocks of electricity; and in this plant, perhaps, as in those animals, it may be a mode of defence, by which it harasses or destroys the night-flying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects which infest it; and probably it may emit the same sparks during the day, which must be then invisible. This curious subject deserves further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestigation. See Dictamnus. The ceasing to shine of this plant after twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light might induce one to conceive, that it absorbed and emitted light, like the Bolognian Phosphorus, or calcined oyster-shells, so well explained by Mr. B. Wilson, and by T. B. Beccari. Exper. on Phosphori, by B. Wilson. Dodsley. The light of the evening, at the same distance from noon, is much greater, as I have repeatedly observed, than the light of the morning: this is owing, I suppose, to the phosphorescent quality of almost all bodies, in a greater or less degree, which thus absorb light during the sun-shine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to emit it again for some time afterwards, though not in such quantity as to produce apparent scintillations. The nectary of this plant grows from what is supposed to be the calyx; but this supposed calyx is coloured; and, perhaps, from this circumstance of its bearing the nectary, should rather be esteemed a part of the corol.

The numerous families of grasses have all three males, and two females, except Anthoxanthum, which gives the grateful smell to hay, and has but two males. The herbs of this order of vegetables support the countless tribes of graminivorous animals. The seeds of the smaller kinds of grasses, as of aira, poa, briza, stipa, &amp;c. are the sustenance of many forts of birds. The seeds of the large grasses, as of wheat, barley, rye, oats, supply food to the human species.</p>
                           <p>It seems to have required more ingenuity to think of feeding nations of mankind with so small a seed, than with the potatoe of Mexico, or the bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruit of the southern islands; hence Ceres, in Egypt, which was the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of our European arts, was deservedly celebrated amongst their divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as well as Osyris, who invented the Plough.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Wahlborn observes, that as wheat, rye, and many of the grasses, and plantain, lift up their anthers on long filaments, and thus expose the enclos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fecundating dust to be washed away by the rains, a scarcity of corn is produced by wet summers; hence the necessity of a careful choice of seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheat, as that which had not received the dust of the anthers will not grow, though it may appear well to the eye. The straw of the oat seems to have been the first musical instrument, invented during the pastoral ages of the world, before the discovery of metals. See note on Cistus.</p>

                           <p>Some snow-drop-roots, taken up in winter, and boiled, had the insipid mucilaginous taste of the Orchis, and, if cured in the same manner, would probably make as good salep. The roots of the Hyacinth, I am informed, are equally insipid, and might be used as an article of food. Gmelin, in his History of Siberia, says the Martigon Lily makes a part of the food of that country, which is of the same natural order as the snow-drop. Some roots of Crocus, which I boiled, had a disagreeable flavour.</p>
                           <p>The difficulty of raising the Orchis from seed has, perhaps, been a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal reason of its not being cultivated in this country as an article of food. It is affirmed, by one of the Linnaean school, in the Amoenit. Academ. that the seeds of Orchis will ripen, if you destroy the new bulb; and that Lily of the Valley, Convallaria, will produce many more seeds, and ripen them, if the roots be crowded in a garden-pot, so as to prevent them from producing many bulbs, vol. vi. p. 120. It is probable either of these me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods may succeed with these and other bulbous-rooted plants, as snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drops, and might render their cultivation profitable in this climate.

                              <hi>Deep in wide caves.</hi> l. 179. The arguments which tend to shew that the warm springs of this country are produced from steam raised by deep sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous fires, and afterwards condensed between the strata of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, appear to me much more conclusive than the idea of their being warmed by chemical combinations near the surface of the earth; for, first, their heat has kept accurately the same, perhaps, for many centuries, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as long as we have been possessed of good thermometers; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be well explained, without supposing that they are first in a boiling state. For, as the heat of boiling water is 212, and that of the internal parts of the earth 48, it is easy to understand, that the steam raised from boiling wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, after being condensed in some mountain, and passing from thence through a certain space of the cold earth, must be cooled always to a given degree; and, it is probable, the distance from the exit of the spring to the place where the steam is condensed, might be guessed by the degree of its warmth.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. In the dry summer of 1780, when all other springs were either dry or much diminished, those of Buxton and Matlock (as I was well informed on the spot) had suffered no diminution; which proves that the sources of these warm springs are at great depths below the surface of the earth.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. There are numerous perpendicular fissures in the rocks of Derbyshire, in which the ores of lead and copper are found, and which pass to unknown depths, and might thence afford a passage to steam from great subterraneous fires.</p>

Dr. Priestley found, that great quantities of pure dephlogisticated air were given up in water at the points of this vegetable, particularly in the sunshine, and that hence it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to preserve the water in reservoirs from becoming putrid. The minute divisions of the leaves of subaquatic plants, as mentioned in the note on Trapa, and of the gills of fish, seem to serve another purpose besides that of increasing their surface, which has not, I believe, been attended to, and that is, to facilitate the separation of the air, which is mechanically mixed, or chemically dissolved in water, by their points or edges: this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears on immersing a dry hairy leaf in water fresh from a pump; innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble globules, like quick-silver, appear on almost every point: for the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of these points attract the particles of water less forcibly than those particles attract each other; hence the contained air, whole elasticity was but just balanced by the attractive power of the surrounding particles of water to each other, finds, at the point of each fibre, a place where the resistance to its expansion is less; and, in consequence, it there expands, and becomes a bubble of air. It is easy to foresee that the rays of the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine, by being refracted, and, in part, reflected by the two surfaces of these minute air-bubbles, must impart to them much more heat than to the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent water, and thus facilitate their ascent by further expanding them: that the points of vegetables attract the particles of water less than they attract each other, is seen by the spherical form of dew-drops on the points of grass.

                              <hi>Trapa.</hi> l. 204. Four males, one female. The lower leaves of this plant grow under water, and are divided into minute capillary ramifications; while the upper leaves are broad and round, and have air-bladders in their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalks to support them above the surface of the water. As the aërial leaves of vegetables do the office of lungs, by exposing a large surface of vessels, with their contained fluids, to the influence of the air; so these aquatic leaves answer a similar purpose, like the gills of fish; and perhaps gain from water, or give to it, a similar material. As the material thus necessary to life seems to abound more in air than in water, the subaquatic leaves of this plant, and of sisymbrium, oenanthe, ranunculus aquatilis, water crowfoot, and some others, are cut into fine divisions to increase the surface; whilst those above water are undivided. So the plants on high mountains have their upper leaves more divided, as pimpinella, petroselinum, and others, because here the air is thinner, and thence a larger surface of contact is required. The stream of water also passes but once along the gills of fish, as it is sooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of its virtue; whereas the air is both received and ejected by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lungs of land-animals. The whale seems to be an exception to the above, as he receives water and spouts it out again from an organ, which I suppose to be a respiratory one. As spring-water is nearly of the same degree of heat in all climates, the aquatic plants, which grow in rills or fountains, are found equally in the torrid, temperate, and frigid zones, as water-cress, water-parsnip, ranunculus, and many others.</p>
                           <p>In warmer climates the watery grounds are usually cultivated, as with rice; and the roots of some aquatic plants are said to have supplied food, as the ancient Lotus in Egypt, which some have supposed to be the Nymphaea.—In Siberia the roots of the Butomus, or flowering rush, are eaten, which is well worth further inquiry, as they grow spontaneously in our ditches and rivers, which at present produce no esculent vegetables; and might thence become an article of useful cultivation. Herodotus affirms, that the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Lotus grows in the Nile, and resembles a Lily. That the natives dry it in the sun, and take the pulp out of it, which grows like the head of a poppy, and bake it for bread. Euterpe.

                              <hi>Ocymum salinum.</hi> l. 225. Saline Basil. Class Two Powers. The Abbé Molina, in his History of Chili, translated from the Italian by the Abbé Grewvel, mentions a species of Basil, which he calls Ocymum salinum: he says it resembles the common basil, except that the stalk is round and jointed; and that though it grows sixty miles from the sea, yet every morning it is covered with saline globules, which are hard and splendid, appearing at a distance like dew; and that each plant furnishes about half an ounce of fine salt every day, which the peasants collect, and use as common salt, but esteem it superior in flavour.</p>
                           <p>As an article of diet, salt seems to act simply as a stimulus, not contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any nourishment, and is the only fossil substance which the caprice of mankind has yet taken into their stomachs along with their food; and, like all other unnatural stimuli, is not necessary to people in health, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to weaken our system, though it may be useful as a medicine. It seems to be the immediate cause of the sea-scurvy, as those patients quickly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by the use of fresh provisions; and is, probably, a remote cause of scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phula, (which consists in the want of irritability in the absorbent vessels,) and is, therefore, serviceable to these patients, as wine is necessary to those whose stomachs have been weakened by its use. The universality of the use of salt with our food, and in our cookery, has rendered it difficult to prove the truth of these observations. I suspect that flesh-meat, cut into thin slices, either raw or boiled, might be preserved in coarse sugar or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; and thus a very nourishing and salutary diet might be presented to our seamen. See note on Salt-rocks, in part i. Canto II. If a person, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to much salt, should eat a couple of red herrings, his insensible perspiration will be so much increased by the stimulus of the salt, that he will find it necessary, in about two hours, to drink a quart of water: the effects of a continued use of salt in weakening the action of the lymphatic system, may hence be deduced.</p>

                              <hi>Arum.</hi> l. 285. Cuckow-pint, of the class Gynandria, or masculine ladies. The pistil, or female part of the flower, rises like a club, is covered above, or clothed, as it were, by the anthers or males; and some of the species have a large scarlet blotch in the middle of every leaf.</p>
                           <p>The singular and wonderful structure of this flower has occasioned many disputes amongst botanists. See Tourniff. Malpig. Dillen. Riven. &amp;c. The receptacle is enlarged into a naked club, with the germs at its base; the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens are affixed to the receptacle amidst the germs (a natural prodigy), and thus do not need the assistance of elevating filaments: hence the flower may be said to be inverted. <hi>Families of Plants,</hi> translated from Linnaeus, p. 618.</p>
                           <p>The spadix of this plant is frequently quite white, or coloured, and the leaves liable to be streaked with white, and to have black or scarlet blotches on them. As the plant has no corol or blossom, it is probable the coloured juices in these parts of the sheath or leaves may serve the same purpose as the coloured juices in the petals of other flowers; from which I suppose the honey to be prepared. See note on Helleborus. I am informed that those tulip-roots which have a red cuticle produce red flowers. See Rubia.</p>
                           <p>When the petals of the tulip become striped with many colours, the plant loses almost half of its height; and the method of making them thus break into colours, is by transplanting them into a meagre or sandy soil, <hi>after they have previously enjoyed a richer soil:</hi> hence it appears, that the plant is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened when the flower becomes variegated.

<note place="bottom">
                           <hi>Dianthus.</hi> l. 303. Superbus. Proud Pink. There is a kind of pink, called Fairchild's mule, which is here supposed to be produced between a Dianthus superbus, and the Caryophyllus, Clove. The Dianthus superbus emits a most fragrant odour, particularly at night. Vegetable mules supply an irrefragable argument in favour of the sexual system of botany. They are said to be numerous; and, like the mules of the animal kingdom, not always to continue their species by seed. There is an account of a curious mule from the Antirrhinum linaria, Toad-flax, in the Amoenit. Academ. vol. i. No. 3. and many hybrid plants described in No. 32. The Urtica alienata is an evergreen plant, which appears to be a nettle from the male flowers, and a Pellitory (Parietaria) from the female ones and the fruit; and is hence between both. Murray, Syst. Veg. Amongst the English in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digenous plants, the veronica hybrida mule Speedwel is supposed to have originated from the officinal one, and the spiked one. And the Sibthorpia Europaea to have for its parents the golden saxifrage and marsh pennywort. Pulteney's View of Linnaeus, p. 253. Mr. Graberg, Mr. Schreber, and Mr. Ramstrom, seem of opinion, that the internal structure, or parts of fructification in mule-plants, resemble the female parent; but that the habit, or external structure, resembles the male parent. See treatises under the above names, in vol. vi. Amoenit. Academic. The mule produced from a horse and the ass, resembles the horse externally with his ears, mane, and tail; but with the nature or manners of an ass: but the Hinnus, or creature produced from a male ass and a mare, resembles the father externally in sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ash-colour, and the black cross, but with the nature or manners of a horse.

                              <hi>The dry Harmattan.</hi> l. 328. The Harmattan is a singular wind, blowing from the interior parts of Africa to the Atlantic ocean, sometimes for a few hours, sometimes for several days, without regular periods. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attended with a fog or haze, so dense as to render those objects invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible which are at the distance of a quarter of a mile: the sun appears through it only about noon, and then of a dilute red, and very minute particles subside from the misty air, so as to make the grass, and the skins of negroes, appear whitish. The extreme dryness which attends this wind or fog, without dews, withers, and quite dries, the leaves of vegetables; and is said, by Dr. Lind, at some seasons, to be fatal and malignant to mankind; probably after much preceding wet, when it may become loaded with the exhalations from putrid marshes: at other seasons it is said to check epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic diseases, to cure fluxes, and to heal ulcers and cutaneous eruptions; which is, probably, effected by its yielding no moisture to the mouths of the external absorbent vessels, by which the action of the other branches of the absorbent system is increased to supply the deficiency. <hi>Account of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mattan, Phil. Trans.</hi> vol. lxxi.</p>
                           <p>The Reverend Mr. Sterling gives an account of a darkness for six or eight hours at Detroit, in America, on the 19th of October, 1762, in which the sun appeared as red as blood, and thrice its usual size: some rain fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, covered white paper with dark drops, like sulphur or dirt, which burnt like wet gun-powder, and the air had a very sulphureous smell. He sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses this to have been emitted from some distant earthquake or volcano. Phil, Trans. vol. liii. p. 63.</p>
                           <p>In many circumstances this wind seems much to resemble the dry fog which covered most parts of Europe, for many weeks, in the summer of 1780, which has been supposed to have had a volcanic origin, as it succeeded the violent eruption of Mount Hecla, and its neighbourhood. From the subsidence of a white powder, it seems probable that the Harmattan has a similar origin, from the unexplored mountains of Africa. Nor is it impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the epidemic coughs, which occasionally traverse immense tracts of country, may be the products of volcanic eruptions; nor impossible, that at some future time, contagious miasmata may be thus emitted from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous furnaces, in such abundance as to contaminate the whole atmos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, and depopulate the earth!</p>

This was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have been caused by the great evaporation, and the deficiency of fresh-water rivers having rendered the sea too salt its inhabitants.

Chundali Borrum is the name which the natives give to this plant: it is the Hedysarum gyrans, or moving plant: its class is two brotherhoods, ten males. Its leaves are continually in spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous motion; some rising and others falling; and others whirling circularly by twisting their stems. This spontaneous movement of the leaves, when the air is quite still and very warm, seems to be necessary to the plant, as perpetual respiration is to animal life. A more particular account, with a good print of the Hedysarum gyrans, is given by M. Broussonet, in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per on vegetable motions, in the Histoire de I'Academie des Sciences.

Murray, Syst. Veg. See note on Collinsonia, for other instances of vegetable spontaneity. Add to this, that as the sleep of animals consists in a suspension of voluntary motion, and as vegetables are likewise subject to sleep, there is reason to conclude, that the various actions of opening and closing their petals and foliage may be justly ascribed to a voluntary power: for without the faculty of volition, sleep would not have been necessary to them.</p>

As these trees bear some male and others female flowers, immured on all sides by the fruit, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their secundation was very unintelligible, till Tournefort and Ponte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera discovered, that a kind of gnat, produced in the male figs. carried the fecundating dust on its wings, (Cynips Psenes Syst. Nat. 919.) and, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating the female fig, thus impregnated the flowers. For the evidence of this wonderful fact, see the word Caprification, in Milne's Botanical Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary. The figs of this country are all female, and their seeds not proli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic; and, therefore, they can only be propagated by layers and suckers.</p>
                           <p>Monsieur de la Hire has shewn, in the Memoir. de l'Academ. de Science, that the summer figs of Paris, in Provence, Italy, and Malta, have all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect stamina, and ripen not only their fruits, but their seed; from which seed other fig-trees are raised; but that the stamina of the autumnal figs are abortive, perhaps owing to the want of due warmth. Mr. Milne, in his Botanical Dictionary (art. Caprification), says, that the cultivated fig-trees have a few male flowers placed above the female within the same cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or receptacle; which, in warmer climates, perform their proper office, but in colder ones become abortive. And Linnaeus observes, that some figs have the navel of the receptacle open; which was one reason that induced him to remove this plant from the class Clandestine Marriage to the class Polygamy. Lin. Spec. Plant.</p>
                           <p>From all these circumstances I should conjecture that those female fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, which are closed on all sides in the fruit or receptacle without any male ones, are monsters, which have been propagated for their fruit, like barberries, and grape<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefort seems inclined to this opinion; who says, that the figs in Provence and at Paris ripen sooner if their buds be pricked with a straw dipped in olive-oil. Plumbs and pears punctured by some insect ripen sooner, and the part round the puncture is sweeter. Is not the honey-dew produced by the punct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

Will not wounding the branch of a pear-tree, which is too vigorous, prevent the blossoms from falling off; as from some fig-trees the fruit is said to fall of unless they are wounded by caprification? I had last spring six young trees of the Ischia fig, with fruit on them, in pots in a stove; on removing them into larger boxes, they protruded very vigorous shoots, and the figs all sell off; which I ascribed to the increased vigour of the plants.</p>

It may seem a solecism in language, to call a flower, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains many of both sexes, an individual; and the more so to call a tree or shrub an individual, which consists of so many flowers. Every tree, indeed, ought to be considered as a family or swarm of its respective buds; but the buds themselves seem to be individual plants; because each has leaves or lungs appropriated to it; and the bark of the tree is only a congeries of the roots of all these individual buds. Thus hollow oak-trees and willows are often seen with the whole wood decayed and gone, and yet the few remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing branches flourish with vigour; but in respect to the male and female parts of a flower, they do not destroy its individuality any more than the number of paps of a sow, or the number of her cotyledons, each of which includes one of her young.</p>

                  <p>P. 14. <hi>Additional note to Curcuma.</hi> THESE antherless filaments seem to be an endeavour of the plant to produce more stamens, as would appear from some experiments of M. Reynier, instituted for another purpose; he cut away the stamens of many flowers, with design to prevent their fecundity, and in many instances the flower threw out new filaments from the wounded part, of different lengths, but did not produce new anthers. The experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were made on the geum rivale, different kinds of mallows, and the aechinops citro. Critical Review for March, 1788.</p>
                  <p>P. 15. <hi>Addition to the note on Iris.</hi> In the Persian Iris the end of the lower petal is purple, with white edges and orange streaks, creeping, as it were, into the mouth of the flower like an insect; by which deception in its native climate it probably prevents a similar insect from plundering it of its honey; the edges of the lower petal lap over those of the upper one, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents it from opening too wide on fine days, and facilities its return at night; whence the rain is excluded, and the air admitted. See Polymor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha, Rubia, and Cypripedia, in Part I.</p>
                  <p>P. 17. <hi>Additional note on Chondrilla.</hi> In the natural state of the expanded flower of the barberry, the stamens lie on the petals; under the concave summits of which the anthers shelter themselves, and in this situation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main perfectly rigid; but on touching the inside of the filament near its base with a fine bristle, or blunt needle, the stamen instantly bends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and the anther, embracing the stigma, sheds its dust. Observations on the Irritation of Vegetables, by T. E. Smith, M. D.</p>
                  <p>P. 19. <hi>Addition to the note on Silene.</hi> I saw a plant of the Dionaea Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipula, Fly-trap of Venus, this day, in the collection of Sir B. Boothby, at Ashburn-Hall, Derbyshire, Aug. 20th, 1788; and on drawing a straw along the middle of the rib of the leaves as they lay upon the ground round the stem, each of them, in about a second of time, closed and doubled itself up, crossing the thorns over the opposite edge of the leaf, like the teeth of a spring rat-trap: of this plant I was favoured with an elegant coloured draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by Miss Maria Jackson, of Tarporly, in Cheshire, a Lady who adds much botanical knowledge to many other elegant acquirements.</p>
                  <p>In the Apocynum Androsaemifolium, one kind of Dog's bane, the anthers converge over the nectaries, which consist of five glandular oval corpuscles surrounding the germ; and, at the same time, admit air to the nectaries

at the interstice between each anther. But when a fly inserts its proboscis between these anthers to plunder the honey, they converge closer, and with such violence as to detain the fly, which thus generally perishes. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was related to me by R. W. Darwin, <abbr>Esq.</abbr> of Elston, in Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, who showed me the plant in flower, July 2d, 1788, with a fly thus held fast by the end of its proboscis, and was well seen by a magnifying lens, and which, in vain, repeatedly struggled to disengage itself, till the converg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anthers were separated by means of a pin: on some days he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that almost every flower of this elegant plant had a fly in it thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled; and, a few weeks afterwards, favoured me with his further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations on this subject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>My Apocynum is not yet out of flower. I have often visited it, and have frequently found four or five flies, some alive, and some dead, in its flowers; they are generally caught by the trunk or proboscis, sometimes by the trunk and a leg: there is one at present only caught by a leg. I don't know that this plant sleeps, as the flowers remain open in the night; yet the flies frequently make their escape. In a plant of Mr. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doyno's, an ingenious gardener at Newark, who is possessed of a great col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of plants, I saw many flowers of an Apocynum with three dead flies in each: they are a thin-bodied fly, and rather less than the common house-fly; but I have seen two or three other sorts of flies thus arrested by the plant.

                  <p>P. 35. <hi>Additional note on Ulva.</hi> M. Hubert made some observations on the air contained in the cavities of the bambou. The stems of these canes were from 40 to 50 feet in height, and 4 or 5 inches in diameter, and might contain about 30 pints of elastic air. He cut a bambou, and introduced a lighted candle into the cavity, which was extinguished immediately on its entrance. He tried this about 60 times in a cavity of the bambou, containing about two pints. He introduced mice at different times into these cavities, which seemed to be somewhat affected, but soon recovered their agility. The stem of the bambou is not hollow till it rises more than one soot from the earth; the divisions between the cavities are convex downwards. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv. sur la Physìque, par M.

Haggren, Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer in Natural History. One evening he perceived a saint flash of light repeatedly dart from a Marigold: surprized at such an uncommon appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he resolved to examine it with attention; and, to be assured that it was no deception of the eye, he placed a man near him, with orders to make a signal at the moment when he observed the light. They both saw it constantly at the same moment.</p>

The light was most brilliant on Marigolds, of an orange or flame colour; but scarcely visible on pale ones.</p>
                  <p>The flash was frequently seen on the same flower two or three times in quick succession, but more commonly at intervals of several minutes; and when several flowers in the same place emitted their light together, it could be observed at a considerable distance.</p>
                  <p>This phenomenon was remarked in the months of July and August, at sun-set, and for half an hour after, when the atmosphere was clear; but after a rainy day, or when the air was loaded with vapours, nothing of it was seen.</p>
                  <p>The following flowers emitted flashes more or less vivid, in this order:

                  <p>To discover whether some little insects, or phosphoric worms, might not be the cause of it, the flowers were carefully examined even with a micros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope, without any such being found.</p>
                  <p>From the rapidity of the flash, and other circumstances, it might be conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, that there is something of electricity in this phenomenon. It is well known, that when the <hi>pistil</hi> of a flower is impregnated, the <hi>pollen</hi> bursts away by its elasticity, with which electricity may be combined. But M. Haggren, after having observed the flash from the Orange-lily, the <hi>anthers</hi> of which are a considerable space distant from the <hi>petals,</hi> found that the light proceeded from the <hi>petals</hi> only; whence he concludes that this electric light is caused by the <hi>pollen,</hi> which, in flying off, is scattered upon the <hi>petals</hi>—Obser.

                     <head>Description of the Poison-Tree in the Island of JAVA. Translated from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Dutch of N. P. Foersch.</head>
                     <p>THIS destructive tree is called, in the Malayan language, <hi>Bohon-Upas,</hi> and has been described by naturalists; but their accounts have been so tine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with the <hi>marvellous,</hi> that the whole narration has been supposed to be an ingenious fiction by the generality of readers. Nor is this in the least degree surprising, when the circumstances, which we shall faithfully relate in this description, are considered.</p>
                     <p>I must acknowledge, that I long doubted the existence of this tree, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til a stricter inquiry convinced me of my error. I shall now only relate simple unadorned facts, of which I have been an eye-witness. My readers may depend upon the fidelity of this account. In the year 1774, I was sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at Batavia, as a surgeon, in the service of the Dutch East-India com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:033600_0414_0FF7A11A59D75758"/>
During my residence there, I received several different accounts of the Bohon-Upas, and the violent effects of its poison. They all then seemed incredible to me, but raised my curiosity in so high a degree, that I resolved to investigate this subject thoroughly, and to trust only to <hi>my own observations.</hi> In consequence of this resolution, I applied to be Governor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>General, Mr. Petrus Albertus van der Parra, for a pass to travel through the country: my request was granted; and, having procured every informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I set out on my expedition. I had procured a recommendation from an old Malayan priest to another priest, who lives on the nearest inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble spot to the tree, which is about fifteen or sixteen miles distant. The letter proved of great service to me so my undertaking, as that priest is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Emperor to reside there, in order to prepare for eternity the souls of those who, for different crimes, are sentenced to approach the tree, and to procure the poison.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bohon-Upas</hi> is situated in the island of <hi>Java,</hi> about twenty-seven leagues from <hi>Batavia,</hi> fourteen from <hi>Soura-Charta,</hi> the seat of the Emperor, and between eighteen and twenty leagues from <hi>Tinkjoe,</hi> the present residence of the Sultan of Java. It is surrounded on all sides by a circle of high hills and mountains; and the country round it, to the distance of ten or twelve miles from the tree, is entirely barren. Not a tree, nor a shrub, nor even the least plant or grass, is to be seen. I have made the tour all around this dangerous spot, at about eighteen miles distant from the centre, and I found the aspect of the country on all sides equally dreary. The easiest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the hills is from that part where the old ecclesiastic dwells. From his house the criminals are sent for the poison, into which the points of all warlike instruments are dipped. It is of high value, and produces a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable revenue to the Emperor.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Account of the manner in which the Poison is procured.</head>
                     <p>The poison which is procured from this tree, is a gum that issues out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the bark and the tree itself, like the <hi>camphor.</hi> Malefactors who, for their crimes, are sentenced to die, are the only persons who fetch the poison; and this is the only chance they have of saving their lives. After sentence is pronounced upon them by the judge, they are asked in court, whether they will die by the hands of the executioner, or whether they will go to the Upas tree for a box of poison? They commonly prefer the latter proposal, as there is not only some chance of preserving their lives, but also a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, in case of their safe return, that a provision will be made for them in future by the Emperor. They are also permitted to ask a favour from the Emperor, which is generally of a trifling nature, and commonly granted. They are then provided with a silver or tortoiseshell box, in which they are to put the poisonous gum, and are properly instructed how to proceed while they are upon their dangerous expedition. Among other particulars, they are always told to attend to the direction of the winds; as they are to go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the tree before the wind, so that the effluvia from the tree are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways blown from them. They are told, likewise, to travel with the utmost dispatch, as that is the only method of insuring a safe return. They are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards

sent to the house of the old priest, to which place they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attended by their friends and relations. Here they generally remain some days, in expectation of a favourable breeze. During that time the ecclesiastic prepares them for their future fate by prayers and admonitions.</p>
                     <p>When the hour of their departure arrives, the priest puts on them a long leather-cap, with two glasses before their eyes, which comes down as far as their breast; and also provides them with a pair of leather gloves. They are then conducted by the priest, and their friends and relations, about two miles on their journey. Here the priest repeats his instructions, and tells them where they are to look for the tree. He shews them a hill, which they are told to ascend, and that on the other side they will find a rivulet which they are to follow, and which will conduct them directly to the Upas. They now take leave of each other; and, amidst prayers for their success, the delinquents hasten away.</p>
                     <p>The worthy old ecclesiastic has assured me, that during his residence there, for upwards of thirty years, he had dismissed above seven hundred crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals in the manner which I have described; and that scarcely two out of twenty have returned. He shewed me a catalogue of all the unhappy suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, with the date of their departure from his house annexed; and a list of the offences for which they had been condemned: to which was added, a list of those who had returned in safety. I afterwards saw another list of these culprits, at the jail-keeper's, at <hi>Soura-Charta,</hi> and found that they perfectly corresponded with each other, and with the different informations which I afterwards obtained.</p>
                     <p>I was present at some of these melancholy ceremonies, and desired different delinquents to bring with them some pieces of the wood, or a small branch, or some leaves, of this wonderful tree. I have also given them silk cords, desiring them to measure its thickness. I never could procure more than two dry leaves that were picked up by one of them on his return; and all I could learn from him, concerning the tree itself, was, that it stood on the border of a rivulet, as described by the old priest; that it was of a middling size; that five or six young trees of the same kind stood close by it; but that no other shrub or plant could be seen near it; and that the ground was of a brownish sand, full of stones, almost impracticable for travelling, and covered with dead bodies. After many conversations with the old Malayan priest, I questioned him about the first discovery, and asked his opinion of this dangerous tree; upon which he gave me the following answer:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>We are told in our new Alcoran, that, above an hundred years ago, the country around the tree was inhabited by a people strongly addicted to the sins of Sodom and Gomorrha; when the great Prophet Mahomet deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to suffer them to lead such detestable lives any longer, he applied to God to punish them: upon which God caused this tree to grow out of the earth, which destroyed them all, and rendered the country for ever uninhabitable.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such was the Malayan opinion. I shall not attempt to comment; but must observe, that all the Malayans consider this tree as an holy instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great prophet to punish the sins of mankind; and, therefore,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:033600_0416_0FF7A11DA2B08DE0"/>
to die of the poison of the Upas is generally considered among them as an honourable death. For that reason I also observed, that the delinquents who were going to the tree, were generally dressed in their best apparel.</p>
                     <p>This, however, is certain, though it may appear incredible, that from fifteen to eighteen miles round this tree, not only no human creature can exist, but that, in that space of ground, no living animal of any kind has ever been discovered. I have also been assured by several persons of vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that there are no fish in the waters, nor has any rat, mouse, or any other vermin, been seen there; and when any birds fly so near this tree, that the effluvia reaches them, they fall a sacrifice to the effects of the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. This circumstance has been ascertained by different delinquents, who, in their return, have seen the birds drop down, and have picked them up <hi>dead,</hi> and brought them to the old ecclesiastic.</p>
                     <p>I will here mention an instance, which proves the fact beyond all doubt, and which happened during my stay at Java.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1775, a rebellion broke out among the subjects of the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, a sovereign prince, whose dignity is nearly equal to that of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. They refused to pay a duty imposed upon them by their sovereign, whom they openly opposed. The Massay sent a body of a thousand troops to disperse the rebels, and to drive them, with their families, out of his dominions. Thus four hundred families, consisting of above six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred souls, were obliged to leave their native country. Neither the Emperor nor the Sultan would give them protection, not only because they were rebels, but also through fear of displeasing their neighbour, the Massay. In this distressful situation, they had no other resource than to repair to the uncultivated parts round the Upas, and requested permission of the Emperor to settle there. Their request was granted, on condition of their fixing their abode not more than twelve or fourteen miles from the tree, in order not to deprive the inhabitants already settled there, at a greater distance, of their cultivated lands. With this they were obliged to comply; but the consequence was, that in less than two months their number was reduced to about three hundred. The chiefs of those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained returned to the Massay, informed him of their losses, and intreated his pardon, which induced him to receive them again as subjects, thinking them sufficiently punished for their misconduct. I have seen and conversed with several of those who survived, soon after their return. They all had the appearance of persons tainted with an infectious disorder; they looked pale and weak, and, from the account which they gave of the loss of their comrades, and of the symptoms and circumstances which attended their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, such as convulsions, and other signs of a violent death, I was fully convinced that they sell victims to the poison.</p>
                     <p>This violent effect of the poison at so great a distance from the tree certainly appears surprising, and almost incredible; and especially, when we consider that it is possible for delinquents who approach the tree to return alive. My wonder, however, in a great measure, ceased, after I had made the following observations:</p>
                     <p>I have said before, that malefactors are instructed to go to the tree with
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:033600_0417_0FF7A12050BC06F0"/>
the wind, and to return against the wind. When the wind continues to blow from the same quarter while the delinquent travels thirty, or six and thirty miles, if he be of a good constitution, he certainly survives. But what proves the most destructive is, that there is no dependence on the wind in that part of the world for any length of time.—There are no regular land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds; and the sea-wind is not perceived there at all, the situation of the tree being at too great a distance, and surrounded by high mountains and uncultivated forests. Besides, the wind there never blows a fresh regular gale, but is commonly merely a current of light, soft breezes, which pass through the different openings of the adjoining mountains. It is also fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently difficult to determine from what part of the globe the wind really comes, as it is divided by various obstructions in its passage, which easily change the direction of the wind, and often totally destroy its effects.</p>
                     <p>I, therefore, impute the distant effects of the poison, in a great measure, to the constant gentle winds in those parts, which have not power enough to disperse the poisonous particles. If high winds were more frequent and durable there, they would certainly weaken very much, and even destroy the obnoxious effluvia of the poison; but without them, the air remains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and pregnant with these poisonous vapours.</p>
                     <p>I am the more convinced of this, as the worthy ecclesiastic assured me, that a dead calm is always attended with the greatest danger, as there is a continual perspiration issuing from the tree, which is seen to rise and spread in the air, like the putrid steam of a marshy cavern.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Experiments made with the Gum of the UPAS-TREE.</head>
                     <p>In the year 1776, in the month of February, I was present at the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of thirteen of the Emperor's concubines, at <hi>Soura-Charta,</hi> who were convicted of infidelity to the Emperor's bed. It was in the forenoon, about eleven o'clock, when the fair criminals were led into an open space, within the walls of the Emperor's palace. There the judge passed sentence upon them, by which they were doomed to suffer death by a lancet, poisoned with Upas. After this the Alcoran was presented to them, and they were, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law of their great prophet Mahomet, to acknowledge and to affirm by oath, that the charges brought against them, together with the sentence and their punishment, were fair and equitable. This they did, by laying their right hand upon the Alcoran, their left hand upon their breast, and their eyes lifted towards heaven; the judge then held the Alcoran to their lips, and they kissed it.</p>
                     <p>These ceremonies over, the executioner proceeded on his business in the following manner:—Thirteen posts, each about five feet high, had been previously erected. To these the delinquents were fastened, and their breasts stripped naked. In this situation they remained a short time in continual prayers, attended by several priests, until a signal was given by the judge to the executioner; on which the latter produced an instrument, much like the spring lancet used by farriers for bleeding horses. With this instrument, it being poisoned with the gum of the Upas, the unhappy wretches were lanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the middle of their breasts, and the operation was performed upon them all in less than two minutes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="unknown:033600_0418_0FF7A124D34BE160"/>
My astonishment was raised to the highest degree, when I beheld the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den effects of that poison; for in about five minutes after they were lanced they were taken with a <hi>tremor,</hi> attended with a <hi>subsultus tendinum,</hi> after which they died in the greatest agonies, crying out to God and Mahomet for mercy. In sixteen minutes by my watch, which I held in my hand, all the criminals were no more. Some hours after their death, I observed their bodies full of livid spots, much like those of the <hi>Petechioe,</hi> their faces swelled, their colour changed to a kind of blue, their eyes looked yellow, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>About a fortnight after this I had an opportunity of seeing such another execution at Samarang. Seven Malays were executed there with the same instrument, and in the same manner; and I found the operation in the poison, and the spots in their bodies, exactly the same.</p>
                     <p>These circumstances made me desirous to try an experiment with some animals, in order to be convinced of the real effects of this poison; and as I had then two young puppies, I thought them the fittest objects for my purpose. I accordingly procured, with great difficulty, some grains of Upas. I dissolved half a grain of that gum in a small quantity of arrack, and dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a lancet into it. With this poisoned instrument I made an incision in the lower muscular part of the belly in one of the puppies. Three minutes after it received the wound the animal began to cry out most piteously, and ran as fast as possible from one corner of the room to the other. So it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued during six minutes, when all its strength being exhausted, it fell upon, the ground, was taken with convulsions, and died in the eleventh minute. I repeated this experiment with two other puppies, with a cat and a fowl, and found the operation of the poison in all of them the same: none of these animals survived above thirteen minutes.</p>
                     <p>I thought it necessary to try also the effect of the poison given inwardly, which I did in the following manner. I dissolved a quarter of a grain of the gum in half an ounce of arrack, and made a dog of seven months old drink it. In seven minutes a retching ensued, and I observed, at the same time, that the animal was delicious, as it ran up and down the room, fell on the ground, and tumbled about; then it rose again, cried out very loud, and in about half an hour after was seized with convulsions, and died. I opened the body, and found the stomach very much inflamed, as the intes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines were in some parts, but not so much as the stomach. There was a small quantity of coagulated blood in the stomach; but I could discover no orifice from which it could have issued; and therefore supposed it to have been squeezed out of the lungs, by the animal's straining while it was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting.</p>
                     <p>From these experiments I have been convinced that the gum of the Upas is the most dangerous and most violent of all vegetable poisons; and I am apt to believe that it greatly contributes to the unhealthiness of that island. Nor is this the only evil attending it: hundreds of the natives of Java, as well as Europeans, are yearly destroyed and treacherously murdered by that poison, either internally or externally. Every man of quality or fashion has his dagger or other arms poisoned with it; and in times of war the Malayans poison the springs and other waters with it. By this treacherous practice
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:033600_0419_0FF7A126618E9768"/>
the Dutch suffered greatly during the last war, as it occasioned the loss of half their army. For this reason they have ever since kept fish in the springs of which they drink the water, and sentinels are placed near them, who inspect the waters every hour, to see whether the fish are alive. If they march with an army or body of troops into an enemy's country, they always carry live fish with them, which they throw into the water some hours before they venture to drink it; by which means they have been able to prevent their total destruction.</p>
                     <p>This account, I flatter myself, will satisfy the curiosity of my readers, and the few facts which I have related will be considered as a certain proof of the existence of this pernicious tree, and its penetrating effects.</p>
                     <p>If it be asked why we have not yet any more satisfactory accounts of this tree, I can only answer, that the object of most travellers to that part of the world consists more in commercial pursuits than in the study of Natural History and the advancement of Sciences. Besides, Java is so universally reputed an unhealthy island, that rich travellers seldom make any long stay in it; and others want money, and generally are too ignorant of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to travel, in order to make inquiries. In future, those who visit this island will now probably be induced to make it an object of their researches, and will furnish us with a fuller description of this tree.</p>
                     <p>I will therefore only add, that there exists also a sort of Cajoe-Upas on the coast of Macasser, the poison of which operates nearly in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but is not half so violent or malignant as that of Java, and of which I shall likewise give a more circumstantial account in a description of that island.—<hi>London Magazine.</hi>

                     <head>Another Account of the Boa Upas, or Poison-Tree of Macasser, from an inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gural Dissertation published by Christ. Aejmelaeus, and approved by Professor Thunberg, at Upsal.</head>
                     <p>DOCTOR Aejmelaeus first speaks of poisons in general, enumerating many virulent ones from the mineral and animal, as well as from the vegetable kingdoms of Nature. Of the first he mentions arsenical, mercurial, and antimonial preparations; amongst the second he mentions the poisons of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral serpents, fishes, and insects; and amongst the last the Curara on the bank of the Oronoko, and the Woorara on the banks of the Amazones, and many others. But he thinks the strongest is that of a tree hitherto unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, known by the name of Boa Upas, which grows in many of the warmer parts of India, principally in the islands of Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Bali, Macasser, and Celebes.</p>
                     <p>Rumphius testifies concerning this Indian poison, that it was more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Dutch then any warlike instrument; it is by him styled Arbor toxicaria, and he mentions two species of it, which he terms male and female; and describes the tree as having a thick trunk, with spreading branches, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a rough dark bark. The wood, he adds, is very solid, of a pale
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:033600_0420_0FF7A12823DB4A70"/>
yellow, and variegated with black spots; but the fructification is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</p>
                     <p>Professor Thunberg supposes the Boa Upas to be a Cestrum, or a tree of the same natural family; and describes a Cestrum of the Cape of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hope, the juice of which the Hottentots mix with the venom of a certain serpent, which is said to increase the deleterious quality of them both.</p>
                     <p>The Boa Upas tree is easily recognised at a distance, being always solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the soil around it being barren, and, as it were, burnt up; the dried juice is dark brown, liquifying by heat, like other resins. It is collected with the greatest caution, the person having his head, hands, and feet care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully covered with linen, that his whole body may be protected from the vapour as well as from the droppings of the tree. No one can approach so near as to gather the juice, hence they supply bamboos, pointed like a spear, which they thrust obliquely, with great force, into the trunk; the juice ooz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out gradually fills the upper joint; and the nearer the root the wound is made, the more virulent the poison is supposed to be. Sometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of twenty reeds are left fixed in the tree for three or four days, that the juice may collect and harden in the cavities; the upper joint of the reed is then cut off from the remaining part, the concreted juice is formed into globules or sticks, and is kept in hollow reeds, carefully closed, and warp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in tenfold linen. It is every week taken out to prevent its becoming mouldy, which spoils it. The deleterious quality appears to be volatile, since it loses much of its power in the time of one year, and in a few years becomes totally effete.</p>
                     <p>The vapour of the tree produces numbness and spasms of the limbs, and if any one stands under it bare-headed, he loses his hair; and if a drop falls on him, violent inflammation ensues. Birds which sit on the branches a short time, drop down dead, and can even with difficulty fly over it; and not only no vegetables grow under it, but the ground is barren a stone's cast around it.</p>
                     <p>A person wounded by a dart poisoned with this juice feels immediately a sense of heat over his whole body, with great vertigo, to which death soon succeeds. A person wounded with the Java poison was affected with tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the limbs, and starting of the tendons in five minutes, and died in less than sixteen minutes, with marks of great anxiety; the corpse, in a few hours, was covered with petechial spots, the face became tumid and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured, and the white part of the eye became yellow.</p>
                     <p>The natives try the strength of their poison by a singular test; some of the expressed juice of the root of Amomum Zerumbet is mixed with a little water, and a bit of the poisonous gum or resin is dropped into it; an effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescence instantly takes place, by the violence of which they judge of the strength of the poison.—What air can be extricated during this effervescence?—This experiment is said to be dangerous to the operator.</p>
                     <p>As the juice is capable of being dissolved in arrack, and is thence supposed to be principally of resinous nature, the Professor does not credit that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains have been poisoned with it.</p>
                     <p>This poison has been employed as a punishment for capital crimes in
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:033600_0421_0FF7A129DC7F6518"/>
Macasser and other islands; in those cases some experiments have been made, and when a finger only had been wounded with a dart, the immediate am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of it did not save the criminal from death.</p>
                     <p>The poison from what has been termed the female tree, is less deleterious than the other, and has been used chiefly in hunting; the carcases of animals thus destroyed are eaten with impunity. The poison-juice is said to be used externally as a remedy against other poisons, in the form of a plaster; also to be used internally for the same purpose; and is believed to alleviate the pain, and extract the poison of venomous insects sooner than any other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicaion. The author concludes that these accounts have been exaggerated by Mahomedan priests, who have persuaded their followers that the Prophet Mahomet planted this noxious tree as a punishment for the sins of mankind.</p>

                     <hi>From Mr. Mundy's Needwood Forest. Referred to in Canto</hi> IV. l. 35.</byline>
                  <lg>
                     <l>HERE, seen of old, the <hi>elfin</hi> race</l>
                     <l>With sprightly vigils mark'd the place;</l>
                     <l>Their gay processions charm'd the sight,</l>
                     <l>Gilding the lucid noon of night;</l>
                     <l>Or, when obscure the midnight hour,</l>
                     <l>With glow-worm lautherns hung the bower.</l>
                     <l>—Hark!—the soft lute!—along the green</l>
                     <l>Moves with majestic step the QUEEN!</l>
                     <l>Attendant Fays around her throng,</l>
                     <l>And trace the dance or raise the song;</l>
                     <l>Or touch the shrill reed, as they trip,</l>
                     <l>With finger light and ruby lip</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>High, on her brow sublime, is borne</l>
                     <l>One scarlet woodbine's tremulous horn;</l>

 triple plume</l>
                     <l>Sheds on her neck its waving gloom;</l>
                     <l>With silvery gossamer entwin'd</l>
                     <l>Stream the luxuriant locks behind.</l>
                     <l>Thin folds of tangled network break</l>
                     <l>In airy waves adown her neck;—</l>
                     <l>Warp'd in his loom, the spider spread</l>
                     <l>The far-diverging rays of thread,</l>
                     <l>Then round and round with shuttle fine</l>
                     <l>Inwrought the undulating line;—</l>

Scarce hides the woof her bosom's snow,</l>
                     <l>One pearly nipple peeps below.</l>
                     <l>One rose-leaf forms her crimson vest,</l>
                     <l>The loose edge crosses o'er her breast;</l>
                     <l>And one translucent fold, that fell</l>
                     <l>From the tall lily's ample bell,</l>
                     <l>Forms with sweet grace her snow-white train,</l>
                     <l>Flows, as she steps, and sweep the plain.</l>
                     <l>Silence and Night enchanted gaze,</l>
                     <l>And Hesper hides his vanquish'd rays!—</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Now the waked reed-finch swells his throat,</l>
                     <l>And night-larks trill their mingled note;</l>
                     <l>Yet hush'd in moss with writhed neck</l>
                     <l>The blackbird hides his golden beak;</l>
                     <l>Charm'd from his dream of love he wakes,</l>
                     <l>Opes his gay eye, his plumage shakes,</l>
                     <l>And, stretching wide each ebon wing,</l>
                     <l>First in low whispers tries to sing;</l>
                     <l>Then sounds his clarion loud, and thrills</l>
                     <l>The moon-bright lawns, and shadowy hills.</l>
                     <l>Silent the choral Fays attend,</l>
                     <l>And then their silver voices blend,</l>
                     <l>Each shining thread of sound prolong,</l>
                     <l>And weave the magic woof of song.</l>
                     <l>Pleased Philomela takes her stand</l>
                     <l>On high, and leads the Fairy band,</l>
                     <l>Pours sweet at intervals her strain,</l>
                     <l>And guides with beating wing the train</l>
                     <l>Whilst interrupted Zephyrs bear</l>
                     <l>Hoarse murmurs from the distant wear;</l>
                     <l>And at each pause is heard the swell</l>
                     <l>Of Echo's soft symphonious shell.</l>

                  <p>☞IT was the intention of the publishers of this work, agreeable to an article of their proposals, to have inserted, in this place, a list of the subscribers' names; but it has been found impracticable, from the difficulty of collecting the subscription-papers from every part of the United States, to comply with that article, without a very considerable delay in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication. It has therefore been thought proper, from the pressing demands for the book, to publish it at this time, and without any names; the omission of the whole being deemed preferable to the insertion of but a small part of them.</p>
