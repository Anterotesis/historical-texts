            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Context informs us, that King <hi>David</hi> excited the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and People of Iſrael, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards the Building and furniſhing of the Temple, by a beautiful and moving Addreſs; the principal Arguments of which were drawn
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006940_0003_102A9C6C0A871180"/>
from the Greatneſs of the Work to be done, the Glory of its Object, and his own Affection and Example; <hi>the Work is great,</hi> ſaith he, and therefore all ſhould aſſiſt in it, and <hi>the Palace is not for Man, but for the Lord God,</hi> and therefore we ſhould exert our utmoſt in erecting and adorning it; that hereby we may teſtify our Affection to his Majeſty, and our honourable Sentiments of his Glory; which the Beauty, the Grandeur, and Magnificence of the ſacred Structure are beſt adapted to repreſent: If it was for Man, a Worm, a Moth, no matter how mean it be; but ſeeing it is for God, the great and glorious God, it ſhould be ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and magnificent: He proceeds to ſpeak of his own Affection and Example, in theſe Words; <hi>I have prepared with all my Might for the Houſe of my God; moreover, becauſe I have ſett my Affection to the Houſe of my God, I have of mine own proper good, Gold and Silver, given to the Houſe of my God.</hi> This pious Prince lov'd the Habitation of Jehovahs-Houſe, the Place where his Honour dwells, with great Intenſeneſs, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of his Words concerning it, but now mentioned, do plainly import; and he evidenced the Sincerity, and vehemence of his love, by the largeneſs of his generous and noble Donations!</p>
            <p>But to bring the Matter to a Point, the King of Iſrael, one of the greateſt Monarchs of his Time in the World, put on the humble Form of a Petitioner, to

his own People, his Inferiors, and Subjects, and accoſts them in theſe affecting Terms; <hi>and who then is willing to conſecrate his Service this Day to the Lord;</hi> as if he had ſaid, I beg not for Man that is a Worm, or the Son of Man that is a Worm, but for God, whoſe ye are, and to whom ye owe your all; what you give towards the Temple, is conſecrated, or religiouſly dedicated to his Service and Glory: This amiable Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion of the Prince, did more Honour to himſelf, then to the Cauſe he ſerv'd by it: So great and honourable a Preſident, ſhou'd me thinks either ſcreene from invective, rudeneſs, and inſult, Perſons of inferior Figure who make the like commendable attempt for God, or ſupport them under ſuch unmanly and unchriſtian Treatment!</p>
            <p>But to proceed, the King's Petition and Addreſs, was immediately crowned with deſired Succeſs; the Chief of the Fathers, the Princes of the <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>Captains</hi> of <hi>Hundreds</hi> and of <hi>Thouſands,</hi> with others, offered willingly large Donations; which occaſioned great and univerſal Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in that vaſt, grand, and auguſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; <hi>the People rejoiced, for they offer'd willingly and with a perfect Heart; i. e.</hi> freely and ſincerely, with a view to the Glory of God; in Teſtimony hereof, the Prince appeals to the Almighty in this ſolemn Manner; <hi>I know alſo my God, that thou trieſt the Heart, and haſt Pleaſure in Uprightneſs, as for me ſaith he, in the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs

of our Text, <hi>wherefore David bleſſed the Lord before all the Congregation of Iſrael and ſaid, bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael our Father, for ever and ever;</hi> He gave to God the Glory of that Gladneſs, he felt on this agreeable Occaſion; and adored him with Reverence and Affection, by acknowledging his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and tranſcendant Eminence; <hi>thine O Lord is the Greatneſs and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Majeſty;</hi> they are thine originally, thine eſſentially, thine independantly, thine invariably, thine eternally: Thou haſt them in and of thy ſelf, and art the ſource and center of them. Gods Greatneſs is immenſe and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, his Power abſolute and irreſiſtable, to him belong Glory and Victory. Seeing God is the Author of all, it is but reaſonable that his Honour and Glory ſhou'd be the End of all; <hi>all things are of him, and thro' him and to him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, all Victory and Succeſs, in every noble and arduous Enterprize, is owing to the efficacious Influence of that great, powerful and glorious Being, who ſubdues all Things to himſelf, and is clothed with <hi>Majeſty</hi> as with a <hi>Robe,</hi> with <hi>Light</hi> as with a <hi>Garment:</hi> With God is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <hi>Majeſty, (As Elihu obſerves.)</hi> he is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of ſuch tranſcendant Perfection, as cannot but ſtrike an awe upon all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, and a Terror upon all his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; ſo overcoming and refulgent is the Majeſty of God, that the Angels vail their Faces with their Wings before it, the

Saints in their embody'd <hi>State,</hi> faint under the glimſes of it; at this the Devils tremble, at this the Earths Foundations ſhake, from this incenſed the Heavens flee away! The Pſalmiſt farther aknowledges in the Words of our Text, Gods abſolute Right to all Things as Creator, <hi>for all that is in the Heaven and in the Earth is thine,</hi> every Thing is more Gods, than any Thing is ours. His claim of Right is original, abſolute and perpetual, becauſe by his Almightineſs he made all Things; but our Right is only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary, derived and dependant, becauſe we have borrowed our Beings and all the Benefits we poſſeſs from him.</p>
            <p>He likewiſe aſſerts God's Sovereign Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over all, as a Ruler and Governor; <hi>thine is the Kingdom O Lord, and thou art exalted as Head above all.</hi> That right to govern which is founded in abſolute Property, is certainly the ſtrongeſt, moſt equitable and permanent, and ſuch is God's; and hence we are told even by a <hi>Pagan</hi> Prince, <hi>that his Kingdom is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Kingdom, and that his Dominion is from Generation to Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe the Pſalmiſt adds an explicit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of God's univerſal influence by his Providence, in the Conduct of human Affairs; ſucceeding Enterprizes, and diſtributing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations among Men, according to his own So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Pleaſure; <hi>Both Riches and Honour come of thee, and in thine Hand is Power and Might; thou reigneſt over all, and in thy Hand it is to make great, and to give ſtrength unto all.</hi>

The whole Aſſembly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd their cordial concurrence with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſolemn Celebration of the divine Praiſe, by a geſture of Adoration and Reverence, <hi>they bowed down their Heads, and worſhiped the Lord and the King.</hi>

Creatures! who are but of Yeſterday, and have no abiding; that the great God ſhould take ſuch kind Cognizance of us, and put ſuch immerited Honour upon us, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and enable us, freely to dedicate to his Glory and Service, a little of what he graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly gave us, by his all ruling Providence, and which was indeed, and ever remains, his own, originally and abſolutely, by the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt claims of right.</p>
            <p>The Text which I have read and explained, opens too large a field of Matter to be fully diſcuſs'd in the ſmall compaſs of two Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I ſhall therefore confine my Meditations to theſe few important Points, which I take to be the Subſtance and Scope of the whole, <hi>viz,</hi> the GOVERNMENT of GOD by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over all; and that GRATITUDE and PRAISE, which is due to him on Account of Mercies communicated by it, particularly of a publick and religious Kind.</p>
            <p>Government, my Brethren, in its nature
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006940_0010_102A9C7A5144C6C0"/>
implies, Right, Power, and the Exerciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the diſpoſal of Things.</p>
            <p>Rule without Right, is Uſurpation; but the Almighty is the fountain and original of all rightful Authority, in the Family, the State, the Church; as it is all derived from him and dependant on him, ſo it ſhould be all ſubordinate to him, who is the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: On this Account the Apoſtle urges Subjection to the higher Powers, becauſe <hi>there is no Power but of God, and the Powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> But beſides a Right to Rule, which is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called Authority, Power or Strength is likewiſe neceſſary to manage the Reigns of Government, and keep the rul'd in Subjection; without which Government is but an empty Name; and hence when it is mentioned in Scripture, the Word Power is generally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, as particularly in theſe Paſſages, (of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>John) he ruleth by his Power for ever. The Lord God Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent reigneth.</hi> Our Text is likewiſe very full to this Purpoſe; nay ſo neceſſary is Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to all Government, that it is even called by that Name, to ſhew that they are inſeparable, <hi>there is no Power but of God:</hi> In a word, all Pretence to Government, without Power, is a meer Farce, which deſerves rather to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided than obey'd.</p>
            <p>Farther, in Government there is an Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Authority and Power in ordering Things ſo as to make them ſerve the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006940_0011_102A9C7C622C8130"/>
Deſign; and hence the Apoſtle informs us, that <hi>God Works all Things after the Council of his own Will;</hi> and our Saviour aſſures us, that <hi>his Father worketh hitherto, and that he works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The bleſſed God, my Brethren, never acts without Deſign, and his Deſigns are ever worthy of himſelf, and bear the Characters of his Attributes. Whatever Honour might be reflected on the Divine Wiſdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by the firſt Production of Things, it would be ſoon eclipſed by their conſequent irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, without the interpoſure of his Providence.</p>
            <p>As it is abſurd to ſuppoſe, that an infinitely wiſe Being ſhould make Creatures for no End at all; ſo it is equally abſurd to imagine, that he does not conduct them to the End deſign'd by his Providence.</p>
            <p>Now it is only creating Wiſdom that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtands univerſal Nature, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſpys every ſpring of Motion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can correct the Errors of the Univerſe. 'Tis only an infinite Mind, in concurrence with Almightineſs, that can take thorough Cognizance and proper Care of that grand <hi>Syſtem</hi> of Beings, the ſpacious <hi>Theatre</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contains; that can allot to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture its Portion, and adjuſt the Intereſts of Kingdoms and States; and foraſmuch as no meer Creature poſſeſſes theſe Perfections of infinite Wiſdom and Power, the World muſt needs be governed by him that made it.</p>
            <p>And indeed if we conſider his Nature and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006940_0012_102A9C805B379EF0"/>
Attributes, we may ſoon perceive that he is not only qualify'd for, but in ſome Meaſure neceſſitated to, take upon him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Univerſe: For does not the End and Perfection of his Attributes conſiſt in their exerciſe? Certainly the End of Wiſdom is Deſign, the End of Power is Action, and the End of Goodneſs doing Good: To ſay that theſe Perfections are not exercis'd upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Objects and Occaſions, is to repreſent them as inſignificant. Of what uſe would the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>Jehovah</hi> be, if he had nothing to deſign or direct; to what purpoſe his <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs,</hi> if all Things were done without him, and of what avail his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> if he ever leſt the innocent as a prey to misfortunes; there muſt therefore be a <hi>Providence</hi> that governs over all.</p>
            <p>The Almighty has implanted in moſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, a natural Care of their Offspring, and repreſents it as an Argument of the want of Underſtanding in the <hi>Oſtrich,</hi> that <hi>ſhe leaveth her Eggs in the Earth, forgeteth that the foot may cruſh them, and is hardened againſt her young ones as tho' they were not hers.</hi> Now can we, without Inconſiſtency and Blaſphemy, impute ſuch a careleſs Character to God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Offspring of his Power, as he condemns in the <hi>Oſtrich?</hi> Can we ſuppoſe that when almoſt every Creature is tender of its Young, every pious Parent ſolicitous for the Protection and ſupport of his deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, that there ſhould be no Bowels of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006940_0013_102A9C82CEFE5D18"/>
Compaſſion in the bleſſed God, who is love and goodneſs itſelf, to incline him to provide for that numerous Family that have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual dependance on him? No ſurely! His love infinitely exceeds the Tenderneſs of the moſt indulgent Relations: A Woman may forget her ſucking Child, but God's People are graven on the Palms of his Hands, ever in View, ever in Memory. Is it natural to a Mother to nouriſh and embrace her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Offspring with the fondeſt Care and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt Careſſes; does the Sun rejoice to bleſs the benighted World with its Light and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and does a Fountain murmur till it is delivered of its Streams, which refreſh the parched Earth; and is it no delight to the Father of Mercies to diffuſe Kindneſs and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity to the miſerable?</p>
            <p>Another Argument of God's providential Government, my Brethren, ariſes from the Nature of Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſidered either in a ſingle, ſocial or religious Character. If we conſider Man in a <hi>private Capacity,</hi> the neceſſity of a Providence to guide and guard him, is very apparent: The many Dangers and Accidents to which Life is expos'd in all the Stages of it, and eſpecially in its early Infant dawn, render it impracticable, to eſcape with ſafety, if a particular Providence, however indiſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in its Operations, did not interpoſe to protect us, and ward off the falling Blow.</p>
            <p>Nor is the Argument of a divine Government, leſs concluſive, when we conſider Man in a <hi>ſocial
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006940_0014_102A9C8457A69890"/>
Capacity:</hi> The Degeneracy of human Nature is great in all, and ſome in particular, ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant and overbearing; ſome ſo covetous and deſigning, ſome ſo furious and malignant, that all Order and Security would be ſpedily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing'd, the Bands of Society diſſolved, and the whole World become a melancholly and terrible Theatre of the moſt calamitous Evils and deſtructive Tragidies, were it not for the interpoſure of a divine Providence, which bounds the arrogance, avarice and cruelty of Mankind, as the threatning Surges of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Ocean, and protects the Juſt.</p>
            <p>And if Man be conſidered in a <hi>religious Character,</hi> the Neceſſity of a divine Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is equaly conſpicious, moſt of the Acts of religious Worſhip reſpect God not meerly as a univerſal Cauſe, but as our particular Protector, and therefore unleſs we are perſwaded that he takes an immediate Care of all his Creatures, and particularly of thoſe who revere and ſerve him, in the Government of every event, why ſhou'd we fear his Reſentments, or confide in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, why ſhou'd we implore him for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in Dangers, and a ſupply of our Wants, or praiſe him for any Benefit we poſſeſs, ſeeing according to the aforeſaid <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> they do not come by his Interpoſure and Direction! The <hi>Roman Orator</hi> ſpeaks with great juſtneſs of Sentiment, and beauty of Diction upon this Head in the following
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006940_0015_102A9C87A3CEABF8"/>
Manner; <q>If the Gods (ſaith he) do not extend their Care and Inſpection to the Affairs of human Life, what Piety, what Holineſs, what Religion will there be in the World; if the Gods cannot or will not concern themſelves with our Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, to aid and Succour us, if they take no Cognizance of our Actions, what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is it, to Honour them, to build Temples and to pray unto them.</q>
And if we take all Religion out of the World, what will become of unhappy miſerable Mankind, nothing will be left but a Scene of Confuſion and Calamity of every Kind and Form, all Integrity, all Solace, all Safty, and conſequently all Society will be at one diſmal Stoke baniſhed from the Earth! Another Evidence of Gods Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over all, is the Continuance of all Things, in the ſame comely order in which they were at firſt created: 'Tis a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Entertainment to the Mind, to take a ſurvey of all the ſurprizing Wonders in Nature; to obſerve with what Art and Contrivance particular Creatures are form'd and how the ſeveral Parts of the whole are, with the greateſt exactneſs, adapted and proportioned to each other, ſo as to make one great regular and uniform Syſtem; and to preceive how all the various Ranks of Creatures within the <hi>Scale</hi> of exiſtance, are as it were by the moſt curious mechaniſm,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006940_0016_102A9C89DB16B528"/>
fitted to the purpoſe of their ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and have a mutual Dependance and Connection, like the ſeveral Wheels of a Clock: <hi>How manifold are thy Works O Lord, in Wiſdom has thou made them all!</hi> Now if the Beauty, Uſefullneſs, and wiſe Projection of the Works of Nature, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove that they were form'd by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wiſe and Almighty Being, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Continuance and Preſervation of them in the ſame State, the regular Motions of the Heavens, and the uniform Productions of the Earth, equally Evidence their being guided and governed by the ſame Cauſe, who, as the Prophet juſtly obſerves, <hi>is wonderful in Council, and excellent in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' the Elements of which the World is compoſed, have different, yea contrary Qualities, yet this repugnancy is ſo tempered and reſtrained, that they do not mutually deſtroy each other, agreeable to their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tendencies, but keep within their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Bounds, and therein ſerve the good of the whole <hi>Syſtem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the conſtant Preſervation of the World, ſo the ſtrange and wonderful Ocurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that ſometimes happen in it, are another Argument of a Divine all-governing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. The Nature of Matter and Motion is ſuch, that they cannot ſerve the deſigns of their Creator without his Aſſiſtance and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006940_0017_102A9C8C01FF2B60"/>
Influence, which he generally gives accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a certain Tenor, which he was pleaſed to preſcribe to himſelf in the Government of the World at the Time of its Production; excepting on ſome extraordinary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Occaſions, when to render conſpicuous his Mercy or Juſtice, he controuls the fixed Laws of Nature: thus fiery Showers were ſent upon the ſenſual Cities of the Plain, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Gomorha, Zeboim</hi> and <hi>Admah;</hi> thus all the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tribes were fed with Bread im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Heaven, without their Care or Culture; thus our bleſſed Lord by a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Empire over Nature, ſpake the Dead into Life, the Sick into Health, and the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Winds and Seas into ſuddain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequious Silence! Miracles are God's wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Works, when he interpoſes in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Manner, and alters the common courſe of Things. Now we muſt either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all human Teſtimony, and condemn the Records of every Age, or acknowledge there have been ſundry Miracles wrought in the World; and if among all that have been ſo well atteſted, there is one true and genuine, that one is a pregnant Evidence of a divine Providence; for it is not conceivable how any natural Cauſe that has no Will of its own to move and determine it, ſhould either ſtop its own Motion, or deviate from its ſtated Courſe and then return again into its former Place and Order, which is the Caſe of Miracles,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006940_0018_102A9C8E8D96FD18"/>
if it were not under the Conduct of ſome ſuperior Being, that guides and controuls it according to his own ſovereign Pleaſure: And here I may add, that it is not agreeable to the moral Excellency's of the bleſſed God, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he would permit infernal Spirits to uſurp the broad Seal of Heaven, and palm an impoſture upon knowing, impartial and inquiſitive Perſons, by wondrous Works, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving ſome plain Notices to detect the Fraud.</p>
            <p>Nor can we eaſily account for the diſcreet Conduct of many Creatures, who are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the Direction of Reaſon, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging a Providence: The Courſe of their Operations ſo far tranſcends their Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, that there is a neceſſity of a divine Agency in what they do; particularly the Prudence and Oeconomy of the Ant and Bee, reſpecting their ſupport, equally deſerve our Wonder and Imitation. If every Thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens by Accident, and there is no divine Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over the World, why does Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tremble at the thoughts of Sin, with the fears of a future Judgment? which can be by no Art or Opiate entirely extinguiſhed and effaced! What would theſe uneaſineſſes ſignify, if the Almighty had abandoned the Care of the Univerſe, and made no Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the goodneſs and badneſs of Men? If every event be entirely accidental, then how is it that ſometimes, even in ordinary
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006940_0019_102A9C907026E780"/>
Occurrences, the Signatures of a providential Government may be plainly diſcerned? For whatever ſavours of deep Council and Deſign, and is of great conſequence to Mankind, and yet is brought about without any human fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight or contrivance, not only beſides but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Intentions of the viſible Agents, ought, in Reaſon and Juſtice, to be aſcrib'd to an inviſible Wiſdom and Power: When therefore great and wonderful Things are done by an unexpected concourſe of many caſual and fortuitous Events, when the greateſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians are outwitted, their Councils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, their Meaſures broken, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns baffled, without any viſible Wiſdom or Strength to oppoſe them; when the Hearts of Princes are turned like the Rivers of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſuch a ſurprizing coincidence of Things and train of Events, ſerve ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Purpoſes; when many of contrary Parties and Intereſts, without conſulting one another, without ſettling their private Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, unexpectedly conſpire in the ſame Thing, intending to ſerve their different and contrary Ends by it—In ſuch Inſtances, the Hand of God is viſible; his all governing Providence is apparent and conſpicuous to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very intelligent and attentive obſerver.</p>
            <p>But what is it that <hi>Jehovah</hi> governs over? Our Text reſolves this Queſtion, by declaring that he <hi>reigns over all, and that he is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Head above all.</hi> But more particularly,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006940_0020_102A9C9297F56858"/>
the glorious GOD governs over all the PARTS of created NATURE, and every BEING they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, together with all ACTIONS and EVENTS.</p>
            <p>The Heavens and the Earth are ſubject to his Rule and Management; the former is his Throne, and the latter his Footſtool; the boiſterous <hi>Deep</hi> ſubmits to his Government, he binds it with a Girdle of Sand within its <hi>Barrs</hi> and <hi>Doors;</hi> his omnipotent Word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims, <hi>hitherto ſhall thou come, but no farther, and here ſhall thy proud Waves be ſtayed.</hi> When he ſpeaks, its Surges ſuddenly ſubſide without murmur or reluctance: <hi>He ſtills,</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>the Noiſe of the Seas, the Noiſe of their Waves, and the Tumult of the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Angels in Heaven, theſe principalities and Powers, tho' Creatures of the higheſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, think it not beneath their Dignity to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Throne as miniſtring Spirits, (with winged haſte) to execute the Errands of his Providence.</p>
            <p>The greateſt Monarchs on Earth are obliged to yield to his Regimen. <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> one of the moſt grand, potent and inſolent of their Order, was forced to acknowlege this eternal Truth, that <hi>the moſt high God rules in the Kingdoms of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea the Devils themſelves are kept in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Subjection to the divine Government, by being limitted as to the Exerciſe of their Power and Malice, and by being expoſed to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006940_0021_102A9C94495056A0"/>
Puniſhment for their Rebellion. The ſacred Scriptures aſſure us, that without leave they could not diſtreſs <hi>Job</hi> in his Perſon or Eſtate, nor even ſo much as take Poſſeſſion of a Swine, and that they are <hi>kept in Chains of Darkneſs to the Judgment of the great Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not only Creatures of the higheſt, but of the loweſt claſs, are under the Cognizance and Controul of his Providence; the Lillies and Sparrows are taken Care of, fed and cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without their Care, by the Father of the Univerſe; and the very Hairs of our Head numbered. The Notion of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Sages, that the Gods take Care of great Things, but neglect ſmall <note n="*" place="bottom">Dii magna cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt parva negligunt.</note> is contrary to the Dictates of Reaſon, and Doctrines of Chriſtianity; there is not any Thing that God has made, that is beneath his Notice.</p>
            <p>But not only all the Parts of the Univerſe, with the Creatures they contain, are under the divine Government, but every Action likewiſe, for in him <hi>we live and move and have our Being:</hi> All the Wheels of Nature are form'd by his Power, and manag'd by his Providence according to his Pleaſure; nor do any of them move without at leaſt his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Support.</p>
            <p>Moreover the divine Government reaches all <hi>Events:</hi> This is the Reaſon that ſometimes the beſt concerted Schemes, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Attempts, fail of Succeſs, while the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006940_0022_102A9C9730C98468"/>
moſt unlikely are ſurprizingly crown'd with it: And hence it is truly ſaid, that <hi>the Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battel to the Strong,</hi> (that is conſtantly) and this prudent Caution added, <hi>let not him that girdeth on his Harneſs boaſt as he that putteth it off, becauſe Time and Chance happeneth to all.</hi> Almighty God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of Events as he pleaſes, and not always according to the appearances and tendencies of Things.</p>
            <p>Nor is it unworthy of our Notice, that the Almighty Governs over not only the Subſtance, but the very Circumſtances of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents: Thus the Decree of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> for tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World, was proclaim'd when the bleſſed Virgin was pregnant, and ready to be delivered.</p>
            <p>When God intends to favour his People with Plenty, he directs to, and bleſſes Means for that End. The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> confirms this Truth by theſe beautiful and memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lines, <hi>and it ſhall come to paſs in that Day, I will hear ſaith the Lord, I will hear the Heavens, and they ſhall hear the Earth, and the Earth ſhall hear the Corn and Wine and Oyl, and they ſhall hear Jeſreel.</hi> The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens had been before as Braſs, and the Earth as Iron, but now the former yields its Dews, and the latter its Fruit. There is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between ſecond Cauſes, as between the ſeveral Links of a Chain, and all of them have a conſtant Dependance on, and entire
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006940_0023_102A9C98D65FBCC8"/>
ſubordination to the firſt, unleſs this puts them in Motion, as the main Spring of a Clock the Wheels dependant on it, they are either motionleſs, or their Motion is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular.</p>
            <p>And tho' the State of Things appears ſometimes dark and confuſed, yet does divine Providence preſide over them, and by its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing and incomprehenſible Agency, extract Light and Order from them; a pregnant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this we have in the caſe of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s ſufferings by his Brethren, and after Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Dominion of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence molded a dark confus'd <hi>Chaos</hi> into a beautiful form: Here the orient Colours laid on, derive a luſtre from the blackneſs of the Ground; and a contraſt of Characters, and Deſigns, in the Caſes and Agents that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Piece, the Scene! What they thought for Evil, the Almighty meant for good; he ſometimes ſerves the Purpoſes of his Providence by the Agency of Creatures, not only beſides, but even contrary to their Intention. <hi>Senacherib</hi> the <hi>Aſyrian</hi> Monarch, was us'd by the Hand of Providence as a rod to correct the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to bring them to Repentance, <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he meant not ſo, neither did his Heart think ſo:</hi> No! Nothing was more remote from his Deſign, than being of any Service to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he only thought of gratifying his Ambition, his Cruelty and Avarice! The Almighty often
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006940_0024_102A9C9B08B33028"/>
makes the ſinful Paſſions and Projects of Men ſubſervient to his great and good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; he extracts Good out of Evil, and turns the <hi>ſhadow of Death into the Morning,</hi> ſo that that <hi>out of the Eater-comes forth Meat, and out of the Strong Sweetneſs.</hi> His omnipotent Council ſo over rules Events, and directs the Chain of them, that that which in its own Nature tends to his diſhonour and his Peoples detriment, does nevertheleſs iſſue in his Praiſe and their Benefit. The Crucifixion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> pours Light and Evidence on this labouring Point; from this, which conſidered in itſelf, the greateſt Evil, his Name derives the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Glory, and Men the greateſt Good!</p>
            <p>But to proceed, Things natural, neceſſary and accidental, are likewiſe under the divine Government. Almighty God is the Father of the Rain, and begets by his Providence, the gentle Drops of the Dew; he brings the Snow and Hail out of his Treaſures, he holds the Winds in his Fiſts, and makes the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Lightning to fullfil his Word: He fixes the Courſe of Nature, ſo that it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acts in a uniform way. The Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Heaven perform their uſual Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the greateſt ſteadineſs and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tho' inanimate and devoid of Council; and the Sea obſerves its ſtated Ebbs and Flows; but when the great Lord of all, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies his Pleaſure to the Contrary, the Sun
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006940_0025_102A9C9CBA2D72A8"/>
ſtands ſtill in the midſt of Heaven, the Fire forgets to burn, and <hi>Jordan</hi> is driven back!</p>

            <p>But how does the Almighty govern all? I Anſwer, with unerring WISDOM, irreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble POWER, unſpotted PURITY, and infinite EASE. <hi>Wiſdom</hi> bears the ſame Relation to the Acts of the Mind, as the Eye to the Motions of the Body. Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are neceſſary to chooſe a valuable End, to direct to proper Means to attain it, and to diſcover Hindrances that tend to obſtruct the attainment of it. Now becauſe the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God are infinite, we may certainly conclude, that he ever propoſes the beſt End, and the wiſeſt Means: But being infinite, and we finite, it is no wonder that his <hi>Judgments are unſearchable and his Ways paſt finding out!</hi> And eſpecially when the great Sovereign is pleaſed to <hi>cover with Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his Pavilion, and to hide the Face of his Throne!</hi> All Things are ever naked and open to the divine View, whether paſt, preſent or to come, his Eye with one glance pervades all Nature, and peirces to the very Center of the Univerſe: He certainly declares the End

from the Beginning, and perfectly deſcerns every Let that might marr the Proſecution of it; he knows our Thoughts afar off, even before they are form'd; he compaſſes all our Paths, and therefore detects the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed Deſigns; <hi>the Darkneſs hideth not from him, but the Night ſhineth as the Day.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> confeſſes with much Affection, that ſuch Knowledge was too wonderful for him, and ſo high that he could not attain to it, <hi>whither,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall I go from thy Spirit, or whither ſhall I flee from thy Preſence; if I aſcend up into Heaven, thou art there; if I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there; if I take the Wings of the Morning and dwell in the uttermoſt Parts of the Sea, even there ſhall thy Hand lead me, and thy right Hand ſhall hold me.</hi> He juſtly inferrs God's Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience from his Omnipreſence, and cloaths his devout.

This Foreknowledge is ſtrongly ſupported both by Reaſon and Revelation, not only by juſt Deductions from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity and Simplicity of the divine Nature and other Attributes; but likewiſe by poſſitive ſcriptural Predictions of future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent Events: But on the other Hand, it is equally certain, that we are not meer Machines, otherwiſe we wou'd not deſerve the Name of Agents; but are only on that Suppoſition, paſſive Inſtruments of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers Action, and conſequently neither liable to guilt, when we violate the divine Laws, nor capable of Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but this cannot be true, for we our ſelves are conſcious of our Freedom of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of our Guilt when we tranſgreſs the Precepts of God, and therefore it is

Senſes and Powers; and that we ſhou'd choſe rather to looſe our ſight, hearing and motive Power, torn away from us, then ſuffer our ſelves to be diſputed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Belief, that the holy and good God, ſhou'd irreſiſtably determine the Wills of Men to, and puniſh the ſame thing.</q>
               <note place="bottom">Vid. Howes reconcilableneſs of the divine preſcience with the Sins of Men.</note> As to good Actions, the bleſſed God no doubt graciouſly inclines the Wills of Men: As to evil, he only ſupports the Powers of Action he has given to his Creatures, and ſuffers them to ſin, but no way excites to it; for if ſo, he wou'd be the Author of it; but this is impoſſible. The bleſſed <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> is of inviolable Purity, and inflexible Equity, he eſſentialy hates Sin, and therefore cannot incline Men to it; let no Man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay, when he is tempted, <hi>I am tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with Evil neither tempteth he any Man, but every Man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own Luſt and enticed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover the divine Majeſty governs all eaſily and at once, his Word and Will was enough to make all, and it is enough to Rule all; as a Father of the Church ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <q>God is not weary with ordering the univerſe, nor is all the Work of the World too much for him.</q>

two Things at once, but the Almighty governs all the Affairs of the World at once, in the ſame inſtant, the ſame Moment he manages Millions of different Matters! neither is the Multiplicity of them any more a Diſtraction to him, being infinite, then if he had but one thing to mind; nor will there be any End to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: No! it is continual and eternal; if he withheld his Hand one Moment, all the Wheels of Nature wou'd ſtand ſtill, or fall to Pieces.</p>
            <p>But it is objected, if God govern the World, why are not Rewards and Puniſhments diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, why are the wicked proſperous and the pious oppreſſed?</p>
            <p>To this we may reply, that there are Examples in every Age of God's rewarding the good, and puniſhing the bad; but this is not general or univerſal, becauſe this World is a ſtate of Tryal and not of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe: There will be a future Judgment, when Rewards and Puniſhments ſhall be univerſally and exactly diſtributed; in order to which the preſent Life is but a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. Now it is unreaſonable to expect the Judgment before the Tryal, the Crown before the Combate. <q>Puniſhments are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inflicted to put Men in Remembrance of God's Government, but not always, leaſt a future Judgment ſhould be prevented.</q>

in the mean Time the allwiſe God has in a Meaſure interwoven Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Nature of things; to ſin he has anexed Diſquiet and Diſtreſs and hence <hi>the Way of Tranſgreſſors is</hi> truly ſaid <hi>to be hard;</hi> and to Virtue and Goodneſs he has anexed the natural Rewards of Peace and Satifaction; on which Account 'tis juſtly ſaid, that <hi>the little that a righteous Man hath is better then the Riches of the Wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If outward Proſperity be not good for bad Men, then the Force of the Objection vaniſhes, but the Caſe is realy thus; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity is ſo far from being good to them, that it is the very reverſe, it is like a ſick Patients uſing ſuch ſtrong Dyet as tends to make his diſeaſe incurable; Proſperity flatters their Pride, and is fuel to their Luxury; by it they are <hi>fattened for the Day of Slaughter;</hi>

            <p>And on the other Hand ſeeing good Men are corrupt, Afflictions are neceſſary for their Cure, as Phyſick for the Sick, a real Benefit; they are likewiſe but of ſhort contindance, and they are ſupported under them by the divine Power, and have them ſweetned to them by the divine Love, and will be graciouſly recompenſed for their Patient enduring of them with a diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed degree of future Bleſſedneſs; with which

            </p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid of God's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, we may learn the Unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Danger of provoking by Sin, the angry Reſentments of ſuch an Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Being; which are as impoſſible to be avoided as they are intollerable to be endured: a Being that can in a Moment turn all our Comforts into the moſt exquiſite Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and make every Creature of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation an Executioner of his Vengeance.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing the Almighty governs over all, he ſhould with our Conſent govern over us, we ſhou'd yield a ready Obedience to his Laws, and a chearful Submiſſion to his Providence; conſidering he has the moſt equitable Right thereto, as our Creator,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006940_0034_102A9CB1CFDBC4C8"/>
Redeemer and Benefactor, and that our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal all depends upon our Compliance.</p>
            <p>If we are under Afflictions, we ſhould look on them as coming by the Direction of that God, who is Wiſdom and Love it ſelf, who does not <hi>afflict us willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men,</hi> but corrects in Meaſure and in Mercy for our Profit, that he may make us partakers of his Holineſs: He knows beſt what is beſt for us, and will by his Power and Providence, make all Things work together for the Advantage of ſuch as fear and ſerve him. We ſhou'd therefore be contented with our Lott, and chearfully commit our all to his Management; humbly confiding in him, who can with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt eaſe, and ſtrongeſt Certainty, ſupply all our Wants, and protect us in the midſt of the greateſt Dangers. Omnipotence can make our worſt Enemies our beſt Friends, can make our Expences for his Cauſe and Servants to increaſe our Eſtate like the Widow of <hi>Serepta's Oyl</hi> given to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elijah.</hi> Surely the Munition of Rocks is the Defence of his People, he is their Shield and Buckler, he covers them with his Wings, and under his Feathers they may ſafely truſt.</p>
            <p>And eſpecially we ſhould expreſs Gratitude, for all the Benefits we receive by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; it is for a Lamentation, that many Labour to fill up their Lives by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Circle of Pleaſures, to the Neglect of God and Religion, <hi>they take up the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006940_0035_102A9CB542A108E0"/>
Tymbrel and Harp, and rejoice at the Sound of the Organ, but regard not the Work of the Lord, nor conſider the Operation of his Hands.</hi> They pore ſo much on ſecond Cauſes, as intirely to overlook the Firſt, <hi>(the primum Mobile,)</hi> and conſequently rob God of the Honour, and themſelves of the Comfort and Benefit which wou'd naturaly iſſue from a deliberate Recollection of his Kindneſſes by Providence; and ſincere GRATITUDE for them; but the Time being elapſed, I muſt refer the Diſcuſſion of this important Point to the Afternoon, and conclude at preſent, praying that what has been ſaid, may be bleſſed to the Hearers Benefit, and aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Honour, and Glory, Majeſty, and Dominion, to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, Amen.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving ſpoken in the preceeding Diſcourſe, of the Government of God by his Providence, I would now proceed to ſpeak upon that THANKSGIVING and PRAISE which is due to him on Account of Mercies communicated by it, (to us) par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006940_0037_102A9CB971ED47D0"/>
of a publick and religious Nature; preparatory to which let it be obſerved, that tho' <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> conſidered ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and critically, may be diſtinguiſhed, yet I apprehend, that in our Text (by the Figure <hi>Hendiadis,</hi>) they are but two Words deſigned to ſignify the ſame Thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> in Sentiment, Speech and Behaviour, which we owe to God for all his Mercies towards us. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> being impreſſed with a deep Senſe of the Divine Goodneſs, enlarges upon the GRATITUDE due for it, in a variety of Expreſſions of the ſame Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. In this View I ſhall conſider them in the following Diſcourſe, and proceed to obſerve, that they neceſſarily ſuppoſe a full <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> of God's <hi>Government</hi> over all, and import a carefull <hi>Attention</hi> to the Bleſſings we receive by it with our <hi>Minds;</hi> a juſt <hi>value</hi> for them in our <hi>Judgments;</hi> a ſincere <hi>Regard</hi> to their Author in our <hi>Hearts;</hi> a faithful <hi>Retention</hi> of them in our <hi>Memories;</hi> an open <hi>Celebration</hi> of them by our <hi>Lips,</hi> and a grateful <hi>Return</hi> for them by our Lives.</p>
            <p>Without a full and ſtrong <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> of God's abſolute <hi>Empire</hi> over all Events, we will not look on the Benefits we receive, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his Direction, and conſequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to expreſs the <hi>Gratitude</hi> which is due for them: It is therefore extremely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to endeavour in the Uſe of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means, to get this Sentiment deeply fix'd
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006940_0038_102A9CBCA1184E28"/>
in our Souls. And having laid this noble Foundation, we ſhould carefully <hi>attend</hi> with our <hi>Minds</hi> to the various and important Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings we derive from the divine Government, <hi>who is wiſe and will obſerve theſe Things, even they ſhall underſtand the loving Kindneſs of the Lord.</hi> The Prophet juſtly reproved the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for this, that <hi>they regarded not the Work of the Lord, nor conſidered the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of his Hands.</hi> Without a cloſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to, and ſerious Conſideration upon the Benefits we receive, our Minds are not like to be fir'd with Gratitude for them.</p>
            <p>Nor is it leſs neceſſary to <hi>value</hi> highly in our Judgment, the Mercies we receive, <hi>how excellent is thy loving Kindneſs O God,</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>how precious are thy Thoughts unto me, O how great is the Sum of them; if I ſhould count them, they are more in Number than the Sand.</hi> A chearful acceptance of Benefits, and complacence in them, is the very Form and Spirit of Gratitude, and that which truly noble Benefactors have principally in View; no Sacrifice or Holocauſt is ſo acceptable to the bleſſed God, as a juſt value for his Goodneſs: The Almighty not only loves a chearful giver, but a chearful receiver; he would have us to guſt and reliſh his Benefits.</p>
            <p>As a due Attention to the Mercies of God, naturally tends to excite our value for them, ſo this value as naturally tends to inflame us with a ſincere <hi>Regard</hi> to their <hi>Author</hi> in our <hi>Hearts.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> aſſures us, that he
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:006940_0039_102A9CC2AE4BDA38"/>
               <hi>loved the Lord becauſe he heard the Voice of his Supplication.</hi> Nothing ſo much endears God to the Soul, as a View and Senſe of his immerited Goodneſs; <hi>we love him</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> The Truth is, we never love him with Freedom, Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, and Tranſport, until we are firſt fir'd with a Senſe of his Love and Goodneſs, (to us) His love apprehended, like a Magnet attracts the moſt paſſionate and grateful Emotions, and vigorous Sallies of our Souls towards him, as the Source of our Benefits, and Center of our Reſt.</p>
            <p>Farther, a faithful <hi>Retention</hi> of God's <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> towards us, in our <hi>Memories,</hi> is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to conſtitute that Gratitude that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. <hi>Seneca</hi> juſtly obſerves, <q>That he who falſely denies the Reception of a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and he that diſſembles it, and he that doth not repay it, is ungrateful; but moſt ungrateful of all is he that forgets it.</q> When Benefits are not remembered, it is a ſign they made no ſuitable Impreſſion on the Mind at firſt, otherwiſe ſome diſcernable Traces of them would have remained there; and as there was no deep Impreſſion, ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably no Thought of a grateful Return. The Almighty frequently complains of the ingratitude of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting his Works, and the Wonders that he had ſhewed them. But the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> whoſe vigilant Gratitude it is our Duty and Intereſt to imitate, determined to <hi>remember God's
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:006940_0040_102A9CBEE057FFB0"/>
Wonders of old, and meditate on all his Works.</hi> It is a lamentable Evidence of the deep De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy of human Nature, that our Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are ſo tenacious of Injuries, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of Benefits. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> being ask'd, what grows the ſooneſt Old? gave this Laconick Anſwer. <hi>Thanks!</hi> A ſevere, but alas, too juſt a cenſure upon the generality of Mankind. A cenſure which every Thing that is great and honourable, ſhould conſpire to incite us to guard our Conduct from. A Succeſſion of new Benefits, ſhould not ſupplant and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the Memory of ancient Mercies, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther render them more deſirable and amiable, like Liquours whoſe Value is increaſed by Age. The Memoirs of important Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, ſhould be inſcrib'd on our Minds with indelible Characters, as that of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Amaleck</hi> on the Altar, with a JEHOVAH NISI, the Lord is my Banner!</p>
            <p>Another ingredient in <hi>real</hi> Gratitude, is an <hi>expreſs</hi> open <hi>acknowledgement</hi> of the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heaven (towards us) by our Lips, and our great Obligations to God, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them; an explicit Declaration of the Value and Moment of his Benefits, as well as our unworthineſs of them, our inability to requite them, and of the Beauty of the divine Attributes opened in their Donation and Conveyance!</p>
            <p>When grateful Love inſpires the Heart, it cannot but perſpire thro' the Lips, and make them move in Praiſe; as when the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:006940_0041_102A9CC0A83D50B8"/>
main Spring of a Clock is well ſet, the Wheels naturally move, and the Bell will not forget to proclaim the Numbers. Real Gratitude is of a diffuſive, ſocial Genius; it wants others to ſhare its ſweets, to witneſs its tender Sentiments, and to aſſiſt its feeble Attempts in celebrating the divine Praiſe. Gratitude is innocently and nobly fond of Light, of Liberty and Society; the Inſtrument of which is Speech, which is never ſo much our Glory as when employed in glorifying our God for his Goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us.</p>
            <p>But that which crowns the Scene, is a <hi>grateful return</hi> for Benefits received, by our Lives.

            </p>
            <p>Now tho it is our Duty to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God for every Benefit we receive, of whatever Kind it be, yet thoſe of a publick and religious Nature, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Honour and Worſhip of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, which affect a Community and its Deſcendants in their moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Intereſts, to late Poſterity; demand our peculiar and moſt affectionate Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments! For as much, as the reaſonable Soul excells the Carcaſs, which it inhabits, in the Dignity of its Nature, and Purity of its Eſſence, as much as ſpiritual Raviſhments, excel the low Gratifications of Senſe, as much as the vaſt Abyſs of Eternity, exceeds the ſhallow Surface of a contracted Span, ſo much our Deſires after, our Complacence in, and Gratitude for ſpiritual Benefits in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (or Relation;) ſhould ſurpaſs the Affections we exerciſe towards thoſe, that are meerly temporal and corporal.</p>
            <p>As many of us are Members in a larger or ſtricter Senſe of religious Societies, we ſhould be pleaſed with, and grateful for any favourable aſpect of divine Providence upon them, or any one of them, ſeeing all Societies, who profeſs Chriſtianity, and retain the Foundation Principles thereof, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their different Denominations and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Sentiments in ſmaller Things, are in Reality, but <hi>One Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but

            <p>It is a juſt and general Maxim, that the more extenſive and durable any good is, the more noble it is, and conſequently, the more worthy incentive of our Gratitude and Praiſe. And indeed if we conſult <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> either Sacred or Prophane, we may eaſily perceive, that it contains ſcarce any thing elſe conſiderable, but the earneſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of good Men to promote the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Benefit, and their affectionate Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to God for it. <hi>Moſes, Nehemiah, Paul,</hi> yea and all the goodly Train of Prophets and Apoſtles are Inſtances of this memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Verity.

the Learning of the accuteſt <hi>Doctors,</hi> the Wealth of the richeſt <hi>Creſſus,</hi> nay nor the higheſt Attainments in Goodneſs or Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men or Angles! for the Comfort and Benefit thereof wou'd be ours: What Comfort or Benefit can any Man have in a happy State but this, to rejoice in it and thank God for it, and if we do ſo likewiſe, ſhall we not partake of their Happineſs without leſſning it, without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Labours for it, yea partake of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or not? By this Means, a Man becomes the Center of all Felicity, honoured in the Promotion, enriched with the Wealth, and delighted with the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of all Mankind; what a Heaven upon Earth, is this Godlike generous Temper of Mind? But what a Hell upon Earth is its contrary viz. ENVY? ENVY a diabolical Evil! the very Picture of God's great Adverſary, and his dark abode! this thinks itſelf eclipſed by anothers juſt Commendation, grows poor in his Proſperity, pines in his Pleaſure, and grows ſick on account of his Health! this hateful iniquity! one of the greateſt <hi>Monſters</hi> in Nature! is a juſt Puniſhment to itſelf, in this Life, and ſhall meet with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Recompence in the Life to come! There is no Principle, <hi>Sirs,</hi> more deeply fixed in human Nature then a grateful Senſe of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; the very worſt of Men, who are not quite diſpoiled of all the Remains of Humanity, have ſome Reſpect for their

Benefactors, this experience teaches, and this our <hi>Saviour</hi> confirms, by aſſuring us, that even Sinners and Publicans did ſo!</p>
            <p>Nor is there any Duty more juſt and equitable then <hi>Gratitude</hi> for Benefits received, we are indebted for what is freely given us, as well as for what is lent to us; for the Freeneſs of the <hi>Giver</hi> in not exacting Security, nor expreſſing Conditions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, inſtead of deminiſhing, encreaſes the Debt: This generoſity to us, and Confidence in us, lays us under the noble Obligations of Ingenuity, which whoever violates, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracts his Reaſon, and betrays his Truſt! <hi>Gratitude,</hi> my <hi>Brethren,</hi> is the ſmalleſt homage we can offer to our glorious Benefactor for all his Goodneſs, which it is as unjuſt as unreaſonable to neglect!</p>
            <p>I may add, that this Duty is alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful. <hi>Praiſe the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>for he is good, ſing Praiſes to his Name, for it is pleaſant, and Praiſe is comely:</hi> As this Duty proceeds from a chearful Mind, ſo it tends to preſerve and increaſe it; other Duties have ſomething Labourous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtful (to Senſe) in them. Prayer ſets the Scene of our Wants and Sins before us, but Praiſe only opens the Memory of divine Mercies; this is the Fruit of Love in the Poſſeſſion of its Object; this is the conſtant Employment of the Inhabitants of Heaven, and therefore the neareſt emblem of it, of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:006940_0048_102A9CD2DC07A4D8"/>
any Duty of Religion, and the moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Entertainment upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>This Duty of all enjoined, is the moſt acceptable to God, and the moſt profitable to us. <hi>Gratitude</hi> for paſt Mercies, opens the Way for future Benefits, by inclining God <note n="*" place="bottom">I uſe the Word <hi>incline</hi> in a figurative Senſe, to repreſent with greater Light and Energy, the agreeableneſs of Gratitude to the divine approving Pleaſure; and the Encouragement we have from God's promiſes in this Way, to expect his kind and gracious Returns.</note>to vouchafe them, and preparing us to receive them; and this indeed facilitates the Practice of other Duties, by animating our Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and encreaſing our Love, from which they eaſily and naturaly flow, thro a Senſe of divine Goodneſs and our Obligations by it.</p>
            <p>The Words of <hi>Epictotus</hi> on this Head de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be mentioned, <q>if we underſtood our ſelves, ſaith he, what other thing ſhould we do, either publickly or privately, then ſing Hymns to, and ſpeak well of God; were I indeed a <hi>Nightingale,</hi> I wou'd do what belongs to a <hi>Nightingale,</hi> if a <hi>Swan</hi> what becomes a <hi>Swan,</hi> but ſince now I am endowed with Reaſon, I ought to praiſe God, this is my Duty and Concernment, and ſo I do, neither will I deſert this Employment while it is in my Power.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But if the Admonitions, the Precepts and Preſidents of <hi>Princes, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopers,</hi> ſhou'd not have due Influence upon you, yet methinks the Example of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate Creation, ſhou'd not fail to excite
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:006940_0049_102A9CD47430D318"/>
you to the Performance of this Duty; <hi>The Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the Firmament ſheweth his Handwork:</hi> Upon which <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> thus gloſſeth, <q>it were an ugly thing, ſaith he, that Man endowed with Reaſon, and the moſt honourable of all Things viſible, ſhou'd in rendring Thanks and Praiſe be exceeded by other Creatures; neither is it only baſe, but abſurd, for how can it be otherwiſe, ſince other Creatures every Day and Hour ſend a Doxology to their Lord and Maker!</q>
            </p>
            <p>And not only the Heavens, my <hi>Brethren,</hi> but the Earth manifeſts a kind of <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> the Rivers with great eagerneſs, and haſte return to the <hi>Sea</hi> the Waters they borrow from it by indiſcernable Conduits; and the Ground by a fruitful encreaſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pays the Culture beſtowed upon it; and with Pleaſure expreſſes its Thanks for the Rain and Dews received by it; the little Hills rejoice on every Side, they ſhout for Joy, they alſo ſing!</p>
            <p>Yea divers <hi>Beaſts</hi> ſhew a ſort of <hi>Gratitude. The Ox knows its owner, and the Aſs its Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Crib.</hi> Not only the Tame and Gentle, but thoſe of the moſt Savage kind, ſuch as the <hi>Lyon,</hi> the <hi>Tyger,</hi> the <hi>Bear,</hi> as ſome Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians inform us, have ſhewed Kindneſs to their Benefactors: How monſtrous then muſt ingratitude be?</p>
            <p>The Subject I have been diſcourſing of, viz. the <hi>Government</hi> of GOD over all by his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:006940_0050_102A9CD6723C9498"/>
and that <hi>Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Praiſe</hi> which is due to him on Account of <hi>Mercies</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by it, particularly of a publick and religious Nature, eaſily applies itſelf to the preſent Occaſion. 'Tis <hi>Providence,</hi> 'tis the all-governing, all-powerful Providence of the moſt high God, my Brethren, that has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and conducted this important Enterprize of erecting a CHURCH for his Honour and Service, to this comfortable and creditable Period, which we now behold and juſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire!</p>
            <p>Divine <hi>Providence</hi> prepar'd the Way for it, by a train of ſurprizing incidents, long before any Thought of ſuch an Event entered into any of our Hearts. The Deſigns of Heaven are deep and impenetrable, until di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, the Executor of them, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers them, and brings them to paſs; <hi>there are many Devices in Man's Heart, but the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Lord that ſhall ſtand, and he will do all his Pleaſure.</hi> Every Event with which his Purpoſe is pregnant, how improbable ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, will be brought to the Birth by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in its appointed Seaſon.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, divine Providence has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſurprizingly in the Courſe and Series of this Tranſaction, in Inſtances two many now to enumerate; of which give me leave to mention the few following hints: We were brought at firſt under a ſudden, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected and urgent neceſſity of endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get a Houſe for ourſelves to worſhip
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:006940_0051_102A9CD96E46B5D0"/>
God in; the iſſue of which, becauſe of the difficulty of the Enterprize, and the low State of the generality of our Society, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not only very doubtful and precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but without Aſſiſtance from others, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely impracticable; this of courſe affected the Minds of ſome, who were concerned for its Preſervation, with fear and ſolicitude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Event; but it has pleaſed a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God by his Providence, in a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to diſſipate our Fears, and to turn that which ſeemed to threaten our total Diſſolution, into a probable Mean of eſtabliſhing the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety for a long while to come!</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, my Brethren, I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen more of the glorious Sovereignty of divine Providence in any Caſe, than in this: The Almighty in ſome Inſtances mercifully diſconcerted the Meaſures we had form'd with a friendly Intention, in order to bring about for us a good we knew not: One Example of this kind, which I think it not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to mention, is the fixing of the Place where the CHURCH now ſtands; a <hi>Situation</hi> which in reſpect of <hi>free Air</hi> in the <hi>Summer, warmth</hi> in the <hi>Winter,</hi> and <hi>open proſpect,</hi> is perhaps not inferior to any in the <hi>City;</hi> thro' a miſtaken view of things, we would have fixed it in a more expenſive and leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Place, but divine Providence would not ſuffer it!</p>
            <p>Nor ſhould we paſs over in Silence the Kindneſs of a gracious Providence, in direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:006940_0052_102A9CDBAEE84148"/>
and inclining us to begin this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Work in a proper Seaſon, a ſuitable Juncture, and in diſpoſing to diligence and firmneſs in the Proſecution of it, in the midſt of many Objections and Diſcouragements to the Contrary. Had it been deferred a little longer, the <hi>Stagnation</hi> of <hi>Trade,</hi> and its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents which ſoon enſued, would have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Attempt abortive!</p>
            <p>The Almighty frequently diſappointed us, as to our fond Expectations of the Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of fome, and graciouſly raiſed up others in their Place, of whom we had little or no Thought or Expectation!</p>
            <p>A kind <hi>Providence</hi> has mercifully appear'd in inclining the Hearts of a conſiderable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our own People, to contribute gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly (their Circumſtances conſidered) to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a Houſe for God.</p>
            <p>And ſtill divine Goodneſs has been more conſpicuous, in inclining many worthy <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi> of other <hi>Societies,</hi> more eſpecially in this <hi>City,</hi> to befriend and aſſiſt us with their generous Donations! <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of large and noble Souls, who are happily freed from the ſlaviſh Shakles of ſordid <hi>Bigottry;</hi> whoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine <hi>Charity</hi> is not confin'd to the mean Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of a <hi>Party,</hi> but like the Sun diffuſes its Brightneſs and Benificence on all around them, who are in neceſſitous Circumſtances! without ſuch, the Comfort of civil Society would quite expire, and every noble and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Enterprize, of a religious kind, where
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:006940_0053_102A9CDDB185E6F8"/>
Aſſiſtance is needed, fail of Succeſs! Bleſſed be God that there are yet ſuch Men upon the Earth! And that all, under religious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts, are not ſour'd into that unmerciful <hi>Severity</hi> which is directly contrary to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>End,</hi> the <hi>Genius</hi> of all that deſerves the Name of <hi>Religion!</hi> Bleſſed be God that all are not ſwallowed up by that ignorant, hateful and mercileſs Monſter of <hi>Bigotry,</hi> to the petty Buſineſs of Parties, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively little peculiars,<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe things in which all wiſe and good Chriſtians in all Age and Places are agreed are generally and juſtly reckon'd eſſential and neceſſary; that is not Philoſophy, ſays one of the Antients, which is peculiar to this or that Sect. but whatever of Truth is to be found in any of them, and the ſame may be ſaid of Chriſtianity, as Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> excellently obſerves, <hi>it is not that which is appropriated to this or that Party, but whatſoever of Sincere Religion is common to them all.</hi> It wou'd be happy for the Churches, if that Antient and excellent Maxim were univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally obſerved, <hi>in neceſſariis unita sin non neceſſariis Libertas, in utriſque Charitas; i. e.</hi> in neſſceſary things <hi>unity, in</hi> Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Liberty, and in both Charity.</note> to the overthrow of Humility, which is the Ornament of Humanity, and the Beauty of Goodneſs; to the overthrow of <hi>Charity,</hi> which (conſidered in its full extent) is the End of Perfection, the Sum of the Law, the Scope of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the Glory of Chriſtianity!</p>
            <p>I may ſay, with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> that I have been ſenſibly affected with beholding divers of our own People <hi>offer willingly</hi> their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral important Donations, to the Service of God's Sanctuary! But the Generoſity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is more ſurprizing, more affecting, as it was leſs expected, and is leſs intereſted! Certainly, my Brethren, the noble Principle
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:006940_0054_102A9CE06F544D70"/>
of Ingenuity invites us, to do juſt Honour to our kind Benefactors, to expreſs our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Gratitude to them, and to God for them!</p>
            <p>Beneificence unconfin'd to Parties, directed by Reaſon, and iſſuing from Love, is a God like Vertue, an Index of a great and noble Soul, an Argument of undiſguiſed Goodneſs, and neceſſarily commands Reverence from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very intelligent, impartial Obſerver; but from ſuch as feel its benign Influence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gloom of Adverſity, it as a Magnet attracts the ſtrongeſt Tendencies, the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Emotions of grateful Love; like the Light of the Eye of Heaven, which tho' it appears amiable to all beholders, yet particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly affects thoſe who are under its direct Rays, with its inimitable Beauty and friendly warmth!</p>
            <p>I do therefore gladly embrace this publick Opportunity, to Thank in the moſt reſpectful Manner, in the Name and Behalf of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, His Honour the GOVERNOR, the Honourable the CHIEF JUSTICE, and the <hi>Secretary</hi> of this Province, and the Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful the <hi>Mayor,</hi> and <hi>Recorder</hi> of this City, and all the honoured <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> and <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and of every other Station and Character in Life, that have contributed to the Building of this CHURCH, wherein we are now conveened.

and generous Benefactions, with every need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Bleſſing in Time and Eternity. Permit me to add, that it gives us great Pleaſure, that thro' the gracious interpoſure of divine Providence, the Projection and Execution of the Model of this Structure, <hi>ſacred</hi> to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>I ſee no ground to believe that there is any ſuch ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Sanctity in Places under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under the Legal, viz. that religious Worſhip ſhould be more acceptable in one Place than another. The Temple was not only the Place, but the medium of Worſhip, ſo that the Prayers made in or towards that Houſe, had a ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Acceptance, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> vi. 21.) And hence it is ſaid, that the Altar ſanctify'd the Gift, (<hi>Mat.</hi> xxiii. 19.) The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip there perform'd, was more acceptable, more available than elſewhere, as being the only Place where the Almighty would accept thoſe ceremonial Services, and likewiſe to ſignify that there is no Acceptance but in CHRIST, who was thereby typified; but the Antitype being come, that ceremonial and typical Worſhip muſt needs expire, and therefore of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that ceremonial Sanctity of Places dependant on it.</p>
                  <p>No doubt Places, or Houſes may be ſeperated from a common and dedicated to a religious Uſe; and this is all the Holineſs that they are now capable of. With whatever <hi>religious rites,</hi> Places of public worſhip be conſecrated, of which the new Teſtament is entirely ſilent, they cannot be called Holy in the ſame Senſe, that the Jewiſh Temple and Tabernacle were; unleſs we can prove a <hi>Shekinah</hi> or ſenſible diſplay of the Divinity in them; and therefore we find that Places of Worſhip under the Goſpel, were choſen by Human Pleaſure and Diſcetion, on account of their conveniency, without Diſtinction, without any immediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Direction, or pretence of Holineſs. <hi>Outram</hi> obſerves, <q>that there is a twofold Holineſs viz. of the Place and Thing: As to the former, that the Dedication of it to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God makes it Holy, but as to the latter, only ſome eminent or extraordinary Appearances of the divine Preſence</q> The peculiar reſpect which Places bore to God, and his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Service by his expreſs appointment rendered them Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Oeconomy; but the Inſtitution of CHRIST has left no mark of ſuch Holineſs in one Place more than another; and hence our Lord obſerves, <hi>that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Mountain, nor in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall Men worſhip the Father;</hi> the Subjects of Jeſus being a kingdom of Prieſts, wherever a number of them worſhip they conſtitute a CHURCH, ſuch as worſhip in Spirit and in Truth, may aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend on Gods gracious Preſence and Bleſſing, for ſuch the Father ſeeketh to worſhip him, and this gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Bleſſing of the moſt high, vouchaf'd generally in a greater degree, together with the clearer diſcovery of Gods Mercy and Goodneſs in a Reedeemer, and ſpiritual Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of eaſly obſervance under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, ſupply the want of the <hi>Shekinah</hi> which obtained under the Legal; in the mean time me thinks, common Prudence and natural Decency, require, that Structures appropriated or ſet apart for the ſtated Worſhip of God, ſhould not be apply'd to other uſes, without ſome apparent neceſſity, or great conveniency. It appears unſeemly and improper to tranſact any ſeculiar affairs of commerce in ſuch Places and much more any thing that is mean and ludicrous, for ſuch uſes tend to bring the Place and Worſhip therein celebrated as well as Worſhipers into contempt: Our Lords driving of the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple, (<hi>Math.</hi> 21, 12.13.) confirms, as I conceive at has been now obſerved.</p>

by the Truſtees of the Society, for whom the Donations are given, who are by them appointed to regulate the Model of the Structure deſign'd, the Objection is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; pray muſt the Truſtees wait for the Approbation of every Donor, nay of every Spectator, reſpecting all the Parts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages of the Work? then it wou'd be like weaving <hi>Penelopes Web,</hi> never finiſhed, for what one woud approve, the other wou'd condemn, and demoliſh!</p>
            <p>Its very true <hi>Soundneſs</hi> of <hi>Doctrine, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and the Power and <hi>Preſence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> are infinitly more neceſſary and valuable, then external Ornaments, but what then; they are ſubordinate thereto, and therefore no Hindrance of them; otherwiſe God himſelf was miſtaken in their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>

commendable Eſſay to promote the Honour of the Divine Majeſty, and the publick Good, with contempt, and repreſenting it as <hi>Criminal,</hi> is any Argument of Candor, or Regard either to Virtue or to Mankind? and whether it is any Evidence of ſuperior Wiſdom, examplary modeſty or eminent Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to expoſe and burleſque the Sentiments and Practice of the wiſeſt and beſt of Men, in any Inſtances wherein they are approved of even by God himſelf; or to charge Vanity on infinite Wiſdom, and unſtained Purity? As <hi>Moſes</hi> had a Patern or Model of the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> from the moſt high God; ſo had <hi>David</hi> of the <hi>Temple;</hi> and it may be here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that tho' the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was, as it were, but an ambulatory <hi>Church,</hi> of obſcurer Figure, erected in, the infancy of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> while they were in a low State, encompaſſed with Dangers and Enemies, before their Entrance into the promiſſed <hi>Canaan;</hi> yet it had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers rich Ornaments, to which a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Part of the Contributions of the People, were applyed by God's own Order!</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that a few of our own Society who have hitherto given little (or nothing) towards this Structure; have not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding grumbled at all, or moſt of the Ornaments of it; I think it may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably Silence ſuch, when we truly aſſert, that their Purſes did not procure them; certainly in this Inſtance, they have acted a very unnatural and indiſcreet Part; and
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:006940_0066_102A9CFB25DBF888"/>
ſhewn as little Judgement of things, as of <hi>Gratitude</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man!</hi> Have they not hereby imitated the Unkindneſs of the murmuring <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> after all his painful and unwearied labours to promote their Benefit; which ſo affected that meek Man of God, that he ſpeak unadviſedly with his Lips; and no wonder, for Ingratitude in Return for important Benefits, is one of the moſt deteſtable Monſters in Nature, equally abhorent to all the Principles and Maxims of Reaſon, of Juſtice, of Ingenuity and Honour! Wou'd it not be better for ſuch to thank <hi>Jehovah</hi> for his unexpected and immeritted Goodneſs towards them, then grieve and break the Hearts of their Benefactors, by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Reflections and murmurings? But Charity enclines me to hope, that if any among us have unhappily blundered as aforeſaid, it is owing to their neglect of ſuitable Reflection, which when they come to exert, will either yeild them Satisfaction, or at leaſt conſtrain them to be ſilent.</p>
            <p>For my own Part, I freely and openly declare; that in my Opinion, there is not one Ornament more then is proper in this Structure; the Building is manly and plain, its chief Beauty is the Simplicity of the whole, and the juſt Proportion of its ſeveral Parts, which are enlivned by the exactneſs of the Workmanſhip, and a few Ornaments interſperſed, which are well deviſed, well executed, and well placed; without, which

A CHURCH is a Place peculiarly devoted to the Honour of GOD, or a Houſe for GOD and his Service by way of eminence or diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So that any Structure that is ſet apart for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe may in <hi>Truth.

The word CHURCH <hi>Ecleſia,</hi> in the new Teſtament, generally ſignifies a number of religious People conveend for Publick Worſhip, yet in ſome places particularly in (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The Doctrine of the Trinity, three Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial, co-equal, co-eternal and one God; or in other Words three Perſons, the ſame in Subſtance, equal in Power and Glory. <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin,</hi> both imputed and inherent, or the Guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> Sin in violating the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, as the Repreſentative and Covenant Head of his Poſterity, reckoned to them, and in Conſequence of this, their being born in a State of Corruption.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of Chriſts <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to the Juſtice of God, for the Sins of Men, by his Sufferings and Obedience. The Doctrine of <hi>Juſtification</hi> by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed, and received by Faith alone.

If the Doctrine of the Trinity be denyed, the Foundation of the Goſpel-plan of Salvation, by a Mediators Righteouſneſs ſeems to be overſet; for if there be but one Perſon how can he be ſuppoſed, without abſurdity, to ſatisfy himſelf? If Chriſt be not truly and properly God, how can he be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without Idolatry, or be reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to make an infinite Satisfaction?
