            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT the Trade of the Plantations is of the last Importance to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> is allowed of on all Hands; and to shew that it might be made much more beneficial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> especially with regard to these Northern Colonies, if properly directed, is the Intention of the following Observations; which I shall introduce with a short Paragraph or two from some late eminent Authors.</p>
            <p>
               <q>PROVIDING and encouraging of proper and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Employment and Manufacture for the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of a Country, and the suppressing of vicious Habits, and pernicious Trades, is the great End as well as great Art of Government; and according as the Governors of different Countries understand this Art, and apply it, so are the Circumstances, Trade and Wealth of these Countries. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Earth are like a Mine, which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it is wrought, yields Riches to all the different Countries in the World. Poverty and Want, Affluence and Riches, are only the Effects of the different Methods how Monarchs and States work here: And where those in a Government are not at due Pains to employ the Wisdom, Power and Authority of the Legislature, for encouraging the Labour of the People, and leading them into useful Trade and Manufactures, that Government lays no Foundation for its own Support, unhinges itself, and must soon totter into Destruction with the People.</q> And,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:006524_0004_10292EF3D666D918"/>
               <q>IT is the first and capital Concern of every valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Member of a Community, to promote the Interest thereof: His own Security, Peace and Happiness depend upon it; for, in Proportion as the Society flourishes or declines, in the very same Proportion must his own particular Interest, and that of his Family and Friends, increase or decay:</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A DUE and just Sense of this, and a warm and honest Inclination to fulfil the Dictates of this Sense, is what is properly and truly called <hi>Publick Spirit,</hi> the first and greatest of moral Vertues; without having a warm Feeling of which it is impossible to be an honest Man. That there is sometimes Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy in this, as there may be in regard to all other Vertues, cannot be denied: But how criminal soever this Hypocrisy may be in them that are guilty of it, yet it is a strong Argument in support of the Vertue itself; for the more Mischief a false Patriot is able to do, the more worthy, the more amiable, the more laudable is the Character of a true Citizen, who acts from the great and glorious Desire of doing Good to all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Put but a poor and languishing City under my Care, I will render it rich and flourishing,</hi> was a Saying of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> the <hi>Athenian;</hi> Which kind of Ability is what alone constitutes a great and able Politician.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed:</p>
            <p>OUR Southern Colonies are, I doubt, at their <hi>Ne plus ultra,</hi> if not upon the Decline; it cannot, I think, well be otherwise, considering the great Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our foreign Neighbours, <hi>French, Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> meet with; which, together with their own Parsimony, Industry and Liberty of Exportation to
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006524_0004_10292EF3D666D918"/>
such Markets as they think will best suit their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, will in a few Years enable them to out-strip us in every Article of the <hi>West-India</hi> Trade. Our Southern Colonies, besides, are so unhealthy and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to an <hi>English</hi> Constitution, that few go thither but with a View to return in a few Years with Estates; and no more People will go there, or continue there, than are necessary to raise the Commodities wanted, which are of so different a Nature from those of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that they can never interfere, and consequently can never give the least Umbrage.</p>
            <p>THE Northern Colonies open quite a different Scene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are healthy Climates, and are as yet but in their Infancy, and capable of the most extensive Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; they increase in People, and will increase. Men living in healthy Climates, paying easy or no Taxes, not molested with frequent Wars, must vastly increase by natural Generation.</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Halley</hi> observes, <q>That in Countries long settled, the Growth and Increase of Mankind, is not so much stinted by any Thing of the Nature of the Species, as it is from the cautious Difficulty most People make to adventure on the State of Marriage, from the Prospect of the Trouble and Charge of providing for a Family; nor are the poorer Sort of People to be blamed, since their Difficulty of subsisting, is occasioned by the unequal Distribution of Possessions, all being necessarily fed from the Ground, of which yet so few are Masters; so that besides themselves and Families, they are yet to work for those that own the Ground that feeds them, and of such does by very much the greater Part of Mankind consist; otherwise it is plain that there might well be four Times as many Births as we now find.</q>
            </p>
            <p>

BESIDES, many flow hither daily from our own Dominions, and from other Parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> Not less than seven Thousand Souls have been brought into <hi>Philadelphia</hi> this last Summer; and if I have been rightly informed, many Thousands have been brought in there yearly, for these many Years past. It has been computed that the Northern Colonies, taken one with another, double the Number of Inhabitants every thirty Years. If this is the Case, we shall soon become powerful States; and the more powerful we grow, still the more People will flock hither; and here is Room, Business, and full Employ for all, and Millions yet unborn. It is hard to determine about the present Number of Inhabitants upon this Continent: I have only been able to learn from a publick Paper, that the Number of the People in <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> taken by Order of the Government in 1738-9, were 43388 Whites, 39<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1 Blacks. By a like Order from Governor <hi>Morris</hi> in 1745, the Number of Whites amounted to 56797, and 4606 Blacks; and by an Increase in this Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior, the Inhabitants will be doubled in less than twenty four Years.</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Little</hi> supposes the Northern Colonies receive yearly to the Value of £. 600,000 in British Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures; and why may not we suppose this to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended at the Rate of, one with another, 20 <hi>s.</hi> a Head, which will amount to 600,000 Souls; and less I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is not, one with another, in these fourteen Colonies; those in 120 Years will be 9,600,000 Souls, and the Demands of the <hi>British</hi> Manufactures in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> £. 9,600,000; or rather none at all, if we are not very soon properly employed; and this can only be done by turning all Hands (by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Encouragement, not by coercive or restraining Laws) to the raising Naval Stores, and Ship-building. Of this, and this only, we are capable, and no Part
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006524_0005_10292EF5578A5630"/>
upon the Face of the Globe more so; we have all the Materials in great Perfection, Timber in Abundance, and good, and some perhaps better than what <hi>England,</hi> or any other Part of the World affords, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the red Cedar, and the Locusts, the Mulberry red and white, of an extraordinary quick Growth, and which may be brought into any Shape, and are much more durable than any Oak, especially in Places often wet and dry: Iron enough to supply the whole Universe, not at all inferior either to the <hi>Spanish</hi> or <hi>Swedish.</hi> And those very Flatts alone in the <hi>Mohawks</hi> Country, are sufficient to supply the Navy of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> with Hemp, for Ages to come. Hitherto our Hands have been chiefly employed in the raising and manufacturing of Wheat, which is indeed the only Thing we can call a Staple with us, every other Branch of Trade is but precarious, and even that is become pretty much so, and will be more and more so: The first Inducement to this Manufacture, was the Supply of our Southern Colonies, which for some Time did tolerably well; but as we have increased vastly, while they have been at a Stand, their Markets are overstock'd: Wheat I have seen at 3s 6d; and when at 3s. it is not worth the Labour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It has indeed bore a tolerable good Price since the Commencement of the War; but that has entirely been owing to the Supply given to our Enemies, who could not be supplied from <hi>Europe,</hi> and without which, had the War continued a Year longer, many of them would have been obliged to abandon their Settlements. And this leads me to a short, but I hope not an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Digression, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That if our <hi>British</hi> Parliament, in Case of a War, would think fit to enumerate every Species of Provisions, in the same Manner as Naval Stores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are enumerated, only during the War; it would distress our Enemies in <hi>America</hi> more effectually than by any other Method they can possibly think of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The greatest Obstruction you can put upon any Fleets
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006524_0006_10292EF85C31E540"/>
going home from <hi>America,</hi> is to prevent their being supplied with Provisions from the Continent, by Way of <hi>Coracoa,</hi> &amp;c. Nor should we have much to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend from any Attacks from <hi>Europe</hi> with their Fleets, as after such long Voyages there is an absolute Necessity for Refreshments, which cannot be had but from hence. This M. <hi>D' Anville</hi> found by fatal Experience; could he possibly have refreshed his Troops, he would have made great Havock along this Continent: Had he touched at <hi>New-York</hi> instead of <hi>Jebucta,</hi> he would have been Master of the Place in a few Hours; and a small Party from <hi>Canada</hi> at the same Time, might have been Masters of <hi>Albany</hi> in as little Time; by which Means they would have been possessed of <hi>Hudson'</hi>s River, the whole Furr Trade, and at the same Time the Command of many thousand fighting Indians, who would very soon have drove us all into the Sea. This is no Utopian Tale; the <hi>French</hi> know their Interest, and will pursue it first or last. It is true, we might have dislodged them, but at what an Expence I am not able to determine; or that ever we should be able to recover our Indians, is much to be doubted; and if ever the <hi>French</hi> become absolute Masters of the Indians, adieu to our <hi>English</hi> Settlements: And should they even attempt this and succeed, of which I make little doubt, if even at the Expence of a Million, they will be Gainers. This is a Point of no small Importance to the Publick, and with the Publick I leave it.</p>
            <p>Is it not high Time then, to think of securing, at least, our Northern Frontiers while the Peace lasts, which from all Appearances cannot be very long? The barbarous, unheard of, unprecedented Manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War there, ought to move Compassion in every human Breast; a Manner peculiar to the <hi>Canadians,</hi> of murdering Women, and Infants in their Cradles. In what Manner we are to set about it, I must leave
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006524_0006_10292EF85C31E540"/>
to better Judges to determine: From Assemblies, by Experience, we have little to hope for; their Distance from the Danger abates much of their Humanity and Concern; and their publick Spirit is in Proportion to their <hi>Res angusta domi,</hi> and Education. Some of them I have been told, in order to save the Expence of a Rat-Trap, have lost a great Part of their Winter Grain by that ravenous Tribe of out-landish Rats, which have lately infested this Country: No-Body here, I hope, will attempt a Parrallel. Were they, however, but as solicitous for the real Good of the Community, as they are about gratifying particular Resentments, and grasping at more Powers than may be consistent with a proper Ballance, which seems to be the two grand Points they have hitherto had in view, it would be happy for those they represent: While we can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our Purse-Strings, we are in no Danger from Power; but if in the Scramble we should lose that, whom shall we have to thank. I would not have it imagined here I mean any particular Assembly, no One therefore I hope will adopt it.</p>
            <p>WE are well assured, the <hi>French</hi> would hardly have been able to have fitted out a single Privateer this last War, had they not been supplied with war-like, as well as other Stores of all Kinds, from this Continent. Our Legislatures here are not, I doubt, fully authorized to prevent those Inconveniencies; and tho' some were willing, others in hopes, I presume, of making great Advantages, would decline it: Nothing therefore, but a <hi>British</hi> Parliament, can put this Affair upon a proper Footing.</p>
            <p>But to return:</p>
            <p>WHAT we have from the <hi>West-Indies</hi> for our Flour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beef and Pork, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is generally Rum, Sugar and Molasses; all consumed here; which, from a proper
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006524_0007_10292EFA014CFA30"/>
Use of Distilling, and Penals, we might as well be without. In some Parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in most Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> they hardly know what Rum and Molasses is; they are not, however, without both Spirits and Sweets from their own Produce. For my own Part, therefore, as we have Nothing from thence of a Staple, fit for Exportation, I cannot help thinking it would be more for the Advantage of the Community, to eat up our Flour at home, than to drink it out in a most pernicious Spirit from abroad. The little Trade however, we carry on with foreign Neighbours (for like the industrious Bee, no Stone is left unturn'd, or Port in <hi>America</hi> untried, to bring something home to the Hive, or in other Words to answer the Ballance due to <hi>Great-Britain</hi>) is what at present keeps Life and Soul together. But this cannot be called a Branch of Trade, being so precarious, and liable to so many Accidents; the Breath of a <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spanish</hi> Governor puts an End to it. Besides, its so severely crampt by the late Sugar Act, to very little other Purpose than that of distressing us in one considerable Article in our Returns, <hi>that is,</hi> we formerly used to supply the <hi>French</hi> &amp;c. with Lumber, Flour, Beef, Pork, Horses, and most kind of our Produce; for which we had in return, Sugars chiefly, which were carried to foreign Markets, and the Produce lodged in <hi>England:</hi> Those Sugars are now altogether in the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> our Competitors in this, as well as every other Branch of Trade, more especially in <hi>America.</hi>

At this Time they are collecting Materials with great Assiduity, and building Ships of War and Merchant Men in <hi>Quebec</hi> River. So much for our Wheat and Flour, which has hitherto employed most of our Hands. How usefully, or of what mighty Advantage it has been, or ever like to be to the Community, in regard to our Returns, I shall leave to others to determine.</p>
            <p>THE Furr Trade is in a great Measure engrossed by the <hi>French;</hi> a great Part of the Share we have in it is from them; which, together with Flax Seed, a late Branch of Trade, but precarious, as it is subject to Accidents of the Seasons, is all the visible Returns we have to make for the vast Importations from <hi>Europe;</hi> and both together, I doubt, will hardly defray the Expence of the Apparatus of our Tea Tables. As to our Beef and Butter, <hi>Ireland</hi> will ever cut us out in those two Articles; while there are any of those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities abroad in our Plantations, those from <hi>America</hi> don't go off. Our long and severe Winters keep our Cattle low, nor do they recover much before they are attacked by the intense Heat of our Summers, and a numerous Breed of Insects, which prevents their kindly Feeding.</p>
            <p>THIS, I think, is the present Situation of our Affairs; if I am mistaken, I shall be glad to be better informed. A Situation melancholly enough! Vast Numbers of People, and daily increasing, uselessly employed, which is the worst Sort of Employment. In Debt we are, and in Debt we must be, for those vast Importations from <hi>Europe:</hi> and as we increase, so will our Debts,

without, from the present Prospect of Things, ever being able to make suitable Returns; and of Course, we must become Bankrupts, unless relieved; and that soon, either from Necessity or Encouragement. Necessity, the great Mother of Invention, which has no Law, nor regards no Law, will, when we can be no longer trusted (which in a few Years will unavoidably be the Case) naturally lead us to interfere in the Manufactures of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and to supply ourselves as well as we can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How far, or how soon, this may be brought to any Degree of Perfection, with the Assistance of those Numbers of foreign Artificers, as well as those from our own Dominions, which daily arrive among us, both needy and ingenious; I shall not take upon me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine: I may however venture to affirm, the Thing is practicable; and where People in such Circumstances are numerous and free, they will push what they think is for their Interest, and all restraining Laws will be thought Oppression; especially such Laws, as according to the Conceptions we have of <hi>English Liberty,</hi> they have no Hand in the contriving or making.</p>
            <p>GIVE me leave here to mention, some such now in being; at least, we think them so, as well as some others of a more pernicious Tendency, with which, it is said, we are threatned. Enumerating our Produce, and confining it to one single Market, is a Solicism in Trade, and the Bane of Industry. Hats, tho' we live almost in the Center of the Furr Trade, we are prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to export, tho' made from those very refuge Furrs not fit for a foreign Market. By the Sugar Act, we are debarred trading with our foreign Neighbours, for Rum, Sugar or Molasses, which was a considerable Help to us in our Returns, as before observed. The high Duty upon Iron from these Colonies, is no small Discouragement, while Foreigners have Leave to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it Duty free, and in foreign Bottoms. <hi>Quere.</hi>

               </abbr> From an anonymous Writer upon Trade, (at least the Title Page of my Book is gone) in a Tract dedicated to Sir <hi>Robert Walpole,</hi> Pag. 77, says, <q>I have before observed, that some of these People (meaning the Northern Colonies) have manufactured some of their own Woollens and Linnens; to prevent the Increase of which, first, with Regard to weaving Woollen and Linnen, let an exact Account be taken of all Looms now erected in the Plantations, and likewise a Register of all Persons now employed, <abbr>

                  </abbr> Such as now get their Living by weaving; that for the Future, no other or more Looms be tolerated, nor any other Persons be allowed to follow, occupy or possess, the Privilege of weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but such as are now living, and follow the said Employment, in all the Plantations respectively. In regard to Rope-making, they should not be allowed to make above a Six-Inch Rope. 2<hi>dly,</hi> As to what regards the Iron Manufacture, let them be restrained from making Anchors for Shipping, which weigh above a Hundred and Twelve Pounds; from making all Manner of Ordnance, or Great Guns, or even Shot for such; and from making any Fusees, Muskets or Pistols; in short, all sorts of Fire-Arms and Swords, as also all Manner of Locks, and Joint Hinges, with all Manner of Tools for Artificers; as Carpenters, Sawyers, Joyners, Bricklayers, and all Sadlery and Cutlery Iron-work, together with all sorts of Nails, less than Weight-Nails, Horse-Nails only excepted: But let them not be deprived (I have hardly Patience to go on) of mending any of the aforesaid Utensils.</q> And in Page 80, after a good deal more of the like Stuff, he condescends to soften Matters, by telling that great Man, <q>With regard to Stockings, if they are deprived of Weaving and Looms, as is proposed, it would surely seem hard, to deprive them of Knitting, &amp;c,</q> And even the noted Mr. <hi>Gee,</hi> in his Discourse

            <p>SHOULD the Government at any Time think fit to take these Gentlemen's Advice, I shall not take upon me to say, what the Consequences might be; this however I will lay down for a Maxim, and I have it from a very good Hand, that <hi>Liberty and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are the Basis of Colonies;</hi> the one carries them thither, and the other keeps them together when they are there; and Violence and oppressive Laws will put an End to both. Of the first, we are thankfully to acknowledge the great Share we have enjoyed; an equal Share of the latter, will make us a happy People, and useful Subjects. The several Notices taken of this Affair, both by the King, Lords and Commons, and of Consequence, the Directions from Time to Time from the Lords of Trade, to the several Governors, hitherto to very little Purpose, to know in what Shape we might be usefully diverted from interfering in the Manufactures of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> are happy Omens, and shew a favourable Disposition in the Government. As there seems nothing then wanting but a proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, it is to be hoped, every Man that has the least Regard to his own Welfare, and that of his Country, and Posterity, or who has ever seriously reflected on the moral Obligation every Individual is under, of adhering to, and promoting the Interest of the Society in which he live, and of which he is a Member; will contribute, either by his Advice or otherwise, every Thing in his Power, to so good a Design. In Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, I shall humbly offer my Sentiments, with this only Request, <hi>Si quid novisti rectius, candidus imperti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:006524_0009_10292EFE550A17D8"/>
IT has been before observed, that these Colonies are capable of supplying the Navigation of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> both Navy and Merchants, with every Thing, and Article wanted, equally good with what they have from other Parts of the World, and that at an infinite less Expence, as it will cost them nothing but the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of their own Produce for us.</p>
            <p>I THEREFORE would humbly propose, That each of the Northern Colonies be encouraged to build and send home, a Capital Ship, or two, yearly, according to their Abilities, altogether from their own Produce, ballasted with Pig or Bar Iron, Pitch, Tar, Turpentine; loaden with Timber of all Sorts and Demensions, Masts, Spars, Bark, Pot-Ash, and Salt-Petre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I would the rather chuse this Method, because there will be an immediate, a constant, and continued Demand. That of running up a Merchant Ship now and then, from green Timber, is of no Consequence or Advantage, but rather the Contrary, as it gives our Timber a bad Character. The common Method is, a Merchant or a Factor brings in, or sends a Cargoe; a Ship of such and such Demensions is bespoke; the Carpenters hurry into the Woods, and she is run up as fast as their Hands can, and there is no more Thought of building till another Cargo or another Order comes; what less then can be expected? Whereas that of building Ships of War, will give immediate Encouragement for raising, and bringing into a general Magazine, all kinds of Naval Stores; and this continued for a few Years, will turn most of our Hands that Way, and when once set a-going, it will be no difficult Matter to keep them a-going; their own Interest will lead them on; and as we increase in Numbers, great Stocks of Timber and Naval Stores will be laid up, and in all Probability we shall be able, (capable I am sure we are) to supply <hi>Europe</hi> with Ships of all kinds. This will reduce the Price of Freight; an
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006524_0010_10292F0004CA93E8"/>
Article which all our Rivals in Trade have long laboured to bring about in their own Favour.</p>
            <p>That a Fund, equal to that expended in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> for the Building such Ship or Ships, be lodged in each respective Colony for that Purpose, and in such Hands, as the Governor and Council shall think proper; giving at the same Time Security, That all Payments be made, after a fair Perusal of Vouchers, by Warrant from the Governor in Council. By lodging a Fund in this Manner, and for these Purposes, the Government can run no Manner of Risque; because, I presume, it will be put into the Hands of the most substantial Merchants and Freeholders, who will become Security for one another; and as no Part of it is to issue, but by Warrant from the Governor and Council, after a careful Perusal of Vouchers, upon a Certificate from the Overseers, or proper Officers of the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines, for Work done, or Stores lodged; it will remain safely in their Hands, till the Whole is expended: And even then, it will every Shilling return to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> from whence it came, together with the Effects: Could we persuade the People of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> of the Truth of this, it must convince them at what an easy Rate they may procure the Effects and Produce of our Labour, in Materials so essentially necessary to their Prosperity and Well-Being, which are now had from Foreigners in a very different Manner. The Accounts to be made up quarterly, audited and transmitted.</p>
            <p>That proper Persons from his Majesty's Yards be appointed to reside for some Time in every County, who are to instruct the People as to the Quantity, Quality and Dimensions of such Timber, and other Kinds of Naval Stores, as will best answer the Purpose; This they will soon learn, and it will be of great Use, as those at a Distance from Rivers may employ all their Hands during the Snow; all which to be immediately paid for, and lodged in proper Yards for his Majesty's</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:006524_0010_10292F0004CA93E8"/>
That some of those be also appointed to direct the Building: A Detachment of those superanuated, as I understand, by a late Order none are admitted into his Majesty's Yards above Forty or under Twenty, would be of mighty Use upon this Occasion. Our own People are all dextrous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ax-Men, being used to it from their Infancy. By this Means, as we increase in Numbers, great Stocks will be laid up. In Mills we abound.</p>
            <p>That some Persons of Skill be appointed to direct the Manufacture of Pot-Ash, and for collecting and manufacturing Salt-petre, of which, it is said, there is an inexhaustable Fund in the <hi>Mohawks</hi> Country, from the Dung of those innumerable Flocks of wild Pigeons which breed there.</p>
            <p>That proper Persons be appointed to collect Bark, by which Means great Quantities of <hi>English</hi> Timber may be saved. By the Statute they are obliged to cut their Timber about the End of <hi>April,</hi> for the Sake of the Bark, which it is generally agreed hurts the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and may be one Reason why foreign Timber is so much better (as will hereafter appear) than <hi>English</hi> Timber; whereas cut about Mid-Winter, or at a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Season, it proves immortal; for which Reason many Speculations have been offered for other Methods of Tanning; witness the Premium in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the Person who shall effectually tan the greatest Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Hides with Tormantile Roots, before <hi>May</hi> 1749, £. 10.</p>
            <p>That proper Persons direct the preparing Pitch and Tar from the Tree; hitherto it has only been from the Knots, at least in this Province, which is but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious. Pity it is, that that Scheme concerted by the Lord <hi>Godolphin,</hi> had not succeeded in 1710; three Thousand Souls of Palatines were sent over at a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Expence, which was to be reimbursed from their Labour in Naval Stores. General <hi>Hunter</hi> had
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006524_0011_10292F0638907BE8"/>
the Direction of the Whole; I was a Witness of the indefatigable Pains he took, and had some Share in the Fatigue; they were settled upon the Mannor of <hi>Livingston,</hi> near a Forrest of Pitch Pine Trees, in order for preparing them for Pitch and Tar; but unfortunately there was not one of them, nor any One in the Country, knew any Thing of the Matter; which together with a Change of the Ministry at that Time, put an End to a very good Project.</p>
            <p>That Magazines be erected in every County, fit to receive Naval Stores, at the same Time, provided with such of the Manufactures of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as the Country, either from Necessity or Choice, seem most likely to fall into. By this Means, they would very probably soon find out the Difference of labouring almost a whole Year about a Field of Wheat, for a precarious Market, and that of raising Naval Stores for ready Money, or such Necessaries as they want, much cheaper, and much better than they can possibly make them. It is common with the Country People, to carry Wheat to the Country Stores, for such Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries as they want in their Families; a proportionable Quantity of Hemp would surely answer much better, as it is easily carried, soon weighed and thrown by: Besides, those Store-Keepers generally put their own Prices upon the Wheat; whereas, the Price of Hemp will be fixed according to its Quality; by which Means it will be equal to ready Money in every Shop in Town or Country, as proper Officers may be obliged to take it off their Hands, at the stated Price; and if those <hi>British</hi> Magazine Manufactures, were even carried into every Nation of the <hi>Indians,</hi> I cannot help thinking, but that it would be of great Advantage to the Publick, whether carried on by the Publick, or by a Corporation with a joint Stock: Nor can I think any Inconveniency would attend, the converting the whole County Taxes and Quit-Rents into Hemp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I mean, making it
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006524_0011_10292F0638907BE8"/>
a Tender. There are few or none of our Farmers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but raise more or less of this Commodity for their own Use, perhaps only by Dew-Rotting; but with a few Directions, it cannot be doubted, that they will soon fall into the other Method: Rotting of it under the Snow, I am told is the best Way.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as I have been told, they raise a Ton of Hemp from an Acre of good Land; and I am credibly informed, from the Low-Lands in the <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seys,</hi> they raise 30 Hundred. Now, I will venture to affirm, there is at least of Low-Land, and Up-Land contiguous, 20,000 Acres upon the <hi>Mohawks</hi> River, as good for Hemp as any in the World. Here then is 20,000 Tons of Hemp yearly, for the Use of the Navy; and they may have 20,000 Tons more from other Parts in this Government, if wanted.</p>
            <p>It is to be observed, that during almost four Months in the Year, that is, during the Severity of our Winters, all Labour is at a Stand; which is a mighty Hardship upon the Poor, and which will ever keep up the Price of Labour: A Tradesman or Labourer must live, and of Course must charge during the eight Months he is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, one third more, to support himself and Family, during the four Months in which he cannot be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; such is the Case as we are at present circumstanced. But being properly encouraged in the raising Naval Stores, will be an effectual Remedy for this Evil. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Thousands, Men, Women, and Children, old and young, may, under proper Covers, with Stoves, be employed in the Manufacture of Hemp, Sail-Cloth, Linnen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> during that Season, which would give great Relief to the Poor, and an Advantage to the Publick; and those in the Country, may be fully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in bringing Ship-Timber, Masts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Water Side, and Logs for Deal and Plank, to the Mills.</p>
            <p>That all Duties be taken off Colony Iron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and laid upon foreign Iron. By a modest Computation, this
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006524_0012_10292F07C06541E0"/>
Article alone, carries out of <hi>England,</hi> at least £. 200,000 yearly in Cash, which never returns in any Shape; besides that of its being imported in foreign Bottoms, if I am not mistaken: Whereas, from us they may have it by Way of Ballast, at an infinite less Expence.</p>
            <p>That proper Sloops or Flats, be purchased or built for his Majesty's Use, to collect such Naval Stores as may be brought to the several Creeks or Landings, during the Sleying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Time: This will greatly encourage such as live out of the Way of common Navigation, and may not be able, even with the Assistance of our common Sloops, whose Compliment seldom exceed that of a Man and Boy, to take in such heavy Timber as they may be able to bring to the Water Side on their Sleys during the Winter Season.</p>
            <p>That £. 50 yearly, be paid out of the Quit-Rents, to the Town or Precinct, which brings to the general Magazine, the greatest Quantity of well prepared Pitch and Tar from the Tree, upon Oath.</p>
            <p>The same to such as bring in the largest Quantity of Hemp, well prepared; and so in Proportion for other Articles.</p>
            <p>That proper Encouragement, as in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> be given to such as excel in any of the Articles of Naval Stores, Pot-Ash, Salt-Petre, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That all Master-Workmen, and Overseers of Work, be obliged to keep a Journal, especially such as reside in the several Counties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all Occurrences; giving an Account how they succeed, or are like to succeed; on Account of the Nature of our Timber; what Obstruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they meet with, and how to be remedied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which to be transmitted with the Accounts quarterly.</p>
            <p>That every Master-Workman and Overseer, after three Years Service in the Country, be intitled to 500 Acres of Land, without paying any Fees, and cleared of all Taxes, military or civil Services for seven Years, and the under Artificers be likewise duly encouraged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:006524_0012_10292F07C06541E0"/>
That a Duty of <hi>One Shilling,</hi> be laid on every Barrel of Flour and Bread exported, and <hi>One Shilling</hi> upon every Barrel of Beef, Pork, &amp;c. as a Fund for the Encouragement of the Importation of Artificers versed in the Manufacture of Naval Stores, and for binding out Apprentices.</p>
            <p>That no Vessel built in the Province, be liable to the above Duties, or any Tonnage, or other incumbrances from Acts of Assembly; provided that the Sails, Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and Iron Work, be likewise of the Produce and Manufacture of this Colony.</p>
            <p>I DO not mean here, to put the least Discouragement upon that grand Article of our Trade, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the raising and manufacturing our Wheat; to encourage Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building among our selves, in order to prevent Strangers from engrossing our Ship Freights, to the no small Loss to the Province, is all that is meant.</p>
            <p>I CANNOT however help thinking, that if all our Hands are to be continually this Way employed, but that it will in a Number of Years, become its own Executioner, unless we do as the <hi>Dutch</hi> do with their Spices, burn one Half of it.</p>
            <p>AND whereas in the Infancy of Times here, many Persons took up large Tracts of Land, chiefly along the Rivers, paying little or no Acknowledgement to his Majesty; (one now-a-Days, possess'd of 500 Acres, pays more to his Majesty, than some of those possess'd of 100,000;) and those Possessors, either from Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or a View of disposing of them in Time to great Advantage, have, in a great Measure, neglected the improving of them, and absolutely refuse to fell; which has been of great Prejudice to the settling and improving of this Colony. Now, left they should take into their Heads, to think in the same Manner, in Relation to their Timber, &amp;c. I would have it enacted, That the Officers appointed to reside in the several Counties, be fully impowered to cut and carry away, with free Egress
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006524_0013_10292F094325EC68"/>
and Regress<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all such Timber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as may be tho't fit for the Use of his Majesty's Navy, being first valued by two of the nighest Neighbours, nominated and appointed by such Justice of the Peace as the said Officers shall apply to, with a Penalty for Neglect of Compliance.</p>
            <p>That proper Encouragement be given to the Whale Fishery, which I am confident would answer, from the many Accounts I have had from Masters of Vessels, who, in coming upon this Coast early in the Spring, with much ado are able to steer clear of them. That the Sturgeon Fishery would turn to good Account, I make no Doubt.</p>
            <p>THUS have I delivered my Opinion according to the best of my Knowledge, and hope, and sincerely wish, every Member of the Community, capable of Reflection on our present or future Circumstances, will duly weigh and consider it, and either add, alter or diminish, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his better Judgment, or substitute Something in its Place; for most certain it is, unless our Hands are turned to something else, than what they are at present about, we must become lower than the lowest of his Majesty's Colonies, even than <hi>North Carolina</hi> it self; useless to ourselves, and a Burthen, if not an Eye-fore to <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> The sorry Figure we have hitherto made in the Revenue Accounts at home, is, I believe, one Reason why we have hitherto been so little taken Notice of. I do not indeed believe, all the Duties paid to the Crown from our own Produce, for these Fifty Years past, would defray the Charge of one Year's Expence of the four Companies posted here, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Fifty Years, for our Protection, together with a Ship of War, and sometimes two. What Duties are paid at home for the Goods we consume, I can make no Estimate: Let us however, by all the Means in our Power, make the People of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> sensible of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006524_0013_10292F094325EC68"/>
what we are capable, even at the Expence of sending home proper Persons for that Purpose. They have generally but a very vague Idea of these Colonies; one very general is, I think, that of keeping us under, and poor, in order the better to keep up our Dependance: How well judged shall be hereafter considered; most certain it is, however, if we were so happy as to have a Ballance in our Favour, as the People in the Southern Colonies have, that we should just do as they do, that is, send our Children home for their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; have all the Necessaries, as well as the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of Life, from that Fund; few Families would be without one or two <hi>English</hi> Suits for themselves, Sons and Daughters: And as we are at least ten to one, and many Degrees colder, we should take off a hundred Times more of the Woollen Manufactures, and so in Proportion as we increase. Whereas, at present, look into what Country House you please, on a working Day, either in this Province, <hi>Jerseys,</hi> or <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and you will there see every one of the Family, well and warmly cloathed in Home-spun from their own Produce, both with Woollen and Linnen.</p>
            <p>WE have here our Woollen Counties as well as they have in <hi>England: Long-Island, Gardner's-Island, Martha's-Vineyard</hi> and <hi>Nantucket,</hi> raise vast Numbers of Sheep, as does <hi>Monmouth</hi> County in <hi>New-Jersey,</hi> where they make very considerable Improvements: And there are very few Persons of any Standing, but what raise more or less for this Purpose chiefly.</p>
            <p>THAT of Bounties, upon the present Footing, I think from a long Experience we may conclude, have little or no Meaning; they are tedious to come at, and often not worth the Soliciting. Will any Farmer raise a hundred Weight of Hemp, be it more or less, or a Barrel of Tar, with a View to the Bounty in <hi>England?</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:006524_0014_10292F0C7783C2F0"/>
Surely not: Whereas, if when lodged in proper Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines, or Ware-houses upon the Spot, by the Raiser or Manufacturer, upon Oath, the Bounty was to be paid, and he or they afterwards had the Liberty of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of it to the best Advantage, Bounties might probably answer. But by building Ships of War, the Intention can never fail; because there will be a constant Demand for all the Articles of Naval Stores, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Manner of Use for continuing the Bounties.</p>
            <p>IN the Execution of a Scheme of this Kind, it is not to be doubted, but that many Rubs and Obstructions will offer, perhaps from a weak Representation of the Nature and State of the Case, or from Inattention in those in whose Hands the Interest of the Publick is lodged, who seldom care to enter into expensive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which their Predecessors have either neglected or over-looked. From the <hi>Russia</hi> and other Companies, who engross the Northern and East Country Trade, we must expect no small Opposition. Our Materials, with great Injustice, have hitherto been represented, either from Ignorance or Prejudice, insufficient both as to Quality and Quantity; and it is much to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, those Prejudices will be continued, from the vast Influences those great Bodies or Companies, must have upon the publick Affairs.</p>
            <p>IN the Debates upon the Sugar-Act, all that could be said in our Favour, had very little Weight. We have been represented of no Manner of Consequence to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> when put in Competition with the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Colonies; at present, indeed, not without a good deal of Reason, as they are daily throwing in vast Sums to the Revenue, while we are daily substracting more or less: Nay, I have heard, that it is even a Doubt with some of our grave Politicians, whether <hi>Great-Britain</hi> had not better be without those Northern
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006524_0014_10292F0C7783C2F0"/>
Colonies altogether; with whom I readily join in the Affirmative, if they are not put under a proper Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement.</p>
            <p>I SHALL here beg Leave to insert an Extract from Mr. <hi>Pepys</hi> (Secretary to the Admiralty) his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs; which, as it is a Piece not commonly to be met with, it may in some Measure amuse the Curious, and at the same Time, shew the absolute Necessity there ever has been, and ever like to be, for the Use of foreign Timber, in the Service of the Navy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I once more do affirm, may be had from hence, equally as good to all Intents and Purposes, as any they ever had, or can have, from any other Part of the World; and Pity it is, they had not thought of us at the Time of the Report.</p>

                        <head>RESOLUTIONS taken at a Conference held at the Office of the Navy, April 17th, 1686, between his Majesty's Commissioners there, and us the under-written Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights, upon Enquiries then proposed by the Secretary of the Admiralty, on the Behalf of his Majesty, touching the present Condition of this Kingdom, in Reference to Plank for Ship-building.</head>

                           <hi>Enquiry</hi> 1. How far it may be depended on, that <hi>England</hi> may at this Day supply itself with a sufficiency of that Commodity, for answering the Occasions both of the Merchants and his Majesty's Service (in the State the Royal Navy now is) without foreign Helps?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resolution.</hi> That it is in no wise to be relied on: Forasmuch as from the Want of Plank of our own Growth, and consequently the Highness of the Price of what we have, the Shipwrights of this Kingdom (even in our Out-Ports, as well as in the River of <hi>Thames</hi>) have been for many Years past, driven to resort to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from abroad, and are so at this Day, to the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning their spending of one Hundred Loads of foreign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           <pb n="24" facs="unknown:006524_0015_10292F0F81B7E930"/>
for every Twenty of <hi>English.</hi> Besides, were our own Stock more, the Exclusion of foreign Goods would soon render the Charge of Building insupportable, by raising the Price of the Commodity to double what it is, and more, at the Pleasure of the Seller.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Enquiry</hi> 2. From whence is the best foreign Plank understood to be brought?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resolution.</hi> Either out of the East Sea, from <hi>Dantzick, Quinborough</hi> or <hi>Riga;</hi> of the Growth of <hi>Poland,</hi> and <hi>Prussia;</hi> or from <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> namely that sort thereof, which is shipped from thence, of the Growth of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> distinguished by its Colour, as being much more black than the other, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered so (as is said) by its long sobbing in the Water during its Passage thither.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Enquiry</hi> 3. What Proportion this foreign Plank may be reckoned to bear to the <hi>English?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Resolution.</hi> For so much as concerns smaller Vessels, of Four-score Tons downwards, whose Works call for not more than Two-Inch Plank, of Twenty Foot long at the Highest, meeting at thirteen and fourteen Inches in Breadth, our <hi>English</hi> Plank will (from the Nature of the Wood) last longer than any foreign of the same Dimensions. But for Ships of three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Tons upwards, which requires the Service of three or four-Inch Plank, from Twenty-six to Forty Foot long, meeting at fourteen or fifteen Inches Breadth at the top End; universal Practice shews, that the white Crown Plank of <hi>Prussia,</hi> and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned black of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> do in their Durableness equal, or rather exceed that of our <hi>English</hi> Production of the like Dimensions; which we conceive to arise from this plain Reason, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> That the foreign Oak being of much quicker Growth than ours, their Trees arrive at a Stature capable of yielding Plank of these Measures, while they are yet in their sound and vigorous State of growing; whereas that of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006524_0015_10292F0F81B7E930"/>
                           <hi>England,</hi> advancing in its Growth more slowly, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives not at these Dimensions, 'till it become to, or rather is past the full of its Strength; Fifty Years sufficing for raising the foreign, to what the <hi>English</hi> will not be brought in a Hundred and Fifty: But whether we are right or not in this Reasoning, it is upon daily Experience most evident, that our <hi>East-India,</hi> and other Ships of greatest Burthen, built with this large foreign Plank, well chosen, prove in their Durableness without Exception; variety of Instances lying before us of Ships built wholly of <hi>English</hi> Stuff, (as well in his Majesty's Yards as Merchants) which have perished in half the Time, others of the like Burthen composed wholly of foreign, have been observed to do: Also it is, that the <hi>English</hi> Plank of short Lengths, cut out of young growing Timber, is manifesty better than East Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and therefore is preferred thereto in laying of a Gun Deck, as far as the three Streaks next the Ship's Sides, where short Stuff will serve, (the Quality of its Wood bearing better with being kept wet and dry, as it generally is in that Place;) yet where, (upon the same Gun Deck) long Plank is necessary, that of foreign Growth is, for Strength and Duration, always preferred, from the Reason, as we conceive, before given, namely, that of its being cut while in its Vigour, which the <hi>English</hi> will not admit, so as to bear those Scantlings; and to this is to be further added, the general Waniness, want of Breadth at the top End, and ill Method of Conversion of our <hi>English</hi> Plank; daily Practice shewing, that Twenty Loads of foreign, shall, in working, go further upon a Ship's Side or Deck, than a Hundred Loads of like Lengths of <hi>English,</hi> after its Wanes, and other Defects shall be cut away.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it is yet to be noted, that in planking of a Ship with foreign Plank, the Builder shall not
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006524_0016_10292F1436647810"/>
be driven to put in above three or four Pieces; whereas in a like Ship, done with <hi>English,</hi> he shall be obliged to use a Hundred, to the no less Impairment of the Strength of the Work, then Increase of its Charge, both in Stuff and Labour; so that upon the Whole, our unanimous Opinion is, that large Plank well chosen, of the foreign Growths before mentioned, is, in its Service, at least as durable, in its Cost less chargeable, and the Use of it, through the Scarcity of <hi>English,</hi> become at this Day indispensable.</p>

            <p>FROM hence I would only infer, that if these Colonies had been taken into the Case, at any proper Period of Time, how many Millions might have been saved to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and what a flourishing People should we have been at this Day; and should we be so happy as to have this past Error speedily mended, what a flourishing People we may in Time still be; of which <hi>Great-Britain</hi> will reap the Advantage: Because, it is infallibly true, that whatever Wealth the Plantations gain, by any Article of Trade that doth not directly interfere with the Trade of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> is so much Gain to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> since every such Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition is sure to center there at last; and therefore, it is the Interest of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to encourage and promote the Industry and Labour of the Plantations; which never fails to increase the Wealth and Power of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and is the Case of all distant Provinces, with respect to their Mother Countries, which always increase in Power in Proportion as their Colonies nourish.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:006524_0018_10292F17413EB9C0"/>
IN Opposition to this, some of our judicious Essay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Writers upon Trade, have represented, that the most effectual Way to keep up our Dependance, is to keep us low and poor; that is to say, in their own Words, or something very like them, to deprive us of making Use of those Means which Providence has been pleased to put into our Hands, for the Ease and Comfort of Life, from what we raise and manufacture from our own Produce and Labour; for that which can be raised for us in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> without the Goodness of putting us in the Way, or telling us how we shall ever be able to pay for those Necessaries.</p>
            <p>IN Answer to which, I shall only beg Leave to Subjoin some few Observations from the famous Mr. <hi>Trenchard,</hi> upon this Subject, who seems to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood it better than all of them together.</p>
            <q>
               <floatingText xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>
                     <div type="observations">
                        <p>THE other Sort of Colonies are for Trade, and intended to increase the Wealth and Power of the native Kingdom; which they will abundantly do if managed prudently, and put and kept under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Regulations. Now Colonies planted in proper Climates, and kept to their proper Business, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly do this. Our Northern Colonies do, or may, if encouraged, supply us with Timber, Hemp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iron and other Metals; and indeed may supply us with most or all the Materials of Navigation, and our Neighbours too through our Hands; and by that Means settle a solid Power in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> not precarious and subject to Disappointments, and the Caprice of our Neighbours; which Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would make us soon Masters of most of the Trade of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I WOULD not suggest such a Thought, as that any of our Colonies, when they grow stronger, should
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006524_0019_10292F18CE46C900"/>
ever attempt to wean themselves from us: However I cannot think too much Care can be taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, and to preserve their Dependencies upon their Mother Country. It is not to be hoped, in the corrupt State of human Nature, that any Nation will be subject to another, any longer than it finds its Account in it, and cannot help itself. Every Man's first Thought will be for himself, and his own Interest, and he will not be long to seek for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to justify his being so, when he knows how to attain what he proposes. Men will think it hard to work, toil, and run Hazards for the Advantages of others, any longer than they find their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in it, and especially for these who use them ill.</p>
                        <p>No Creature suck the Teats of their Dams longer than they draw Milk from thence, or can provide themselves with better Food; nor will any Country continue their Subjection to another, only because their Great Grand Mothers were acquainted. This is the Course of all human Affairs, and all wise States will ever have it before their Eyes; and will consider therefore how to preserve the Advantages arising from Colonies, and avoid the Evils; and I conceive there can be but two Ways in Nature to hinder them from throwing off their Dependance; the One to keep it out of their Power, and the other out of their Will: The first must be by Force, and the latter by using them well, and keeping them em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in such Productions, and making such Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, as will support themselves and Families comfortably, and get Wealth too, or at least, not prejudice their Mother Country. Force can never be used effectually to answer this End, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the Colonies themselves; Liberty and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement are necessary to carry People thither, and to keep them together when they are there,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006524_0019_10292F18CE46C900"/>
and Violence will hinder both. Any Body of Troops considerable enough to awe them, and keep them in Subjection ****************************** will soon put an End to all planting, and leave the Country to the Soldiers alone; and if they did not, would eat up all the Profit of the Colony. For this Reason, arbitrary Countries have not been equally successful in planting Colonies, with free Ones; and what they have done in that Kind, has either been by Force, at a vast Expence, or departing from the Nature of their Government, and giving Privilege to Planters, which were denied to their own Subjects: And I dare say, a few prudent Laws, and a little prudent Conduct, would soon give us far the greatest Share of the Riches of all <hi>America,</hi> and perhaps, drive many of other Nations out of it, or unto our Colonies for Shelter: If Violence, or Methods tending to Violence, are not used to prevent it, our Northern Colonies must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly increase in People, Wealth and Power; vast Numbers every Day flow thither—because they have Lands given them for tilling.</p>
                        <p>AND there are so many Exigencies in all States, so many foreign Wars, and domestick Disturbances, that they can never want Opportunities, if they watch for them, to do what they shall find their Interest to do; and therefore we ought to take all the Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in our Power, that it shall not be their Interest to act against that of their native Country; and that can only be done, by keeping them fully employed in such Trades as will increase their own, as well as our Wealth: For it is much to be feared, if we do not find Employment for them, they may find it for us. No two Nations, no two Bodies of Men, or scarce two Men, can long continue in their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, without having some Cement of their Unions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           <pb n="34" facs="unknown:006524_0020_10292F1C04FC0FE0"/>
and where Relation, Acquaintance, or mutual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure are wanting, mutual Interests alone can bind it: But when those Interests separate, each Side must assuredly pursue its own. The Interest of Colonies is often to wean themselves, and is always so, when they no longer want Protection; and when they can em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themselves more advantageously, than in supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Materials of Traffick to others; and the Interest of the Mother Country, is always to keep them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and so employed, and it requires all their Address to do it; and it is certainly more easily and effectually done, by gentle and insensible Methods, than by Power alone. Men will always think they have a Right to Air, Earth and Water, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themselves for their own Support, to live by their own Labours, and to apply the Gifts of God to their own Benefit; and in order to it, to make the best of their Soil, and to work up their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; and when this cannot be done without Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to their Mother Country, there can be but one fair, honest, and indeed, effectual Way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, which is, to divert them upon other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, as advantageous to themselves, and more so to their Employers; that is, in raising such Growth, and making such Manufactures, as will not prejudice their own, or at least, in no Degree equal to the Advantage they bring; and when such Commodities are raised or made, they ought not to be forced to find out other Markets by Stealth, or upon throwing themselves upon new Protections. Whilst People have a full Employment, and can maintain themselves comfortably in a Way they have been used to, they will never seek after a new One, especially when they meet with Encouragement in one, and are discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced in the other; as without this Conduct, Colonies must be mischievous to their Mother Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for the Reasons before given; so with it, the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006524_0020_10292F1C04FC0FE0"/>
greatest Part of the Wealth they acquire, centers there; for all their Productions, are so many Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations of our Power and Riches, as they are Returns of the People's Labour, the Rewards of Merchants, or Increase of Navigation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without which, all who are sent abroad, are a dead Loss to their Country, and as useless as dead, and the more so, if they become Enemies; for we can send no Commodities to them, unless they have others to exchange for them, and such as we find our Interest in taking: But our Northern Colonies are healthy Climates, and can raise all, or most of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which our own Country produces; and without the former Precautions, must, by the natural Course of human Affairs, interfere with most Branches of our Trade, work up our best Manufactures, and, at last grow too powerful and unruly, to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned for our Interest only; and therefore, since the Way lies open to us, to prevent so much Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, to do so much Good, and add so much Wealth and Power to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> by making those Countries the Magazines of our Naval Stores; I hope we shall not lose all these Advantages, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to the Interests of a few private Gentlemen, or even to a few Counties.</p>

Beggars, grown by habitual Wretchedness, so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that, tho' sensible of the Smart, they were not ashamed to prefer Hunger and Idleness, to Labour and Competency.

Already the little Town has undergone a wonderful Change; for whereas in 1735, it contained at most but fifty Houses, many of them fit only for Beggars; it now contains one Hundred and Seventeen, whose Inhabitants are fully employed, and take Pleasure in being so. This is true Patriotism and Policy united: <hi>Carpere vel noli nostra, vel ede tua.</hi>
