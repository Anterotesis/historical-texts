            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> concerted Laws, and afford the desired Success, unto all their mature Debates, and wise Administrations; and therefore they looked upon it as their incumbent Duty, to improve some Part of this Day of the Gladness of their Hearts, because of their valuable, and distinguishing Priviledges, in Acts of Religious Worship, humbly, and earnestly, to ask the Divine Direction and Blessing, and meekly to receive Counsel from the Sacred Oracles, as in the particular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections

            <p>Thro' the tender Mercy of the most High to us, (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Revolutions have been brought upon the Form of the Government, since the first founding the <hi>British</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in this distant Part of the World,) we are yet in the full Possession, not only of all the Priviledges which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>Englishmen,</hi> as the happy Subjects of <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> but over &amp; above, of such peculiarly valuable Ones, (and it may be of all that our Circumstances would bear of the former,) confirmed to us, by a Royal CHARTER, from the ever memorable King <hi>William,</hi> as sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it of us to go on, in imitating the laudable Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our pious Ancesto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I am very sensible, the Times, we are fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, are attended with such peculiar Circumstances, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it very difficult to speak out some necessary Truths, with any Certainty, and Plainness, without being liable to the severe Censure of such as may possibly think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too nearly concerned in them, or the more feeble Exceptions of little Wit lings, who will attempt to criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize upon what they scarce understand. However I trust I shall not be so unfaithful to your <hi>Excellency,</hi> and the honourable <hi>Board,</hi> and much less so to my great Master, to whom I must be accountable, as to forbear expressing myself, upon the Subject before me, as becomes my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and the Place I stand in, at this critical Juncture,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003745_0006_100255CE906C50B0"/>
according to the best Light I shall receive from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Truth; at which I am sure no one ought to be offended.</p>
            <p>The Words I have read, for the Foundation of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Discourse, are enrolled among the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the great and the wise King of <hi>Israel.</hi> And because we have here the Sentiments of one so renowned for Wisdom, beyond all that went before him, or have come after him, we may reasonably expect to find in these few Words the true <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> the deepest Mysteries, and the best Policies, by which a Government stands firm, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken, as a Rock, against the Roaring of the Sea, and the Dashing of its Waves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Throne is established by Righteousness.</hi> Tho' we are not to expect much of Connection and Dependance, among Adages, yet we may observe some considerable Relation between several <hi>verses,</hi> in my <hi>Context,</hi> in which the royal Teacher lays down his Aphorisms about Kings, and the Thrones which they sit on; wherein he rather gives Direction, than recites an History, and more truly informs them what they ought to be, than what they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways are; and so places the most beautiful Picture, in full View before them, to excite a laudable Ambition in their best Endeavours to copy it.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The first Thing I would observe here is, the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> of Government, and whence it takes its Rise. And I doubt not to say, That it is from God, who is the <hi>God of Order and not of Confusion:</hi> That is to say, that, upon Supposition that Mankind dwell together in Societies, which the humane Nature cannot well avoid, it is not a matter of Liberty and Freedom, and left to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This the Voice of <hi>Nature</hi> plainly declares to us. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the Divine Sovereignty, and unerring Wisdom, has formed, and fitted, the humane Nature for Rule and Government, and necessitated it to it, this may be justly looked upon as the Voice of God to Mankind; because the Almighty's adapting his Creatures to a particular End, is one way of making known His Mind and Will concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and every true dictate of right Reason, is no other than God speaking to his rational Creatures, by the inward Sentiments of their own Mind. Thus 'tis that they, who are destitute of the written Law, <hi>are a Law unto themselves,</hi> as the Apostle expresses it, <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 4.</note> The Law or Will of God being written upon their Hearts, and legible, in some measure, by the Candle of the Lord, which he hath lighted up within them.</p>
            <p>'Tis very evident, the Nature of Man is formed for Government, and necessitated to it, from that Power of Reason and Understanding that is in him, his fixed Bent to Society, and the many Weaknesses and Imperfections that attend him.</p>

            <p>However, since Sin has broke in upon the World, and vitiated the humane Nature, there is but so much the more Reason and Necessity for Government among Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are become so very weak, and depraved; to restrain their unruly Lusts, and keep, within due Bounds, the rampant Passions of Men, which else would soon throw humane Society into the last Disorder and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. For if all Men were left to live, and act, as they please, 'tis undoubted, the different Views and Interests, Humours and Passions of Mankind, and these often exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by false Principles, and strongly moved by a corrupt Bias upon the Mind, would unavoidably produce a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And does not this necessitate Laws to tame this fierce Creature, to bound his Appetites, &amp; bridle his Passions, that he may not be injurious to his Neighbour!

And this is Government. Thus the light of Nature shews us the Reason, and Necessity, of Government; and this Voice of Nature is the Voice of God. Thus 'tis that <hi>vox populi est vox Dei.</hi>

And that there are any, who walk in the Shape of Men, that do not diligently attend to the voice of Reason, nor enquire after Understanding, but sit down contented in the most abject Stupidity, scarce distinguishing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Brute, by any true Acts of Reason, it no more an Objection to Government's being a true Dictate of Nature, than one Man's shutting his Eyes would be, against the Sun's being risen, when all, who have their Eyes open, walks in the full Light of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The second thing I proposed to offer something up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, under the Head of Government, was, the <hi>Form</hi> of it. And here the Enquiry is, What Form of Government is chiefly to be regarded by a People? Since Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment originates from God, and is of Divine appointment, is there any particular Form of Divine Ordination? Or if not, what Form shall a People put themselves under as most eligible?</p>
            <p>To the First of these Enquiries, I think there is no great difficulty in Answering, That I know of no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Form of Civil Government, that God Himself has, directly, and immediately, appointed, by any clear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, of His Mind and Will, to any People whatever. The Scripture speaks of Civil Rulers under the several Denominations that were in use, at that Day; but it no where directs to, and enjoyns, any one Scheme of Civil Government, even upon God's own peculiar favorite People; but we find, when they became a settled Nation, in the Land which God had promised to their Fathers, it was the People's own Choice to come under a <hi>Monarchical</hi> Form of Government, and they said, <note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> viii. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>Nay, but we will have a King over us; that we also may be like all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that our King may Judge us, and go out before us, and fight our Battles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And tho' there was some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of the Divine Displeasure against them, for
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003745_0015_100255E1A196F020"/>
their asking a King, yet this was not for their assuming that particular Form of Civil Government, but for their throwing off the <hi>Theocracy,</hi> they and their Fathers, had so long experienced the Benefit of.</p>
            <p>So that it is evident God Almighty has left it to the natural Reason of Mankind, in every Nation and Country, to set up that Form, which, upon a thorow Consideration of the Nature, Temper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inclinations, Customs, Manners, Business, and other Circumstances of a People, may be thought best for them. And hence it is that some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have tho't it best for them to keep the Power of Government in the Hands of the Body of the People; while others have thought fit to lodge it in the Hands of their chief Families and Nobles; others again have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved the Weight of the Government upon a single Person; leaving it wholly with Him to assign what Part, to what Persons, he pleases; and another People have looked upon it most adviseable, for them, to take a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle way between these Extreams, and have laid up the Honours of Government, in a single Person, as their Supream Head, to flow from him down to all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and then have divided the Weight and Burden of it, between this single Person, a Body of Nobles of his creating, and a Select Assembly of their own choosing; by which Means, Sovereignty is so happily tempered with Righteousness and Mercy, and Will and Pleasure directed and limited by Liberty and Property, as to guard against Tyranny on the one Hand, and Anarchy on the other. Tho' neither of these Schemes, nor any other that may be tho't of, are immediately and directly of Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, yet so far as any, or all of them, are the Result of right Reason so far it may be said of them, that they are of God. Thus, the <hi>Powers that be,</hi> be they what they will, meaning Government, <hi>are ordained of God.</hi> And as every People are left to their Liberty to constitute what Form of Civil Government, all things considered, may appear best to them, as to any thing to the contrary from the Law of God, so, doubtless, it remains with any civil Society to alter, and change, the Form of their Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they see just Reason for it, and all Parties are consenting to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:003745_0016_100255E4F9D469B0"/>But if there be no particular Form of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appointed by God, and every Nation and People are left to their own Prudence to establish what Form they please, which Form and Scheme is best? If this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry means, What Form is best, considered absolutely, and by it self? I answer, That Form which is best accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to all the Ends of Government. What That is, may be tho't an hard Question, and it is not my Business to determine it. Tho' I would observe, that, possibly, it may be a just Answer to the Enquiry, to say, that it is an improper Question; because there can be no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without a People, or Subject of it; and the good, or ill, Qualities of it, can fall under no Consideration, but as Government stands related to its Subject; so that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Circumstances of a particular People must come into Consideration, to determine what is best. If the Question mean, what Form is relatively best? I answer, That which will suit the People best: which requires a thorow Knowledge of them, their Scituation, Produce, Genius, and the like, to resolve. If still it be insisted on, what Form is best for our selves? To this I answer, were we absolutely free to choose for ourselves, it must be left to the wisest Heads, the greatest Politicians among us, and those best acquainted with the People, and Country, to advise upon it: but as we are not at Liberty now to choose, I can readily Answer, that Form of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is best for us, which we are under; I mean the <hi>British Constitution.</hi> And this I can say, not only because we are a dependant Government, but because were I at full Liberty, I should choose to be (as, blessed be God, we are,) of the Number of the happy Subjects of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> whom God hath blessed above all People upon the Face of the Earth, in the Felicity of their Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and I look upon my self happy, that I know not of a single true <hi>New England</hi> Man, in the whole Province, but what readily subscribes to these Sentiments, and hopes we shall continue, to be the genuine Members of that glorious Constitution, thro'out all Ages.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another thing I am to offer something upon, is, the <hi>Person,</hi> or <hi>Persons,</hi> invested with the Authority of the Government. And here it may be Enquired, who, among the Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> has a Right to take the Reins into his Hands? Where shall we find the Right certain and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003745_0017_100255E6848B2D70"/>
indisputable? And whence does this personal Right and Claim arise? or who gave this Person, and not another, the Authority to preside over, and give Law to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and enforce Obedience? I scruple not to Answer; This Right is found, in whomsoever the Government constitutes and appoints to be their Ruler, or Rulers; There, and There only, is the certain Claim, full Right, and lawful Authority; and thence does it derive: And this, upon a due Consideration of things, will appear to hold good, let the Form of Civil Government be of what Kind it will. For,</p>
            <p>If we consult Strength and Force, and trace them to their utmost Extent, we shall find, that, (however un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely they may be thought, upon a cursory View, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with this Principle, yet,) upon a more thorow Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, they resolve themselves, at last, into Compact, and Agreement. For, (upon supposition of what is called Government founded in Conquest,) it is very evident that there must be a Conquest to found the Right in it; and a Conquest necessarily supposes one of these two things, either that there is an entire Destruction of the contending Party; or else that they come to Terms of Submission. If the Conquest consist in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n intire Destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Enemy, there is an End of all Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over them; for <hi>the dead hear not the Voice of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor,</hi> and <hi>there the Servant is free from his Master;</hi> but if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y come to Terms of Submission, (the very hardest of which supposes a Right to Life, and the Necessaries of it, and such further Accommodations as the Conqueror, in his Clemency, shall allow, which is a submitting to Mercy, and surrendring upon Discretion,) 'tis apparent the Right to rule over them is founded in Compact; tho' the strength of the Arm has made the Terms harder for those who are forced to submit, than, possibly, they would have been otherwise. Mere natural Force and Power gives no Person a Right to rule over another, and all Pretensions to Rule, founded in this only, without Consent, will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever leave the Government to be bandyed about by the perpetual Cuffs of contending Rivals, and endless Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, from every bold Usurper, that has got the longest Sword, and the strongest Arm; and he that is forced to resign to Day, may recover Strength eno' to Morrow; or where Strength fails, Stratagem and Craft may succeed,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003745_0018_100255E93767B358"/>
and carry the Game. And who sees not that, while the Royal Ball is thus tossed about, and catch who can, the State will become giddy with a continual Whirle, and all things run into such Confusion as oversets the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Government. <hi>He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eareth the Sword,</hi> not the Sword him.</p>
            <p>He therefore that sits upon the Throne of Empire must have a moral Right, and lawful Authority, to Rule; and this moral Right must be either natural to him, and what he was born with; (I mean, now, antecedent to an Act of the Government's conveying such a Birth-Right to any Man;) or it must arise from an immediate Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; or lastly, flow from the Election or Consent of the Community.</p>
            <p>Some have been so vain as to attempt to find out a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right, to Dominion, belonging, unalienably, and indefea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>amitical,</hi> and imagine, that, because the first Father of Mankind had a natural Right (as they say) to rule his Descendents, that therefore Kings have a natural Right to rule over their Subjects. But what if the First Man had a natural Right to Dominion over those that descend from him? Would not this necessarily infer these two things, namely, that this Right be continued in the next Male Heir, in a lineal Descent, to the Worlds End; and that this Male Heir, in a lineal Descent, be an absolute Monarch over all Nations, States, and Kingdoms in the Earth; the first of which has been impossible to be put in Practice this many Hundreds, yea Thousands, of Years; the other as impossible to consist with the Tempers and Interests of all Nations: which shews the Absurdity of the Scheme, upon their own Principles. But I very much doubt the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the Principle, <hi>That the First Man, were he living, would have a natural Right to rule all his Descendants.</hi> That he would have a natural Right to rule his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, whether Descendants, or not, is very readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and so has every Man now; but then it is to be remembred, that there is a very wide Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Man's Ruling his own immediate Family, and his Ruling over an other Man's Family. For the immediate
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003745_0019_100255EBA8388628"/>
Children of the first Man, upon their becoming Heads of Families, would have the same natural Right to govern their own, as <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st Person to bear rule over them, and giving up so much of their own Power over their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, to him, as is necessary for the general Benefit of the publick Society, they are now formed into. And this I think intirely overthrows the <hi>Patriarchal Scheme,</hi> and the whole set of fine Thoughts built upon it.</p>
            <p>Others have endeavoured to find out such a Divine Right, for civil Rulers, as is wholly exclusive of all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, or Consent of the Community; and have fancied, that they derive their Power immediately from God, by a particular, and immediate Designation of them Personally, to their high Office; from whence they conclude their Power unalienable, and their Authority absolute, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitted, as well as their Persons unaccountable. But these also have greatly failed in their Attempt.</p>
            <p>For, besides what I have already observed, that it hath pleased God to leave the particular Form of civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to humane Prudence; which infers, the Designation, of the Person to his Office, is from Man also; so far are we from having any Proof of such a Divine Right, in our Day, as, that when the Lord of Hosts Himself gave some particular directions, to His peculiar People, about

            <p>It is beneath the Dignity of a rational Agent to act for no End; and it is contrary to Reason, and Religion, to propound any but a good one; and the Good aimed at cannot be appropriated to this or that Set or Party, of Men, in the State, without having a suitable Regard to others; but must necessarily extend to the whole Body, otherwise it would soon be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

But the World has often had full Experience, that such false Ends of Government have issued in the Destruction of it; and those, who have been most forward to offer their Necks to the Feet of Princes, have given Conviction, how little able they were to resist the Force of Nature in them, when they themselves have began to feel what they meant for others.</p>
            <p>One would be ready to think it hardly possible for any, who are not destitute of the Understanding of Men, and lost to all true Reverence to the Deity, to entertain such a monstrous Conception, That God Almighty, the wisest, and the best of Beings, should make whole Natio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the other Hand, if the Good of the Subject, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as distinct from that of the Ruler, were the End of Government, what would the Consequence of this be, but A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>archy, wild Disorder, and universal Confusion? Which would be as destructive to Government as the hottest Tyranny could be. For the civil Rulers of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have not only their Interests in many Respects, twist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together with the Subjects, but some things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them, in a peculiar Manner, as Rulers, which are very essential to the Support of Government; I mean, their distinguishing Honour, their Authority and Power, their more special Security, and the like; and if these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests which are appropriated to them, should not be duely consulted, in the Administration, their Glory would soon become dim, their Authority be trampled on, and their Persons liable to the insult of every one that had more Sense than Understanding, and more of Passion than either: And any one may easily see where this would End.</p>
            <p>So that it is the Good of the whole Community both Rulers and Ruled in Conjunction, that is the great and main End of Government; and therefore we find Dr. <hi>Tillotson</hi> thus expressing himself, <note n="†" place="bottom">Vols 1. page 39.</note> 
               <hi>The great End of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is, to preserve Men in their Rights, against the Encroachments of Fraud and Violence.</hi> To preserve <hi>Men,</hi> not this or that Person, or this Set of Men, only, but the whole Body of Mankind, and every individual Member of the Body Politick. Hence I suppose arose that Maxim, <hi>Salus Populi est suprema Lex,</hi> the Safety and Welfare of the whole, (not the Subjects only, as some are ready enough to understand it,) is to give Law to the Government, and to be preferred to the seperate Interest of any particular Person whatever. As the Rights, Liberties, Defence, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and Prosperity of the Subjects are to be consulted; so the Honour, Majesty and Authority, of the Ruler are to be considered as, unitedly the Ends of Government; and tho', possibly, the first may be tho't the Primary, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003745_0024_100255F700E6F118"/>
the latter the Secondary Ends, yet cannot they well be separated without the Destruction of the Government. And this I think is sufficiently taught us, in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as when the civil Ruler is styled <hi>the Breath of our Nostrils</hi>

            <p>Having thus offered some things upon the Nature of Government, I now proceed to the <hi>Second Thing</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, which was,</p>

admit of no unreasonable Alterations, and sad Changes and Revolutions. For tho' this is to be considered as a very essential Part of the Establishment, of the Throne, yet this alone is not all that is intended. As the Throne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the whole Government, so the Establishment of the Throne means, the Establishment of the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Thus the Establishment of the Throne carries in it, the Firmness and Stability of the State; that it be fixed upon solid Foundations, and that all the Parts of it be well cemented and put together.

Jerusalem</hi> there means the whole Body of that People, State, or Kingdom, and their Throne was established, by their being, as a City, compact together; that is firmly united in all their Parts. So, when the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Branches of the Authority closely adhere to the Supream Head, and return all to it, as their Original, as the Rivers, fed by the Sea, return thither; when the Rulers are most firmly united to the People, in their most tender Affection, and jealous Concernment for their Good, as the common Fathers of their Country; and when the People are as closely united to their Rulers, in their profound Honour and Respect to their Persons, and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Obedience to their Lawful Authority, then is the Throne said to be established.</p>
            <p>The Stability of the Throne further includes in it, the Success of the Administrations, both for the Preservation of the <hi>Regalia,</hi> and the Security of the Rights of the Subject, and the promoting of the good Order and Vertue, the Humanity and moral Honesty, the Peace, Harmony and Unity of the State, and the Flourishing of the whole, in Wealth, Honour, and Renown.

            <p>Only while Rulers put on Righteousness as a Robe, and Justice as a Diadem, in the Preservation, and Defence, of this part of the Constitution, it seems necessary that these two Rules be observed, namely, that what they so vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously defend be a real Priviledge worth contending for, and that they truely have a Right to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Another Branch of Righteousness, in Rulers, requisite to establish the Throne, is the providing <hi>Righteous, good, and wholesom Laws.</hi> The first Notion of Government is, a Right to enact and then to execute, certain Laws, for the regulating the Society: and wherever this Legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Power is lodged, it is of the highest Consequence that the Laws themselves be just and righteous; because, since the Government is to proceed by them, if the Rule it self be not Straight, what ever is measured by i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a People needs, no great Foresight to determine. And where the Fault of all the Confusion brought upon such a People, will at last be found to lye (tho' it might have taken it's Rise from humane Frailty, and Mistake, but becomes greatly aggravated by the Continuance of the Error after the Discovery of it,) every one may plainly see.</p>
            <p>However, this seems pretty certain, that where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a Standard, and fixed Measure, of all Commerce, is provided by the State, it will not be in the Power of any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Craftiness to alter it; which I think is apparent in all Kingdoms, and Governments where there is a fixed Standard; or if some might, possibly, find their Interest in little Variations from the Standard, yet, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has done its Duty, and so far acted righteously, as to provide a known, certain, and unvariable Rule to go by. In short, all I plead for is Righteousness; that a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought to have a stated Measure, a fixed Medium, and there can be none but what the Law makes so. Having thus provided a publick Standard, in their Medium,</p>
            <p>The next thing seems to be, the Legislature's reducing all things, which the Members of the Community may be concerned about in the way of Barter, and Exchange, to Number, Weight, and Measure, that there may be no door left open, for Persons of no Principle, or Conscience, or Honour, (and such there will be in every State,) to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon their Neighbours, in the quantity, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, they may, after all imaginable Care to prevent it, in the quality, of their Goods. This is that Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which the Divine Oracles calls for, when it assures us, <hi>That divers Weights are an Abomination to the Lord,

and a false Ballance is not Good</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus the Righteousness of the Ruler is seen, in the Laws being calculated, to encourage all that is vertuous and laudable, and to banish whatever is any ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the State, or to the Person, Name, and Interest of any particular Member of it, that they may <hi>be a Terror to Evil doers, and a Praise to them that do Well.</hi> Their Righteousness is displayed, in so tempering the Laws, that they may equally take hold on the Great and Small, and not be Traps to one, and open Doors to another; that one may not be burdened, and another eased, but that all Parts of the Body, may proportionably bear the Weight, and render it Light; and in adjusting all their Acts and Laws, to the Temper and Genius, to the Condition and Circumstances of the People To which End, a very great Regard is to be paid to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Divine Laws, not only Moral, but Judicial, as far as the Condition of a People will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, as the Result of the highest Wisdom and Rectitude.</p>
            <p>And as Righteousness must enter into the Nature of the Laws, so into the Sanctions of them also; that they may be duely confirmed, and enforced, and that the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty be proportioned to the Nature of the Crime, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, in its self, and in its Circumstances, as they more or less affect the Preservation of the Peace, and Welfare, of humane Society, and every Member of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third Instance of the Righteousness in Rulers, by which the Throne is established, is, the due <hi>Execution of the Law,</hi> and <hi>dispensing the Rewards</hi> of the Government; For all of this is but distributive Justice.</p>
            <p>Thus, there is Righteousness required in the due Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the Laws. A State or Kingdom has a Right to see all their just Laws obeyed, and therefore is the Sword put into such and such Hands, jointly, or separately, that Obedience may be enforced, and they may be governed

according to Law; and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perhaps, it may be as great a wrong to the Government, not to put the Laws in Execution, as to make none. The wilful Neglect, therefore, of Executing the Law, by those to whom it belongs, will be looked upon, as the Betraying an important Trust, and Dissolving of the Government. For, should the Laws be ever so good, if they are suspended, or the executive Power acts contrary to them, 'tis evident the Design of the Rulers Office is perverted.

and much more of great Trust and Service,) Promotions are made, from the lowest of the People, to serve a turn, whose straight Circumstances, low Education, and mean Imployment, as well as personal Incapacity, cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with the Dignity and Majesty, the Grandeur and State, of the Post they sustain, this would be so far from distributive Justice, that it would be a doing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment one of the greatest Injuries For a State, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ever designs their Rewards to the most worthy, and have a just Right to the Service of the ablest Heads, and best Hands; and it must, therefore, come vastly short of Righteousness, for secret Ends, to prefer such as are inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, to Men of known Ability, and Experience, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Fidelity; and would be no greater Kindness to the Persons themselves, than the hang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Such a Distribution of the Rewards of a Government, would unavoidably bring it into Contempt, at home, and abroad. For, the common People, (who have scarce any thing else to keep them at a Distance, and procure their Respect, and Veneration, but the Impressions which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Grandeur makes upon their Minds,) would be very apt to grow too familiar, and despise the Men, whom they find upon a Level with themselves, in their Capacity and Circumstances. And Men of real Worth, and Distinction, will hardly brook it to be ranked with those who are, upon all Accounts, so much below them; nor can they easily bear to have their brighter Understanding over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled, in matters of Importance, by a perfect Silence, or numerous Hands of such as scarce understand their Actions.

Sometimes these Leagues and Treaties are entred into for the sake of carrying on a Trade, which may be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to both Parties, in the Consumption of the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus Manufacture of the one, and the supply of the Wants of the other.

               </note> Tho' I do not think our holy Religion will be a Loser by searching it to the Bottom, and making all the Objections that can in Reason, be brought against it, but it will shine the clearer, and be established the stronger, when it is seen that it can endure the Trial, and overcome all Opposition; yet I doubt the running upon the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion with Banter and Ridicule, with Flout and Jeer, with Railing and Scurrility, which so unhappily chimes in with the Depraved Inclinations of Mankind, and gives such a Titillation, to the wild Imagination which is easily hurried away with the Laugh, will go far in banishing all Religion out of the World; which seems to be the last and strongest Effort of diabolical Policy in the Satanic Agent of the present Age; if God in infinite Compassion to Mankind do not prevent it. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rulers of a People are to exert themselves, and prevent such Insults upon our holy Religion. <q>The Heathen (said Dr. <hi>Tillots<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:003745_0046_10025629A721F1C0"/>Thus, the civil Ruler should preserve the Rights of the Christian Church, not only by countenancing their Assembling to Worship, their Choice of their Officers, and their Church Administrations, but by encouraging their Associating in Councils, and Synodical Assemblies, for the mutual Benefit of all the parts of the Church of Christ, and the Communion of Churches, which is so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to their Well being. Thus, they should speak comfortably to the Ministers of the Lord, as it is recorded of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </note> And since those that teach the good Knowledge of the Lord are greatly instrumental to preserve the Peace of the State, and promote the Honour and Obedience which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pay to their Rulers, by preaching the Laws of Christ which strongly enjoyn these Duties, it is but just in the civil Ruler to shew a decent Respect to the Minister of Christ, and remember the Honour that belongs to him in his Place and encourage him to his Work; and not as some little Minds are too apt to do, who, as soon as they are raised to a small Figure in the State, think they must rule in the Church also, and therefore enter a Contest with their Minister, and excite such as now have some Dependance on them to a disrelish of his Person, Gifts, or Performances, that if possible they may subdue him to their Humour, and by that means bring the People where they dwell to what Terms they please.</p>
            <p>Thus the civil Ruler should secure the Rights of the Church by taking Care of the Support of it's Officers, who have a Right to their Maintenance, by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Law of the Gospel, if there were no Promise from their People. Thus <hi>Hezekiah, commanded the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to give the Portion to the Priests and Levites, that they might be encouraged in the Law of the Lord.</hi>

            <p n="2">II. To consider Righteousness as it relates to the <hi>Ruled,</hi> or governed part of the State. And what is needful here may be reduced to these Heads, of Honour, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Maintenance, Defence, and Prayer, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>h are so plain, that I need not to enlarge upon them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first Branch of Righteousness in the Subject, is the paying all due <hi>Honour</hi> to the Ruler. For the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Characters of the Deity upon them, beyond what is to be found upon other Men, in their Authority and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over rational Agents; and the special Relation they stand in to the Subjects, as Fathers to their Country, shews that it is an Act of Righteousness to give the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est civil Honours to them, proportionable to their Rank and Station. This Honour is to be paid to them in the inward Love and Affection we are to bear them, the high Opinion and Esteem we are to entertain of them, and the very great Veneration and awe of the Mind to them<hi>:</hi> hence is that <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

               <hi>My Son fear thou the Lord, and the King.</hi> This Honour is to be manifested, in our outward Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:003745_0048_1002562FB02BE4D8"/>
by our speaking honourably of them, treating them with the greatest Deference, with all the customary Marks of Respect, and observing our due Distance. Hence says the Apostle, <hi>Fear God, Honour the King</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 27.</note> This Honour is to be paid to them for the sake of their Office, and should be greatly encreased from their personal Worth, and the Superiority of their Powers, and their filling and honouring their Station with a wise and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, righteous and just, generous and paternal Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Instance of Righteousness in Subjects is <hi>Obedience</hi> to their Rulers. If it be righteous in the Ruler to make good and whol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But all the Judicial Laws of a State, (as well as plainly moral ones) that are calculated to promote their Peace and Flourishing, the Support and Defence of the Government, and the like, wherein the Rights of the great Lord of Conscience are not specially concern'd, are readily to be obeyed.

be among such a People to render them uneasy? The Prince would smile under the Weight of the Crown, and the Burden of Empire, because they sit easy upon him. The People would Salute their Rulers with their joyful Acclamations, <hi>Let the King live for Ever,</hi> because of their safe Possessions, and quiet Habitations.

            <p>Forgive me, if I observe to you, that my greatest Fears arise from the threatning Aspect the want of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness has upon our Land.</p>
            <p>As for that Unrighteousness which is to be observed in the Private Life, there seems to be a Necessity of further Provision in the Law to prevent it. And particularly, what we fear will be the Consequence of the publick Notes being called in, at their appointed Time, before particular Persons have discharged their Obligations, arising upon them, seems to require timely Provision, to guard against the Oppression and Injustice which, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, will ensue. But this has been set in so good a Light, and spoken to with such Cogency, by the very Rev. Dr. COLMAN, in his late Discourse, <hi>preparatory to a Fast,</hi> that I shall say nothing further concerning it.</p>
            <p>As to publick Righteousness, the Righteousness by which the Throne is established, This has been set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this honourable Assembly; and it will now lye, with those more especially concerned, to view over the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances that have been named, and see whether there is nothing that wants to be amended; and to enter upon the Business of the Year with this first Act of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, an unbiass'd Choice of his <hi>Majesty'</hi>s <hi>honourable Council,</hi> that it may be a happy Token of the Rectitude of the Administrations, thro'out the whole of it.</p>
