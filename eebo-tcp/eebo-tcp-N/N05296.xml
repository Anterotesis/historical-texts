            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM XI. 3.</bibl>
               <q>If the Foundations be deſtroyed, what can the Righteous do?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is evidently agreeable to the will of God, the Sovereign Ruler of the World, that men whom He has made ſociable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhould live in Communities, and enjoy the Benefits and Advantages that are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the <hi>Social</hi> Life. This cannot poſſibly be effected without erecting &amp; ſupporting Civil Government: For men in a State of <hi>Anarchy,</hi> ſuch a State wherein every One does <hi>that which is right in his own Eyes;</hi> or rather that which gratifies his irregular Appetites without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering whether it be Right, or Wrong, or regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding how much it infringes the Right, or affects the Happineſs of others, are ſo far from enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proper Advantages of Society, that a wiſe man would chuſe the moſt retired Solitude rather than ſuch Company.</p>
            <p>THE Nature of Government requires that there be men of different Orders, ſome veſted with Authority to command and others under Obligations to obey; or that there be Rulers &amp; Subjects in every Community. Different Forms
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:006692_0005_1029A759803CAF28"/>
of Civil Government have all along obtained in the World, and probably will do ſo to the End of Time. And after all the Diſputes which particular Species of it is in it ſelf moſt perfect and excellent, it muſt be owned that there is that Difference, perhaps in the very Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Genius of different Nations, or certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their Condition and Circumſtances as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders one Form of Government moſt ſuitable to one Nation, and beſt adapted to promote it's Happineſs; while another Form ſhall beſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the great Ends of Government with a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent People. It has not pleaſed God to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in this Caſe, by inſtituting one Form of Civil Government and obliging all Nations to ſubmit to it; and therefore though Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general muſt be owned as a Divine Inſtitution, yet no one particular Species of it as oppoſed to another, can juſtly claim the Honour of ſubſiſting by a ſtrictly <hi>Divine Right.</hi> Whether we conſult the Light of Nature or Revelation; we ſhall find Reaſon to conclude that all regular Forms of Civil Adminiſtration, ſo far as they anſwer the Intentions of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are equally agreeable to the Will of God. And perhaps, if our Views were ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, we ſhould ſee that the Good of the whole World is beſt promoted, and the Grand Scheme of Divine Providence in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, moſt effectually carried on, while
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006692_0006_1029A75D04306EF8"/>
diverſe Nations are under different Forms of Civil Government.</p>
            <p>PUBLIC Happineſs is the original Deſign and great End of Civil Government. The magiſtrate under all Forms of Government, is according to the Intention of his Office, <hi>God's miniſter attending continually upon this very Thing.</hi> If we conſider the magiſtrate's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as derived from God; we cannot Doubt that this is the End for which it is given. A man muſt certainly have very abſurd Notions of the Divine Being, if he can perſuade himſelf that God, in appointing Civil Government, aimed at nothing higher than aggrandizing Rulers; and it would be blaſphemous to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that his Intention was, to give ſome men a Right to gratify their Pride and Ambition, their Cruelty, Luſt, or Revenge at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the public Happineſs of a whole Nation. It is evidently much more agreeable to our natural Conceptions of God, as well as to the expreſs Revelations He has made of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to ſuppoſe Him, as the indulgent Parent of mankind, aiming at and providing for their public Welfare in appointing Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than to conſider Him as the Patron of Tyranny, Cruelty and Oppreſſion, and of their genuine Conſequences, Public Deſolation and univerſal miſery. And it requires but a little Reflection to be convinced, that Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006692_0007_1029A76052E0CF38"/>
is wiſely ſuited to promote it's great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in ſecuring the public Happineſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Society.</p>
            <p>GOD will forever have the Glory of all his wiſe and gracious Appointments for the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his Creatures; but men through their own Folly and Wickedneſs may miſs of the Advantage deſigned them. Civil Government may, and too often does fail of anſwering it's End; and public Happineſs is not effectually ſecured even by this excellent method which infinite wiſdom has provided for that Purpoſe. This ſometimes happens through the weakneſs or wickedneſs of Rulers, and ſometimes through the Folly and madneſs of Subjects, And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are the blameable Cauſes of unhinging a Government, and preventing its anſwering its Deſign, the effect will be very pernicious, and men of all Sorts will ſooner or later ſuffer under it; tho' <hi>the Righteous,</hi> men of honeſt Intentions and peaceable Diſpoſitions, will ordinarily be the firſt and deepeſt Sufferers.</p>
            <p>THIS is beautifully expreſſed in the words I have choſen for the Subject of our preſent meditations, <hi>If the Foundations be deſtroyed, what can the Righteous do?</hi> In which words Civil Government is ſpoken of as the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Safety, Security and Happineſs of men conſidered as formed into Society, the Caſe of <hi>theſe Foundation's being deſtroyed</hi> is ſuppoſed,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006692_0008_1029A7639EF4D1E8"/>
and upon this Suppoſition the Queſtion is put, <hi>What can the Righteous do?</hi> That this is the Senſe of the words ſeems plain from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. The Pſalmiſt here flies to God &amp; truſts in Him for Protection in a Time of Danger. <hi>In the Lord put I my Truſt; how ſay ye to my Soul, Flee as a Bird to your mountain?</hi> ver. 1. The Danger he was in is thus expreſſed, <hi>for lo, the wicked bend their Bow, they make ready their Arrow upon the String; that they may privily ſhoot at the upright in Heart.</hi> ver. 2. In this Caſe it was the Duty, and it ought to have the Care of the Civil Magiſtrate to reſtrain the wicked and protect the upright: But the Government was too weak to do this; or elſe they who had the Adminiſtration of it, were negligent of the Duty of their Office, and would not interpoſe in the Caſe; or perhaps the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate himſelf who ought to have defended the innocent, was the very man who in this Caſe attempted to deſtroy him. King <hi>Saul,</hi> who ſought <hi>David's</hi> Life <hi>as when one doth hunt a Partridge in the Mountains</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Sam. xxvi. 20.</note>, may be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>the wicked</hi> man who had <hi>bent his Bow,</hi> and <hi>made ready his Arrow upon the String</hi> to <hi>ſhoot at the upright in Heart.</hi> Thus the Power of the magiſtrate, which was originally deſigned for the Protection of the innocent, was ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006692_0009_1029A765238C43F8"/>
as to be uſed as the means of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; or at leaſt was not ſo exerted as to afford him Safety and Protection. This State of Things the Pſalmiſt deſcribes by the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Foundations being deſtroyed,</hi> and in theſe Circumſtances he demands, <hi>what can the Righteous do?</hi> which Queſtion plainly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents men of this Character as expoſed to pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Difficulties in ſuch a State of Things as is here mentioned.</p>
            <p>IN diſcourſing from theſe words on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Occaſion, my Deſign is, to conſider ſome of the principal Things on the Account of which Civil Government is ſtiled the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Social Security and Happineſs; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each of theſe Heads, I ſhall mention ſome of the moſt obvious Ways in which this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation may be deſtroyed, and point out the ſpecial Difficulties of the righteous in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Caſes that will come under Conſideration. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>I. CIVIL Government is the Foundation of Social Happineſs as it is deſigned and ſuited to render men ſafe, eaſy and ſecure in their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE are many Things relating to men's Perſons, of ſuch a Nature and Importance that they cannot be <hi>happy,</hi> nor indeed ſo much as <hi>comfortable</hi> without having ſome Security for the quiet Poſſeſſion, and Enjoyment of them.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006692_0010_1029A76A2557C0E0"/>
Of this kind are Life, Liberty, Reputation, Eaſe and the like: He that enjoys theſe has a Value for them; and in Proportion to his Eſteem of them, will be his uneaſineſs when he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inſecure in the Poſſeſſion of them, or in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of looſing them. Social Happineſs cannot be enjoyed unleſs men have ſome reaſonable Security with Regard to theſe perſonal Things; nor are there any advantages ariſing from So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety that can ballance a Want of Security with reſpect to ſome of them. What reaſonable man would not chuſe to be deſtitute of all the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the Social Life, rather than to live among a Company of lawleſs <hi>Banditti,</hi> Robbers or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; any one of which might on the leaſt Provocation, or even without any Provocation at all, inſult and abuſe, beat, wound, or torture him, or even take away his Life? What Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage reſulting from Society can be named, that would make amends for this conſtant and imminent Danger of being ill-treated &amp; abuſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> put to the moſt excruciating Tortures, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of Limbs and even of Life it ſelf?</p>
            <p>LIBERTY, or a Freedom from unneceſſary and burthenſome Confinements, Reſtraints or Impriſonment, is what men are <hi>naturally,</hi> and indeed very <hi>juſtly</hi> deſirous of. The Poſſeſſion of it gives a ſweet and pleaſant Reliſh to Life and the Enjoyments of it, and the want of this renders them all taſteleſs if not nauſeous. A
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006692_0011_1029A773072EB6F0"/>
wiſe and good man, one who does not deſire to <hi>uſe Liberty for a Cloke of maliciouſneſs</hi>

A good Conſcience, a Senſe of Innocence, an Expectation of being acquitted and approved in the Day when God ſhall judge the Secrets of men, will do a great deal towards ſupporting and comforting the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right under a Load of calumny and Defamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But even this inward Satisfaction, though ſo greatly deſireable, is not ſufficient to <hi>Social</hi> Happineſs.

and Defamation, laid under many Diſadvantages, and rendred leſs happy as well as leſs uſeful than he would otherwiſe be.</p>
            <p>GOVERNMENT is deſigned and ſuited to defend men in the Enjoyment of theſe perſonal Rights, which are ſo eſſential to Social Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Laws are made to curb the unruly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions of men, and prevent their wounding the Perſons or Reputations of their Neighbours, their depriving them of Life, Eaſe or Liberty. The Magiſtrate has juſt Authority, to puniſh the Tranſgreſſors of theſe wholſome Laws, and to proportion the Puniſhment to the Injury done, and to the neceſſary Intention of deterring others from doing the like. A ſtrict and impartial Adminiſtration of Juſtice in theſe Caſes, is the greateſt Political Security againſt the Perpetration and Increaſe of Crimes of this Kind; and conſequently tends to render every Member of the Community ſecure and ſafe in the Poſſeſſion of Life and Liberty, Reputation and Eaſe. And Civil Government conſidered as intended and adapted to protect men in theſe Reſpects, deſerves to be called the Foundation of Social Happineſs; and, when duly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter'd, it is a very firm and ſolid Foundation.</p>
            <p>BUT this Foundation, ſolid as it is, may yet be deſtroyed; and all the Confidence and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity built upon it, may end in Diſappointment and Ruin. A particular Government may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006692_0013_1029A77D18A1B1D0"/>
be eſſentially wrong, in its very Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by being built upon ſuch Maxims as are diametrically oppoſite to the Nature, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of the original Deſign of Society, or inconſiſtent with public and Social Happineſs. Or a Government originally well formed, may by a gradual and perhaps an imperceptible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from its original Principles, in Length of Time, become quite the Reverſe of what it at firſt was. Magiſtrates may degenerate into Tyrants; a mild and Legal Government may corrupt and turn into mere Arbitrarineſs and Deſpotiſm: or, on the other Hand, the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration may become weak, and ſo incapable of anſwering its Intention; the Magiſtrate may looſe his Influence and Authority, and the Laws may become contemptible in the Eyes of the People. This may ariſe from a general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſs in the Execution of them, which if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for any Length of Time, ſeldom fails of producing this fatal Effect: Or it may proceed from the Prevalence of a diſcontented, factious and mutinous ſpirit in the People, which ſome times riſes to ſuch an Height that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate has not Strength to repel and ſubdue it. In theſe Caſes it is evident that the Foundation of Social Happineſs is deſtroyed; for in ſuch Circumſtances no Man has a proper Security for his Eaſe or Liberty, his Reputation or even his Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:006692_0014_1029A77E9E249938"/>
TYRANNY, whether natural to the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Government or owing to Corruption in the Adminiſtration, is utterly inconſiſtent with Social Happineſs. The Subjects in an arbitrary Government have indeed <hi>ſome</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt being aſſaulted, abuſed, defamed or murdered by their Fellow-Subjects; but even this is not ſo ſtrong as public Happineſs requires it ſhould be, becauſe arbitrary Rulers ſuſpend the Execution of the Laws at their Pleaſure, and that even of thoſe Laws the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Execution of which is moſt eſſentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Security even of the Lives of their Subjects. And then Subjects in ſuch Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, have no Security at all, even of Life it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, againſt their Rulers. Every man has a <hi>Right</hi> to his own Life by the Law of Nature; and when men enter into Society they are ſo far from giving up this Right, that it muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the ſecuring it to them was one of the principal Reaſons of men's forming themſelves into Communities. If any man doubts this, he need only aſk himſelf whether he would, on any Conſideration, join with a Society in which it ſhould be a fundamental Article, that any one man, or any Number of men ſhould have a Right to take away his Life when they pleaſed? A man may forfeit his Life, and when he has done ſo the magiſtrate may juſtly take it away: But without ſuch Forfeiture made, the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006692_0015_1029A78759AF64C8"/>
magiſtrate has no more Right to take away the Life of a Subject, than one private Perſon has to take away the Life of another. Murther committed with all the Solemnities of a legal Tryal &amp; Execution, is the worſt Kind of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; The innocent man ſuffers moſt in this way, as his Reputation is murthered as well as his Perſon: and thoſe who in this method ſhed innocent Blood, contract an aggravated Guilt as they make the Authority of the magiſtrate which was given on Purpoſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the innocent, the very means of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. This I take to be the meaning of that Speech of Chriſt to <hi>Pilate, Thou couldſt have no Power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above:</hi> Therefore <hi>he that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me unto thee hath</hi> the greater Sin. John xix. 11. and ſo <hi>Confinement</hi> or an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Liberty which the Intentions and Laws of Society allow to men in general; <hi>Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and the Infliction of Corporal <hi>Pain</hi> are to be conſidered as <hi>Puniſhments;</hi> and as ſuch they ſuppoſe <hi>Guilt</hi> in the Subjects of them: And when theſe are inflicted on any Man not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of a Crime that deſerves them, he has an Injury done him. And when Magiſtrates without regarding the Rules of diſtributive Juſtice, act in an arbitrary, Tyrannical Manner, and treat the innocents as if they were guilty, the Diſtinction between Right and Wrong, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006692_0016_1029A78924E3F070"/>
ſo the Foundation of Society and public Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Security is deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>THE Caſe is much the ſame when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate wants Power, as when he wants the Will to protect the Innocent, and puniſh the Guilty. Tyranny and Anarchy, like Fire and Froſt, tho' contrary in their Natures, are in many Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces much alike in their Effects. A factious, ungovernable Diſpoſition in the People does as effectually deſtroy the Foundations of public Happineſs, as Tyranny in the Rulers: And a man has no more ſecurity of his Life or any of the Enjoyments of it, when the Execution of the Laws is prevented by the mutinous Temper of the People, than he would have if the Laws were Suſpended by the arbitrary Will of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Governors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IF the Foundations be deſtroyed</hi> in either of theſe Ways, <hi>What can the Righteous do?</hi> While the authority of the Magiſtrate is rightly directed, duly exerciſed, &amp; properly reverenced and ſubmitted to, every Member of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity has the higheſt Political Security againſt perſonal Injuries and Abuſes: But when the Adminiſtration of Juſtice is perverted, and the Ends of Government render'd impractible, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Corruption and Tyranny in the Rulers or by Obſtinacy a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

of perſonal Injuries, even to that of having his life violently taken away. In theſe Circumſtances wicked Men may for a while preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they can <hi>cringe</hi> and <hi>fawn;</hi> they have no Reſtraints of Conſcience to prevent their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring a Tyrant, or ſacrificing the Liberties of their Country, and the Happineſs of their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Subjects to his lawleſs Will; or even their yielding themſelves to him, and becoming the criminal Inſtruments in his Hands of entailing Miſery on Generations yet unborn. Or, if the Tyde ſets the other Way, and popular Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent &amp; Faction prevail againſt the juſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Magiſtrate, yet ſuch men can ſtill ſwim with the Stream. They will join with the factious, and be ſome of the loudeſt in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Clamours againſt Rulers; and under a Pretence of <hi>Patriotiſm</hi> and Zeal for the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the People, ſuch men will revile the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and contemn the Authority of the Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, weaken the Adminiſtration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and enervate the Laws, and ſo deſtroy the Foundations of public Happineſs to ſecure their own private Intereſt. But now the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous whoſe Conſciences reſtrain them from uſing ſuch wicked Arts, they who religiouſly adhere to the Conſtitution and Intereſts of their Country, and will neither ſacrifice the juſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the People to Rulers of an arbitrary Diſpoſition, nor give up the legal Authority of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006692_0018_1029A7917B3F09B8"/>
Rulers to a prevailing Faction, theſe honeſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right men are moſt expoſed; they are not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Favourites of an ambitious Tyrant, nor the Darlings of a lawleſs Mob, but are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally looked on with a jealous Eye, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out for Ruin by them both.</p>
            <p>II. CIVIL Government is the Foundation of Social Happineſs as it is deſigned and ſuited to ſecure Men in their <hi>Rights</hi> &amp; <hi>Properties,</hi> by a due adminiſtration of Juſtice in all <hi>Civil Cauſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SOCIAL Happineſs requires that men be ſecured in their civil Rights and Properties, as well as in their Perſons; and this is one great Deſign of Government. Property is prior to all Humane Laws and Conſtitutions. God has <hi>given the Earth to the Children of men</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal cxv. 16.</note>; and if by the <hi>original Grant</hi> every one of them has an equal Right to every particular Thing, while it continues meerly in the State wherein Nature produced it, yet when any one man has by his own Labour rendred it better, more ſuitable to the Uſes of Human Life and therefore more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, he has now a better Right to it, than any other man has; and being in Poſſeſſion, he cannot juſtly be turned out by one who has not ſo good a Title as he himſelf has. But Properties and Poſſeſſions would be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006692_0019_1029A794F977B738"/>
Things in a State of Nature, they need the Sanctions of Government and Laws to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in any meaſure ſecure and ſafe; and the obtaining this Security was no doubt one great Reaſon that induced men to combine in regular Societies, and eſtabliſh Government. For in a State of Nature, though no man had a Right to diſturb the Happineſs, or take away the Property of another, yet the ſtronger would prey upon and devour the weaker: And when any Diſputes aroſe concerning Property, there being no Perſons authorized to judge &amp; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine between the Parties, every man was Judge in his own Cauſe; and would put his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Execution in ſuch a manner as would beſt anſwer his End, either by Force or Fraud. A State of Nature is a State of War; and in all the Controverſies that might ariſe in it, there was no Appeal but to the Sword.</p>
            <p>GOVERNMENT is excellently ſuited to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this Evil, and to ſecure and defend men in the quiet Poſſeſſion of their Rights and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. This can no otherwiſe be done but by a due Adminiſtration of Juſtice in Civil Cauſes; and therefore it is <hi>eſſential</hi> to Society that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es be appointed, and that they have ſufficient Authority to carry their Judgments into Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, by obliging even the moſt ſtubborn and refractory to ſubmit to it. And as the whole Force of the Community is to be applied, when
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006692_0020_1029A7982F89B550"/>
neceſſary, to execute Legal Judgments, every man in a well conſtituted Government, has the higheſt Political Security for the Enjoyment of his Property, for all his Fellow-Subjects are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to defend him therein, with their united Force and Strength.</p>
            <p>IN this View of the Caſe the Foundations may be deſtroyed ſeveral ways, as, when good Laws are not provided, or Judges not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to execute them; when Corruption and Bribery prevail, and Judgment is bought and ſold; or when through the weakneſs of the Adminiſtration, or the Strength of Factions, a righteous Judgment cannot be carried into Execution, and ſo Juſtice cannot be done. 'Tis poſſible for ſome of theſe Things to ariſe to ſuch an Height as abſolutely to diſſolve a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and reduce a People to a mere State of Nature, and ſo to deprive them wholly of the Advantages that ariſe from Society: and every Degree of them affects the Foundation of public Happineſs, as it weakens the Security which every Man in Social Life ought to have, for the quiet Poſſeſſion of his Property or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
            <p>THE Righteous will be expoſed to peculiar Difficulties in this Caſe as well as the former. For ſuch being under the Reſtraints of Religion &amp; Conſcience, cannot bribe a Judge, nor corrupt a Jury, nor ſuborn an Evidence; nor on the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006692_0021_10293E1A085E49C8"/>
other Hand can they join with the mutinous, promote Riots, or raiſe a Mob to protect them. But they who are under no ſuch Reſtraints will readily uſe theſe &amp; ſuch like wicked Arts; and by them, when the Foundations are thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, they too often not only Defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but oppreſs &amp; ruin their innocent Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>III. CIVIL Government is the Foundation of Social Happineſs, as it is appointed &amp; ſuited to promote the Practice of all thoſe Virtues which conduce to render a Community ſafe, flouriſhing and happy; and to ſuppreſs thoſe Vices which tend to deſtroy or hurt it.</p>
            <p>'TIS a very juſt Obſervation, that <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs exalteth a Nation, and Sin is a Reproach to any People</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. xiv 34.</note>. Sin of any Kind when connived at and encouraged, brings public Guilt; public Guilt deſerves public Judgments; and it may reaſonably be expected, that the Sovereign Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the World will manifeſt the Holineſs of his Nature, and diſcover the Righteouſneſs of his moral Government, by rendering a wicked and debauched Community a miſerable one. Indeed it can hardly be otherwiſe, in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things, where ſome particular Sorts of Vice prevail, and become general. Some Vices are in their own Nature deſtructive of public
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006692_0022_1029A7A23245F308"/>
Happineſs; ſuch, for Inſtance, are <hi>Idleneſs, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, Intemperance,</hi> and <hi>the Neglect</hi> of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Care for the <hi>Education</hi> and Inſtruction of <hi>the riſing Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>EVERY Member of a Community is obliged to contribute, in his Station, to the good of the whole, and every induſtrious, frugal Man does ſo; he ſerves himſelf, and he ſerves the Public at the ſame Time. Whatever any man gains by honeſt Labour, is juſt ſo much gained to the Society of which he is a Member: And on the contrary Idleneſs in particular Perſons is preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the Public; there is at leaſt the Loſs of what the Community might have been bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted by their Labour. And then as <hi>he that is ſlothful in his work is Brother to him that is a great Waſter</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. xviii. 9.</note>, and Lazineſs is the Parent of Poverty and Want, Idleneſs tends to hurt the Public by increaſing the Number of Beggars, or that of Thieves and Robbers.</p>
            <p>EXTRAVAGANCE as it tends to impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh particular Perſons &amp; Families, has the ſame evil Aſpect upon public Happineſs as Idleneſs has; and beſides this, it impoveriſhes a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity as it turns the Balance of Trade againſt them, and ſo obliges them to ſend to other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries what ought to ſerve as a Medium of Trade among themſelves, and reduces them to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006692_0023_1029A7A3B5C4FBF0"/>
Expedient of a baſe Currency which no body will take off their Hands. The Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which this brings on and continues, are at preſent ſo publickly known, and ſo generally felt, that I need not ſpend Time in deſcribing them. There is no one Kind of Extravagance ſo pernicious in its Nature &amp; Conſequences as an intemperate uſe of ſtrong Drink. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the ſame fatal Effects with Idleneſs, and the other ſorts of Extravagance, beſides many others, as deſtructive to ſocial Happineſs, which are peculiar to it ſelf. It debauches the Mind, and enfeebles the Body, it ruins the Conſtitutions and deſtroys the Health of ſuch as practiſe it; and degrades a man, who was made for noble &amp; uſeful Purpoſes, into one of the meaneſt, moſt inſignificant and uſeleſs of all Creatures. Not only ſo, but it is productive of Brawls, Riots &amp; Quarrels, which too often produce Fighting, &amp; iſſue in wounds &amp; Blood, <hi>Who hath Wo? who hath Sorrow? who hath Contentions? who hath Bablings? who hath Wounds-?-They that tarry long at the Wine, they that go to ſeek mixt Wine</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. xxiii. 29, 30.</note>.</p>
            <p>THESE Vices tend to the preſent &amp; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Deſtruction of Social Happineſs, and the Neglect of proper Care for the Inſtruction and Education of Youth, does as certainly tend to entail public Miſery on Poſterity. Ignorance
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006692_0024_1029A7A5397296B8"/>
and Wickedneſs are prejudicial to Society, while Learning &amp; Virtue greatly promote the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of it. The P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The proper Deſign of Schools &amp; Colleges, is, that Youth may be trained up in uſeful Learning and ſtrict Virtue or Religion: And there is nothing more neceſſary to the maintaining Social Happineſs, and rendering it a durable Thing, ſuch an one as ſhall continue from Generation to Generation, than that theſe be ſet up and ſupported, and ſo regulated as effectually to anſwer their End.</p>
            <p>GOVERNMENT is the Foundation of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Happineſs as it is deſigned to prevent ſuch Things as are detrimental to it, and to promote thoſe Things which tend to advance &amp; perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate it. That this is one Deſign of Magiſtracy, is plain from the Apoſtle's deſcribing Rulers as being <hi>a Terror not to good Works, but to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. xiii. 3.</note> for whatever tends to prevent or deſtroy public Happineſs, is evil both in a moral &amp; in a political Senſe. Government is well adapted to anſwer this it's Intention: The Magiſtrate has the Power of the Sword committed to him, that he may be <hi>the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil</hi>

Authority he is veſted with enables him to puniſh &amp; ſuppreſs Idleneſs, Extravagance &amp; Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; to lay ſuch Duties upon the Means of Luxury &amp; Drunkenneſs as ſhall at leaſt prevent the general Practiſe of them; and to give pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per &amp; needful Encouragement to uſeful Arts &amp; Manufactures. The Magiſtrate's Authority capacitates him for erecting and ſupporting Schools &amp; Colleges, and for ordering &amp; regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating them, and the Circumſtances relating to them ſo as effectually to promote the good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of their Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>THE Foundations may be deſtroyed by Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs and Indifference with Regard to theſe Things. When no Encouragement is given to Learning, Ingenuity, Frugality &amp; Diligence, nor any Thing done to diſcountenance &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Idleneſs, Extravagance &amp; Intemperance; when Laws are not provided, or, if made, not executed to prevent thoſe vicious Practices which directly tend to procure public Miſery, or to encourage thoſe virtuous, amiable &amp; uſeful Things which promote the Happineſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Society, then are the Foundation, in this View of Things deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>IN this Caſe vicious Perſons, ſuch eſpecially as are addicted to the particular Vices that have been now mentioned, will think themſelves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. They may be as idle, extravagant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate as they pleaſe; they may gratify their
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006692_0026_1029A7AF966181E8"/>
Corruptions, at the Expence of their Eſtates, their Health and their Lives; they may bring their Families to Poverty, and leave them a Burthen to the Public; they may indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Drunkenneſs and Rioting, to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance of the Quiet and Peace of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and to the Prejudice of the public Happineſs of Society; they may do all this without any one to puniſh them, or make them aſhamed: And this theſe miſerable Creatures call Freedom, Liberty and Happineſs. But <hi>What can the Righteous</hi> now <hi>do?</hi> The moſt valuable members of Society muſt, in ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, bear a very heavy Burthen: The Public muſt be ſupported by laying ſevere Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es on uſeful Arts and painful Labour, that the luxurious and intemperate, uſeleſs and even hurtful Members of the Community, may gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their Corruptions at the cheaper Rate. He that has been endeavouring by honeſt Labour, to make Proviſion for his own Family, ſhall find himſelf oppreſſed by being obliged to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Children of his Neighbour, reduced to Nakedneſs &amp; Starving by the Idleneſs, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, or Drunkenneſs of their Parents. I will add but one Thing more.</p>
            <p>IV. CIVIL Government is the Foundation of Social Happineſs as it is deſign'd and adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to encourage and promote Religion, and to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006692_0027_1029A7B1187517D8"/>

            <p>NATURAL Religion is eſſential to Society; Morality is as indiſpenſibly nececeſſary to the Political Happineſs of Communities as it is to the Eternal Happineſs of particular Perſons. Were the Practice of the ſtricteſt &amp; moſt exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Morality, ſuch an one as the Goſpel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes &amp; requires, univerſally to prevail in any Community, it would conſtitute a ſort of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon Earth: And on the contrary, where it is wholly diſregarded, where Vice &amp; Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of every Kind maintain an unreſtrained Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, there is properly an Hell upon Earth. In the intermediate States between the univerſal Practiſe of Virtue and the uncontrouled Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Vice, a Society is happy or miſerable in Proportion as it approaches to one or the other of theſe Conditions.</p>
            <p>IF the Matter be conſidered in this Light, I ſuppoſe no reaſonable Man will deny that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is an eſpecial Object of the Civil Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate's Concern. 'Tis neceſſary to the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Society, and to the Security of every Member of it, that the Belief of the Being, and Perfections, and Providence of God ſhould be kept up; that men ſhould be acquainted with the Doctrin of the Immortality of the Soul, and of a future &amp; eternal State of Happineſs or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; that men ſhould look upon themſelves as
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006692_0028_1029A7B2E2B0DFE8"/>
accountable Creatures, and expect the great and awful Day when they muſt ſtand before the Tribunal of God, the Sovereign and univerſal Judge, to give account of the Actions done in the Fleſh, whether they have been good, or whether they have been evil. The firm Belief of ſuch Things as theſe is ſo eſſentially neceſſary to Social Happineſs, that he deſerves to be eſteemed an Enemy to mankind, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to weaken the Evidence, or leſſen the Importance of them. For without a Belief of theſe Things, what ſhall reſtrain men from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring, oppreſſing, or even deſtroying one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, when they have, as they frequently will have, opportunity of doing ſo without any great Danger of being detected &amp; puniſhed by the Magiſtrate? And if a ſenſe of theſe Things be taken away, or much weaken'd, what Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can we poſſibly have for the Truth of what men declare under the moſt ſolemn Oathes? It muſt therefore be allowed, that whatever is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to keep up the Belief &amp; Practice of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, belongs properly to the Province of the Civil Magiſtrate; and that his Authority cannot be exerted in a way more agreeable to the Will of God, from whom all Authority pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, or indeed more conducive to the Deſign of Magiſtracy, which is Social Happineſs, than when uſed to promote &amp; encourage theſe Things, and to puniſh and ſuppreſs whatever is contrary to them.</p>

THE Chriſtian Inſtitution conſidered as ſuch, or as diſtinguiſhed from natural Religion, is not abſolutely neceſſary to the Subſiſtance of Civil Society. This is evident ſince there were Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in the World, and ſome of them ſo wiſely formed and ſo juſtly adminiſter'd, that Social Happineſs was tolerably provided for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men were favoured with the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. Yet it muſt be owned that Morality is incomparably better explained, carried to a vaſtly higher Degree of Perfection, and inforced on the Minds of men b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ever was before, or than it poſſibly can be on any other Hypotheſis. And the Goſpel in all theſe Views does greatly conduce to Social Happineſs; and therefore ought to be ſupported, countenanced &amp; encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the Civil Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>BUT then though the Goſpel Revelation is wiſely ſuited to promote temporal Proſperity, or the Social Happineſs of mankind; yet this is not the principal Deſign of it. Future and Eternal Happineſs as it is in it ſelf of infinitely greater Importance than any Thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the preſent mean, ſhort &amp; uncertain State of Exiſtence, ſo it is the Thing principally aimed at in the Chriſtian Religion: <hi>The Salvation of the Soul</hi> is <hi>the End of</hi> that <hi>Faith</hi> which the Goſpel requires, and is deſigned to produce. The ſecuring this ought to be the firſt Concern
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006692_0030_1029A7BCDFFFA680"/>
&amp; principal Buſineſs of every particular Perſon; and to uſe the Chriſtian Religion as a Political Inſtrument of promoting Social Happineſs, in ſuch a manner as ſhall prevent its proving <hi>the Power of God to</hi> eternal <hi>Salvation</hi> to any who enjoy it, is to pervert the Goſpel it ſelf, by making the moſt important and ultimate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it give way to that which is of little or no Conſequence any further than it tends to promote it; or making the <hi>means</hi> inſtead of being ſubſervent to the <hi>End,</hi> inſtrumental in preventing the End's being attained.</p>
            <p>THE Goſpel diſcovers the Proviſion God has made, in his unſearchable Wiſdom &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounden Grace, for our being recovered to his Favour, renewed after his Image, and trained up to an actual Meetneſs for the everlaſting Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Himſelf. Jeſus Chriſt is in it <hi>ſet forth as the Propitiation</hi> for Sin<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 25.</note>, and revealed as that Glorious Perſon in whom it hath <hi>pleaſed the Father that all Fulneſs ſhould dwell</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Coloſs. i. 19.</note>, that ſo He might be the Fountain of Holineſs &amp; Comfort to his People. He that has a proper Senſe of the wonderful Love of God his Saviour, will find himſelf powerfully but ſweetly conſtrained to make all poſſible Returns of Homage, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Obedience to him: His greateſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light will be in honouring &amp; glorifying Him
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006692_0031_1029A7BE619AD050"/>
by a Life of univerſal Holineſs and perſevering Obedience; and in enjoying Communion with Him in the inſtituted Acts or Ordinances of Divine Worſhip. And it is impoſſible men ſhould have a well grounded Hope of being finally Accepted of God, or a regular Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of everlaſting Life without the Teſtimony of their own Conſciences to their Sincerity in theſe Things.</p>
            <p>NOW, if it be the Duty of every Man to <hi>work out his own Salvation,</hi> and to <hi>give Diligence to make his Calling &amp; Election ſure;</hi> if Men are ſtrictly obliged to make if their great Care to ſecure an Intereſt in the Favour of God, and obtain the Evidences of it; and if this cannot be done without having the Teſtimony of their own Hearts that they worſhip Him in Sincerity &amp; Truth; it muſt be allowed that every Man has a juſt Right to worſhip God in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he, after making due Inquiry, judges moſt agreeable to the Nature &amp; Will of God, and ſo moſt likely to obtain Acceptance with Him: Otherwiſe men will be oblig'd, under the ſevereſt of all Penalties to do that which at the ſame time they have no Right to do. The Right of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Judgment</hi> in matters <hi>merely Religious</hi> in their Nature, and of acting upon this Judgment by worſhipping God in ſuch a Manner as a man, with the beſt Light he can obtain, judges agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God's revealed Will, does therefore
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006692_0032_1029A7C02A009810"/>
ſtand upon as firm a Foundation as the Duty of endeavouring to ſecure the Favour &amp; Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. For no man can expect this by worſhipping God in ſuch a Way as he himſelf believes diſagreeable to Him, nor even in the Neglect of ſuch Worſhip as his own Conſcience, after ſuitable Endeavours to inform it, tells him God does require of him.</p>
            <p>THE Civil Magiſtrate, if he would anſwer the Deſign of his Office, inſtead of denying men this Right, or inflicting any Puniſhment on them for uſing it in a quiet, peaceable manner, ought to protect and defend them in it: Otherwiſe Government it ſelf, which certainly was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Good of men, will on the whole be a Diſadvantage to them. For if the Exerciſe of this Right be neceſſary to the eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men, it is certain that none of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages men derive from Civil Government, can balance the Diſadvantage of being deprived of it. The free allowance of this Right, is ſo far from diſturbing the Peace of Civil Society, that it is undoubtedly one of the beſt Means of preſerving and ſecuring it. If the Magiſtrate countenances &amp; ſupports one Party in oppreſſing &amp; perſecuting another, the Conſequence will be, that they arrive at a greater &amp; more irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſtance from each other; Animoſities and Quarrels may be expected; and, when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are near equal in Numbers &amp; Strength, a
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006692_0033_1029A7C1ACFBC328"/>
Civil War is too often the Effect. But when the Magiſtrate protects all peaceable Subjects in their Religious as well as Civil Rights, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers no one to oppreſs or diſturb another, they are moſt likely to act the Part of good Subjects toward their Rulers, and that of good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours toward one another: And this is the moſt probable Way to bring men to unite in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as Affection.</p>
            <p>'TIS indeed poſſible for men to uſe this <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs;</hi> they may in Preaching or even in Prayer uſe ſeditious or treaſonable Expreſſions, they may revile the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of their People, contemn &amp; diſparage the good Laws of their Country, or ſlander &amp; abuſe their Neighbours. When ever they do ſo, they are beyond all doubt juſtly puniſhable by the Civil Magiſtrate, and the Peace &amp; Happineſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Society do ſomtimes make it neceſſary that they ſhould be puniſhed with ſeverity. There is nothing in this at all inconſiſtent with Liberty of Conſcience; for my Right to worſhip God according to the Dictates of my own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence does by no means include a Right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the public Happineſs of Civil Society, by ſubverting the Government of it; nor does it in the leaſt Degree authorize me to revile my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, or to defame &amp; abuſe any Man. Let then Treaſon &amp; Sedition, Slander &amp; Defamation, and every Thing that deſtroys Social Happineſs
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006692_0034_1029A7CA296D9F10"/>
be puniſhed as they deſerve; let no Pretence of Conſcience excuſe any Perſon in the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Crimes; let their being committed under the Notion of Praying, or of performing any other act of Divine Worſhip be eſteemed (as it really is) a great Aggravation of the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Action, and all the Intentions of Civil Government will be anſwered without at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing Liberty of Conſcience, or taking from quiet &amp; peaceable Men the invaluable Right of worſhipping God in ſuch a Manner as they believe He requires and will accept.</p>
            <p>PRINCIPLES and Practices which don't affect Civil Society, and ſo cannot be ſaid to have any <hi>Political</hi> Evil in them, may yet be evil in a Religious or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Senſe, and ſo may juſtly expoſe Men to Church Cenſures: But then theſe Cenſures ought not to have Civil Puniſhments annexed to them; becauſe it is only Political Evil that deſerves Political Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006692_0035_10293E1F523B09B8"/>
Cenſure, cannot, I think, be reconciled to theſe Precepts. But neither theſe nor any other Texts of Scripture that I know of require the Civil Magiſtrate to annex temporal Pains and Penalties to Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures.</p>
            <p>WHILE the Civil Magiſtrate continued Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, the Church had as much Right to cenſure its own members as it has now; and while its Cenſures were adminiſtred agreeable to the Will and Command of Chriſt, &amp; with a Dependance on Him to ſucceed them, they beſt anſwered the Intentions for which they were inſtituted. But when the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire became Chriſtian, 'twas pretended that it belonged to the Magiſtrate to ſtrengthen the Hands of the Church by annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Civil Puniſhments to her Cenſures. When this Point was once gained, the Party that could by any means ingratiate it ſelf with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, was ſure to perſecute all the Reſt. They all had their Turns of Suffering, and they that thus <hi>took the Sword</hi> did many of them <hi>periſh by the Sword: Conſtantine</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, baniſhed the <hi>Arians,</hi> and his Son did the ſame by the <hi>Orthodox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT was at firſt pretended that this belonged to the Civil Magiſtrate by virtue of his being <hi>a nurſing Father</hi> to the Church; and 'twas ſaid that <hi>mild</hi> &amp; <hi>moderate</hi> Puniſhments were all that were deſired, or proper to be uſed in this Caſe: But in Proceſs of Time the Magiſtrate was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006692_0036_1029A7CBABAE7AD8"/>
from the honourable Character of a <hi>nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Father</hi> into the mean and ignoble one of a mere <hi>Executioner.</hi> In ſome Countries which call themſelves Chriſtian, the Civil Magiſtrate is at this Day obliged, under the Penalty of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which with them includes a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of his Temporal Dominion, to inflict <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Puniſhments</hi> of the moſt <hi>cruel</hi> &amp; <hi>barbarous</hi> Kind, upon all that are condemned by the Church for Hereſy. And tho' the Perſon be one of his own Subjects, one whom he is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by his Office to protect &amp; Defend, yet he is not allowed to look into the Proceſs againſt him, or at all to inquire whether the Sentence he executes be juſt or unjuſt<note n="†" place="bottom">Vid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>WHEN the Foundations are deſtroyed by the Civil Magiſtrate's neglecting to countenance and encourage Religion, or to protect men in the peaceable Exerciſe of their Religious Rights; and eſpecially when he joins with one Party to perſecute &amp; deſtroy all that diſſent from them, 'tis eaſy to ſee that the Righteous will be bro't under peculiar Difficulties, and be the greateſt Sufferers. A man of no Religion can comply with the eſtabliſhed Religion, how corrupt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be; He that believes nothing can profeſs any Thing; he that makes Conſcience of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can conform to any Thing; and he that
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006692_0037_1029A7CD2F6CE650"/>
cares not whether he worſhips God at all, will not be very ſolicitous about the manner or modes of Worſhip. Thus the irreligious Part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind can eaſily eſcape Perſecution in theſe Caſes: But the Righteous, they who make Conſcience of what they do, cannot ſubſcribe Articles of Faith which they eſteem falſe or unfound, nor profeſs what they do not believe; they cannot conform to what they judge corrupt &amp; ſinful, though eſtabliſhed by the higheſt Human Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; nor dare they neglect to attend ſuch Worſhip &amp; Ordinances as they find God has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, even tho' the Laws of their Country ſhould make it penal to attend them. Thus Men of Honeſty &amp; Sincerity, ſuch as really en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſerve &amp; pleaſe God, and to obtain his Favour to eternal Life, are the Men that will ſuffer when the Foundations of common Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Safety are thus deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>I COME now to the <hi>IMPROVEMENT</hi> of this Subject. And here,</p>
            <p>I. WITH all the Defference due to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Magiſtracy, and yet with the Freedom that becomes a Miniſter of the Goſpel, I would addreſs the Honorable the GOVERNOR, the DEPUTY-GOVERNOR, &amp; ASSISTANTS of this Colony, with the REPRESENTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVES <hi>of the Free-men</hi> of the ſame, now aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in a <hi>general Court of Election.</hi>

               <hi>My honoured Fathers,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE been endeavouring, tho' in a weak and imperfect Manner, to repreſent the Deſign and Uſefulneſs, and conſequently the Dignity &amp; Importance of that Office which Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has placed you in. My Deſign herein has been to promote ſuch a Direction &amp; Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Authority you are veſted with, as is agreeable to the wiſe &amp; benevolent Deſigns of God in the Inſtitution of Civil Government; ſuch an one as ſhall render you eminent Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors to the People of this Colony, and the dignified Inſtruments of promoting Public Peace and Social Happineſs.</p>
            <p>THERE is nothing of greater Importance to Men in any Office, than frequently calling to Mind the original Deſign and great End of the Office they ſuſtain. This naturally ſuggeſts to their Thoughts what are the peculiar Duties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on them, what the great God expects and requires of them, and how they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct themſelves at preſent, if they would at laſt be able to give their Accounts with Joy. In this View the Practice of preaching on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion which I ſuppoſe has been continued from the very Beginning of this Government, appears very reaſonable &amp; proper. For though it will frequently happen (as I am very ſenſible it does this Day in particular) that the Preacher ſhall have leſs acquaintance with the Nature &amp; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006692_0039_1029A7D7430160F0"/>
of Government than a great Part of his Hearers, yet being obliged to apply his mind with ſome cloſe Attention to the Subject he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes upon, he may perhaps ſuggeſt ſome Things, which though known, would not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe have been ſo diſtinctly thought of, and ſo one who cannot Pretend to inſtruct you, may yet <hi>ſtir up your minds by way of Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOVERNMENT is the Foundation of the Peace and Happineſs of men conſidered as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into Civil Society; it is ſo in the gracious Deſign of God, and it will be ſo in the Event, at leaſt in all ordinary Caſes, if it be ſuitably Conducted and Adminiſtred. The two great Things neceſſary to this Purpoſe, are, the enacting wiſe &amp; righteous Laws, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring Juſtice according to them, both in Civil and Criminal Cauſes, with a ſteady &amp; impartial Hand. Theſe both belong to your Province, as you are aſſembled this Day not only in your Legiſlative Capacity, but alſo to appoint ſuch executive Officers to whom the Adminiſtration of Law &amp; Juſtice is to be committed. Allow me to ſay that both God &amp; man expect that in both theſe important Branches of your Authority you keep the great &amp; original Deſign of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a near View, and ſincerely aim at pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Public Welfare of His Majeſty's Subjec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

THE happy Conſtitution of this Government is ſuch, that I cannot think it needful to caution you againſt carrying the Civil Authority of the Magiſtrate too high, or fixing a Tyrannical Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration upon us: Since you are Members of the ſame Society with us, and hold your Seats in the Adminiſtration over us by the annual Choice of the Community. I wiſh I could ſay there was as little Danger of having the Foundations of our Public Peace &amp; Social Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs deſtroyed, or even ſhaken, by Popular Diſcontent and Uneaſineſs. This I take to be the peculiar Danger in Elective Governments. It will frequently happen that ſuch Meaſures as are neceſſary, or highly conducive to Public Good, ſhall be very unpopular. People in general cannot be thought ſufficiently ſkilled in the Nature of Government, or enough acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with public Affairs to know what Meaſures are proper to be taken in a great variety of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that frequently happen. And though, if let alone, they will not ordinarily be deſirous of a Change of Government, ſo long as the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration is ſteady, uniform, and impartial, and the good Ends of Government are in a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Degree anſwered; Yet it muſt be owned that it is too eaſy for crafty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſigning Men to work upon them, to propagate a ſpirit of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs &amp; Diſaffection, and ſo to lead a Society into Parties. In this Caſe the Magiſtrate who
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006692_0041_1029A7DA849825C0"/>
eſpouſes an unpopular Meaſure, tho' it be in it ſelf ever ſo juſt &amp; reaſonable, and even neceſſary, incurs the Danger of being left out at the next E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. In ſuch Circumſtances the Security of this Colony depends very much upon the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution &amp; Virtue of its Magiſtrates. Should ſuch a Caſe happen, we truſt that you, our Political Fathers, will approve your ſelves the firm and immoveable Foundations of our Happineſs, by ſteadily purſuing what in your Wiſdom you judge our true Intereſt, even though it ſhould happen to be againſt the prevailing Opinion of the People. For it certainly becomes you as Fathers of your Country, not to humour &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge us to our Hurt, but by a wiſe, righteous, and mild Adminiſtration to promote our Good.</p>
            <p>THE Things that have been mentioned as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Social Happineſs, ſuch as the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men in their Perſons &amp; Properties, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting ſuch Things as tend to the Public Good, and ſuppreſſing whatever is contrary thereto, the countenancing &amp; encouraging Religion &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting men in the quiet Enjoyment of Religious Rights &amp; Privileges, deſerve your ſerious Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration &amp; conſtant Attention. For without theſe Things the Intentions of Government can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be anſwered, and a ſlight Attention or Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with regard to any one of them will greatly endanger, if not certainly deſtroy the Foundations of Public Peace &amp; Social Happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:006692_0042_1029A7DC06536280"/>
PERMIT me to recommend it as a Thing worthy of your moſt ſerious Conſideration, whether nothing further can be done to reform mens Morals, &amp; to put a ſtop to the Growth of Injuſtice and Profaneneſs, Idleneſs and Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, Intemperance, and Uncleanneſs, which are ſo viſibly increaſing upon us, and do ſo aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully threaten to be our Ruin. We have good Laws againſt ſuch Vices as theſe; but it deſerves to be conſidered whether there is not ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proviſion wanting to carry them into ſuch a vigorous &amp; ſteady Execution, as the preſent ſtate of Things ſeems plainly to require. Penal Laws are deſigned to procure Public Safety; Offenders are to be puniſhed that others may hear and fear, and ſo be reſtrained from ſuch Practices as are inconſiſtent with the Safety and Happineſs of Human Society. If therefore the Laws againſt <hi>Theft</hi> &amp; <hi>Burglary</hi> (for Inſtance) ſerve no higher Purpoſe than to help the Owner in recovering Goods Stolen from him, which 'tis generally known is too often the Caſe; though it cannot be ſaid that theſe Laws do no Good at all, yet it is plain that they do not anſwer the proper Intention of Penal Laws, nor afford that Security to the Public which Social Happineſs evidently requires. And indeed Penal Laws in general, if they are not put in Execution, do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hinder than promote the Good of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, as they inure People to a Diſregard to the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:006692_0043_1029A7E44814C190"/>
Law, and a Contempt of the Authority of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
            <p>IF the Reaſon of ſo general a Remiſneſs in the Execution of Penal Laws be inquired into, perhaps it will be found very much owing to our Executive Officers acting ſo much Singly, and not meeting in a Body as is practiſed in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Governments. It is not to be wonder'd at if a ſingle <hi>Grand-Juryman,</hi> or a ſingle <hi>Juſtice of the Peace,</hi> ſhould in many Caſes be ignorant of the Duty of his Office, or at a Loſs with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Method and Forms in which he ought to proceed: Nor even, if in ſome Caſes he ſhould be intimidated, and afraid to proceed againſt ſome particular Offenders. Whereas if they were regularly to meet in a Body, and act conjunctly, one would inſtruct &amp; encourage an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; they would thus be under much greater Advantages for ſuppreſſing vicious &amp; deſtructive Practices, and there would be much leſs Danger of encouraging Wickedneſs by ſuffering Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to go unpuniſhed. If I am rightly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this is the only Government within the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions; in which the <hi>Juſtices</hi> and <hi>Grand-Jury</hi> of a County do not ſtatedly meet in their Seſſions of the Peace: And perhaps if they did ſo with us, it would be as uncommon to ſee an open Tranſgreſſor of the Laws of his Country eſcape with Impunity, as it now is to ſee ſuch an one proſecuted to Effect.</p>

'TIS Part of the magiſtrate's Office to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and promote Religion, and to defend the Subject in the peaceable Exerciſe of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Rights. And this, you will ſuffer me to ſay, is in an eſpecial manner incumbent on you, my honoured Fathers; ſince Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has placed you at the Head of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment originally ſetled on a Religious Deſign, and by an excellent Set of men who thought themſelves obliged to bear Teſtimony againſt Human Inſtitutions in Religion, and Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Conſciences of men; and who freely left all the Delights of their native Country, &amp; retired into this then howling wilderneſs, that they might, without Offence or Diſturbance to others, injoy the ineſtimable Privilege of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God agreeable to the Directions of his Word, without any Additions or Impoſitions of men; and that they might leave this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege as an invaluable Inheritance to their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity after them.</p>
            <p>THE Churches planted by theſe noble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors and ſufferers for the Cauſe of pure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Eccleſiaſtical Liberty, think themſelves to have ſome Title to the peculiar Protection and Favour of their Civil Rulers. And I hope they will never abuſe it by deſiring any Thing inconſiſtant with an extenſive Toleration of ſuch as conſcientiouſly and peaceably diſſent from them: I hope a Spirit of Ambition, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny

and Domination, ſo unbecoming the Diſciples of the <hi>meek and lowly JESUS,</hi> will never poſſeſs theſe Churches or their Miniſters: I truſt they will always be far from aſking you to paſs Acts of Uniformity, to oblige all men by Civil Penalties to conform or ſubmit to them; or from deſiring you to inflict <hi>temporal Puniſhments</hi> on ſuch as they cenſure for Faults that are <hi>merely Eccleſiaſtical</hi> in their Nature, and do not affect the Peace and Happineſs of Civil Society. And while they act thus, I make no doubt of your approving Yourſelves <hi>nurſing Fathers</hi> to them, by protecting them in all the Rights and Privileges which belong to them as the Eſtabliſhment of this Colony, by counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing and encouraging their Miniſtry, and affording them ſuch Aſſiſtance as they may at any Time need in raiſing a proper Support, &amp; decent Maintenance for them.</p>
            <p>COULD I think, my honored Fathers, you need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſtrong Motive to excite you to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of theſe Duties of your exalted Station, I need not depart from my Text to find ſuch an one. <hi>If the Foundation be deſtroyed, what can the Righteous do?</hi> God the Sovereign Ruler &amp; Judge of Magiſtrates and People, is Himſelf a moſt righteous Being, and He loves his own Image in his Creatures; <hi>His Countenance beholdeth the upright.</hi> Now theſe Perſons who are ſo dear to God, are the very men that will immediately

            <p>II. THIS Diſcourſe is to be addreſſed to the MINISTERS <hi>of the Goſpel. My Reverend Fathers and Brethren,</hi> the Subject I have now
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:006692_0048_1029A7F2ED41FFA0"/>
been diſcourſing of ſuggeſts many Things worthy of your ſerious Conſideration, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed than the Time will allow me diſtinctly to mention. Suffer me however briefly to apply ſome of them to you, as well as to my Self.</p>
            <p>THE great Deſign of that ſacred Office we ſuſtain, is to promote the Glory of God, by advancing the Intentions of redeeming Wiſdom and Grace in the eternal Salvation of men. It is of infinite Conſequence that we keep this in our View, and that our Conduct in Public and Private, be directed and influenced by a ſteady and conſtant Regard to it. The <hi>Foundations</hi> we are principally concerned with, are thoſe <hi>of Repentance from dead Works, &amp; of Faith towards God.</hi> That theſe may be laid deep and firm in the Hearts of men, and ſo as to bear the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure of an holy &amp; religious Life, we muſt endeavour to awaken careleſs &amp; ſtupid Sinners, who are ſleeping on the Brink of eternal Ruin, and to warn them <hi>to flee from the wrath to come;</hi> and we muſt direct the weary and heavy laden Sinner to Jeſus who is <hi>the Way, the Truth, &amp; the Life,</hi> and but by whom <hi>no man cometh unto the Father.</hi> Having led our Hearers to Chriſt both for Righteouſneſs to juſtify their Perſons, &amp; for Grace to renew &amp; ſanctify their Natures, and to furniſh their Souls with the Principles of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical &amp; acceptable Obedience; we are on this Foundation to build all the Virtues &amp; Duties of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:006692_0049_1029A7F471310868"/>
the Chriſtian Life. We muſt explain all the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Moral Law, in that Latitude &amp; Extent wherein they are inculcated in the Goſpel; and we muſt inforce the Obſervation of them by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe exalted and powerful Obligations to Holineſs and practical Religion which are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly Evangelical, in the ſtrongeſt and moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Light we are capable of.</p>
            <p>'TIS no ſmall or inconſiderable Part of our Work to explain &amp; inforce Relative Duties, or the Virtues which are peculiarly neceſſary &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to Social Happineſs. Religion never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in a more amiabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Light than when it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes men to a ready &amp; chearful Performance of relative &amp; ſocial Duties. When they that before were ſtubborn &amp; diſobedient to their Superiors in Civil, Sacred, or Domeſtic Relations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ready to join with the turbulent &amp; facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in fomenting Uneaſineſs &amp; promoting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, become ſubmiſſive &amp; obedient, ready to pay all proper Regards to thoſe who are ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and ſtudious to promote the ſame Temper in all they converſe with; when they that once were proud, haughty &amp; inſolent to their Inferiors, become humble, affable and gentle; when ſuch as formerly were cruel, malicious, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful &amp; implacable, become kind, meek, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable &amp; forgiving; when, I ſay, ſuch a Change as this appears in a man's Temper &amp; Conduct, upon his profeſſing himſelf a Chriſtian, 'tis
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:006692_0050_1029A7F644EA4530"/>
hardly poſſible for an Infidel to doubt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Original of the Goſpel. But when nothing like this appears on Men's making the higheſt Profeſſion of Religion, and even boaſting of their Experiences of a work of Grace on their own Souls; and eſpecially when the viſible Change is the very Reverſe of this, what can be expected but that the ſacred Name of God ſhould be blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, and the Minds of many filled with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable Prejudices againſt all ſerious Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? And when a righteous GOD <hi>maketh Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for Blood,</hi> He will <hi>remember</hi> and take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of Perſons of this Character, for in their <hi>Skirts</hi> will be <hi>found Blood,</hi> even the Blood of Religion it ſelf.</p>
            <p>'TIS our Duty, my Fathers &amp; Brethren, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our Hearers to adorn the Doctrin of God their Saviour by the Diſcharge of Social Duties, and in a particular Manner of thoſe they owe to their Civil Rulers, the Diſcharge of which is, as we have heard, ſo very neceſſary to render Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment a ſolid &amp; durable Foundation of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Peace &amp; Happineſs. The inſpired Apoſtles thought this a matter of ſo great Importance that they frequently mention it, and inſiſt upon it in their Epiſtles: Nor did they think it enough <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>to obey Magiſtrates, to be ready to every good work; to ſpeak Evil of no man, to be no Braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, but gentle, ſhewing all meekneſs to all men.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Titus iii, 1, 2.</note> By obſerving theſe and ſuch like Apoſtolic Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections we ſhall contribute in our Station, to ſtrengthen the Foundations of public Peace, &amp; to promote the Welfare &amp; Happineſs of Mankind.</p>
            <p>OUR Lord &amp; Maſter, whoſe we are &amp; whom it ought to be our higheſt Ambition to imitate and ſerve, diſcovered the greateſt Love to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that the World ever heard of; ſuch Love as is the object of the Admiration &amp; Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Angelic World, and the delightful Subject of thoſe Praiſes which are ſung in Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic Strains in the Temple above. This led Him to pity &amp; relieve them under the Miſeries of the preſent Life, as well as to provide for their future &amp; eternal Happineſs. The Prophet ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly deſcribes Him as <hi>bearing our Griefs,</hi> and <hi>carrying</hi> away our <hi>Sorrows,</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſai. liii, 4.</note> and tho' this ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately refers to his Sufferings for our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet the Evangeliſt ſpeaks of this Prophecy as being in ſome ſenſe <hi>fulfilled</hi> when Jeſus <hi>caſt out</hi> evil <hi>Spirits, and healed all that were Sick</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth viii, 16. 17.</note>. In Proportion as we have the Spirit &amp; Temper of Chriſt, we ſhall be influenced by a tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, both for the temporal &amp; eternal Welfare of Men. And we take the direct Method to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:006692_0052_1029A800503D2678"/>
both, when we ſincerely endeavour to bring our Hearers to practiſe Social Virtues from truly Chriſtian Principles; teaching them to <hi>render to all their Dues; Tribute to whom Tribute is due; Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom; Fear to whom Fear; Honour to whom Honour; to Owe no man any Thing, but to Love one another</hi>

            </p>
            <p>BUT it is more than Time that I ſhould,</p>
            <p>III. IN the laſt Place, apply what has been ſaid in an Addreſs to this numerous Aſſembly. And this I muſt do in a few Words.</p>
            <p>YOU ſee, my Brethren, what abundant Reaſon we have to be thankful to God for the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Civil Government, and for caſting our Lot under ſo equitable a Conſtitution &amp; ſo righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous &amp; mild an Adminiſtration; that we enjoy ſuch diſtinguiſhing Privileges, &amp; that the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our public Peace &amp; Happineſs do as yet ſtand ſo firm &amp; ſecure. It becomes us at all times to maintain &amp; expreſs a thankful Senſe of theſe diſtinguiſhing Favours of Heaven, &amp; eſpecially ſhould we do ſo, when as at this Day, we are favoured with the Return of an <hi>Anniverſary</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LECTION. It is a Time of Joy with us, and it becomes us to <hi>rejoice in the Lord,</hi> and triumph in the God of our Salvation. Thankfulneſs to God for theſe Favours, if it be ſincere, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:006692_0053_1029A801D52187D8"/>
in us great Carefulneſs that we do not by any means abuſe and forfeit our Privileges; &amp; it will prevent thoſe Uneaſineſſes, Diſcontents &amp; Diviſions, which, if indulged, may juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke a holy God to deprive us of them, and to turn this, which has for ſo long a Time been a Day of Gladneſs and Rejoicing, into a Day of Lamentation and Mourning.</p>
            <p>THOUGH Government is deſigned and ſuited to ſecure Public Happineſs, and though Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates wiſely &amp; faithfully endeavour to promote the great deſign of their Office, &amp; continually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to this very Thing; yet it will be in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the People to defeat the Deſign, and render themſelves &amp; their Poſterity miſerable after all. They take the direct way to Ruin, when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge groundleſs Jealouſies of their Rulers, and ſpread idle Reports to the Diſadvantage of their Characters, when they join with the Diſcontented &amp; Uneaſy, &amp; by their Clamours, Animoſities &amp; Diviſions diſhearten their Rulers, weaken the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Government, and render it leſs capable of producing its ſalutary Effects. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple contribute to their own Miſery when they indulge themſelves in Idleneſs, Extravagance, Intemperance &amp; the like vicious Practices, which as we have ſeen tend to deſtroy the public Peace and Happineſs of Human Society.</p>
            <p>I MUST add, that People really help to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Foundations of their own Happineſs,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:006692_0054_1029A8051F76E6B0"/>
when from a reſtleſs &amp; uneaſy Spirit, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually &amp; without any juſt Reaſon endeavouring a Change of the principal Perſons in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Government. I know the Freemen of this Colony have the Right of chuſing their own Rulers annually, and I acknowlege it is a great Privilege, ſuch an one as if wiſely improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will greatly conduce to the perpetuating our Proſperity &amp; Happineſs. But then it muſt be granted, on the other Hand, that it is capable of being abuſed to the great Detriment of Public Happineſs. If the Freemen of this Colony ſhould ever admit it as a Principle, or make it the Rule in giving their Votes, that a Magiſtrate of known Ability &amp; approved Faithfulneſs is to be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, merely becauſe he cannot be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuch Meaſures as he eſteems prejudicial to his Country, tho' they happen to be popular, what is this but in Effect ſaying that neither Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom nor Fidelity are of any uſe in a Magiſtrate? For he that has neither of them, can Vote accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Humour or Prejudices of the People, and in many Caſes is more likely to do ſo than he that has them both. And ſurely a Principle which would render the moſt neceſſary Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in a Magiſtrate uſeleſs, muſt tend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Foundations of public Happineſs, and therefore ought not to be admitted, or acted upon.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Let us all endeavour, in our ſeveral Stations, faithfully to Diſcharge the Duties
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:006692_0055_1029A80A2FA55788"/>
incumbent on us, and wiſely to improve the advantages put into our Hands for promoting the Glory of Divine goodneſs both in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and eternal Happineſs of men. To quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us to the greater Activity &amp; Diligence in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Generation according to the will of God, let us conſider that all our abilities &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for uſefulneſs are Talents commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our Truſt by our Great Lord, &amp; Maſter, and that the Improvement of them muſt at laſt be accounted for to Him. Let us call to mind that neither the higheſt pitch of Grandure and Authority nor the loweſt State of Meanneſs &amp; Obſcurity will exempt any Perſon from being called to a ſtrict Account. Let us think before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of the great and awful Day, when <hi>the dead both ſmall and great</hi> ſhall ſtand before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat of Chriſt, and remember that we who this Day appear before God in his Houſe, as men of ſuch different Orders &amp; Degrees as are ſuited to the preſent State of Things, ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably never meet again in one Aſſembly, till that important &amp; deciſive Day when all theſe Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſhall vaniſh, and we ſhall all ſtand upon a Level at the Bar of a righteous Judge <hi>that every one may receive the Things done in his Body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now, <hi>the Lord grant unto us</hi> all <hi>that</hi> we <hi>may find mercy of the Lord in that Day.</hi> AMEN.</p>
