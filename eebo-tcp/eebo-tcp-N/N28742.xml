            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>****CONSIDERING the end for which man is made and placed in this world, the condition of his preſent life, and his connexion with a future ſtate, it is of the utmoſt importance to him to make a right eſtimate, and good improvement, of his time. It is in this life he muſt take a right direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he would make a happy progreſs through
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038323_0004_1011A116D530C248"/>
eternity. It is here he muſt begin to live <hi>well,</hi> if he would live hereafter in the enjoyment of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. As he muſt neceſſarily look forward to that period when "time ſhall be no longer," when the revolutions of the earth, which now meaſure off his exiſtence in ſtated and regular portions, ſhall ceaſe, and days and nights, months and years, ſhall be done away, it becomes him, while they laſt, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to uſe them to the great end for which they are given—to prepare for eternity.</p>
            <p>If man were to live here forever, his life paſſing on continually, without the interruption of death, it would be <hi>wiſe</hi> in him to make a right and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent uſe of his time; becauſe wiſdom, which is the true glory of man, conſiſts in uſing every thing to the beſt end; and this, as it reſpects the life of man, is in doing that which gives him the greateſt dignity and happineſs. The reverſe of this is folly. For he who miſuſes his time, ſpending it in the purſuits of vice, only accumulates to himſelf a load of miſery, which makes life unpleaſant and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, if not undeſirable. And he who ſpends his time in idleneſs, without much employment in actions either good or bad, ſuffers a diſeaſe to grow
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038323_0005_1011A1189C1646F0"/>
upon him, which will finally make him in capable of enjoyment, fill him with uneaſineſs, and render his exiſtence miſerable.</p>
            <p>Man was made for action; and he cannot tranſgreſs this law of his nature without injuring himſelf. He was ordained to ſeek and find hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in a courſe of good actions. He ought not therefore to expect to find it in idleneſs, or the purſuits of vice. He muſt be active, but he muſt alſo be virtuous; otherwiſe he perverts the end of his being, which leads to miſery.</p>
            <p>If it be true, that, in the preſent ſtate, virtue generally tends to happineſs, and vice to miſery, it is alſo true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that our good or bad conduct will produce much more enjoyment and ſuffering in the future; for this is a ſtate of probation and trial to mankind; the other is to be a ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, in which men are to receive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deeds done in the body.</p>
            <p>Though, in general, happineſs reſults from good actions, and miſery from bad, in this life, yet it is not uniformly the caſe. Good men are ſometimes permitted to ſuffer, even for the exerciſe of virtue; and the wicked are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038323_0006_1011A11B2A236638"/>
to triumph, and to enjoy for a while the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt they reap in the field of iniquity. It is by proſperity and adverſity God tries men here; but we are cautioned againſt being overcome by theſe trials, and exhorted to look to the end. We are neither to be frighted from the path of duty by the ſufferings of the virtuous, nor decoyed from it by the temporary proſperity of the wicked. Mankind, in all their actions, ſhould look forward to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate, where virtue will be highly rewarded, and vice ſeverely puniſhed; and conſider what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their actions will have upon their future, rather than on their preſent life. If the practice of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs be not always profitable to the righteous in giving them the good things of this life, it will give them, in adverſity, that conſolation and hope which are better than the gains of ungodlineſs; and it will finally give them the ineſtimable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of heaven. For the Apoſtle aſſures us, that in "the day of the righteous judgment of God, he will render to every man according to his deeds: to them who, by patient continuance in well doing, ſeek for glory, honour, and immortality, he will give eternal life; but unto them that are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038323_0007_1011A11EC15D5D80"/>
and do not obey the truth, but obey unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, he will render indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh, upon every ſoul of man that doth evil." Seeing, then, that as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of men has been here, ſo will their condition be hereafter, it is neceſſary we ſhould be diligent in uſing our time <hi>well</hi>; ſpending it in the faithful diſcharge of our duty; making the moſt we can of the ſhort term of life now allotted us, by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying it in good and virtuous actions.</p>
            <p>I do not mean to aſſert, that every moment of our time, not neceſſarily employed in taking the refreſhment of animal nature, muſt be devoted to bodily action. There are mental as well as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal employments belonging to the duty of man. The mind muſt be refreſhed, as well as the body: it muſt have its food and its exerciſe; and our wiſdom is to be ſhewn in the proper diſtribution of time between ſtudy and labour, thinking and acting. As animal beings, we muſt provide for the ſupport and comfort of the body: but as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional beings, our principal care muſt be to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the improvement and happineſs of the mind. Our cares for the former ſhould be ſubſervient to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038323_0008_1011A12140547130"/>
thoſe for the latter. The body is the vehicle in which the ſoul acts, and through which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives many pleaſures; but mere ſenſual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are of the lower kind, and our animal is the leaſt valuable part of our nature. We ought duly to prize every enjoyment God has given us; but we ſhould prefer thoſe of the nobleſt kind, and on which he has ſtamped the greateſt value. What ſhall a man profit if he gain the whole world of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſures, and loſe all the exquiſite delights which belong to the ſoul—all that pure and refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed happineſs an intelligent being is capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying? A part of our time, therefore, ought to be appropriated to <hi>thinking</hi> and <hi>reflecting</hi>; for without this we cannot improve the mind, lead a rational life, nor anſwer the principal end of our being.</p>
            <p>He who reflects properly on his nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, muſt ſoon perceive, that the intention of his Creator in placing him here, was not merely that he might enjoy the ſenſual or ſocial pleaſures of the preſent life. His views and expectations are neceſſarily carried forward to another ſtate: his hopes and fears connect him with it, and he feels
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038323_0009_1011A1240D87AB38"/>
himſelf bound to act with reference to it. Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation teaches him to contemplate the future ſtate of immortality as a <hi>ſpiritual ſtate</hi> of purity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; full of wiſdom and love, as well as of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable happineſs. He will therefore ſee the neceſſity of a diligent improvement of his time, to become qualified to enjoy it. In many things it is the contraſt of our preſent condition: and if we would obtain the qualifications for it, we muſt oppoſe every thing in ourſelves we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive contrary to it. We ſhall find we have much to do in <hi>time</hi> to prepare for <hi>eternity.</hi> We have the evil propenſities of our nature to reſtrain and ſubdue, the paſſions to control and regulate, ſin to mortify and conquer. We have knowledge to acquire, of our duty, of the beſt manner of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and overcoming temptations, and of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good and virtuous actions. We muſt <hi>watch</hi> with vigilance, and <hi>pray</hi> with fervency, that we be not overcome by our ſpiritual enemies. We have many and various talents to improve; and time, which is not the leaſt important talent, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces all the others. How many duties have we to diſcharge which reſpect ourſelves! how many
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038323_0010_1011A125978B5FD0"/>
ſocial duties which regard others! We have much to learn and practiſe, if we would "abound in the work of the Lord." And, though we have the grace of God to aſſiſt us in this chriſtian courſe and warfare, we need to uſe great diligence to make progreſſive improvement in it. Our paſſions will ſometimes get the advantage over our reaſon and judgment, and a ſenſe of our duty—impede our progreſs towards heaven, and throw us back upon the world. It requires every aid of exertion, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, diligence and firmneſs, "to perſevere in the ways of well doing"—to lead that life of piety and virtue which will fit us for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of immortality.</p>
            <p>I mean not to ſuggeſt, that we can <hi>merit</hi> eternal life by our own works. This is the free gift of God to men through Jeſus Chriſt. But he has not promiſed it to any who continue in diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who ſpend their time in idleneſs, or employ it in the works of iniquity. He requires the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of holineſs to fit us for it. "Ye ſhall be holy," ſays he, "for I am holy;" and, "with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord." By the uſe of the means of grace, God has appointed, we
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038323_0011_1011A12A1DF9B0D8"/>
may become holy; but we muſt be diligent in the uſe of them, to make progreſs in a holy life.****</p>
            <p>Enough has been ſaid to ſhew the importance of time to us, and the neceſſity of making a right uſe of it, that we may be prepared for that final, though uncertain, period when time ſhall ceaſe, and eternity, as it reſpects us, begin; and when all, who ſhall be counted worthy to obtain the gift, ſhall enter upon the enjoyment, of eternal life.</p>
            <p>I have been led to this ſubject, my hearers, by that tranſition of time which has brought us near the cloſe of the preſent year. At the end of two days it will be no more. Another year of our lives will have rolled away, and brought us nearer to that important period "when time will be no longer;" when the apparent revolutions of the ſun, and other heavenly bodies, ſhall no longer divide the portions of our exiſtence. For then the preſent conſtitution of this world will end. "The heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; the earth alſo, and the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up." The meaſurers of time will no longer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038323_0012_1011A12BA61D2FD8"/>
this office: the revolutions by which our years have been determined will then ceaſe: the preſent beautiful ſcene of nature, and all the works and monuments of human labour, art, and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, will be gone. But the ſoul of the good, the righteous man, ſhall remain unhurt, amidſt this diſſolution of nature, this "wreck of matter, and this cruſh of worlds." He is taught to look for, and expect from the Lord, "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, beloved," ſays the Apoſtle, "ſeeing that ye look for ſuch things, be diligent, that ye may be found of him in peace:" be diligent in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the preſent time, that ye may be prepared for that great event. And let us, my hearers, reflect ſeriouſly on this truth, that we know not the time when this decree of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, pronounced by his angel, ſhall be fulfilled. As it reſpects ourſelves it cannot be farther diſtant than the remainder of our lives: for, when death cloſes the preſent ſcene of our exiſtence, to us "time will be no longer." And who can count with certainty upon a future hour? Let us then improve the preſent time in the important duties
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038323_0013_1011A12D5F256380"/>
of life, to ſecure the bleſſings of eternity. As one mean of improvement, as a ſtimulus to diligence and activity, let us reflect on the year that is paſt; and, while the ſcenes of it are freſh in our minds, ſelect from them that uſeful inſtruction they afford.</p>
            <p>In this, as in every other year, we may trace the progreſs of good and evil in the world. We may ſee the unhappy effects of a ſtate of imperfection, in the ſufferings produced by ſin. And <hi>we,</hi> my hearers, have ſeen, and realized, many of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of a bountiful Parent, in <hi>our own</hi> preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the enjoyments he has furniſhed to us. We have heard of wars, and the rumours of wars, in diſtant parts of the world; while <hi>we</hi> have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the bleſſings of peace. We have read of the ſlaughter of the field, and of the ſword drunk with the blood of its enemies; while <hi>our</hi> fields have only teemed with the bleſſings of life, and <hi>our</hi>
ſwords have reſted in their ſcabbards. We have heard of the devaſtations of war, and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of thouſands of our fellow-men; while <hi>our</hi> lives have been protected from the weapons of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, the rage of ungoverned paſſions, and the mad career of ambition and diſorganization. Our habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038323_0014_1011A12EEB03E6E0"/>
now ſhelter us from the inclemency of winter; a bleſſing, at this moment, denied to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who have been deprived of it by the ravages of war. We alſo are enjoying the fruits of a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful harveſt, while many, on the theatre of the war in Europe, are ſuffering with hunger. While ſome parts of our own country have been viſited with peſtilence, we, in this part of it, have been bleſt with a remarkable degree of health. No epidemic diſeaſe has come nigh our dwellings, or touched the lives of our citizens. Some indeed have been called to quit this ſcene of exiſtence in the paſt year; but the number has been ſmall, compared with many other years. It is the common lot of humanity, and what muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in its preſent ſtate.</p>
            <p>But though we have been thus remarkably fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, and have many reaſons to be grateful to God for his goodneſs to us in the year paſt, yet we have alſo to acknowledge his judgments, and to mourn under the afflicting hand of his providence. As individuals, ſome of us<note n="*" place="bottom">The Author's Mother died in July.</note> have been called to part with near relatives and friends, which has agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038323_0015_1011A1349F71F8F8"/>
our boſoms, and called the tear of ſorrow from our eyes. For theſe loſſes we could mourn in ſilence and ſolitude, and confine, within our own domeſtic walls, the expreſſions of our grief. But God in his wiſe providence has, in the courſe of the paſt year, afflicted us with bereavements as a <hi>people,</hi> and called us to public mourning, by taking from us good and valuable men in public life—men high in ſtation—eminently uſeful—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous for public and private virtues—orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of religion and ſociety—and greatly beloved by their country and particular acquaintance. It is not ſix months ſince a SUMNER died, and the gloom of public grief overſpread our countenances for the loſs of a moſt excellent Chief Magiſtrate of this Commonwealth—a man who was beloved and reſpected wherever he was known; and who, as far as the duties of his office extended, evinced what advantages a people enjoy when bleſt with a wiſe and good governor. Short was the time this bleſſing was lent to us in him; but long will his virtues and uſefulneſs remain in our remembrance.</p>
            <p>As the year has drawn nearer to the cloſe, God has ſeen fit to afflict us with a more extenſive loſs,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038323_0016_1011A13625BFCD98"/>
in taking from us our beloved WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON;<note n="*" place="bottom">He died on the 14th of December, 1799.</note> our country's pride, our nation's greateſt prop; the man whom he had raiſed up to be the inſtrument of his providence in working out our <hi>political</hi> ſalvation. This is a diſtreſſing national event; it demands, and has, a nation's tears. For we cannot part with one who has been ſo eminently uſeful to us, and is ſo juſtly univerſally beloved, without deep-felt affliction. That he was the Father of his Country, we all have experienced, in the protection he afforded us in the time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; in the wiſdom, courage and prudence with which he led our armies, and preſided in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional councils. That he had a ſincere affection for his country, is evident from his numerous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſerve it. This affection, guided by a mind endued with wiſdom and integrity, always led him to ſeek his country's good. That he was not ambitious of power, is ſeen by his reſigning that power which had been delegated to him in the field, into the hands of the people again, when he had accompliſhed the purpoſes, and ſecured the object, for which it was given to him. That his
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038323_0017_101184FE73391D08"/>
country was dearer to him than riches, is evident from the pecuniary ſacrifices he made to ſerve it.</p>
            <p>Few, if any, good and virtuous patriots have been ſo fortunate in doing ſo much for theirs, as WASHINGTON has done for his country. Few have, like him, begun and conducted a revolution through to independence. He was the only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief of our armies, through a long and hazardous war, which he terminated with ſucceſs and glory to himſelf and country. He then reſigned his ſword to a grateful people, and ſoon after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from them the helm of the national govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to conduct in peace our political bark, which he had ſo ably guided amidſt the tempeſts of war. He continued at the head of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils till our government was eſtabliſhed in ſafety and proſperity. He then retired from the burden of office, ſo long and ſo well ſuſtained, to enjoy domeſtic eaſe and tranquillity. Thoſe who were acquainted with his private life, and ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his intimacy, ſpeak of him as exemplary in the walks of religion; in the practice of piety and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and declare that he was great, good and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his domeſtic circle, as he was in the public ſphere of life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:038323_0018_1011A13C1C6DF828"/>I do not mean to attempt to give you his full and complete character. It is far above the powers of my pen to deſcribe it, which is too inadequate to expreſs the feelings of my own heart. <hi>You</hi> are acquainted with all his virtues and worth; <hi>you</hi> know how valuable he has been to his country; and <hi>your</hi> grateful hearts, I doubt not, will appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate all his merits. What I have ſaid, or may ſay, of him is not with any expectation of exalting his merit with you; but becauſe it would be improper that a perſon ſo great, good, and valuable, ſhould be taken from us, whoſe death ſo juſtly excites univerſal mourning, without noticing ſome of the virtues which endeared him to us. In our hearts he has erected a monument of love and reſpect, which will be as durable as our lives. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, who were the witneſſes of his actions, need no higher eulogy than to recollect them. To poſterity many men of genius, obſervation, and judgment, will tranſmit his name and virtues, which will live as long as this American nation exiſts, at whoſe birth he preſided, whoſe infancy he nouriſhed, over whoſe childhood he watched with a parent's care and ſolicitude, and which he
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038323_0019_1011A13FB9DFA898"/>
never left till it had attained the ſtrength of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the world never ſaw an inſtance like this, of a young nation advancing with ſuch rapid and ſturdy growth. Let us look back to the time when this country was a wilderneſs, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated ſcene, and compare it with the preſent. How ſoon do we behold it filled with inhabitants, with populous cities, and numerous towns, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing under an increaſing commerce, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving agriculture, beyond example! This na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional proſperity, under the foſtering hand of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, is to be attributed to him whoſe death we now lament, more than to any other man.</p>
            <p>God, to anſwer the great, wiſe and good deſigns of his government of the world, always provides adequate means to accompliſh his ends. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate the people of this part of America into a nation, and eſtabliſh them in proſperity, he gave them a WASHINGTON for their leader, who was equal to the mighty work. And, having ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled his purpoſe by him, he has, in his own time, taken him again. In this afflictive diſpenſation to us, his goodneſs to our departed Father and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038323_0020_1011A1436B8E19C8"/>
Friend is ſeen, and ought to be acknowledged. For it is worthy of remark, that, as this good man died when at the ſummit of earthly greatneſs, ſo he died without imbecility of body or mind. He neither outlived himſelf, by withering in age, and ſinking into ſecond childhood, or doing any one action, through the infirmity of years, that might caſt a ſhade over his former glory. He died as he lived, with all the honours he ever acquired by his great and good actions bright upon him; and in poſſeſſion of all that affection and veneration he had impreſſed, by thoſe actions, upon the hearts of a grateful people. The Sovereign of the world, having exhibited him here in ſo eminent and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a character, has, by a timely death, exempted him from the common frailties of age, which might have diminiſhed his greatneſs in our view: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that his example, as a true patriot, might not, in any part of it, be leſs perfect than it now is; and that the recollection of it may, through future times, be a uſeful leſſon to others. In his death, then, as in his life, he may be uſeful to his country. He has fallen "like a ſhock of corn fully ripe," in the beſt time for himſelf. And
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038323_0021_1011A144F6059ED0"/>
in this event we may conſider him as a favourite of Heaven. This we often noticed in the courſe of his public life. We then ſaw conſpicuouſly the hand of Providence ſhielding him in danger, and crowning his military actions with ſucceſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſpirit of wiſdom directing him, in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional councils, to thoſe meaſures which have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured our national glory.</p>
            <p>And in him we have an example alſo of what has been offered in this diſcourſe, on the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>diligent improvement</hi> of time. Without this he never would have been ſo great, good and uſeful as he was. For we are not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, by what has been ſaid above, he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inſpired by God. By deep reflection and ſtudy, and by a ſocial and active walk in life, he acquired that wiſdom to judge <hi>rightly,</hi> and that prudence to act <hi>cautiouſly,</hi> for which he was <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi>; and that knowledge of the world, which enabled him to manage our affairs with ſo much addreſs and advantage. His death has ſecured his earthly fame—his political immortality; and we truſt he is gone to reap the reward of his illuſtrious labours in the kingdom of his Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whom he loved and ſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:038323_0022_1011A146D3311DD0"/>Though he might have been longer highly ſerviceable to us, and it would have delighted our hearts to have had him dwelt among us while he could have been uſeful, and enjoyed life, that we might have given him the tokens of our gratitude, as we grew in greatneſs and proſperity; and felt the benefits of his patriotiſm; and have received his ſage advice and fatherly bleſſing: yet, as the great Parent of all, the wiſe Governor of the world, has denied us this gratification and favour, let us humbly ſubmit to the diſpenſation; let us gratefully thank him for having continued his valuable life ſo long, and made him ſo uſeful to his country.</p>
            <p>And let us remember, that though our beloved friend be dead, and his tongue ſilent in the grave, he yet ſpeaketh to us in that valuable legacy he has left behind him for our peruſal and direction. In his Farwell Addreſs, on quitting the office of Preſident, he is ſtill our counſellor. And while our hearts are oppreſſed with grief for this ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from him, let us ſeriouſly reſolve that we will attend to his inſtructions, and follow his counſels, which have ſo often ſaved us in the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038323_0023_1011A14B5A98D298"/>
time of danger, and have led us to unexampled proſperity.</p>
            <p>And though I would ſay nothing to leſſen the praiſe which is due to the great and good friend we have loſt, yet let us always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he was but the inſtrument in the hands of God to effect what has been done for us. It is to Him, "who rules in the kingdoms of men," we are primarily indebted for all we have and enjoy, in a national, as well as private, view—To him let us give the tribute of thankſgiving and praiſe—To him we muſt look for future bleſſings. Though our hopes are in ſome meaſure caſt down by this event, they are not deſtroyed. Our chief truſt and confidence is in God, who will <hi>ſtill</hi> be "the light of our countenance," and preſerve our national independence and proſperity, if we do not forſake him. We have good reaſon to preſume, that he, who gave us a WASHINGTON to make us a free and proſperous nation, will not ſuffer this work of his hands to be deſtroyed by the arts of wicked men; unleſs we forfeit the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable bleſſing of freedom, by becoming the ſlaves of vice, and proſtituting, to the ſervice of ſin, the bounties of his providence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:038323_0024_1011A14DE1FB91D8"/>Let us remember, that though God has taken our WASHINGTON from us, he has left us many great and good men, wiſe and virtuous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, to conduct our national affairs. And let us reſolve to unite in harmony with them to promote our country's good. Let us ſolemnly declare, we will always revere, love, and ſupport, the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion God has given us, and be obedient to the laws of the government founded upon it. Let us diligently improve our time through the years which may be to come, in the faithful diſcharge of all duties, religious and civil, patriotic and ſocial— in the exerciſe of all public and private virtues. And by our prayers to the great Ruler of the world, the Father of all bleſſings, by mutual good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and actions, let us endeavour to give a ſtability and proſperity to our nation and government, which ſhall laſt, through ſucceeding ages, till the angel of God ſhall again "ſtand upon the ſea and upon the earth" to perform the oath he has ſworn, "THAT TIME SHALL BE NO LONGER."</p>
