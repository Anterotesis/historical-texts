            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Here your Lordſhip and the world ſee the real ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Gentleman of great honour, ſenſe, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, at a time of the ſtricteſt ſincerity. And I beg leave
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:012728_0004_0F91400194861EB0"/>
publicly to declare, that I have no other reaſon in the world for affixing your great and venerable name to the following papers, than thoſe aſſigned by the worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman before-mentioned: Being utterly unbiaſſed by any ſuch motives as uſually produce Dedications to great men. And I perſuade myſelf, it cannot be unacceptable to your Lordſhip, to be the patron of a book, the only deſign of which is, to ſerve and vindicate the civil and religious liberties of mankind.</p>
            <p>And here, according to the uſual ſtile and purpoſe of dedications, it may be expected I ſhould launch out into a panegyric on your great and excellent qualities: And, indeed, being a lay-man, and having not the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on your Lordſhip, I might, in that caſe, be preſumed to ſpeak to you, and of you, with the freedom of an indifferent man, and without riſking that cenſure which is ſo generally incurred by Dedicators.—But the exhibiting your Lordſhip's amiable character, requires an abler pen: It is a ſubject too nice and delicate for me to attempt: Beſides, it can receive no advantage from any private man; as it ſtands immoveably fixed, beyond the reach of party or of ſaction, on records that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main until time ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip, at your firſt ſetting out in the world, was pleaſed to lay aſide the unintelligible jargon of the ſchools, in matters of religion, and to declare openly and freely in favour of the New-Teſtament and common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>And as to matters of Government, you ever appeared a ſtrenuous aſſerter of thoſe noble principles; whereby the Revolution was brought about, under the late King William, whoſe memory will be always dear to every Briton, that has the leaſt regard for honeſty, reaſon, or juſtice. Thoſe religious and political principles, your Lordſhip was pleaſed to defend and maintain, by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments founded on truth, and ſuperior to all the wicked ſophiſtry of your adverſaries.</p>
            <p>When mercenary ſcribblers are employed by a party, to vent their malice, it may be fit to leave them to the courſe of common juſtice; but here the trumper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

but war; they attacked you with unappeaſible ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but covered their outrage with the ſpecious names of Loyalty, Religion, and the Church; where by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded populace were drawn to inliſt under their banners, in contradiction to their own moſt valuable rights, both as men and Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>This, my Lord, was the caſe with reſpect to you, and to thoſe truly rational and even divine principles you ſo bravely defended; when the high court of Parliament thought it neceſſary to interpoſe in favour of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; whom, with ſurprize and aſtoniſhment, they ſaw thus iniquitouſly perſecuted by many Reverend Doctors and Dignitaries, and for no other reaſon than for your open and hearty attachment to our Religion, Laws, and Government.</p>
            <p>This illuſtrious Aſſembly determined, by a public act, to teſtify to the Sovereign, and to the whole nation, their reſentment of your ill uſage, and the ſenſe they had of your extraordinary merit. For this purpoſe, a motion was made by the ingenious Anthony Henly, <abbr>Eſq;</abbr> and, after a ſhort debate, the Houſe came to the following reſolution:</p>
            <q>That the Rev. Mr. Benjamin Hoadly, Rector of St. Peter's Poor, London, for having ſtrenuouſly juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the principles on which her Majeſty and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeded, in the late happy revolution, had juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merited the favour of this houſe; and that an humble Addreſs be preſented to her Majeſty, that ſhe would be graciouſly pleaſed to beſtow ſome dignity in the Church, on the ſaid Mr. Hoadly, for his eminent ſervices in the Church and State.</q>
            <p>The Queen's anſwer was:</p>
            <q>I will take a proper opportunity to comply with your requeſt.</q>
            <p>A greater honour, your Lordſhip could never have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; as it was the approbation of your country, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by its repreſentatives, one of the moſt auguſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies upon earth, and which will remain, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords thereof, an eternal monument to your renown: A monument, more glorious and laſting, than pillars of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, or triumphal arches!</p>
            <p>For ſome time after this your Lordſhip had a reſpite
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:012728_0006_0F91400783379BC0"/>
from your eccleſiaſtical adverſaries. It ſeemed as if they were thunder-ſtruck by this noble reſolution. However, it was not long, before theſe diſturbers of our peace, theſe ſworn enemies of Britiſh liberty, received a freſh provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in a ſermon preached before the King, at St. James's, and publiſhed by his ſpecial command, entit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, THE NATURE OF THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST. Herein you had proved, beyond all reaſonable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that Chriſt's kingdom was not of this world: A doctrine new and ſurpriſing, even to the greateſt part of the clergy.—What now could your Lordſhip expect but judgment without mercy!—It was a crime of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as never to be forgiven. To be told that Chriſt's kingdom did not conſiſt in mitres, lordſhips, deanaries, veſtments, ceremonies, ſpiritual courts, abſolutions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—It was next to the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and for which your adverſaries will never forgive you, either in this world or the next.</p>
            <p>Here your enemies loſt all patience; and, inſtead of reaſon and argument, diſcharged againſt you their whole artillery of affronts and indignities: Notwithſtanding the greateſt and beſt men in the kingdom acknowledged that your Lordſhip's principles, both civil and religious, were for the benefit of human ſociety, agreeable to the natural rights of mankind, and perfectly conſiſtent with the New-Teſtament, the Reformation, and the church of England.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip's enemies did not intend things ſhould ſtop here.—The lower houſe of Convocation appointed a committee, conſiſting of Dr. Moſs, Dr. Sherlock, Dr. Friend, Dr. Spratt, Dr. Cannan, and Dr. Byſe, to draw up a repreſentation, to be laid before the upper houſe, concerning ſeveral dangerous poſitions advanced by your Lordſhip, at that time Biſhop of Bangor; which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation was approved of by the lower houſe, and was voted to be entered on their books, <hi>nem. con.</hi>—The atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the public was again engaged, and perſons of the higheſt rank were extremely ſolicitous for your protection.</p>
            <p>And here, alſo, your Lordſhip had the honour to here one of the beſt, the wiſeſt, and braveſt men that ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

writ to the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, to prorogue the Convocation; whereby the deſigns of your enemies were at once defeated. A noble inſtance of Royal juſtice and paternal affection to his ſubjects! A ſtrange phaenomenon in the political world! A Monarch exerting himſelf in defence of his ſubjects liberties, which multitudes of themſelves were eager to betray! An example highly deſerving the imitation of every Sovereign, but hardly to be paralleled. His generous ſoul was influenced by all thoſe ſentiments of humanity and compaſſion, with which Chriſtianity never fails to inſpire its real votaries. He could not forbear, voluntarily and unaſked, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in behalf of an innocent and abuſed ſubject. This ſingle inſtance of his Royal virtue will ever be recorded in the Britiſh annals, to his immortal honour; for which generations to come will call him bleſſed.</p>
            <p>I cannot conclude without taking ſome notice of a late honeſt performance<note n="*" place="bottom">The Plain Account.</note> of your Lordſhip's, which has again drawn upon you the unjuſt attacks of the bigots of all parties. Your Lordſhip could expect nothing leſs:—Its natural deſign and tendency being to beat down myſtery, bigotry, ſuperſtition and nonſenſe; which have been for ſo many ages, the grand ſupport of the ſacerdotal empire. What wonder, then, if your Lordſhip ſuſtained a freſh torrent of abuſe on this occaſion. I have read ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the anſwers to this valuable treatiſe; but have found none of them meriting your Lordſhip's obſervation. In oppoſition to all theſe exertions of ſcurrility; I could produce, if it were neceſſary, the ſentiments of the beſt and greateſt men that the preſent age has produced in favour of your Lordſhip's character and principles. But I ſhall content myſelf with what the learned and pious Dr. Tenniſon was pleaſed to advance, in his proteſt againſt the report of the Convocation, in the caſe of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. I have read it often, and never without a ſecret pleaſure. It breathes forth nothing but piety, charity, and New-Teſtament religion:</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>REVEREND SIR!</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not of vanity, lucre or party, that I now ſit down to make ſome remarks on your late very extraordinary ſermon. I muſt confeſs I have read ſome other notable ones, and heard many more, on this occaſion; but none ſo deſerving or public contempt and cenſure. Your whole performance could be calculated with no other view, than to revive old heats and animoſities, and to raiſe that ſpirit of ſtrife and diſcord, which, as a Miniſter of the Goſpel of peace, it is your peculiar province to ſuppreſs.</p>
            <p>I know of nothing more repugnant to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, than for one, profeſſing to preach it, to ſet up for the champion of a party; ſince parties are for the moſt part influenced by motives mean and brutal, inconſiſtent with that unalterable regard to truth and juſtice, to which all men and all parties have an invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable claim.</p>
            <p>I hope you will not be offended, if, in this addreſs, I ſpeak my ſentiments plainly. And though I ſhall not fail of doing ſo, yet, notwithſtanding the provocation you have given, my intention is to treat you with the civility due to your function, without paſſion, or perſonal reproach. And if you are not very much prejudiced by a blind and ſerious ze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l, I perſuade myſelf, I ſhall in ſome degree en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten your underſtanding and awaken your conſcience;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012728_0010_0F94DD287B1F8750"/>
not by falſhood and diſguiſes, but by facts; facts that are inconteſtable, and that will argue for themſelves.</p>
            <p>I would take up too much of my time to enter upon all the particular falſities, abſurdities, and fallacious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, of which your ſermon was made up. I ſhall only offer the following general remarks to your conſideration; intreating you to peruſe them calmly, without any party<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirit, diveſted of all prejudice and partiality, with a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and diſpoſition of mind becoming a Gentleman and a ſcholar, always determined to ſubmit to the force of truth and evidence: And then your own conſcience will preſently ſuggeſt to you, that your whole ſermon was a manifeſt contradiction to the religion, laws, government, and true hiſtory of your country.</p>
            <p>The exalted character you was pleaſed to give of King Charles I. made a very conſiderable part of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. I muſt acknowledge, it was ſpeciouſly drawn, and delivered with an engaging elocution and emphaſis; but it had this unlucky circumſtance attending it, that the picture had no affinity with the original: Light and darkneſs, heaven and hell, could not poſſibly be more oppoſite to each other, than your portrait was to the real character of that unhappy Prince. Therefore, permit me, Sir, in my turn, to give you his true and genuine character; which, at this diſtance of time can only be done, by an impartial recital of the moſt conſiderable and important actions of his life.</p>
            <p>During the minority of this Prince he was looked on, by all that knew him, to be of a moſt obſtinate diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His mother greatly lamented his unhappy turn of mind, and was heard to ſay of him in public, that <q>ſhe feared he would live to be the ruin of himſelf, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the loſs of his three kingdoms by his obſtinacy.</q> Soon after he came to the throne, he married a French Papiſt, by a diſpenſation from the Pope, and according to the ceremonies of the church of Rome. She was not only a Papiſt, but in a remarkable manner attached to all the fopperies and moſt abſurd practices of that church. By the articles of this marriage, many liberties were granted to the Papiſts. A chapel was permitted to be built at Sommerſet-houſe, where there was likewiſe eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012728_0011_0F94DD293A462AC8"/>
a convent of Capuchin-Friars, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> together with a great number of Prieſts and Jeſuits, walked the ſtreets in their habits, in ſuch a manner as had never been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſince the Reformation. The King wrote to the Pope with the title of Moſt Holy Father.</p>
            <p>All the honeſt and wiſe part of the nation was greatly alarmed at this match; fearing it would again bring us back to the ſlavery and bondage of Rome. King Charles I. was a ſtaunch bigot, and conſequently the darling of the Clergy; and having no great reach of his own, was governed by his Prieſts, who have always been unfortunate when they meddle in politics. His whole reign was one continued ſeries of follies, or infringement of the rights of his ſubjects. He lived in the conſtant and open viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fundamental laws of the realm; and conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every thing to the diſhonour and reproach of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nation. But to deſcend to particulars.</p>
            <p>He agreed with the Marquis D'Effiat, the French Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, for a ſquadron of men of war, to join the French fleet at Dieppe, which was fitting out againſt the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants at Rochelle: Thereby to deſtroy at once all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtrength of the Reformed in that kingdom. The command of this ſquadron was given to Captain Penning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, whom he ſtrictly enjoined, that in caſe his ſhips ſhould refuſe to join the French, in this vile expedition, he ſhould uſe all forcible means to compel them, even to the ſinking them, if they continued o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtinate: That was, to deſtroy the Engliſh his own people, if they would not deſtroy the French Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>This conduct appears by far the more wicked and aſtoniſhing, as the King a little before had wrote two let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſigned Charles <hi>Rex,</hi> to the Peers, Burghers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the city of Rochelle, engaging to aſſiſt them to the utmoſt. In the firſt letter he ſays, <q>My fleet ſhall periſh rather than you ſhall not be relieved.</q> In the ſecond; <q>Be aſſured I will never abandon you, and that I will employ all the force of my kingdom for your deliverance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the Parliament came afterwards to examine Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on's papers, they found a letter from the King, ſigned Charles <hi>Rex,</hi> 
               <q>Requiring him to diſpoſe of thoſe

ſhips as he ſhould be directed by the French King, and to ſink or fire ſuch as ſhould refuſe to obey thoſe orders.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On this proceeding, General Ludlow has this plain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, <q>By this horrible treachery the ſtrong town of Rochelle, wherein the ſecurity of the Proteſtants of France chiefly conſiſted, was delivered up to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; and thoſe of the Reformed religion in all parts of the kingdom expoſed to the rage of their cruel and bloody enemies<note n="*" place="bottom">Memoirs, vol. I. page 5.</note> Again: King James was ſtrongly bent to render himſelf abſolute; yet he choſe rather to carry on that deſign by fraud than violence; but King Charles immediately after his acceſſion to the throne, pulled of the maſk and openly diſcovered his intention to make the crown abſolute and independent; and the Queen, on her part, preſſed him on all occaſions, to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rſue the deſign of enlarging his power, and to mould the church of England to a nearer compliance to the See of Rome.</q> At the ſame time, this Prince ſent a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Lord-keeper, for granting full liberty and toleration to all Papiſts, notwithſtanding the extreme ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the then laws againſt them. Upon ſome of the Privy Council adviſing him againſt this illegal ſtep, he openly replied, That it was his will thoſe laws ſhould ſtand diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Thus, almoſt in the firſt month of his reign, he ſet up a deſpotic power againſt the conſtitution. He granted a general pard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> to all Papiſts, under proſecution; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Papiſts, but as criminals. He releaſed twenty Prieſts from goal. And it now evidently appeared, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to rule and govern all by abſolute will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The Parliament began to be greatly alarmed by theſe meaſures, and proteſted in form againſt them. They remonſtrated.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His protecting a ſeditious, virulent and ignorant Prieſt, Richard Montague, in oppoſition to the ſenſe of the Parliament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The great increaſe and countenancing of Popery, by diſpenſing with all the laws againſt it, in an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary manner.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The war againſt Spain, without a declaration; and the ſending to deſtroy the Proteſtants of Rochelle.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:012728_0013_0F94DD2ABA3F6850"/>
4. The total miſ-employment of three ſubſidies, and three fifteenths. With many other enormities, too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to relate.</p>
            <p>This Montague wrote a book, entitled, <hi>Apello Coeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi> wherein he advanced the following poſitions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the church of Rome is, and ever was a true church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That images might be uſed to excite devotion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That ſaints have patronage, cuſtody, protection, and power, over certain perſons and things, as the angels have.</p>
            <p>This book gave great offence unto all true Proteſtants. The Parliament condemned it, and ſummoned Montague to attend at their bar; and voted his book to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the articles eſtabliſhed by Parliament, to tend to the King's diſhonour, and the diſturbance of the church; and obliged him to enter into a bond of 2000 l. to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear again on the next ſummons.</p>
            <p>However, notwithſtanding this book was ſo publicly condemned by the Parliament, as well as by the general voice and ſuffrage of the kingdom, yet at Court it met with applauſe and high encomiums; and the Author was rewarded inſtantly with the Biſhoprick of Chicheſter, and ſoon after was tranſlated to Norwich: Whereby the King again openly declared his encouragement of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; and that whoever, in contempt of the Parliament and conſtitution of England, would aſſert a deſpoti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> power in church and ſtate, might expect to be rewarded.</p>
            <p>Thus, in the beginning of his reign, he loſt the hearts and affections of a great part of his ſubjects. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to increaſe the general murmuring and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, was his illegal and arbitrary treatment of a great number of leading men of both Houſes of Parliament. Sir John Elliot, a famous Speaker in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, was committed cloſe priſoner to the Gate-houſe, with many others. The pretence was, for undutiful ſpeech. The Commons p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſed a vote to vindicate all their members at once; declaring there had been no undutiful ſpeech in that Houſe, from the beginning of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to that day. Sir Dudly Diggs, another top ſpeaker in the Houſe of Commons, was hurried away to the Tower, under the pretence alſo of undutiful ſpeech, at a late public conference with the Lords. This Gentleman
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012728_0014_0F94DD2B7A190818"/>
proteſted with the utmoſt ſolemnity, that he never ſpoke the words he was charged with, and that no ſuch words ever came into his thoughts; and what is more, (merely out of regard to common juſtice) thirty-ſix of the Lords, who ſtood cloſe by him at the time of the ſaid confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, entered into a voluntary proteſtation, ſubſcribing their names to it, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſaid Sir Dudly Diggs did not ſpeak thoſe words, nor any words that did or might trench on the King's honour: Some of the Lords who proteſted were

            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this public atteſtation of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence by To many Peers, to the Tower he muſt go, right or wrong. Innocence in thoſe days was no ſecurity.</p>
            <p>All this was done contrary to the opinion of the Judges, who declared, That ſuch a violent reſtraint on ſo many members, was a public arreſt on the whole body of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The King, by a meſſage to the Earls of Briſtol and Arundell, forbad them to attend the Houſe of Lords; and ſoon after committed the latter to the Tower. This made a mighty ferment. All the Peers began now to look on their perſons and eſtates to be in great danger. They petitioned his Majeſty in a ſubmiſſive manner, humbly beſeeching, <q>That the Earl of Arundell, a Member of their Houſe, might be reſtored to them again; and that the ſame regard might he had to the rights and privileges of the Peers as had ever been.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The King gave a rough anſwer, and would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him. This produced a long and well-penned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance. The Lords exerted themſelves on this occaſion with a becoming ſpirit; they petitioned the King again and again, five different times, and came to the following remarkable reſolution, <hi>nemine contradicent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:012728_0015_0F94DD2C3A67C840"/>
"That no Lord of Parliament, the Parliament ſitting, or within the uſual time of the privilege of Parliament, is to be impriſoned or reſtrained, without ſentence or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Houſe; unleſs it be for treaſon or felony, or for refuſing to give ſecurity for the peace; and that, <hi>una voce,</hi> this is the undoubted right of the Peers<note n="*" place="bottom">Ruſhworth, p. 365.</note>."</p>
            <p>Things continued for a conſiderable time in this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; the King committed many of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and daily breaking in upon thoſe rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the Houſe of Lords, which for a long time had been held ſacred and inviolable, till at laſt he grew tired with frequent petitions and remonſtrances of both Houſes, in vindication of their juſt and legal rights: Wherefore, the better to eſtabliſh his abſolute power and dominion over the lives and properties of his ſubjects, he determined to have no Parliament at all; and ſent a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Houſe of Lords, ſignifying his intention to diſſolve the Parliament, then ſitting, inſtantly.</p>
            <p>This alarmed both Houſes, more than any thing that had yet happened; and they were under terrible appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the conſequences that might enſue ſuch a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory and ſudden diſſolution, at ſo critical a juncture.</p>
            <p>The Lords, the ſame morning, ſent a petition to the King, affirming, <q>That they were really and truly his moſt faithful and loyal ſubjects; and that as they were alſo his Majeſty's hereditary council of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they were obliged by the duty they owed to God, his Majeſty, and their country, humbly to offer their advice, that the Parliament may be continued for ſome time longer, whereby great and apparent dangers may be prevented, and his Majeſty made happy in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and love of his people.</q> This honeſt and memorable petition was delivered by the Lord Viſcount Mandeville, the Earl of Mancheſter, Lord-Preſident of his Majeſty's Council, the Earl of Pembroke, the Earl of Carliſle, and the Earl of Holland. The King returned for anſwer, <q>That he would hear no motion, but would diſſolve the Parliament, and immediately cauſe a commiſſion to paſs the Great Seal for that purpoſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. p. 398.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the King would not ſtop here; for, the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012728_0016_0F94DD2D03C4F740"/>
warrants were directed from the privy-council to apprehend ſeveral members of Parliament, as Denzil Hollis, <abbr>Eſq;</abbr> Sir Miles Hobert, Sir Peter Hayman; John Selden, <abbr>Eſq;</abbr> Corrington, Long, Stroud, Valentine, and ſome others; all leading men in the Houſe of Commons. Moſt of them were apprehended and committed cloſe priſoners to the Tower.</p>
            <p>Having in ſo unprecedented a way diſſolved this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and calling no other during the twelve follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing years, he in that long period governed as arbitrarily as the Grand Seignior, and in a manner ſubverſive of all the laws and conſtitution of this realm. In the firſt ſeven years of this time, he publiſhed no leſs than one hundred and forty-ſix proclamations: The chief deſign of which was to raiſe money without conſent or authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, under the denomination of conduct-money, tunnage, poundage, ſhip-money, &amp;c.&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Great numbers amongſt the nobility and principal gentry, who had hitherto adhered to the King, began daily to fall off, and to deſert the Court. Nothing was heard of but grievances and remonſtrances; and perſons of great note began publicly to declare, that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was illegal and arbitrary, and that the conſtitution was actually deſtroyed. Many about the King had the honeſty and courage to point out to him the unavoidable conſequences of thoſe wicked and violent meaſures. Sir Robert Cotton repeatedly told him in council, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reaſons may be given for it, the nation would not hear the levying money without conſent of Parliament; and that every tax not authorized thereby, was breaking in upon the conſtitution, and eſteemed by the people of England as an act of tyr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>This wiſe and prudent advice did not ſuit the temper of King Charles. He had nothing in his head or heart, but abſolute rule and government.</p>
            <p>I may here remark, that the miſchiefs and miſery of this reign, muſt, in ſome meaſure, be imputed to that haughty eccleſiaſtic Archbiſhop Laud, and his creatures.

(which is certainly done, when their money is taken by force, without law and conſent of Parliament) and, to do them juſtice, they laboured at it heartily.</p>
            <p>One Manwaring undertook to prove out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <q>That Kings might impoſe taxes without conſent of Parliament, and that the people were bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to obey their will and pleaſure.</q> Laud ſent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other pa aſitical prieſt (one Sibthorp) to preach an aſſiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the King ſoon found that the Clergy might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their preaching to eternity, without bringing any money into the Exchequer, and therefore more violent methods were taken.

            <p>Were it neceſſary, I could mention a hundred flagrant inſtances more, to prove that the Government of King Charles I. for many years was illegal, arbitrary, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, and that the conſtitution was actually ſubverted and deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>The King began now to look upon himſelf as ſecure, and to imagine that by this barbarous uſage of ſo many, perſons of rank and quality, all others would be deterred from appearing openly for their religion, laws and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The prerogative, (ſays Ludlow) was now wound up to a great height in England, and the affairs of the church tending to a conjunction with the See of Rome. But before any further progreſs was made, it was thought expedient, that the pulſe of Scotland ſhould be felt. To this end, a form of public prayer was ſent them, more nearly approaching the Roman office than that uſed in England. The Nobility, Clergy, and Gentry, were diſcontented with the book itſelf, as well as the manner of impoſing it. The Clergy of England, who had been the chief adviſers and promoters of this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, prevailed on the King to cauſe all the Scots to be declared traitors; and they were not wanting to promoting the new levies againſt the Scots, contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing largely thereunto: which was but reaſonable; it being manifeſt to all, that the Clergy were the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal authors and fomenters of thoſe troubles<note n="†" place="bottom">Ludlow, vol.

               </q>.</p>
            <p>This war with the Scots was looked upon by the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Gentry, and Commonalty of England, as the moſt imprudent that could be. And indeed the King himſelf ſoon found it to be ſo the very officers and ſoldiers of the army treating it with contempt and ridicule; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he was quickly obliged to come to an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Scots, upon terms no way to his honour or advantage.</p>

               <q>The moſt profitable preferments in the Engliſh church were now given to thoſe of the Clergy who were moſt forward to promote the new ceremonies and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

            </p>
            <p>Things went on for a conſiderable time pretty favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Court. By their violence and tyranny they carried all before them, and ſeemed to bid fair to obtain a complete victory over all the laws of the kingdom, as well as over the lives and properties of the ſubjects. But freſh troubles began now to ariſe. The city of London grew more and more diſguſted at the granting monopolies and patents; and at the unparliamentary raiſing, as well as the violent methods daily practiſed in collecting ſeveral illegal taxes; inſomuch, that a very great number of citizens, of rank and figure, at once refuſed to pay ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the loans; at the ſame time declaring, they would pay no taxes at all, without the conſent and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament.</p>
            <p>This was a dreadful ſhock to the Court; they gave it the name of rebellion, and determined to put an end to it at once. An order was iſſued, to take away the ſword from the Lord-Mayor, and moſt of the chief officers of the city were inſtantly impriſoned. Hereupon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple roſe, and beſet the houſe of Laud, Archbiſhop of Canterbury, who was ſuppoſed to put the King on thoſe violent courſes; they demoliſhed his Grace's windows, but he made his eſcape for that time by water.

frequently got the better of the Crown, yet it many times ended in their ruin.</p>
            <p>The Court now found it neceſſary to tamper with moſt of the great Lawyers. Some of the Judges and Lawyers took the bait, and for the ſake of ſome temporary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment became open and public traitors to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by declaring in Weſtminſter-Hall, for law, <q>that the King might impoſe taxes upon the people, and that he might impriſon and diſtrain in caſe of refuſal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But to do juſtice to the Lawyers, I muſt acknowledge, that the far greater part of them were, in reality, friends to the conſtitution. They diſcovered a true Engliſh ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and gladly embraced every opportunity to ſupport the rights and liberties of the ſubjects; to the great mortification of the King and Laud.</p>
            <p>This firm behaviour of the Lawyers, put the Court on making another dreadful attack on the lives and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſubject. For finding they could not corrupt the common Courts of juſtice to that degree they aimed at, they created or revived arbitrary Courts, as the Star-Chamber and High Commiſſion Courts, wherein mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous cruelties were daily committed, even on perſons of high rank, quality, and learning.</p>
            <p>The practice of thoſe Courts was much a-kin to that of the inquiſitions in Spain and Portugal at this day. Laud preſided in both of them. His power and influence were ſo great, that every thing done there was eſteemed as his particular act and deed. The other members were, as Biſhop Burnet obſerves, <q>little more than mere machines, to move and act as this godly Prelate directed.</q> And truly they judged right, in putting an Eccleſiaſtic at the head of thoſe Courts; as nothing was intended but fines, impriſonments, cutting off ears, ſlitting up noſes, and other ſuch bloody work: Witneſs the horrid barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity practiſed on the learned William Prynne, <abbr>Eſq;</abbr> Dr. Leighton, Dr. Baſtick, Dr. Burton, and a multitude of others, by thoſe inhuman arbitrary judicatories.</p>
            <p>Prynne was an eminent Lawyer of Lincoln's Inn; a Gentleman of high reputation for learning and piety; he wrote a book againſt the obſcenity of the ſtage, and the lewd practices of the actors, who were arrived to ſuch
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012728_0022_0F94DD317A56F3A8"/>
a height as to give great offence to all the ſober part of the nation. Laud pretended this was a reflection on the Queen, who was a mighty favourer of the women Actors, ſhe having herſelf alſo acted a paſtoral at Somerſet-houſe; ſo without any ſhadow of law, reaſon, or juſtice, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes Prynne in his beloved Star-Chamber; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces this execrable ſentence upon him: <q>To pay the King five thouſand pounds; to ſtand twice in the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory; to have both his ears cut off, one at each time; to be afterwards impriſoned during life without the uſe of pen, ink, or paper; and to be ſtigmatized on both checks, with S. L.</q> denoting thereby a ſeditious libeller.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time Laud proſecuted Dr. Baſtick and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; the former an eminent Phyſician, the latter a Divine.</p>
            <p>They were both condemned <q>to pay five thouſand pounds to the King; to ſtand in the pillory; to have both ears cut off; and to be impriſoned during life:</q> All which was executed with the utmoſt ſeverity; and they, together with Mr. Prynne, were baniſhed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Iſlands of Scilly, Guernſey, and Jerſey, where they were incarcerated; neither their wives nor any of their friends being permitted to ſee them.</p>
            <p>John Lilburn, a young Gentleman of conſiderable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and fortune, lived at this time with Mr. Prynne; and, having a great regard for a perſon of his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary abilities and integrity, could not forbear writing ſomething in his vindication. This ſoon came to Laud's ears. The Prelate hereupon immediately ordered him to be brought before him in the Court of Star-Chamber, where he ſat in triumph, and condemned this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate youth <q>to be whipped from the Fleet-Priſon to Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall, to receive five hundred laſhes, with a treble cord having knots upon it, and afterwards to ſtand in the pillory.</q> He was whipped ſo bloodily, that every heart bled for him; yet he bore it with a courage, that was amazing. While he was in the pillory, in this moſt deplorable condition, he expreſſed ſome indignatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Three years afterwards, a Gentleman of the Houſe of Commons exclaimed with great force and eloquence againſt the diabolical practices of this Court; and taking notice of this Mr. Lilburn's ſufferings, concludes with the following words: <q>By impriſonment he was made a dead trunk, by whipping a rogue, by pillorying a cheat, by gaging a beaſt; they had better have hanged him out-right.</q> Ruſhworth ſays, <q>When once the Star began to ſwell big, and was delighted with blood (which was not till Laud's time, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Parliament, ſome years afterwards, voted the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of thoſe four Gentlemen to be illegal and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, and obliged theſe unrighteous judges to make them reparation. After the Parliament ordered them to had he ſet at liberty, they came to London, and were received with loud acclamations; they were met near the city by a hundred coaches filled with Gentlemen of rank and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. At the ſame time, one of the members of the city of London preſented to the Parliament a Petition, ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by more than fifteen thouſand hands moſtly perſons of note, complaining of the wicked and tyrannical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Laud and the other Prelates, who had treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome of the beſt men in England, more like ſlaves at Morocco, than like Chriſtians, Proteſtants, or Engliſhmen.</p>

moſt impious Court. The Rev. and learned Alexander Leighton, Doctor of Divinity in the two Univerſities of St. Andrew's and Leyden, was arreſted by two ruſſians belonging to the Court of Star-Chamber, who dragged him with force and violence to Laud's houſe, where they told him he was to be examined, Laud being then at home; but, inſtead of that, they carried him through a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

In this doleful place and plight they kept him fifteen days, ſuffering none to come at him, not even his wife, in all that time. Four days after his commitment, Laud's officers, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ruſſians, came to Dr. Leighton's houſe in Black Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, under a pretence of ſearching for books. Here they laid violent hands on his poor diſtreſſed wife, and uſed her with ſo much inhumanity as is a ſhame to expreſs. They rifled every one in the houſe, and held a cocked piſtol to a boy's breaſt, not above five years old, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to kill him if he would not diſcover where the books were; at which the poor child was ſo frightened, that he never recovered afterward. At laſt they carried off all the Doctor's books, houſhold goods, furniture and wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-apparel. During his confinement, he almoſt pined away, and was ſo ill, that an Attorney and four Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans certified his caſe to be deſperate<note n="*" place="bottom">All this is taken from the repreſentation of his caſe, afterwards laid before the Parliament.</note>. Yet, abſent and ſick, he was ſentenced to undergo the dreadful puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which we have an account as follows in his own petition to the Parliament: <q>This horrid ſentence was to be inflicted with knife, fire and whip, at and upon the pillory, with ten thouſand pounds fine; which ſome of the Lords of the Court conceived could never be inflicted, only that it was impoſed on a dying man, to terrify oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Your petitioner's hands being tied to a ſtake, beſides all other torments, he received 36 ſtripes with a treble cord; after which he ſtood almoſt two hours in the pillory, in cold, froſt and ſnow; and then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the reſt, as cutting off the ear, firing the face, ſlit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the noſe.</q> Here the clerk of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, when the petition was reading, was ordered to ſtop; and when he was going on again, he was ordered to ſtop a ſecond time, till the auditors recovered themſelves a little; for the Houſe was melted down with tears, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and compaſſion. The petitioner proceeded: <q>He was made a theatre of miſery to men and angels; and being ſo broken with his ſufferings, that he was not able to go, the warden of the Fleet would not ſuffer him to be carried in a coach, but hurried him away by water, to the further endangering of his life. And on that day ſe'nnight, the ſores upon his back, ears, noſe, and face not being cured, he was again whipped at the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory in Cheapſide, and there had the remainder of the ſentence executed by cutting off the other ear, ſlit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the other ſide of the noſe, and branding the other cheek.</q> My hand trembles, my heart bleeds, I can go no farther. The Parliament, <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> voted Dr. Leighton ſix thouſand pounds, and made him warden of that priſon where he ſo long lived in loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome confinement.</p>
            <p>This helliſh cruelty, which the Parliament could not bear the hearing of without being moved with tears and compaſſion, does Biſhop Laud, in his cloſet, write down at large in his diary with delight. Yet this is that very Biſhop of whom that zealot Arch-deacon Eachard ſays, <q>No man in the world was ſo fit to make a Chancellor of the Univerſity of Oxford, conſidering his religion and charity.</q> When this ſort of men ſpeak of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and charity, the words muſt be taken in a ſenſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to their meaning in the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Dr. Juxon, a haughty Eccleſiaſtic, of mean abilities, had been very aſſiſting to Laud in his wicked doings, who in return, got him advanced to the Biſhoprick of London;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012728_0026_0F94DD33BA8AA220"/>
and ſoon after prevailed on the weak and infatuated King, to make him Lord High-Treaſurer of England, which gave great diſguſt to all the Gentry and Nobility; or, as Clarendon expreſſes it, ſet them in a flame.</p>
            <p>When any one was brought into the Star-Chamber, they had always one general charge brought againſt them, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were enemies to the church. Thus branded, without any regard to age, rank, or quality, they were treated with the utmoſt rudeneſs. Laud would make a ſpeech of half an hour long, in favour of the divine right of Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, Deans, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, Arch-deacons, mitres, copes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he would call the true primitive conſtitution; and would generally conclude with ſome ſilly and ill-natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ignorant reflections on all the foreign Proteſtants, particularly the churches of Amſterdam and Geneva. By ſuch miſ-repreſentations he prevailed on the King to ſhut up the Dutch and Walloon Churches in London, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the law of God, and the law of nations, and againſt the intereſt of ours in particular; great numbers of ſober induſtrious perſons being thereby driven out of the kingdom.</p>
            <p>Laud's ſpeeches, what influence ſoever they had on his own tools and inſtruments, had no other effect on his auditors in general than to expoſe himſelf; for thereby he diſcovered his utter ignorance of all hiſtory, both ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and profane.</p>
            <p>Things again, for ſome little time, went on pretty calmly. The Court carried all before them. The cruelty of the Star-Chamber (as Acherly expreſſes it) bound down all the Gentlemen in England under a ſlaviſh fear. The King openly avowed a deſpotic abſolute government, by declaring that he would be accountable for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to none but God. Nothing can be more fooliſh and ridiculous: Is not every Prince upon earth accountable for his actions to reaſon and juſtice? Sure I am, a King of England is in a particular manner accountable to the laws and conſtitutions of the realm. In one of his ſpeeches to the Parliament, he has this very remarkable expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <q>As it is blaſphemy to diſpute what God may do, ſo it is ſedition in ſubjects to diſpute what a King
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012728_0027_0F94DD347AAFE918"/>
may do.</q> In the height of his power (Burnet ſays) he was ſo poſſeſſed of the divine right of Kings, that he could not bear that even an elective and limited King ſhould be called in queſtion by his ſubjects.</p>
            <p>The ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>annical power exerciſed by the Crown began now to grow daily more and more grievous; inſomuch, that a multitude of people began to take refuge in our foreign plantations; and numbers of families actually tranſported themſelves, from different parts of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Government at length took umbrage at it, and publiſhed a proclamation, to reſtrain his Majeſty's ſubjects from tranſporting themſelves to the plantations in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, without a royal licence. The Court at the ſame time was greatly alarmed, by an information from the Cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, that eight large ſhips were then in the river Thames, taking in paſſengers for New-England; which immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately produced the following order of council: <q>That the Lord Treaſurer of England ſhould take a ſpeedy and effectual care for the ſtopping of eight large ſhips now in the River Thames, bound to New-England; and ſhould likewiſe give orders for the putting on land all the paſſengers and proviſions intended for the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The providence of God appears very conſpicuouſly in this order of Council; for the famous Mr. Hampden, Sir Matthew Poynton, Sir William Conſtable, Sir Arthur Haſleridge, with many others of the ſame ſtamp, and, above all, Oliver Cromwell, were actually embarked, and would have ſailed the next day, had they not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by this order. When liberty is loſt, let ſlaves and cowards ſtay. True Engliſhmen could not bear the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſight. Religion, laws and liberty were then no more!</p>
            <p>The murmurings and diſcontent of the people increaſed daily. The King was at laſt prevailed on to call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and accordingly a Parliament was ſummoned to meet on the 13th of April, 1640, after twelve years in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion. The Commons preſently began to talk of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing grievances. Whereupon, to the ſurprize and concern of the whole nation, the King ſuddenly diſſolved them, after a ſeſſion of three weeks. And, to make the matter ſtill worſe, he at the ſame time continued the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012728_0028_0F94DD353A94DF38"/>
convocation by a ſpecial warrant; who, in complaiſance paſſed a canon, wherein the divine right of Kings, and unlimited obedience to them, were moſt ſtrongly aſſerted.</p>
            <p>By this prepoſterous conduct, the King ſoon found himſelf reduced to greater ſtraits and difficulties than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He was obliged to ſummon another Parliament, to meet on the 3d of November following. In this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he may be truly ſaid to have reverſed his former arbitrary proceedings, (tho' without any ſuch intention) by a more unaccountable ſtep than any he had yet taken; and to have degraded his authority beneath every thing even his adverſaries could have hoped for: I mean, by his paſſing a bill, whereby he diveſted himſelf of the power of diſſolving, or ſo much as proroguing them, without their own conſent. Thus he ſubverted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his country, to his own prejudice; as he had before violated it in numerous inſtances, to the detriment of his ſubjects.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh conſtitution is originally free. We do not owe our liberty to the conceſſions of our Kings; as ſome eccleſiaſtical writers have laboured to prove. No, Sir. In England there has ever been a conſtitution; that is, a ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of laws, inſtitutions and cuſtoms, according to which the King is obliged to govern, and the ſubject to obey. The King, in his coronation oath, as much ſwears to the people, as the people ſwear to the King. When the Prince acts in conformity to the laws, he ought not, he muſt not be reſiſted, under any pretence whatever; but if he violates the fundamental laws of the realm, and actually ſubverts the conſtitution, he virtually unkings himſelf, and may then not only be reſiſted, but even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, by his injured people. Lineal ſucceſſion, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary right, have no foundation in nature; and to ſay they are appointed by God, is ſo groundleſs and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a poſition, as to merit no reply. There is no form of Government in the world of divine appointment: Every nation and kingdom under heaven is left to ſettle that form of Government which is moſt agreeable to their genius, and moſt conducive to the ſole end of all Government, the happineſs of the community. Even where kingly Government prevailed, hereditary fight
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012728_0029_0F94DD35FA63EFE0"/>
was firſt introduced by communities, to prevent ſtrife and confuſion. In England this right is acknowledged and ſtands firm, at this day; but ſubject to certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions: that is, there have ever exiſted in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity certain laws founded on reaſon, tending to the public tranquillity and welfare: theſe laws are the rule of the Governor's adminiſtration, as well as of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples' obedience; theſe laws are the conſtitution of the realm; and whenever it happens that a Prince endeavours to ſubvert that conſtitution, and ſubſtitutes an arbitrary power in its room, then it becomes juſt, reaſonable, and neceſſary, not only to reſiſt, but even to depoſe ſuch a Governor. And if the circumſtances of his deſcendants are ſuch as will not comport with the intereſt of the nation, the lineal ſucceſſion may be altered, or the Crown tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from one branch of the family to another; or to a new family, when the ſupreme law, the ſafety of the people, calls for it. By a ſtatute as far back as the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of Queen Elizabeth, it was made high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for any one to affirm, that the reigning Prince, with the authority of Parliament, is not able to limit and bind the Crown, and the deſcent and inheritance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This plainly ſhews the Legiſlature's opinion of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary right in thoſe days.</p>
            <p>The deſign of this letter, Sir, is to convince you, and all into whoſe hands it may fall, that King Charles was the very perſon who did deliberately and ſtrenuouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſubvert and deſtroy the conſtitution of this kingdom, and to ſubſtitute in its room a wicked, lawleſs and tyrannical power over the lives and properties of his ſubjects; and conſequently, that the oppoſition, of his ſubjects, or the attempts of the people to depoſe him, cannot, with any colour of reaſon or juſtice, be called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> rebellion. No, Sir; it was a neceſſary oppoſition, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the juſteſt principles: It was an oppoſition per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conſiſtent with our holy religion, with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe of mankind, as well as entirely agreeable to the particular laws and conſtitution of this realm.</p>
            <p>Government, I will allow, is a ſacred thing, as you ſo often repeated; and to reſiſt Goverment is certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and may be reckoned among the moſt heinous
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012728_0030_0F94DD36C23C3460"/>
crimes: But Tyranny is not Government. And as, in caſe there were no civil polity, men would not, however, be deſtitute of a natural right to defend their lives and properties, but might perſonally reſiſt, or, if they found it neceſſary, deſtroy the invaders; ſo, as the nature of things does not allow of any eſtabliſhed umpire to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine between a Prince and his people, the community has a like natural right of defending itſelf againſt an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary or cruel adminiſtration. Nor is the exertion of this right liable to ſo much objection as is that of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, for the matters in diſpute between thoſe are often of ſuch a nature, as makes it very difficult to judge of the aggreſſor: The offence is oftentimes ſecret; or, immediately affect the aggrieved. Self-love may magnify it beyond its due meaſure, or prompt to revenge, when prudence or good-nature may dictate otherwiſe in vain: Moreover, in certain caſes one may ſerve a preſent inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, by claiming redreſs where no real injury has been offered. But a conſtitution can be no ſecret, nor can the violations of it be concealed. Self-love can never influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the ſociety to reſiſt legal Government; for the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety can conſider that as no other than its own ſecurity and ſupport, and will be ever ready, for its own ſake, to maintain and defend it. In ſhort, as thoſe in authority have greater inducements to become tyrants, than ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects can have to reſiſt or revolt; ſo, in fact, while it has been the almoſt conſtant aim of all governments to make themſelves abſolute, and the generality of Princes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by no other rule than their own caprice, with no other view but that of gratifying their luſt of power, ſome, or pleaſure; no people, on the other hand, as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ion, ever revolted, 'til their oppreſſion became intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; nor have their been many (hardly any) leſſer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections, or rebellions of a few, that have not been warrantable in point of equity, tho' not of prudence.</p>
            <p>Again, private men in ſociety, however injured and abuſed, muſt not be their own judges; but muſt ſeek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from the equitable and impartial laws of the land. But King Charles had deprived them of that reſource; laws and appeals were no more; he had a hundred times broken his coronation-oath. In the very nature of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012728_0031_0F94DD3783985578"/>
is implied public ſafety and protection; King Charles's Government was public deſtruction and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. He had taken from his ſubjects every thing that was dear and valuable: Their peace, their rights and poſſeſſions; all which he had publicly ſworn, at his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, to defend and maintain: Their properties he had unrighteouſly invaded, their liberties infringed. All this he did by means the moſt arbitrary and tyrannical; by repeated acts of horrid cruelty and barbarity, even on the beſt and wiſeſt of his ſubjects.</p>
            <p>What was now left for the people to do? He was now no Prince of theirs; he had forfeited their allegiance. Liberty and laws were a jeſt; he treated their very name with contempt. Mr. Locke ſays, <q>That in a ſtate of nature every man has a right to vindicate himſelf; and when ſociety is diſſolved, the ſame right returns. Men can never be deprived of public ſafety and private defence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The people of England had no quarrel with King Charles, who had taken an oath to rule and govern by the laws and conſtitution of the realm; but when this King, by a conduct of many years, had diſcovered in ſpite of oaths and laws, that he would rule by violence, and abide by no law, he was degenerated into a tyrant, and become a different perſon; then it became neceſſary for the people to repel force by force. They ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but chains and fetters on one ſide, and arms on the other; and they wiſely flew to their arms; which is what the people of England have ever done, and ever will do, in ſuch direful circumſtances. King Charles had no more right to what the law did not give him, than the Grand Turk had; and therefore they did not oppoſe an Engliſh Governor, but an invader and a tyrant: For, as Mr. Locke juſtly obſerves, <q>Whereſoever law ends, tyranny begins.</q> Had King Charles conquered his ſubjects, what would he have gained, but the deteſtable glory of a triumphant oppreſſo, and the horrid ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeeing his kingdom reduced to poverty and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude! Do but look into the kingdoms of France and Spain, naturally the fineſt in Europe, and ſee the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty difference between their inhabitants and ours! And,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012728_0032_0F9BE47E10413588"/>
pray what makes that difference? Nothing but their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to have all their laws reduced into one ſhort one, that of Royal will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Would Princes live and die in peace and ſecurity, let them rule by the fixed and preſcribed laws of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective countries, and not graſp at more than is given to them. If Princes will never encroach, ſubjects will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rebel. How much more deſirable, how much more ſafe and eaſy is the condition of a Prince, who lives and rules by law over a free people, by their own conſent? The laws are their mutual defence and guard. Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Temple, in his admirable Eſſay of Government ſays, <q>The ſafety or firmneſs of any frame of Government de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the breadth of its bottom; the broader the bottom, the leſs liable to be ſhaken or overthrown.</q> The ground upon which all Government in England now does or ever will ſtand, is the conſent, the intereſt, and the affection of the people; therefore a monarchy, where a Prince governs by the affections, and according to the opinions of the people, makes of all others the ſafeſt and firmeſt Government. It is a poor and contemptible ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Prince, that of ſwelling his prerogative, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually catching at advantages over his ſubjects; it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers a mean ſpirit. A Prince of a generous turn of mind will not look on his ſubjects as his property, and as ſlaves; but conſiders them under the amiable and endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing title of his children, and himſelf as their father and protector, and will ever chearfully conſent they ſhall hold their lives, liberties, and eſtates, by certain fixed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed laws, and not by the mere will and pleaſure of any ſingle man. The univerſal experience of all ages, kingdoms, and nations, directs, that no mere man ought ever to be entruſted with abſolute power and dominion.</p>
            <p>Power of itſelf, without a proper check and controul, naturally makes men wanton, cruel and reſtleſs; it intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the mind: In ſhort, it has ſomething in its very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture too great for the human ſoul to bear; it is fit for none but God, who is infinitely wiſe, juſt and benevolent.</p>
            <p>I apprehend the facts already recited are abundantly ſufficient to prove that King Charles did actually ſubvert and deſtroy the conſtitution: However, to put this grand
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012728_0033_0F9BE47EAC8C6758"/>
point out of a poſſibility of being ever more diſputed, I will mention two or three more.</p>
            <p>He publiſhed a book of ſports, requiring it to be read in all churches, thereby to promote and encourage a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid profanation of the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>But before I enter upon the particulars of this act, and the wicked deſign of the Court by it, I would ſay a word or two relating to the ends of the original inſtitution of the Sabbath; from whence it will appear to be ſtill obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory upon all Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The belief of a God is the foundation of all religion. It is neceſſary we ſhould know whom we are to worſhip, and in what manner. It is likewiſe neceſſary that ſome portion of time be allotted for the inſtruction of mankind in the knowledge of their duty: Hence there is and ever will remain an eternal reaſon for the fourth command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment having a place among the unalterable precepts of the moral law. Indeed, the preſerving ſerious religion would be almoſt impoſſible without ſuch an inſtitution. On the other hand, the ſetting apart ſome periodical ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the more public and ſolemn worſhip of God, when mankind may be inſtructed in all thoſe duties that are required of them, in order to their preſent and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs, has a tendency to exalt the ſoul, to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the heart, to qualify us for the purpoſes of this life as well as of a better; in a word, to promote our temporal as well as our eternal felicity. The Sabbath was inſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that men might continually commemorate the works of creation, might offer up their grateful acknowledgements to God, of all his mercies and goodneſs vouchſafed towards them, and might openly declare themſelves the worſhippe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of the one true God, the Author and Lord of the univerſe, in oppoſition to the infidelity of Atheiſts, and the impure and ridiculous rites of idolatrous nations. The worſhip paid to God in heaven is thus repreſented in Scripture: The whole multitude of the heavenly hoſt fell down before him that ſat on the throne, ſaying. <hi>Worthy art thou O Lord, to receive glory and honour, and power, for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are, and were created.</hi> This is the employment of ſaints and angels in the eternal Sabbath in heaven; and the original
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012728_0034_0F9BE47F67891030"/>
foundation of the inſtitution of a Sabbath on earth was, the celebration of the praiſes of God. And that this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and public worſhip ſhould be performed in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable manner, it is requiſite it ſhould be done when the mind is moſt calm and ſerene, abſtracted from the noiſe and hurry of the buſy world: Therefore it was, that when God at firſt ſanctified the ſeventh day, or appointed it for a day of worſhip, he prohibited all manner of work thereon. Gen. ii. 1, 2, 3. Exod. xx. 8, &amp;c. But the buſineſs of the Sabbath is not confined to public worſhip alone; there are various other duties to be performed, thereon; it is then a proper time for reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and endeavouring to underſtand their true meaning; for thoſe that are maſters of families to be aſſiſting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing their children and ſervants in the knowledge and practice of their duty: In ſhort, 'tis to be ſpent in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tends to the honour of God, and the true intereſt and advancement of religion, virtue and ſobriety in the world. Beſides it ought to be conſidered that the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a great part of mankind, particularly thoſe in the lower claſs of life are of ſuch a nature, that they have no other time for improving themſelves in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and in the practice of true religion and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>I am ſenſible that this is a digreſſion from my main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; but really, Sir, I could not enter upon the recital of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, whereby it will appear, how the Sabbath was, by the expreſs command of King Charles I. and the wicked compliance of a corrupt and worldly-minded Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, profaned throughout this kingdom, in a moſt noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner, without ſaying ſomething of the morality of its inſtitution, and the unſpeakable advantages ariſing to ſocieties, as well as private perſons, by a religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation thereof; and conſequently of the obligation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on all men to ſanctify it.

Beſides this, they publiſhed a particular declaration, encouraging dancing, leaping, vaulting, ſhooting, May-games, Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunals, Maurice-dances, May-poles, all on Sabbath-days. <q>It is ſad to recount, ſays Doctor Fuller, what grief and diſtraction was occaſioned by this declaration in the hearts of all honeſt men. For, this Sabbath-breaking gave great offence to the people in general, and was a vaſt increaſe to the Puritan party, who cried out againſt it as a national ſin.</q> Some time after was publiſhed a ſecond book of Sports, with many enlargements, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding wreſtling, and cudgel-playing, &amp;c. &amp;c. on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days. The good, the pious, the moſt religious King Charles was ſo intent on this ſecond publication, that to haſten it, he wrote the following order or warrant to Laud.</p>

What will the reader now think of Archbiſhop Laud, of Biſhop Pierſe, and his ſeventy able Clergymen? I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to make any reflections of my own on ſuch a beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of men, aſſuming the ſacred character: But give me leave to recite the plain, the honeſt remark of the great Mr. Locke, relating to their conduct on a like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant occaſion: Speaking of the act of uniformity, and the wonderful compliance of the Clergy with it, he ſays, <q>So great was the zeal in carrying on this Church-affair, and ſo blind was the obedience required, that if we compute the time allotted for the Clergy to ſubſcribe the book of Common Prayer, we ſhall plainly find it could not be printed and diſtributed, ſo as one man in forty could have ſeen and read the book they did ſo perfectly aſſent and conſent to. The Clergy readlly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with it; for they are a ſort of men taught rather to obey than underſtand; and to uſe what learning they have to juſtify and not to examine what their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors command.</q> It is reported, that the late Sir Joſeph Jekyll concluded his ſpeech in favour of the mortmain act, with the following words: <q>It hath ever been a great unhappineſs, that the Clergy of our eſtabliſhed church have been no better acquainted with the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, laws, government, and true hiſtory of their country.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I could produce a cloud of witneſſes, to vouch in this manner, for the honeſty, prudence, and piety of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, in paſt times: Or in other words, to ſhew, what goodly tools of lawleſs power they have been, and how thoroughly qualified they are for ſuch an office. But the teſtimonies of two ſuch eminent perſons, as the foregoing, are equivalent to thoſe of a multitude: Mr. Locke, moſt illuſtrious for learning and virtue; Sir Joſeph, a man of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, inflexible integrity, and impartial juſtice.</p>

            <p>I am now come to the period of this wicked Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic's carreer; for, in the year 1644, he was brought to the bar of the Houſe of Commons, and, after a fair and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

reſolution, (with but one diſſenting voice) <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That he had traiterouſly endeavoured to ſubvert the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, laws, rights, and liberties of this kingdom; that he had uſurped an arbitrary and tyrannical power; and that for the ſame he ſhould ſuffer death, as in caſes of high-treaſon, <hi>To be drawn, hanged and quartered.</hi>
               </q> They afterwards ſent him up to the Lords, who voted him guilty of the treaſon, without one diſſenting voice. The manner of his death was changed from what the ſentence denounced, as it uſually is in the caſe of perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and he was beheaded on Tower-hill, the 10th of January, 1644—5.</p>
            <p>This is but a ſmall part of what I might have ſaid of the violent and impious proceedings of this Archbiſhop. What can one then think of ſuch hiſtorians as Clarendon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

There was no regard to women great with child, nor to inſants. One Proteſtant Lady was delivered while in the hands of the tormentor, who flung the new-born infant to be eaten by a hog. Theſe inſernal monſters carried their inhumanity ſo far, as to oblige fathers and mothers to murder their own children, huſbands their wives, and wives their huſbands. There was ſuch an exceſs of Popiſh cruelty, that my nature ſhrinks and recoils; I can repent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>I am ſenſible, I tread here on ſlippery ground; ſo ſhall make uſe of the words of others, as much as poſſible. General Ludlow, vol. I. p. 17. writes, <q>The King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d it without trembling, even at the diſtance of more than a hundred years. Pray, dear Sir, don't be angry with my military hiſtorian. Give me leave to tell you, he was a Gentleman of quality, learning, experience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: he commanded armies, fought battles, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the kingdom of Ireland. He was a Univerſity ſcholar, a man of ſenſe, and ever eſteemed to have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible regard to truth and juſtice. He was a man of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter family and fortune than Clarendon, and was Knight of the ſhire for the county of Wilts, when the other was only a member for Wotton Baſſet, a ſmall borough in the ſame county. Tis true, indeed, Ludlow was forced into exile, and driven as it were from place to place, to avoid aſſaſſination, or falling into the hands of an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The news of this dreadful maſſacre alarmed all the people in England to a great degree; and the more ſo, becauſe thoſe bloody Papiſts confidently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>irmed they were abetted by the King, and had a commiſſion under the the Great Seal for what they had done. Ludlow tells us<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. I. page 19.</note>. <q>A great number of Proteſtants flying from the bloody hands of the Iriſh rebels, arrived in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, filling all places with ſad complaints of their cruelties to the Proteſtants of that kingdom; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Parliament earneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Commons; and it was there obſerved by many, that thoſe concerned in the late tumult in Scotland, about a prayer-book, were forthwith declared rebels, in every pariſh church in the kingdom of England.</p>
            <p>The proclamation publiſhed in Ireland, by Sir Phelim Oncal, at the head of thoſe bloody traitors, began with the following words: <q>Be it known to all our friends and countrymen, that the King's moſt excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, for many great and urgent cauſes him thereunto moving, and repoſing confidence in our fidelity, has ſignified to us by commiſſion under the Great Seal of Scotland, bearing date the firſt of this inſtant October.</q> Then follows the Commiſſion itſelf, <q>To arreſt and ſeize the goods, eſtates, and perſons of all the Engliſh Proteſtants.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As the rebels pretended the King's authority and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, in ſo public and open a manner, it gave great offence to the Parliament, that they were not declared rebels and traitors by proclamation. At laſt, to ſatisfy them, it was promiſed, that on the firſt of January a proclamation ſhould be publiſhed, declaring the Iriſh Papiſts in arms to be rebels and traitors. But before this time came, Sir Edward Nicholas, one of the Secretaries of State ſent a ſpecial warrant to the Printer's, directing that only forty copies ſhould be printed, and thoſe not publiſhed till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is Majeſty's further pleaſure was ſignified. This gave a juſt foundation for all the jealouſies and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions that were afterwards entertained on that affair. Dr. Calamy, in his life of Baxter, page 43. ſays, <q>The Iriſh declared they had the King's commiſſion for what they did; and many even at that time, weighing all circumſtances, believed as much; while others repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it as an unjuſt and ſcandalous aſperſion on his Majeſty.

                  </gap>rquis of Antrim was forced to produce in the Houſe of Commons a letter of King Charles the Firſt, by which he gave him an order for the taking up arms; which being read in the Houſe, produced a long ſilence. The whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, with a great many ſurprizing particulars, was publiſhed in a pamphlet, entitled, <hi>Murder will out.</hi>
               </q> Thus far Calamy.</p>
            <p>Let us now ſee what Biſhop Burnet ſays of this bloody buſineſs, Hiſtory of his own Times, page 58, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>I will relate ſome particulars, concerning the Earl of Antrim; I had in my hands ſeveral of his letters to the King, writ in a very confident ſtyle. Upon the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in the year 1660, Lord Antrim was thought guilty of ſo much bloodſhed, that it was taken for granted, he could not be included in the act of Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that was to paſs in Ireland. Upon which he came over to London, and was lodged at Somerſet-Houſe. He petitioned the King, to order a committee of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to examine the warrants he had acted by. As it ſeemed but juſt to ſee what he had to ſay for himſelf, ſo a committee was nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d, of which the Earl of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland was chief. He produced to them ſome of the King's letters, but they did not come up to a full proof. In one of them the King wrote, <hi>he had not then leiſure; but referred himſelf to the Queen's letter,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>That was all one as if he wrote himſelf.</hi> Upon this foundation, Antrim produced a ſeries of letters, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by himſelf to the Queen; in which he gave her
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012728_0042_0F9BE490B6CA1F80"/>
an account of every one of thoſe particulars that were laid to his charge, and ſhewed the grounds he went on, and deſired her directions; to every one of theſe he had anſwers, ordering him to do as he did. So a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was prepared, to be ſigned by the committee, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth, That he had fully juſtified himſelf in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that had been objected to him, and that he ought not to be excepted out of the Indemnity. This was brought firſt to the Earl of Northumberland, to be ſigned by him; but he refuſed it, and ſaid, he was ſorry Antrim had produced ſuch warrants, but he did not think they could ſerve his turn; for he did not believe any warrant from a King or Queen could ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify ſo much bloodſhed, in ſo many black inſtances as were laid againſt him. Upon his refuſal, the reſt of the Committee did not think fit to ſign the report; ſo it was let fall; and the King was prevailed on to write to the Duke of Ormond, telling him, that Antrim had ſo vindicated himſelf, that he muſt endeavour to get him included in the indemnity: That was done, and was no ſmall reproach to the King.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Neither Burnet nor Calamy takes notice of the date of this famous letter of King Charles the Second, to the Duke of Ormond, but it was dated at Whitehall, the 10th of January, 1663.</p>
            <p>Upon my word, Sir, this bears hard upon the memory of your holy martyr. Had I time, I could produce a variety of other inſtances to convince you, that you are guilty of a moſt notorious miſtake, when you ſo repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed, he ſuffered martyrdom for the Proteſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. I do not believe, indeed, King Charles the Firſt gave the Iriſh Papiſts a commiſſion to cut throats, to rip up women with child in cold blood, and other ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid cruelties; but from a ſtrict and impartial enquiry into the beſt hiſtories of thoſe days, there is really too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>During the King's ſtay in Scotland, he endeavoured to prevail on that people to invade England, but without effect. On his return to England he was obſerved to grow daily more violent and tyrannical. He countenanced a company of looſe diſſolute fellows, frequenters of ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, taverns and gaming houſes, and kept a table for them in his own palace at Whitehall; and at the head of this rude mob, all armed, he entered the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ſat down in the Speaker's chair, and demanded the delivery of five of the moſt eminent members, Pym, Hampden, Hollis, Stroud and Haſleridge: Names that I cannot mention without a peculiar reverence; their memories will be always dear to every honeſt Briton, for that noble ſtand, that brave defence they made, in favour of the religion, laws, and liberties of their country. Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſays, page 21. <q>The King encouraged a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of looſe and debauched fellows about the town, to repair to Whitehall, where a conſtant table was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for their entertainment. And again, page 24. The King went in perſon to the Houſe of Commons, attended not only with his ordinary guards of penſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers but alſo with thoſe deſperadoes, which for ſome time he had entertained at Whitehall, to the number of three or four hundred, armed with partizans, ſwords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and piſtols. The King not finding any of the five members there, left the houſe; many members cried out <hi>Privilege, Privilege,</hi> and were pleaſed to call it an outragious act againſt all the peoples' rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges; and, after a ſhort debate, they unanimouſly voted, <hi>That the King's entering their Houſe was in a warlike manner.</hi> And therefore they, in great fear, trouble and confuſion, adjourned to the Guildhall, in the city, for their better ſecurity. The ſame evening the King went into the city; but his coach was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by multitudes, crying out, <hi>Privilege of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> This happened on the 4th of January, 1641<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from this day we muſt date the beginning of the civil war. The King doubled his guards at White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </p>
            <p>By all accounts, and in all ſhapes, the King himſelf was the beginner of this dreadful civil war.</p>
            <p>The pretenſion of both parties being ſubmitted to the deciſion of the ſword, the only diſpute now was, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the people of England ſhould again recover their laws and liberties, or be governed by the abſolute will and caprice of a ſingle perſon? Whitlock, ſpeaking of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament forces, ſays: <q>Moſt of them were freeholders, and freeholders ſons, who upon matter of conſcience engaged in the quarrel; and then being armed within by the ſatisfaction of their own conſcience, and without with good iron arms, they would as one man ſtand firmly, and charge deſperately.</q> Ludlow ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. I. page 41, 42.</note>, <q>Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to this extremity, the nation was driven to a neceſſity of arming, in defence of the laws, openly and frequently violated by the King, who now reſolved to do that by force of arms, which he could not do by the ſtrength of argument. I thought it my duty, as an Engliſhman, to enter into the ſervice of my country, in the army commanded by the Earl of Eſſex, under the authority of the Parliament.</q> A true Engliſh ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit! O how far different this from Clarendon and Eachard!</p>
            <p>At laſt, after a dreadful civil war of many years, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, laws and liberty prevailed, as they ever will do in England, ſooner or later. The King, by the fate of war, was taken, and afterwards made a priſoner at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Port, in the iſle of Wight. Here he entered into a treaty with the Parliament, commiſſioners being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that purpoſe by both parties. The King entirely deſpairing doing any thing more by force, made a great many conceſſions, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) To indemnify the Parliament for all that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:012728_0045_0F9BE492E5114200"/>
been done by them during the late war, which the King acknowledged they were neceſſitated to do in their juſt and lawful defence.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) He agreed, that Archbiſhops ſhould be aboliſhed, and that the Biſhops who remained, proviſionally, ſhould not exerciſe authority, juriſdiction, or ordination, but with the advice and aſſiſtance of their Preſbyters, that the Preſbyterian Government ſhould be eſtabliſhed for three years, at the end of which the Aſſembly of Divines, his Majeſty naming but twenty more, ſhould determine the form of Church Government for the future; and that the Common Prayer ſhould be taken away out of all churches and chapels.</p>
            <p>I mention theſe particulars to ſhew the ignorance and preſumption of thoſe who annually affirm, the King was a Martyr for the church.</p>
            <p>During this treaty the Parliament received letters from Colonel Jones in Ireland, giving an account of the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Marquis of Ormond in that kingdom, with a commiſſion to conclude a peace with the rebels, at the very time when the King was treating with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to carry on the war againſt them. Jones alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted a letter of Ormond's to the chief of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Again, though in time of Parliament he often promiſed to redreſs grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances; yet the beſt friend he hath cannot produce one act of good he ever did his ſubjects in the vacancy of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Does this agree with the King's ſtrict juſtice, piety, and devotion, that Clarandon ſpeaks of? This diſcovery put an end to the treaty at once.</p>

            <p>Cromwell and a few more of the army had now the majority in Parliament, and court was made to them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. They abuſed that power they found they had, both in the army and the Houſe of Commons, to execute the baſe deſign they had formed againſt the King's life. I have no reſerves; I love a fair and open repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of things. I can ſee wickedneſs, tyranny, and a flagrant breach of truſt on both ſides. I will readily grant that the King had hard and cruel uſage; that he was murdered; that he was deſtroyed by a faction! The conſtitution was now again trampled upon, the laws were violated; tyranny and a wicked military force uſurped their room! But ſtill let us trace this lamentable ſtate of things to its firſt cauſe. It began from the Court and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. It was the Monarch who created a diſguſt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. It was the inſolence of churchmen that made the church odious. You deteſt the murder of the King; ſo do I altogether as much. But I likewiſe deteſt the murder of the conſtitution, in which he and his wicked C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ſellors were principals, and which for many years <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap> been effecting. You mentioned the murder of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and the abolition of the Monarchy as the moſt wonderful events that ever the world produced. But, Sir, give me leave to tell you, that there was nothing wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or ſurpriſing therein. Any one that had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> all acquainted with the Hiſtory of kingdoms or ſtates <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> eaſily have foreſeen them. Cromwell, Ireton, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> others of the army, had by invincible courage ſubdued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

by troops not only hardy and brave, but the moſt ſober alſo, and beſt diſciplined, that this or any other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had ever ſeen. What wonder is it, if the leaders of ſuch as theſe, if they had an inclination to ſubvert the laws of their count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, to ſet up for themſelves, and erect a new tyranny in their own perſons, in the place of that from which they had juſt delivered her; I ſay, what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is it, if a ſet of men thus qualified accompliſh their purpoſes. It was the beſt of the Roman troops that were the inſtruments of Caeſar's uſurpation. Soldiers are inured to implicit obedience. Whatever their officers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand they ſeldom ſcruple. It is their profeſſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute by force, and the ſword. Cromwell, Ireton, and a few more of the army, having ſucceeded in that bold and impious attempt, of ſecluding by force one hundred and forty members, or purging the houſe, as it was termed, found themſelves, by accurſed experience, able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance and controul the civil authority. They loſt no time, they exerted their ſtrength, deſtroyed the King, and ſeized the ſovereign power at once. Men naturally deſire dominion, and riches; and it is ridiculous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they will not endeavour to attain them, when they have opportunity and power. I could mention many parts of Europe, that have been enſlaved by their own troops. This has been and ever will be the caſe of all countries, that ſubſiſt by ſtanding armies. When thoſe have conquered the enemies of their country, they will ſubdue their country for themſelves. Inſtances of this are too numerous, to allow ours to be wondred at.</p>
            <p>You was all along groſsly miſtaken, in preſuming the death of the King to be a national act. It was merely the act of the army. Ireton was the perſon who drove on the King's trial and death. Cromwell was a long time in ſuſpence about it. <q>Ireton (ſays Burnet) had the principles and temper of a Caſſius in him, he ſtuck at nothing that could have turned England to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I could ſay a good deal in vindication of the Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, from the firſt ſeſſion to the laſt moment of their exiſtence; which was when the army by force ſecluded above one hundred and forty members, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>They were after that no Parliament; nor could they in any ſhape be deemed the repreſentative body of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No, certainly. They were then under the terror, awe, and influence of a wicked military power, which would admit of no check or controul. I chuſe here to make uſe of the words of others. Wellwood, in his Memoirs ſays, <q>No age ever produced greater men than thoſe who ſat in that Parliament. They had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient abilities and inclinations, to render the King and their country happy. They ſet down a ſcene of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances under which the nation had long groaned; the many cruelties and illegal practices of the Star-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and High Commiſſion Courts were now laid open; and it was inſiſted on, that thoſe two arbitrary tribunals ſhould be thrown down.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The intentions of this Parliament were certainly juſt and noble, and tended to the equal advantage of King and people. But the King urged on his own ruin, ſtep by ſtep, and at laſt came to an open rupture with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which made the gap too wide to be again cloſed. I am ſenſible, Clarendon and Eachard every where treat this Parliament as a parcel of rebels and ſcoundrels, and repreſent their proceedings in a baſe and injurious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But I have a greater authority than that of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man, to ſupport and vindicate their proceedings: That very convention that brought in King Charles II. though ready to run mad with loyalty, would not ſuffer any reflection on the conduct of thoſe illuſtrious patriots, except only in the article of beheading the King. Mr. William Lenthal, who had been Speaker of the Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and was a member of the reſtoring one, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to drop this expreſſion in the debate about the general pardon, <q>He who firſt drew his ſword <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <q>Sir, the Houſe hath taken great offence at ſome words you have let fall in this debate, which in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contain as high a reflection on the juſtice and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Lords and Commons of the late Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in their actings before 1648, as could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. They apprehend there is much poiſon in the ſaid words, and that they were ſpoken out of a deſign to inflame, and to render thoſe who drew the ſword to bring delinquents to puniſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Do not Clarendon and Eachard ſtand unanſwerably condemned in the moſt ſolemn manner by this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Houſe of Commons, pronounced by their Speaker? after which all future Critics on them would be ſuperfluous.</p>
            <p>I now come to that part of your ſermon, wherein, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſual cuſtom, you laid the trial and death of the King at the door of the Preſbyterians. Moſt true it is, on the contrary, that of all our different parties, none had the honeſty and courage to appear openly for the King but the Preſbyterians. They exerted themſelves in public and private, and omitted no one thing that was poſſible to be done, to prevent the execrable fact of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Majeſty to death. No ſooner was he taken and confined as a priſoner, but Mr. Calamy, Mr. Mariſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. Aſh, Mr. Whiteaker, Mr. Sedwick, and many other Preſbyterian Miniſters waited on the Lord General Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax, teſtifying their diſlike of making the King a priſoner. A few days after, above forty of the Preſbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters joined in a letter to the General, and officers in the army, freely declaring againſt their ſeizing and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſon of the King. This was about the latter end of December, 1648. About the middle of January it began to appear, that the death of the King was a matter fixed and determined by the army. On the 18th of January there was another meeting, of more than ſixty of the principal Preſbyterian Miniſters in and about London, wherein it was inſtantly agreed, that, in behalf of themſelves and their reſpective congregations, they

ſhould by ſome public act declare, before God, angels, and men, their abhorrence of the ſeizing and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſon of the King, and their deteſtation of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to death; which they apprehended would be the iſſue of the trial then depending. In conſequence of this reſolution, the following repreſentation was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately printed and publiſhed, in the form of a letter, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the General and Council of war:</p>
            <p>"That they appeared at firſt for the Parliament, on the propoſitions and orders of the Lords and Commons, June 10th, 1642, for bringing in of money and plate, wherein they were aſſured it ſhould be no otherwiſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, than to maintain the Proteſtant religion, the King's authority, his perſon in his Royal dignity, the free courſe of juſtice, the laws of the land, the peace of the kingdom, and the privilege of Parliament, againſt any force that ſhould oppoſe them. That they were wholly unſatisfied with the proceedings ſince the excluſion and impriſonment of the Members of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and held themſelves bound in duty to God and religion, the King, the Parliament, and kingdom, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs before God, angels, and men, that they verily believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the taking away the life of the King, in the way of trial then depending, was not only not agreeable to the word of God, the principles of the Proteſtant religion, (never yet ſtained with the leaſt drop of the blood of a King) or the fundamental conſtitution of the kingdom, but contrary to them; as alſo to the oath of allegiance, the proteſtation of the 5th May, 1641, and the ſolemn League and Covenant: From all which, or any of which engagements, they knew not any power on earth, able to abſolve them or others. They warned and exhorted in the name of the great God, all that belong to their charge and miniſtry, to keep cloſe to the ways of God, the rules of religion, the fundamental conſtitution and government of the kingdom; not ſuffering themſelves to be ſeduced from it, by being drawn to ſubſcribe the late models or agreement of the people, which directly tended to ſubvert the fundamental government; and to mourn bitterly for the ſins of all degrees of men, and beg of God that he would reſtrain the violence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Some of the ſubſcribers delivered it to the General, and Council of war; which, as Calamy obſerves, was running a great hazard, as things then ſtood; and may be juſtly reckoned as an evidence of the great integrity and honeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the perſons who ſubſcribed it. Yea, the day the King was beheaded, Mr. Calamy, and ſome others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to General Fairfax, and perſuaded him to reſcue the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012728_0052_0F94DD437B5CCAE8"/>
King; but he was full of regret and uneaſineſs, and ſaw that he had been trick'd and overpowered by his under officers, ſo that ſoon after he laid down his commiſſion, and never had to do with the army more, whereby Cromwell became head of all.</p>
            <p>What ſort of mortals muſt thoſe vicars, curates, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and dignitaries be, that paſs ſentence of damnation, every 30th of January, on thoſe Miniſters and their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, for killing this very King, whom, with ſo much boldneſs, truth and courage, they laboured to ſave? Strange and ſurprizing infatuation, egregious ignorance and baſeneſs, which no age or hiſtory can parallel!</p>
            <p>And here, Sir, you did not only ſeem to expatiate on the faults of the dead, with a bitter and malicious plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but was pleaſed to caſt many ſevere and indecent reflections on the preſent generation of Preſbyterians; <q>and did call on them aloud, to repent and mourn, in ſackcloth and aſhes; to weep and faſt, with the utmoſt contrition and ſelf-abaſement; that ſo they might not bear the abominable iniquities of their forefathers; but by their extraordinary humiliation and ſorrow might avert the juſt indignation and wrath of Almighty God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Conſidering all this, I was quite aſtoniſhed at what you advanced on this head In truth, it was not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reaſon and juſtice; but directly oppoſite to all divine revelation. It is from thence inconteſtably plain, that every man ſhall ſtand upon his own bottom, ſhall be condemned or acquitted hereafter, agreeable to his own conduct and behaviour; or as the New Teſtament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, ſhall be judged according to the actions done in the body, whether they be good or evil. It is no where ſaid, that any ſhall be judged according to the actions done or performed by their great-grandfathers, ſixty or ſeventy years before they were born. No, the very ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of it carries an injurious reflection on the juſtice and goodneſs of the Deity. And it can never enter into my held to conceive, that I can be properly puniſhable for the ſins of my parents. Of my own ſins I ought to repent, and to be filled with ſhame and indignation at the remembrance of them; and I am certainly liable to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in proportion to the degree of my guilt; But of
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012728_0053_0F94DD443A17D380"/>
my grandfather's or great-grandfather's ſins I can no more repent, than I can of the ſins of my grandchildren yet unborn. It is impoſſible for me to prevent what ſhall be done after I am dead, ſo it was equally impoſſible for me to help what was acted before I was born.</p>
            <p>You alſo hinted at the political principles of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſſenters. I take the liberty to ſay, they are not aſhamed of them. They are the ſame now as in the days of their forefathers. Upon their principles the late glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious revolution was founded. Their principles have been confirmed by many and repeated Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and have often had the ſuffrage and ſanction of the moſt auguſt aſſemblies upon earth. Upon the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r principles Sir, ſtands the parliamentary ſucceſſion of the Crown of theſe realms, in the preſent reigning family; and God Almighty grant it may there ever ſtand. Yea, I could tell you a time when the clergy themſelves were glad to borrow their principles.</p>
            <p>I cannot finiſh my remarks on your ſermon, without taking notice of what you was pleaſed to advance in the cloſe of it, relating to the title King Charles had to the Crown of England, which you called an abſolute, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſible, hereditary right, and conſequently not liable to cavil or diſpute, by party or faction. This is what I think ſhould never he ſaid in pulpits, as it ſeems to imply a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt of the validity of the parliamentary eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>I told you in the beginning of my remarks, that as far back as the thirteenth year of Queen Elizabeth, it was made high-treaſon, for any one to affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m, that the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prince, with the authority of Parliament, is not able to limit or bind the Crown. I doubt not but you imbibed this principle of hereditary right at Oxford, forty years ago; and having never ſuffered yourſelf impartially to examine its foundation, it is become to you as a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated truth. But the preſent age is given to reaſoning; they do not ſo implicitly ſubmit to abſurdities, though they have the ſanction of a convocational decree.</p>
            <p>You was pleaſed to dreſs up the principles of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians in a frightful ſhape; but let me tell you, Sir, in my turn, that the principles of your party have been burnt, not by a rude and lawleſs, rabble, but by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

in London, and by authority of Parliament. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you never have heard of this contemptuous treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Oxford principles, and therefore I will give it you from the Parliamentary records. <q>
                  <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1710. The Houſe of Lords taking into conſideration the judgment and decree of the Univerſity of Oxford, paſſed in their convocation, 21ſt July, 1683. It was reſolved by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament aſſembled, that the ſaid judgment and decree ſhall be burnt by the hands of the common hangman, before the Royal Exchange in London, between the hours of twelve and one, on Monday the 17th inſtant of March, in the preſence of the Lord Mayor of the city of London, and the two Sheriffs of London and Middleſex.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this decree were ſtrongly aſſerted the doctrine of paſſive obedience, the abſolute, indefeaſible, and heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary right of ſucceſſion to the Crown; and Revolution principles were called damnable. Biſhop Burnet, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this deteſtable decree, ſays, <q>The Univerſity of Oxford aſſerted the King's prerogative in the higheſt ſtrain of the moſt abject flattery poſſible, both in their addreſſes, and in their wild decree; in which they laid together a ſet of ſuch highflown maxims, as muſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh an unaccountable tyranny.</q>.</p>
            <p>I will readily grant, it is an action worthy a Miniſter of the Church of England, to diſcover a proper zeal for the ſupremacy and prerogative of his Prince; but then, Sir, it ſhould be with ſuch limitations, and reſtrictions, as are conſiſtent with our known and eſtabliſhed laws, and agreeable to the ſettlement of the Imperial Crown of theſe realms. Under this head you might have teſtified ſome love to your country, ſome little attachment to the liberties of your fellow-ſubjects. But the advancing or the bare hinting that impious doctrine, of an abſolute, indefeaſible, hereditary right, is not only weak and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, but may be attended with dangerous conſequences; as it may ſo unſettle the minds of ſome of his Majeſty's ſubjects, as to make them ſuſpect the validity of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary title: A title by far the beſt and moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and will be found by experience to be the moſt durable. An abſolute Prince is of all others the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecure;
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012728_0055_0F94DD45BA4E3178"/>
as he proceeds by no rule of law, he can have no rule of ſafety. He acts by violence; and violence is the only ſafe-guard againſt him. It was the advancing this ſlaviſh doctrine from the pulpit, in the latter part of Queen Anne's reign, that greatly contributed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion which broke out on the acceſſion of the late King, to the throne of this kingdom. This, with great propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety might be called the Grand Rebellion. It was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, the moſt wicked and diabolical, that ever the world produced; a rebellion againſt King, Lords and Commons; againſt religion, laws, and liberty; in favour of chains, fetters, ſlavery, blackneſs and darkneſs both of body and mind. An event that will leave an eternal mark of infamy and diſgrace on the Britiſh nation, as many of the nobility, gentry, and commonalty, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther openly engaged therein, or ſecretly favoured it. I have often wiſhed, for the honour of the nation, that an hundred of the moſt conſiderable of the rebels had been confined in Bedlam, during their reſpective lives, that after-ages might have concluded, none but fools and madmen were engaged in that moſt wicked and impious attempt.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot omit taking notice, not only to the everlaſting honour of the Preſbyterians, but of all the different denominations of Diſſenters, that there was ſcarce a ſingle man of them to be found, at that critical period, but what openly declared for the Parliamentary ſucceſſion of the Crown in the Houſe of Hanover; and were preparing to venture their lives and fortunes in its de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ence.</p>
            <p>The invader, you know, Sir, claimed under the notion of an abſolute, indefeaſible, hereditary right. Whether he was, or was not, the ſon of King James, is quite out of the queſtion; it is of no conſequence at all to any one man in England, Scotland or Ireland, who was his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or who was his mother; he is a perſon attainted by law, and therefore cannot reign; and all his aiders, and abbettors, or whoever holds any correſpondence or intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with him, are deemed and judged guilty of high treaſon<note n="*" place="bottom">

I aſſure you, Sir, was I in poſſeſſion of the mines of Mexico and Peru, together with all the other riches of thoſe vaſt and mighty empires, I would moſt chearfully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice all, to the very laſt ſhilling, to preſerve and tranſmit to poſterity, the preſent Parliamentary ſucceſſion of the Crown, with which are connected religion, laws, liberty, and independency; and ſhould, in my moſt calm and ſerious moments, eſteem my conduct to be juſt and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. And I perſuade myſelf, I here ſpeak the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of every true Briton. Moſt ſurpriſing then it is that any one who has bound himſelf by the ſtrongeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements religion can lay men under, and has tied down his ſoul by an oath, to defend and maintain the preſent ſettlement of the Crown in the illuſtrious Houſe of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover, ſhould be ſo wicked and profane, as to hint any thing in favour of an abſolute hereditary right.</p>
            <p>Thanks be to Heaven for this <hi>Parliamentary ſettlement of the imperial Crown of Great Britain:</hi> A ſettlement, which our religion, our country, our liberty, and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, oblige us to maintain: Yea, without the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an oath, we are bound to defend this eſtabliſhment, by every motive that can influence the mind of men; honour, conſcience, and the love of our country, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains us to it.</p>
            <p>We ſhould certainly have been chained down, in the moſt abject condition of ſervitude, in the reign of the late King James, had not the Almighty, in mercy, given us that glorious inſtrument of his Providence, the late and memorable King William; by whoſe ſeaſonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition we are now in a condition of enjoying life, liberty, religion and property.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not content myſelf with remarks only from the different hiſtorians of thoſe days; but let us ſee the calm and deliberate reſolutions of the Lords and Commons, the repreſentative body of the whole nation: In the firſt year of King William and Queen Mary, an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was made, entitled, An ACT <hi>declaring the rights and liberties of the ſubject, and ſettling the ſucceſſion of the Crown:</hi> It begins thus, 'Whereas the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in Parliament aſſembled at Weſtminſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

All which are utterly and directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the known laws, ſtatutes, and freedom of this realm: And the ſaid late King, having abdicated the Government, and the Throne thereby being vacant, they the ſaid Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, aſſembled at Weſtminſter, do reſolve, That Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am and Mary, Prince and Princeſs of Orange, be, and be declared King and Queen of England, France and Ireland, and all the dominions thereunto belonging, &amp;c. &amp;c." Then they enjoin the following oath to be taken, "I A.

            <p>In the declaration preſented by the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to King William and Queen Mary, on their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the Crown, after having aſcertained the rights and liberties of the people in the ſtrongeſt terms, we have the following words: "And it is hereby-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and enacted, that all and ſingular the rights and liberties, aſſerted and claimed in the ſaid declaration, are the true, ancient, and indubit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Let us now ſtep into Scotland, and ſee what was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted there at this important juncture, in a grand and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012728_0058_0F94DD47FAE3BAB8"/>
convention of their Lords and Commons, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, "That whereas King James VII. by the advice of wicked Counſellors, did invade the fundamental conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Scotland, and altered it from a legal, limited monarchy, to an arbitrary and deſpotic power, and exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that power to the ſubverſion of the Proteſtant religion, and to the violation of the laws and liberties of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, &amp;c. &amp;c. All which miſcarriages of King James were utterly and directly contrary to the known laws, freedom, and ſtatutes of the kingdom of Scotland. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe grounds and reaſons the eſtates of the kingdom of Scotland did find and declare, that the ſaid King James had forfeited the Crown, and the throne was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vacant, and the eſtates of the kingdom of Scotland had reſolved, that William and Mary, King and Queen of England, be declared King and Queen of Scotland, &amp;c."</p>
            <p>In theſe Acts of Parliament the cauſes and reaſons of the late revolution are fully ſet forth.</p>
            <p>The people of England and Scotland, when they had gone ſo far, plainly ſaw the work was but half done. They had only delivered one generation from Popery and Slavery, and knew that in caſe King William, and Queen Mary, and the Princeſs of Denmark, left no iſſue, ſome Popiſh Prince or other, under pretence of being next in deſcent, might ſet up a claim to the Crown. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration gave birth to another <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> made in the thirteenth year of King William, entitled, "An Act for the further limitation of the Crown, and for the better ſecuring the rights and liberties of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject." By this act "the moſt illuſtrious Princeſs Sophia, Electreſs and Dutcheſs Dowager of Hanover, and the heirs of her body being Proteſtants, were declared the next in ſucceſſion in the Proteſtant line, to the Crown of England, &amp;c. &amp;c. after the late King William and the Princeſs Anne of Denmark, and their reſpective iſſue; and it is enacted, that the Crown ſhould be, remain, and continue to the ſaid Princeſs Sophia, and the heirs of her body being Proteſtants; and there unto the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in the name of all the people of this realm, did moſt humbly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubmit themſelves, their heirs, and poſterities, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:012728_0059_0F94DD1BC782AF08"/>
About this time a little Popiſh Jacobite party began to peep up; upon which another <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> was framed, entitled, "An Act of attainder of the preſent pretended Prince of Wales of high treaſon." This Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite faction ſtill ſubſiſting, our Great Deliverer, and his glorious Parliament, having a dread upon their minds, of that Popery, Slavery, and Arbitrary Power, from which they had been ſo lately delivered, were now reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do the work effectually; and for that purpoſe they paſſed another Act for extinguiſhing the hopes of the preſent pretended Prince of Wales, and all other preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders whatſoever, and their open and ſecret abettors. And, to clinch the nail and make thorough work of it, they framed the Adjuration Oath, and thereby tied down the people, body, ſoul, and eſtates, to maintain and defend the ſettlement of the Crown in the Houſe of Hanover.</p>
            <p>By theſe means our glorious Deliverer compleated his work, and handed down to us the moſt pure religion and the beſt conſtitution in the univerſe; guarded, and fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced about by oaths, and laws, as unalterable as human affairs can be.</p>
            <p>When I conſider how we ſtand as to the Pretender, that we have all perſonally abjured him in public courts of juſtice, and have in the preſence of God, angels, and men, declared the ſame to be without any equivocation, or mental reſervation; really, when I conſider and reflect on theſe many ſolemn ties of laws and oaths of religion and conſcience, of duty, intereſt, and inclination, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks all fear vaniſhes in a moment, and an invaſion in favour of the Pretender, appears to be a moſt wild and romantic chimera, unleſs ſupported by a wicked reſtleſs faction within our own bowels; he may otherwiſe with equal reaſon, and probability of ſucceſs, attempt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the moon, as to invade and conquer the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland<note n="*" place="bottom">This was written before the French had taken Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, or any part of Flanders, or the breaking out of the late rebellion.</note>. His preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and the next ſucceſſor to the crown, we know full well, will always rule agreeable to the laws and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the kingdom; and God Almighty grant, their
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:012728_0060_0F94DD1B001BE4A0"/>
ſucceſſors may ever follow their glorious example: and then they will ſtand, eternally ſtand, on Sir William Temple's broad bottom, viz. The affection, intereſt, and inclination of the people, againſt which the united pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of France and Spain, Hell and Rome, will never prevail.</p>
            <p>I have often wiſhed that the ſundry Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for limiting and ſetting the ſucceſſion of the Crown, were more univerſally known and underſtood; and that the moſt ſignificant clauſes of them were engraved on monuments of braſs or marble, erected for that purpoſe in every pariſh church in England; that ſo the moſt wicked and impious of all doctrines, that of an abſolute, indefeaſible, hereditary right, might ſtand publicly and perpetually condemned.</p>
            <p>I have only one remark more, and then ſhall have done with your famous ſermon. You was pleaſed largely to inſiſt on the obligation all men are under, to pay a due and proper regard to the national religion, and national faith; and endeavoured to prove, that the legiſlature is at all times truly and properly inveſted with a power, not only to ſupport the national faith and religion, but to enforce it, and even its different modes and ceremonies, by civil penalties.</p>
            <p>I would not be underſtood here, to be running down all eſtabliſhments, and particularly that of the Church of England; but the eſtabliſhing a national faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and enforcing the ſame by civil penalties, does not appear to be reaſonable and juſt, or quite conſiſtent with the nature and end of civil ſociety. Religion, I mean true and real religion, in its own nature is incapable of being eſtabliſhed by any law. It is not ſubject to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man inſpection, nor can it be controuled by any human authority. It conſiſts in the reverence and love of God, in conſtant ſubmiſſion to his divine will, and in a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and devout obedience to his Laws. This is truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but it cannot be infuſed into the mind by any other means than by argument and perſuaſion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſubmit it to the conſideration of the public, if it be juſt or reaſonable for the Magiſtrate to enforce the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal religion and faith by civil penalties. The different
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012728_0061_0F94DD48B9E0DD30"/>
modes and ceremonies of worſhip indeed may be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the magiſtrate, but this is not the eſtabliſhment of religion; theſe modes and ceremonies are, at beſt, only forms of godlineſs, and are often deſtitute of real devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reverence and love of God. Mahometaniſm is certainly an impoſture, and its di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erent modes and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of worſhip are fooliſh and ridiculous; the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of them does not alter their nature, or make them a jot more reaſonable and juſt. Upon the whole, there is ſomething in the nature of true and real religion inconſiſtent with any civil eſtabliſhment whatſoever. But the contending for, and eſtabliſhing a national faith, is ſtill more unaccountable. With reſpect to faith, every man muſt believe according to the evidence that is exhibited to him; he cannot help it. Such is the frame of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind, that it cannot withhold its aſſent or belief from any propoſition that ſhall appear to be true or probable. I evidently perceive, two and three make five; was I to gain the world, I cannot think otherwiſe. I have never been at Jamaica, yet I believe there is ſuch a place; and that it lies in or near the particular latitude deſcribed in our maps: The teſtimonies I have received of it are ſo ſtrong, as force the belief of it, whether I will or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tranſubſtantiation, the Athanaſian creed, and many other things I could mention, are truly myſterious and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, and therefore cannot be properly the objects of the aſſent of any reaſonable man. Was I to be threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſevereſt tortures, if I did not believe theſe doctrines, yet the fear of thoſe ſevere puniſhments could not force me to the belief of them; it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to conſider them any otherwiſe than as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd falſehoods. The dread of pain might induce me outwardly, to acknowledge them a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> true; but this would be no other than a wilful deliberate act of hypocriſy, for which I ſhould ſtand condemned in my own conſcience.</p>
            <p>I will grant, the belief of a God is the foundation of all religion; there is no man who makes any uſe of his reaſon; but will conclude, that from eternity there muſt have exiſted ſome one, unchangeable, independent, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſelf-exiſtent Being, from whom all other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and all other things, that are, or ever were, have
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012728_0062_0F94DD497A8AC160"/>
received their original. It is demonſtrably true, that all things could not have riſen out of nothing; nor can they have derived from one another in an endleſs chain or ſucceſſion. Whatever exiſts muſt have a cauſe, a reaſon, a ground of its exiſtence; therefore, it is one of the moſt evident truths in the world, that ſomething muſt have exiſted eternally and independently: That is, (as Dr. Clarke very juſtly obſerves) to exiſt by an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, originally in the nature of the thing. This is the moſt natural idea of the Supreme Being; therefore I am forced to believe, that there is One only living and true God, a moſt pure, glorious ſpirit, neceſſarily poſſeſſing all poſſible perfections, eternal, immenſe, immutable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, omniſcient, independent, infinitely holy, juſt and good.</p>
            <p>Thus far the light of nature, unaſſiſted by revelation, points out and directs; and the more we conſider and contemplate this ſubject, the ſtronger we ſhall find it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in our minds: yea this truth is ſo evident and demonſtrable, that it comes with an irreſiſtable power; ſo that our aſſent to it is neceſſary and unavoidable.</p>
            <p>Let us now examine the pretenſions of revelation, and we ſhall find the caſe exactly the ſame.</p>
            <p>It is undeniably true, and we have all the proof and evidence that any reaſonable man can deſire, that there really was ſuch a perſon as Jeſus Chriſt, and that he appeared in the world about 1700 years ago; that he was Jeſus the Meſſiah; and was ſent out from God, and acted by the authority of God; that he came into the world to eſtabliſh a pure, ſpiritual and undefiled religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in its nature ſimple and perfect, freed from ſuperſtition and idolatry, not loaded with ſacrifices or ceremonies, but every way adapted to make mankind wiſer and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The ſublimity of its doctrines, the purity of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, the ſpirit of love, charity, and univerſal benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that runs through the whole Chriſtian ſyſtem, obliges me to believe it has God for its author. Beſides, the mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>les our Saviour wrought, in confirmation of his doctrine, were many, and unconteſtable; performed in open day-light, in preſence of many hundred people; ſo that there could not be the leaſt ſuſpicion of any fraud or juggle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:012728_0063_0F94DD4A3A2C9400"/>
I am very ſenſible, 'tis natural for all men, to have a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> over-bearing opinion and eſteem of that particular reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they were born and bred up in; but Chriſtianity will bear the ſtricteſt enquiry, and ſtand firm, when the mind is freed from all the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſs and prejudice of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It calls on all its votaries to prove and examine it; and it has this particular diſtinction from all other religions whatſoever; that the more it is inſpected into, the more its purity, rationality, and divine authority will appear: So that I am obliged, whether I will or not, to acknowledge the truth of our Saviour's miſſion, and the divinity of his doctrine: The proofs are ſo inconteſtable and concluſive, that it is not in my power to withhold my belief or aſſent; ſo that this faith alſo, like all others, is in its own nature neceſſary and unavoidable. Theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes make it extremely difficult for me to conceive, that any one can be properly puniſhed or rewarded, either here or hereafter, merely for believing or not believing; and abundantly demonſtrate, that the power claimed by the civil magiſtrate, to eſtabliſh a national faith, is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible on rational principles, and not agreeable with the nature and ends of civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>With regard to Chriſtianity, it is purely a practical thing, not a ſpeculative one. The Scriptures declare, that faith without works is dead. It avails not. It ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing. Let a man believe by the lump, let him ſwallow creeds by dozens, let him believe all the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox eſtabliſhed notions, or all the orthodox opinions of the other different parties, yet, if he is an immortal man, he is worſe than an infidel. A good life infers good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Living well is the beſt evidence we can give that we believe well. Certainly, an honeſt, ſober, virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Heathen, muſt be more in the favour of God, than a wicked Chriſtian. A Pagan who obſerves the laws of truth and peace, is infinitely more religious, than a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, turbulent, ava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ters; eſpecially during the reign of that weak and arbitrary family, the Stuarts. And, really the conſideration is very affecting. I cannot forbear crying out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>To thee, O my God, are due my eternal praiſes, to thee will I offer my humbleſt acknowledgements of gratitude and thankfulneſs!</hi> Bleſſed, bleſſed be thy name for ever, that thou haſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me to act my part in Great-Britain, at a period of time when my perſon, my eſtate, my conſcience, my religion, are all my own.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bitrary dictates of inſolent and lawleſs power. The fruits of my labours are my certain property. My chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, thoſe dear pledges of conjugal affection, I educate for myſelf, in ſuch a manner, as my own prudence and circumſtances may direct, without the diſtreſſing fear of ſeeing them torn from me, by the bigotry and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of crafty and tyrannical Prieſts<note n="*" place="bottom">Memento the Schiſm Bill.</note>. Thanks be to Heaven, that the days of tyranny and darkneſs are now at an end, and that the men of the greateſt fortunes and abilities, of the preſent and riſing generation, ſeem to be inſpired with an ardent love of liberty, and to have been brought up in an abhorrence, of thoſe bitter and ſlaviſh principles, whereby wicked and deſigning Eccleſiaſtics have formerly invaded, and, at laſt, impiouſly deſtroyed the nobleſt privileges of their country. The infinite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of liberty<note n="†" place="bottom">When I ſpeak of civil liberty, I deſire always to be underſtood, as meaning nothing more than being govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by laws of our own making.</note> is now univerſally underſtood; and it is impoſſible for any nation to be too jealous of every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that may have a tendency to infringe or deſtroy it. In ſhort, it is one of the nobleſt gifts of God to mankind, and the only ſource and foundation of happineſs, both in public and private life. And what a ſatisfaction muſt it now afford, to every wiſe and honeſt man, to ſee the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant claims of ſome Clergymen in our day and time,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012728_0069_0F94DD4C83FE7DD0"/>
univerſally treated with ſcorn and contempt, even when advanced by a perſon of high rank, and, confeſſedly, great, abilities. I hope to live long enough to ſee the bulky performance of that Gentleman meet with the ſame treatment as the famous Oxford Decree of 1683, long ſince worthily burnt by the hands of the common hangman.</p>
               <p>Should any one ſay, that no ſuch claims or pretenſions are now aſſerted, I beg leave to refer him to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quotations from the work I have juſt referred to: <q>The magiſtrates ought not to interfere with the Clergy, in the exerciſe of their power; but ought on all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be aſſiſting to them, when their aid is required. The Clergy ought to be permitted to make ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, from time to time, as ſhall appear to them conducive to the ends of their divine commiſſion; and the power of interpreting thoſe conſtitutions and of carrying them into execution, ought to be inveſted in the clergy alone, or in thoſe only to whom they ſhall delegate it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <q>every Biſhop may claim authority by the word of God, for the correction and puniſhing of ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> are unquiet, diſobedient, and criminous; that is, for the exerciſe of all manner of ſpiritual diſcipline within his dioceſs. No adminiſtration that is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpiritual, can come into any other hands whatſoever, otherwiſe than by the voluntary choice and expreſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Biſhop.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I could quote ſeveral other paſſages, all endeavouring to prove that the Biſhops and Clergy, by a Divine right, ſtand inveſted with the ſole power for the correction of manners, and puniſhment of vice; and that his authority is to be exerciſed by viſitations, ſynods, and rural chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Truly the tyranny of the Grand Turk is not ſo deteſtable. Who would not rather be a ſlave to a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch than a monk? The experience of all ages confirms this truth, that the oppreſſion or cruelty of temporal ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants never was, norever can be, ſo great as that of Prieſts has been; were thoſe claims pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>itted and allowed, the ſacerdotal empire would ſoon draw all power to itſelf, and render the civil magiſtrate its ſlave and dependant.
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:012728_0070_0F94DD4D509842B0"/>
From the recognition and acknowledgement of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right ſprang the Papal ſupremacy; and ſhould the Clergy of England ever poſſeſs a power or right of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, underived from the civil magiſtrate, it would lead us to a ſtate and condition worſe than being ſlaves to Rome; we ſhould then become ſlaves and vaſſals to a Popery at our own door. Thoſe Prieſtly claims and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions are in themſelves not only abſurd, and dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſchievous; but alſo directly oppoſite to all the known laws and conſtitutions of the realm. At the time of the Reformation our forefathers were not content to aboliſh the uſurped power of the Biſhop of Rome, but went to the root of this accurſed evil, and declared, that all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, as well eccleſiaſtical, as civil, is veſted in, and exerciſed by authority from the Crown.</p>
               <p>3 Henry 8. <q>His Royal Majeſty is declared to be ſu-§ 1. C. 17. preme head of the church of England, and hath full power to puniſh, and repreſs all manner of errors, vices and ſins, growing within the ſame.</q>
               </p>
               <p>26 Henry 8. <q>The King, his heirs and ſucceſſors, Chap. 1. ſhall be taken and reputed the only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head on earth of the church of England, and have full power to correct, reform, and amend all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and enormities within the ſame.</q>
               </p>
               <p>1 Edward 6. <q>It is declared, and enacted, that all ſpi-Ch. 2. § 3. ritual, juriſdiction and authority is deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the King's Majeſty, as ſupreme head of the churches in England and Ireland.</q>
               </p>
               <p>1 Elizabeth, <q>Be it enacted, that all juriſdiction ſpi-Ch. 1. § 17. ritual, and eccleſiaſtical, be exerciſed by her Majeſty, and that ſhe hath full power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the viſitation of the eccleſiaſtical ſtate, and perſons, and for the reformation, order, and correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame; and, further, that all manner of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical power and juriſdiction is in the Crown, and is exerciſed by authority derived from thence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I could cite many other acts of Parliament, wherein it is moſt fully and peremptorily declared, that Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and all other eccleſiaſtical perſons whatſoever, have no manner of juriſdiction, or authority, but by, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and from the King, from whom alone all eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:012728_0071_0F94DD4DFA6E0200"/>
power is derived. Therefore, the Clergy ſetting up for an independency, or pretending to exerciſe any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or temporal juriſdiction, by virtue of a divine right, is directly contrary to all our known and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed laws, as well as inconſiſtent with all the principles of the reformation; which abundantly declare, that all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual power and juriſdiction is derived ſolely from the civil magiſtrate. This principle has ever been eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ground-work of the reformation. Whoever has a mind to ſee the weakneſs and pernicious tendency of thoſe prieſtly claims learnedly and judiciouſly refuted, may conſult that admirable treatiſe, entitled, <hi>An exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Codex,</hi> by that great Lawyer and true Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman the late<note n="*" place="bottom">Now the honourable Mr. Juſtice Foſter, one of the judges of the King's-Bench.</note> recorder of Briſtol. And leſt any one ſhould think I bear too hard on thoſe Reverend Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I beg leave to conclude with a quotation from this invaluable performance, Page 2. After having proved, beyond all contradiction, that Chriſt's kingdom was not of this world, but that it was an empire of truth and righteouſneſs, founded in the hearts of his faithful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he goes on, <q>For it is notorious; that a certain ſet of men (meaning the Biſhops and Clergy of ancient times) moſt impudently aſſuming to themſelves the ſole interpretation of the laws of this kingdom, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to an extraordinary zeal for the honour of its founder, did ſet up, and for many ages did maintain, a kingdom of their own over the greateſt part of the Chriſtian world; the moſt impious and oppreſſive tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ever exerciſed the patience of God or men; an empire founded in craft, ſupported by blood, rapine, breach of faith, and every other engine of fraud and oppreſſion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have now gone through what I firſt intended, and to ſpeak the truth, what was at firſt wrote for my own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate amuſement and without any deſign of its ſeeing the light; but when I conſidered what dreadful havock bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry and ſuperſtition had made in the Chriſtian world, I concluded, the publication might be of ſome uſe, and not unſeaſonable. My Lord Bacon's obſervation is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:012728_0072_0F94DD4EBA64A390"/>
juſtly, that the danger of ſuperſtition is even greater than that of Atheiſm: for, ſays he, <q>Atheiſm leaves men to ſenſe, to philoſophy, to laws, to reputation, all which may be guides to moral virtue, though reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were not; but ſuperſtition diſmounts all theſe; and erects an abſolute monarchy in the minds of men; Therefore, Atheiſm did never perturb ſtates; but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition hath been the confuſion of many. The cauſes of ſuperſtition are pleaſing and ſenſual rites and ceremonies, exceſs of phariſaical and outſide holineſs, reverence to tradition, and the ſtratagems of prelates for their own ambition and lucre.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Probably, I may have incurred the diſpleaſure of ſome perſons, by advancing things contrary to the commonly received opinions: But I beg leave ſolemnly to declare, that my intention is perfectly innocent and juſt. I deſign nothing but the defence and ſupport of the beſt religion, the beſt laws, and the beſt government in the world. I ſubmit all to the candour and good-nature of the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ader, and do hope he will forgive what was honeſtly meant, although it ſhould be found to be weakly executed. Should any one object, that I have taken too great liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the names and characters of the dead; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that I am fully ſenſible of the reaſonableneſs and juſtice of that ancient maxim, <hi>De mortuis nil niſi bonum:</hi> However, this muſt not extend to hiſtory, wherein for a juſt recital of facts, the true and full characters of the principal agents are often requiſite; and the hiſtorian ſhould be under no manner of reſtraint, but that only of keeping within the bounds of truth and decency.</p>
