            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE awful and unuſual Providence of GOD in the Week paſt, in which he has viſited us with a remarkable Earthquake, has been the Occaſion of my ſelecting the Words before us, for our Meditation at this Time. If we ſhould neglect to take a proper Notice, or to make a ſuitable Improvement of an Event of this Kind, we ſhould undoubtedly act againſt the Light of Nature, the firſt Principles, and moſt evident Dictates of Reaſon. Even theſe could teach <hi>Jonah'</hi>s Mariners in a Tempeſt, every one to ariſe &amp; call upon his God: tho' they were Heathen, unenlightned by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Strangers to the Covenant of Promiſe, and
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007375_0004_102B8BEE2CF58198"/>
Aliens from the Common-Wealth of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> They who dwell in the uttermoſt Parts of the Earth are afraid of his Tokens. Certainly therefore our Guilt and Puniſhment would be enhanced and aggravated, if we ſhould omit this natural Duty in a Caſe of equal Diſtreſs and Danger; if we ſhould incur the Character of thoſe who regard not the Works of the Lord, neither conſider the Operation of his Hands. We call our ſelves Chriſtians, we profeſs the true Religion, and enjoy the Means of Grace, the Oracles and Ordinances of God in their utmoſt Purity and Perfection: It may juſtly therefore be expected that we ſhould do more than others who are not favour'd with the like Advantages, that we ſhould be more ſerious and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in our Behaviour on ſuch an Occaſion; more frequent and fervent in our Addreſſes at the Throne of Grace, more careful and critical in our Enquiries into the Grounds of the divine Diſpleaſure, and wherefore our God is thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with us.</p>
            <p>The God of Patience is yet waiting to be gracious; He is loth to ſtrike the fatal Blow, to overwhelm us in univerſal and unavoidable Deſtruction. He has Tho'ts of Pity towards us; his Heart is turned within him, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentings are kindled together: How ſhall I give thee up <hi>Ephraim?</hi> How ſhall I deliver thee <hi>Iſrael?</hi> How ſhall I make thee as <hi>Admah?</hi> How ſhall I ſet thee as <hi>Zeboim?</hi> We may yet be reconciled to him in and thro' our Lord
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007375_0005_102B8BF01317C970"/>
Jeſus Chriſt, the great and only Mediator: But if thus having Space to repent, we yet repent not, we ſhall find that it is a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living God. If we deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe the Riches of Divine Goodneſs, Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance &amp; Long-ſuffering; there will be nothing before us but a certain fearful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation, which ſhall devour the Adverſaries. Be not deceived, God is not mocked. He will again viſit us with an Earthquake, or with ſome other deſolating Judgment; He has other Judgments in Store, other Arrows in his Quiver: And verily, it will then be more tolerable for <hi>Tyre</hi> &amp; <hi>Sidon,</hi> for <hi>Sodom</hi> &amp; <hi>Gomorrah</hi> than for us. After our hard and impenitent Heart, we ſhall treaſure up Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the righteous Judgment of God. <q>At his Wrath the Earth ſhall tremble, and the Nations ſhall not be able to abide his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In handling the Words, I propoſe to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two Propoſitions which are evidently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in them, and which may make Way for the Enquiry, What Improvement we are to make of the awful Providence in the Week paſt.—<hi>At his Wrath the Earth ſhall tremble.</hi>—This teaches us that an Earthquake is a Work of Almighty Power, and a Token of Divine Anger.</p>
            <p>I. An Earthquake is a Work of Almighty Power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007375_0006_102B8BF1EF62F370"/>
No Doubt natural Cauſes may be aſſigned for this <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> An impriſoned Vapour too cloſely pent, or too ſtrongly compreſſed in the Caverns beneath, will, thro' a natural Elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, abhor Confinement, dilate and expand, ſwell and heave up the Surface of the Earth, producing a Tremor and Commotion, till it either finds Vent, or, from ſome other Cauſe, it is ſmothered, and its Violence abated. Could we look into the Vaults below, over which we now walk without Fear, and in ſo much ſeeming Security, to ſee the tremendous <hi>Apparatus</hi> there: in ſome Places, immenſe Tracts of Sulphureous and Combuſtible Materials that lie buried, and wait for Nothing but a ſingle Spark to tear all before them in a ſudden and irreſiſtable Explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; In others, how thin the Arch which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſes between us and a Furnace of Flame, which curls up againſt it, waſts it away, cauſes it to grow thinner and thinner, and leſs able to ſupport us: Should we not ſhudder at ſuch a Proſpect, when the Imagination of it fills us with ſo much Horror and Amazement! And yet this is very probably the State &amp; Condition of our Globe at preſent. It has a natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to a final Conflagration. It is kept in Store and reſerved unto Fire againſt the Day of Judgment and Perdition of ungodly Men. And that ſame Diſpoſition of Things which fits it for this Cataſtrophe, renders it alſo liable to Earthquakes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:007375_0007_102B8BF38EAE7028"/>
But we muſt not imagine from hence, that an Earthquake, becauſe it may be accounted for on Philoſophical Principles, is a caſual Event, or that ſome Chance has happened unto us. It is God at Work, tho' he works by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of ſecond Cauſes. Tho' it is no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, it is the Effect of Almighty Power: This is frequently declared in the ſacred Pages: Nay this is taken for granted in the Context as an indiſputable Point; and <hi>Jehovah</hi> proves himſelf to be the only true God, in Oppoſition to all the Idols of the Heathen, from this very Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <q>The Lord is the true God; He is the living God, and an everlaſting King; at his Wrath the Earth ſhall tremble, and the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall not be able to abide his Indignation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How often do we find this wonderful and terrible Work aſcribed to God in the holy Scriptures? He looketh on the Earth and it trembleth; He toucheth the Hills and they ſmoke. At his Command a Vulcanoe is lit up to the univerſal Terror and Conſternation of the guilty Inhabitants round it. Deep groans the affrighted Earth, at his Preſence; and the awful Sound is reverberated from Cavern to Cavern thro' all its moſt intricate, gloomy and profound Receſſes. The whole Continent ſhivers &amp; quakes to its remoteſt Foundations; the Pillars of Heaven tremble and are aſtoniſh'd at his Reproof.<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. xxix. 8.</note> 
               <q>The Voice of the Lord ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Wilderneſs, the Lord ſhaketh the Wilderneſs of <hi>Kadeſh.</hi>

Thunder was in the Heaven: the Lightnings lightned the World, the Earth ſaw, trembled and ſhook. The Hills melted like Wax at the Preſence of the Lord, at the Preſence of the Lord of the whole Earth.</q> How exalted and ſublime theſe glowing Periods of Inſpiration, in which the ſhaking of the Earth is expreſly aſſerted to be a Work of Almighty Power!</p>
            <p>When the glorious God has, upon particular Occaſions, made a miraculous Deſcent upon our Earth, he has frequently been attended with an Earthquake, as one of the Tokens of his ſpecial Preſence. So at the Promulgation of the Law, in all its Terrors, to the attending Tribes,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Exod. xix. 19.</note> 
               <q>Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was altogether on a Smoke, becauſe the Lord deſcended upon it in Fire: and the Smoke thereof aſcended as the Smoke of a Furnace, and the whole Mount quaked greatly.</q> We have another Deſcription of this memorable Event in the Song of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak;</hi>

What ailed, thee O thou Sea, that thou fleddeſt? Thou <hi>Jordan,</hi> that thou waſt driven back? Ye Mountains that ye ſkipped like Rams? and ye little Hills like Lambs? Tremble thou Earth at the Preſence of the Lord, at the Preſence of the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </q> When God afterwards appeared to <hi>Elijah</hi> in the ſame Place, it was with the ſame terrible Circumſtances. An Earthquake was his Attendant.<note n="†" place="bottom">1 King. xix. 11.</note> 
               <q>Behold the Lord paſſed by, and a great and ſtrong Wind rent the Mountains, and break in Pieces the Rocks before the Lord, and after the Wind an Earthquake.</q>

               <q>of the Cities, and that which grew upon the Ground.</q> This was the Puniſhment of <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> when they laid an impious Claim to the Employment, the Honors and the Privileges of the Prieſthood, which God had confined to the Family of <hi>Aaron.</hi> The Anger of God was kindled againſt them for their preſumptuous and ſacrilegious Attempt. At his Wrath the Earth trembled, and the bold Conſpirators were hurled headlong, plunged promiſcuous and precipitant into the hideous Vaults below. Down they ſunk, as they were in the very Act to ſacrifice, and inſolently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>Moſes</hi> in the View &amp; at the Head of the Rebel Congregation.

               <q>And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, Hereby ye ſhall know that the Lord hath ſent me to do all theſe Works: For I have not done them of my own Mind. If theſe Men die the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Death of all Men, or if they be viſited after the Viſitation of all Men, then the Lord hath not ſent me. But if the Lord make a new Thing, and the Earth open her Mouth, and ſwallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the Pit; then ye ſhall underſtand that theſe Men have provoked the Lord. And it came to paſs, as he had made an End of ſpeaking all theſe Words, that the Ground clave aſunder that was under them: And the Earth opened her

Mouth, and ſwallowed them up, and their Houſes, and all the Men that appertained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Korah,</hi> and all their Goods. They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the Pit, and the Earth cloſed upon them, and they periſhed from among the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And all <hi>Iſrael</hi> that were round about them, fled at the Cry of them; for they ſaid, Left the Earth ſwallow us up alſo.</q> So alſo when the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> invaded the Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Days of <hi>Saul,</hi> God appeared for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of his People, and the Confuſion of their Enemies.

            <p>Upon the whole then, it evidently appears from what we have heard, that an Earthquake is not only an Effect of Almighty Power, but a Token of Divine Anger. It is a Judgment upon a Land, and it is to be looked upon as ſuch. God threatens it as ſuch againſt a ſinful and degenerate People: And in this Manner he has in Fact frequently teſtified his Anger

Of what infinite Conſequence and Importance is it, that we have this God for our Friend, that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint our ſelves with him, and be at Peace. This will ſupport us, give us a Preſence of Mind, a Courage, and a Dignity, amidſt all the Convulſions of the Earth, the Ruins of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of Nature.

               <q>God is our Refuge and Strength; a very preſent Help in Trouble. Therefore will we not fear, tho' the Earth be removed, and tho' the Mountains be caſt into the Midſt of the Sea. Tho' the Waters thereof rore and are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, tho' the Mountains ſhake with the ſwelling thereof.

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007375_0018_102B8C0A074D04C0"/>
Deſolations which he has made in the Earth! And theſe are the only Principles that will ſupport and abide by us in an Earthquake, when the gay Infidel, the licentious Libertine, and the bold Blaſphemer, forget their wonted Mirth and Frenzy, and tremble in the near Views of a miſerable Eternity. Where can we fly for Refuge, but to God our Maker, in &amp; thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the great and only Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? Who elſe will be able to protect us in the Day of the Lord's Anger, when the Earth ſhall tremble at his Wrath? This leads me to ſay,</p>
            <p>II. Is it as we have heard; This ſhould teach us the Vanity of all Confidence in the Creature, and the Uncertainty of all Earthly Enjoyments.</p>
            <p>Let us not put our Confidence in an Arm of Fleſh. Let us ceaſe from Man, whoſe Breath is in his Noſtrils, for wherein is he to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of.—Man that is a Worm, and the Son of Man that is a Worm.—What Defence can we expect here, when God ariſeth to ſhake terribly the Earth? On what Creature can we depend with Succeſs, when even the Ground, on which we tread, is not able to ſupport us?</p>
            <p>Where can we meet with a laſting Poſſeſſion, when our very Lands, which one would think would bid the faireſt for it of any Thing here below, when even theſe are liable to be ſunk in an Earthquake, and their Place no more to be found? How great the Folly of thoſe who place their ſupream Felicity in the Poſſeſſions
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007375_0019_102B8C0B9C6F4048"/>
and Acquirements of a vain Earth! Who heap up Silver as the Duſt, and prepare Raiment as the Clay! Who ſay to Gold, Thou art my Hope, and to the fine Gold, Thou art my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence! Their inward Thought is, that their Houſes ſhall continue for ever, and their Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Places to all Generations; they call their Lands after their own Names. O the Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Riches! What is it that thus inchants and infatuates the Generality of Mankind, for the obtaining of which, they toil and labour, ſacrifice all their Eaſe here, and frequently fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go all their Hopes of Happineſs hereafter? Uncertain Riches, which may make themſelves Wings, and flee away as the Eagles towards Heaven, or which may be ſuddenly overthrown by an Earthquake, and buried deep in the Subteraneous Vaults; never more to ſee the Light, till they are illuminated by the Flames of the laſt Conflagration. Let not the rich Man then glory in his Riches, for he that truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his Riches ſhall fall. God ſhall deſtroy thee for ever: He ſhall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy Dwelling-Place, and root thee out of the Land of the Living. The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous alſo ſhall ſee and laugh at him. Lo, this is the Man that made not God his Strength, but truſted in the Abundance of his Riches!

can by any Means redeem his Brother, or give to God a Ranſom for his Soul. So at the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by an Earthquake, the Merchants of the Earth are repreſented as utterly unable to help her, and as lamenting over her in all the diſmal Accents of Deſpair;<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xviii. 15.</note> 
               <q>The Merchants, which were made rich by her, ſhall ſtand afar off, for the fear of her Torment, weeping and wailing. And ſaying, Alas, alas, that great City, that was cloathed in fine Linen, and Purple, and Scarlet,; and decked with Gold, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, &amp; Pearls: For in one Hour ſo great Riches is come to nought!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing then we have here not continuing City, ſhall we not be exhorted to ſeek ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is an heavenly, to lay up Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Heaven, and to ſeek after the true Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, even durable Riches and Righteouſneſs, thoſe Things which remain, for they cannot be ſhaken: That we may know what is the Hope of our Calling, and what the Riches of the Glory of our Inheritance among the Saints, even that Inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for us?</p>
            <p>III. What we have heard teaches us the Evil of Sin, with the Neceſſity of ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and thoro' Reformation.</p>
            <p>We are a ſinful and degenerate People, and the Love of many waxes cold. Where is the Lord God of <hi>Elijah,</hi> the Spirit that animated

This, which was our Glory, is in a great Meaſure departed from us. We need to be ſhaken out of our Sleep, to be rouſed out of our Lethargy, our ſupine Indolence, our Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs and carnal Security. This no Doubt was the Deſign of the alarming Providence in the Week paſt. We have heard a Voice of Trembling, of Fear, and not of Peace. The Voice of God to us was as that of the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to <hi>Jonah;</hi>

               <q>What meaneſt thou, O Sleeper? Ariſe, call upon thy God; if ſo be, that God will think upon us, that we periſh not.</q> The Voice of God to us was as that to the Church of <hi>Epheſus;</hi>

And it was Sin that provoked God to appear againſt us in ſo awful a Manner; and the Land to tremble and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.—At his Wrath the Earth trembled.—Shall not the Land tremble for this; and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? God might juſtly have overwhelmed us in the

Fierceneſs of his Anger, have cruſhed us in our Beds, or buried us in the Bowels of the Earth. We might have ſerved as a fearful Example to ſome future People, of the pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſequences, and fatal Effects of Sin. So it is threaten'd to a rebellious and impenitent People;<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xxix. 22.</note> 
               <q>The Generation to come of the Children that ſhall ariſe after you, and the Stranger that ſhall come from a far Land, ſhall ſay, when they ſee the Plagues of that Land, and that the whole Land is Brimſtone, and Salt, and Burning, that it is not ſown nor bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, nor any Graſs groweth therein, like the Overthrow of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Admah</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi> which the Lord overthrew in his Anger, and in his Wrath: even all Nations ſhall ſay, wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this Land? What meaneth the Heat of this great Anger? Then Men ſhall ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have forſaken the Covenant of the Lord God of their Fathers.</q> Then might have been made over us that Lamentation of the Prophet;<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lam. ii. 1, 2, 5.</note> 
               <q>How hath the Lord covered the Daughter of <hi>Zion,</hi> with a Cloud, in his Anger, and caſt down, from the Heaven to the Earth, the Beauty of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and remembred not his Footſtool in the Day of his Anger! The Lord hath ſwallowed up all the Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and hath not pitied; he hath thrown down in his Wrath the ſtrong Holds of the Daughter of <hi>Judah,</hi> he hath brought
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007375_0023_102B8C13485CCAF8"/>
them down to the Ground. The Lord was an Enemy, he hath ſwallowed up <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he hath ſwallowed up all her Palaces; he hath deſtroyed his ſtrong Holds, and hath encreaſed in the Daughter of <hi>Judah</hi> Mourning &amp; Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</q> This might juſtly have been our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Is it not then an evil Thing and a bitter, that we have forſaken the Lord our God? Knowing the Terrors of the Lord, let us be perſwaded. Let the Sinners in <hi>Zion</hi> be afraid, let Fearfulneſs ſurprize the Hypocrites thereof.</p>
            <p>But behold the Goodneſs as well as Severity of God! and may this Goodneſs of God lead us to Repentance. He is yet giving us Space to repent; he is yet waiting to be gracious to us. He has not dealt with us as our Iniquities deſerve; the Day of Grace is not over with us, nor the Door of Mercy ſhut againſt us. In the midſt of Wrath, he has remembred Mercy, nor ſuffered the deſtroying Angel to lay deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Habitations of his People. O may our warmeſt Gratitude be excited upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and may we ſtudy what we ſhall render. Let our future Lives be devoted, with double Diligence, to the Service of our gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, and our beſt Benefactor. Let us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Delay, repent of our paſt Sins, with a ſincere &amp; thoro' Repentance; that Repentance which is unto Life, never to be repented of.

between God &amp; Man. May we know and acknowlege the God of our Fathers; may we ſerve him with a perfect Heart, and with a willing Mind.</p>
            <p>How happy would it be, if this awful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſhould be bleſſed by God, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a univerſal Reformation of Manners, and a Revival of Religion among us! When the Spirit was poured out upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles &amp; Profeſſors of the primitive Church, it was attended with an Earthquake.

IV. What we have heard ſhould teach us the Neceſſity of being in a conſtant actual Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs for a dying Hour.</p>
            <p>A Sentence of Death is paſſed upon all. The Living know that they muſt die. We know that thou wilt bring us to Death; but we know not the Time, nor the Manner of our Death, nor in what Form the laſt Enemy ſhall approach us. We know not when the Maſter ſhall call for us, whether at Evening, or at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, at the Cock-crowing, or in the Morning. Whenever it ſhall be, may our Loins be girt, our Lamps trim'd and burning. May we ſo number our Days, as that we may apply our Hearts unto Wiſdom. May we devote all our Talents to the Glory of our Lord, and employ them in his Service. May we be perpetually induſtrious in ſome Part of that Work which he has allotted us. Bleſſed is that Servant whom his Lord, when he cometh, ſhall find ſo doing.</p>
            <p>When we ſcruple the Lawfulneſs of any Action, in which we are engaged, let us ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how we ſhould feel if we were ſurpriz'd, in the midſt of it, by an Earthquake; and not dare to do any Thing which we ſuſpect would then give us Cauſe of uneaſy Reflection.</p>
            <p>By thus going on in an uninterrupted Courſe of Duty, leading a holy and conſcientious Life, realiſing our own Diſſolution, and habituating our ſelves to the Thoughts of it, we ſhall by Degrees, with the Aſſiſtance of Divine Grace,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007375_0027_102B8C1B053EDD70"/>
be greatly victorious over the Fears of Death, and in a conſtant actual Readineſs for its Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: Nor need we be anxious as to the Time, the Manner, or the Circumſtances of it. Should we be ſoon alarmed, &amp; taken away by the fatal Stroke; the Difficulties and Temptations of Life will be the ſooner over, and our Paſſage thro' this Vale of Tears of a ſhorter Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Should our Attack from the laſt Enemy be ſudden; our Tranſition will be ſo much the quicker and the eaſier, to the Regions of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Glory: Should it be painful; Heaven will be ſo much the more welcome, when we arrive there: Should it be attended with the moſt formidable Circumſtances; bleſſed be God, we may be ſtill ſecure: Tho' the Body ſhould be cruſh'd in an Earthquake, or ſink deep in the Subteraneous Vaults; the Soul ſhall be catch'd away, and tower aloft, upon the Pinions of Guardian Angels; ſafe and unhurt, amidſt this Diſcord of Nature, this Convulſion of jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Elements, the Wrecks of Matter, and the Cruſh of Worlds. The Soul and the Body are indeed at preſent ſeperated: but with a ſure and certain Hope of being again re-united, in better and more glorious Circumſtances; at that illuſtrious and tremendous Day, when the Earth ſhall give up the Dead that are in it.</p>
            <p>This leads me to ſay,</p>
            <p>V. and Laſtly, Earthquakes ſhould remind us of the ſecond Coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, at the Day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>

They are deſigned to be Warnings to the World, that this Day of the Lord is at Hand: It is near, it is near, and it haſteth greatly, when the Heavens ſhall paſs away, with a great Noiſe; 'and the Elements ſhall melt, with fervent Heat.' As a Prelude to this, we read,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Matth. xxiv. 7.</note> 
               <q>There ſhall be Earthquakes in divers Places;</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Luk. xxi. 25.</note> 
               <q>There ſhall be Signs in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars; and upon the Earth, Diſtreſs of Nations, with Perplexity, the Sea and the Waves roring; Mens Hearts failing them for Fear, and for looking after thoſe Things, which are coming on the Earth: for the Powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken. And then ſhall they ſee the Son of Man, coming in a Cloud, with Power and great Glory.</q>

               <q>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, yet once, it is a little while, and I will ſhake the Heavens, and the Earth, and the Sea, and the dry Land: And I will ſhake all Nations, and the Deſire of all Nations ſhall come.</q> Antichriſt ſhall firſt be deſtroyed by the Breath of the Lord, and by the Brightneſs of his Appearance. An Earthquake ſhall be employed on this Occaſion. So it is deſcribed by <hi>John</hi> in his Revelations,<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">Rev. xvi. 17.</note> 
               <q>And the ſeventh Angel poured out his Vial into the Air; and there came a great Voice out of the Temple of Heaven, from the Throne, ſaying, It is done. And there were Voices, and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Lightnings; and there was a great Earthquake, ſuch as was not ſince Men were

upon the Earth, ſo mighty an Earthquake, and ſo great. And the great City was divided into three Parts, and the Cities of the Nations fell: and great <hi>Babylon</hi> came in Remembrance before God, to give unto her the Cup of the Wine of the Fierceneſs of his Wrath. And every Iſland fled away, and the Mountains were not found.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xviii. 21.</note> 
               <q>And a mighty Angel took up a Stone like a great Milſtone, and caſt it into the Sea, ſaying, Thus with Violence ſhall that great City Babylon be thrown down, and ſhall be found no more at all. And the Voice of Harpers, and Muſicians, and of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and Trumpeters, ſhall be heard no more at all in thee; and no Craftſman, of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Craft he be, ſhall be found any more in thee; and the Sound of a Milſtone ſhall be heard no more at all in thee: And the Light of a Candle ſhall ſhine no more at all in thee; and the Voice of the Bridegroom, and of the Bride, ſhall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy Merchants were the great Men of the Earth; for by thy Sorceries were all Nations deceived. And in her was found the Blood of Prophets, and of Saints, and of all that were ſlain upon the Earth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What univerſal Conſternation and Horror, will then overſpread the Face of this whole Earth! We had a little Emblem of this in that awful Night, which we now commemorate: So ſhall the Coming of the Son of Man be, and

               <q>They ſhall go into the Caves of the Earth, into the Clefts of the Rocks, and the Tops of the ragged Rocks, for Fear of the Lord, and for the Glory of his Majeſty, when he ariſeth to ſhake terribly the Earth.</q> Thus alſo the Viſion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Evangeliſt;<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. vi. 12.</note> 
               <q>And I beheld when he had opened the ſixth Seal, and lo, there was a great Earthquake, and the Sun became black as Sackcloth of Hair, and the Moon became as Blood; And the Stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth, even as a Fig-Tree caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her untimely Figs, when ſhe is ſhaken of a mighty Wind: And the Heaven departed as a Scrowl, when it is rolled together; and every Mountain and Iſland were moved out of their Places: And the Kings of the Earth, and the great Men, and the rich Men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty Men, and every bond Man, and every free Man, hid themſelves in the Dens, and in the Rocks of the Mountains; and ſaid to the Mountains and Rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the Face of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb: For the great Day of his Wrath is come; and who ſhall be able to ſtand?</q> But where can they fly for Shelter and Security in this awful &amp; tremendous Hour? <q>
