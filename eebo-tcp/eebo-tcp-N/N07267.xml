            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE ſtate of the currency of the Province be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a matter of general ſpeculation and diſcourſe and a very intereſting ſubject, I hope the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a few thoughts upon it will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable nor liable to cenſure. It is certain that Gold paſſes at too high a rate compared with ſilver, and it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that in a little time ſilver will be extremely ſcarce and gold become the only currency; and, it is ſaid, that gold not being eſtabliſhed by law cannot be tendered in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of debts, and therefore great oppreſſion of debtors and other miſchiefs muſt enſue. Ever ſince the ſettlement of the money in 1749 there has been a ſufficient plenty of ſilver and no preference given to it beyond gold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the exchange with England turned againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and the debtor to the merchants in England found himſelf obliged to ſhip money for the diſcharge of his debts: Upon comparing the prices of the two metals here with their prices in England, it appeared that ſilver might be ſhipped to much greater advantage than gold: This occaſioned a general enquiry after ſilver and gave the firſt alarm; for until then, by means of a variety of favourable circumſtances, exchange with England for twelve years together had not been above par, and there had been but little money ſhipped thither; the diſproportion in the two metals was inconſiderable, between this and other places to which they have been exported; a much greater proportion of ſilver than of gold had been imported by means of the grants made by Parliament; and although the unequal rates have not been wholly unobſerved yet there has not been any real miſchiefs accrued therefrom. I was in hopes upon my firſt thought that there was not ſufficient grounds for this alarm, and that we might go on as well for twelve years to come as we have done in thoſe which are paſt, but upon further conſideration I am convinced this cannot be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exchange is above par;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009283_0004_10322A32DC48EFB0"/>
ſo many people have unfortunately contracted ſuch large debts in England that, for ſometime at leaſt, it muſt continue ſo, and there will inevitably be further and very great exportation of money, and it is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary ſomething ſhould be done to prevent this exportation being made altogether in ſilver. In order to judge what is proper it will not be amiſs to look back to the time of the exchange of our late depreciating and deteſtable paper currency. It was then the determination of the government to have a perpetual invariable ſtandard for the future: Silver alone agreeable to the practice of all other countries was pitched upon for this purpoſe, not that the currency of gold was excluded but it was ſuppoſed it would paſs in that proportion to ſilver as it bore in other parts of the world with which we had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce: It was thought beſt to conform to Queen <hi>Ann</hi>'s proclamation and to eſtabliſh a currency at the rate of <hi>ſix ſhillings</hi> a milled dollar, for although ſilver by the act of the province is made the ſtandard at 6<hi>s.</hi> 8<hi>d.</hi> the ounce, yet at the ſame time a milled dollar was allowed to paſs in diſcharge of contracts at 6<hi>s.</hi> and every body expected by this means to exclude hammered pieces of eight from our currency, and this has been the effect, and in fact ſilver is our ſtandard by law at 6<hi>s.</hi> 10<hi>d.</hi> the ounce, ſuppoſing a dollar to weigh 17 dwt. 9 grains; Soon after this, ſeveral ſpecies of gold coins obtained a currency, and to prevent any ill influence upon the ſtandard it was thought neceſſary to fix by law rates for each ſpecies which they ſhould not exceed, although they were not made a legal tender at thoſe rates. In doing this the government unhappily fell into two miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes; they ſuppoſed a dollar to be worth 4<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whereas Spaniſh ſilver being then in London from 5<hi>s.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi>½ to 5<hi>s.</hi> 4<hi>d</hi> the ounce, a dollar was worth from 4<hi>s.</hi> 7<hi>d</hi> to 4<hi>s.</hi> 7<hi>d.</hi>½<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they likewiſe ſuppoſed the rates at which foreign gold coins paſſed in England to be in a juſt proportion to ſilver, whereas they were at leaſt 3 per cent. too high, and from theſe miſtakes we ſet a half Joannes at 48<hi>s,</hi> which ought to have been but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009283_0005_10322A30E08E4E08"/>
46<hi>s.</hi> and had exchange then have been againſt us our ſilver coin would have gone from us and the gold only remained. It may be proper to obſerve that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is the proportion between gold and ſilver bullion, not gold and ſilver coins as they are commonly current by tale, in England, the ſame muſt be always kept in the colonies, for all we have of both metals except what is abſolutely neceſſary in trade will always go to England, and if you ſet gold too high in the colonies, it will drain you of your ſilver, if you ſet it too low you in effect exclude gold.</p>
            <p>Spaniſh ſilver in London by the laſt advices was at 5<hi>s.</hi> 9<hi>d</hi> Portugal gold £.4. 0<hi>s.</hi> 8<hi>d.</hi> the ounce: Gold is ſaid to be riſing. How gold and ſilver bullion both can riſe in any conſiderable degree in England without affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the debt and credit of the nation and the courſe of exchange with all other countries is difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. If this be the caſe the evil is ſo great that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the wiſdom of the Parliament will ſoon provide a remedy; the difficulty of which we in this province know by experience will increaſe in portion to the length of time the miſchief is ſuffered to continue. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> this is going beyond my line. All the obſervation to be made from it which concerns us is that by means of this riſe exchange when at par is no more now than about 120, whereas before it has been accounted 133⅓</p>
            <p>It appears that gold bullion is now lower in England compared with ſilver than it was in 1749, ſo that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to a dollar at 6<hi>s.</hi> or ſilver at 6<hi>s</hi> 10<hi>

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009283_0006_10322A2DDED08108"/>
body muſt ſee that this is an unfortunate circumſtance at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending our currency. The queſtion is what is to be done to prevent any miſchievous effects? It is ſaid we muſt make gold a legal tender as well as ſilver. I think this propoſal is contrary to the principle the government pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in 1749, and will be a violation of the public faith. Two metals as gold and ſilver cannot be the meaſure both together, and be both a fixed meaſure, becauſe they are frequently changing their proportion one to the other, and we therefore ſee that in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries they have one meaſure only, and this generally is ſilver, and gold in ſuch caſe is a commodity as much as copper or other metals. Now if we make gold a tender at the rate it paſſes at preſent, we take the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual method that can be to drive away all our ſilver, and there will be no poſſible way to prevent it but by raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rate of ſilver to at leaſt 7<hi>s.</hi> 4<hi>d.</hi> inſtead of 6<hi>s.</hi> 10<hi>d.</hi> the ounce; but this is what I have not yet heard any body own they are willing ſhould be done. If we do not raiſe ſilver by law, but ſuffer it to go from us and leave gold alone to be our meaſure, it will be a meaſure in proportion to ſilver at 7<hi>s.</hi> 4<hi>d.</hi> the ounce, and will have the ſame ill effects &amp; be the ſame violation of the publick faith as if we had raiſed the ſilver. I am ſurprized at the diſtinction ſome perſons make between publick and private debts. The government owes a large ſum for which notes are given payable in ſilver at a certain rate. This we are told is an expreſs promiſe of which there muſt be a ſpecifick performance. The promiſe would have been altogether as expreſs if it had been for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful money: There is no more difference than between a promiſe for a crown and a promiſe for five ſhillings. Now all private contracts are underſtood to be in lawful money, the government is the guarrantee for the true performance of ſuch contracts; but if we alter the meaſure we ſhall prevent ſuch performance, and it muſt be a whimſical conſcience that will be ſcrupulous in the one caſe and not in the other. What pretence can a man have to whom a ſum of money is due from the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009283_0007_10322A2BF4AA50A8"/>
government, which his neighbour will not have, to whom the like ſum is due from a private perſon? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if by making gold a tender we drive away the ſilver, does it not effectually diſable us from paying the public debt in ſilver? Shall we then ſit ſtill and let things take their courſe? This would be as miſchievous as the other propoſal: Gold will paſs at the preſent rates until we are near drained of our ſilver, and then it will become the meaſure of our commerce, which it has not yet been: When this is ſenſibly perceived it's probable that creditors will refuſe to receive it, unleſs at ſuch rates as ſhall be equal in value to lawful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and from thence inequality and confuſion in all trade and dealing muſt neceſſarily ariſe.</p>
            <p>There is one way more in which we may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; and although it will be attended with inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, yet they will be leſs than in any other way. We have the example of the Parliament, in the like caſe, at home; and I know of no example which we may more ſafely follow. Let the Gold coins be reduced to a juſt proportion to Silver, as ſtated by law ſo as to make it indifferent to the merchant which he exports: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps reducing the half Johannes from 48<hi>ſ.</hi> to 46<hi>ſ.</hi> and other coins in the ſame degree, may be ſufficient. It is objected that this will oblige every debtor to pay more than his juſt debt; he received gold at 48<hi>ſ.</hi> and muſt pay it at 46<hi>ſ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to judge of the force of this objection, we muſt conſider what has been the meaſure of all contracts, whether ſilver at 6<hi>ſ.</hi> the dollar, and 6<hi>ſ.</hi> 10<hi>d.</hi> the ounce, or gold at 48<hi>ſ.</hi> the half Joannes; if the latter the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is unanſwerable; if the former, it has no force. Now I take it ſilver alone has been the meaſure, and the gold hitherto has had no more influence upon it than piſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reens have had, which although of a baſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, yet have been received and paid without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count between them and the purer ſilver. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the courſe of exchange with all places with which we have commerce, has been governed by our ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009283_0008_10322A2A70DE6810"/>
lawful money, and not by our gold; and when we ſhall have reduced the half Joannes to 46<hi>ſ.</hi> it will take no more of a debtor's eſtate to obtain an hundred pounds in gold at 46<hi>ſ.</hi> then it does now at 48<hi>ſ.</hi> the piece, and no debt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

As for the poſſeſſors of the gold, reducing the value has the appearance of ſo far leſſening their property. But if this is not done now, it infallibly will be done, ſooner or later; for the two ſhillings, or whatever ſum it is which we affix to the half Joannes above its juſt value, is a mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I expect ſome perſons will ſay this propoſal does not go far enough, and we muſt have a ſcheme which will keep both ſilver and gold among us, and then there will be no more need of reducing gold than there has been in times paſt. If any perſon can propoſe a method of effecting this, I will give up my propoſal. This can be done in no other way than by leſſening our imports: We ſhall not do this ſufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the ſcarcity of money obliges us to it. The plenty of money has produced luxury, luxury naturally tends to poverty, poverty will produce induſtry and frugality, and induſtry and frugality will leſſen the proportion of imports to exports and will bring money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; but before this revolution is finiſhed, the miſchiefs we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>I conceive the amount of theſe, and ſeveral other expreſſions, in the writing I am conſidering to be this; that we have here, or even in England, no other law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful money, but of ſilver only, that gold is only a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, that a debtor therefore never might in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince diſcharge himſelf, or prevent the forfeiture of his obligation, by tendring gold coins at the rates ſet in the law. And that new to make them ſuch a legal tender would be a violation of the public faith.

            <p>Doubtleſs, when I contradict ſo great authority, it is incumbent on me to produce the authorities and reaſons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> which I rely. Let us therefore conſider this matter a little more at large.</p>
            <p>I take it, that money is that metal of gold or ſilver, which is coined by the authority of the prince, or is
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009283_0011_10322A250AEA4BD8"/>
made current, and it's rate ſtated, by his proclamation. I further apprehend it clear, that gold has been nearly in as ancient uſe in England for this purpoſe as ſilver.</p>
            <p>To prove this I cite theſe authorities. Mirror cited by Ld. Coke, 2d. Inſt. 576. It was ordained that no King of this realm may change his money or impaire it, or make other money than of gold or ſilver, without the aſſent of all his counties.</p>

               </gap>ed by Ld. Coke, 2d Inſt. 577. Item. It is accorded that the money of gold and ſilver, which now is current, ſhall not be impaired: in weight or alloy; but as ſoon as good way be found, that the ſame be put in the ancient ſtate as in the ſterling.</p>
            <p>Ld. Coke 1 Inſtit. 207. "Lawful money of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, either of gold or ſilver, is of two ſorts, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the Engliſh money coined by the King's authority, or foreign coin by proclamation made current within the realm."</p>
            <p>Stat. 9 Henry 5 cap. 10. From Chriſtmas even next coming, none of the King's liege people ſhall receive any money of Engliſh gold in payment, but by the King's weight thereupon ordained.</p>

Many more might be produced to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: but it muſt be needleſs. Nor do I deſire to make any comment on thoſe produced. Let every one, after reading them judge for himſelf, whether it can be juſtly ſaid that ſilver is the only meaſure in England: and that gold is as much a commodity as copper or other metals.

            <p>His Honor goes back no further in this reſearch, than to the times of the exchange of our late depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating, and (as he doth not ſpare to call it) <hi>deteſtable</hi> paper currency. I cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For whatever wiſdom and integrity I aſcribe to the court that was concerned in that memorable exchange, the year of jubilee, as it hath been often ſounded: I can hardly ſuppoſe a matter of that important and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting nature, as his Honor juſtly repreſents this, to have wholly eſcaped the obſervation of our legiſlators before this time.</p>
            <p>If therefore his Honor will be pleaſed to look into the province law 15 Georg. 2d. cap. 2. A. D. 1741. he ſhall there find a law entitled an act to aſcertain the value of money, &amp;c. the firſt clauſe whereof enacts, that from and after the firſt day of February [then] next, all coined ſilver of ſterling alloy ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted paid and taken as lawful money of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince at the rate of <hi>ſix ſhillings and eight pence</hi> per ounce, and OTHER MONEY in the ſame proportion, and no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Here I ſhould be glad to enquire what more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit words could well be found out to determine gold to be lawful money of this province. What <hi>other

            <p>We will now come with his Honor to the act for redeeming the bills of credit: which it is true menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth only coined ſilver, and does not that I can find make any mention of gold. This I take to be a meer overſight at that time, owing to the great perturbation, which the redeeming our paper currency occaſioned, both within doors and without: Or perhaps it was ſuppoſed that fixing the rate of ſilver, the proportion between it and gold being ſettled, fixed the rate of other money: juſt as ſettling the value of one dollar was ſettling the rule for any other number whatſoever. Or whatever other cauſe it was owing to: certain it is (as his Honor ſays, and we need not deſire a better witneſs) it was not intended to exclude the currency of gold. In truth, if it had been their moſt declared intention ſo to do: I incline to think it cannot be in the power of the legiſlature of this province, by an act of theirs, to exclude the currency of the gold coin, ſtamped by the authority of the King, or current by his proclamation.</p>
            <p>We need not however ſpend time in the diſcuſſion of this laſt point; becauſe before the change of our bills took place, the other act for aſcertaining the rates of gold coins was made.</p>
            <p>The report his Honor makes of this law is this. "To prevent any ill influence on the ſtandard, it was thought neceſſary to fix by law rates for each ſpecies, which they ſhould not excede, altho' they were not made a tender at thoſe rates."</p>
            <p>I on the contrary ſuppoſe that the rates of thoſe gold coins were ſettled as much by that law; made as really lawful money at thoſe rates; as ever dollars were made ſo at the rate of ſix ſhillings a piece by the former law. Thus we differ, our appeal muſt therefore be to the law itſelf for a deciſion. But before I preſent that to the reader, I deſire him only to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, what a ſtrange repreſentation is here made by his
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009283_0015_10322A1D6E7981B8"/>
Honor, reſpecting our currency, our money, that which (in a commercial ſtate at leaſt) is the meaſure of all things.</p>
            <p>Theſe gold coins, his Honor ſaith, obtained a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency among us; rates were fixed which they ſhould not exceed, yet they were not money at thoſe rates. So according to his opinion, an execution againſt a deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor could not and cannot now be diſcharged (unleſs the creditor voluntarily accept it as he may do old ſhoes or any thing elſe) in any of thoſe gold coins. And a debtor taken in execution muſt be committed to goal for a debt of ten pounds, tho' he hath and tenders to the officer, gold with the image and ſuperſcription of the King of Great-Britain on it, to the amount of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds.<note n="†" place="bottom">The ſheriff perhaps may take it in execution and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

It was ſuppoſed (the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaith) it would paſs in that proportion to ſilver, as it bore in other parts of the world with which we had commerce." Let us ſee if as ſhocking conſequences do not follow from this explication as the former. Let us ſuppoſe, a debtor in the hands of a ſheriff, on an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for ten pounds. He hath no ſilver to offer; but he hath gold enough. On our preſent ſuppoſition the ſheriff muſt not commit him, if he will pay in gold in proportion to ſilver as it bears in other parts of the world with which we have commerce. Who is to judge and determine this, which is needful to be inſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, in order to the debtors liberation? Why, to compleat our repreſentation; let us ſuppoſe this matter to happen preciſely at the inſtant his Honor's projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and propoſals are made public.

Mean time his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner grows impatient, tenders him all his gold coins, amounting to one hundred pounds ſterling, and bids him take at his peril. What now ſhall the ſheriff do? ſhall he adventure himſelf to decide what his Honor hath left doubtful? ſhall he determine what proportion gold bears to ſilver in other parts of the world with which we have commerce? And does he determine at his own riſque, ſo that if he determine gold at a lower or higher rate than it really bears to ſilver in other parts of the world with which we have commerce, the creditor or debtor reſpectively have their action againſt him? And ſhall this queſtion which hath ſo much puzzled the ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, puzzle a jury on the action againſt the ſheriff, and be finally determined at the riſque and expence of the ſheriff? Note here that I do not ſuppoſe the ſheriff or debtor in this caſe to apply to any lawyer for advice. That body are ſuppoſed to be acquainted with the laws of their country, but this matter by the ſuppoſition the law hath not ſettled, it hath left it to be defined by the commerce of other countries; which the lawyers by their books and ſtudy, have no direction to find.</p>
            <p>All this abſurdity and innumerable others clearly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from this opinion, that any coins are by the law money and yet their rates not fixed by the law.</p>

Upon this view I think the juſtice of the ſecond po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition I advanced, muſt appear clear to every one, <hi>to wit.</hi> that if thoſe ſpecies of gold coin were not now a legal tender at thoſe rates; public juſtice and conſcience evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently require they ſhould in the moſt explicit manner be made ſo. For nothing is more evident than that ſuch uncertainty and fluctuation in ſo intereſting an affair, muſt produce endleſs confuſion and diſorder. And I think, it is alſo very evident, in fact and experience, that thoſe gold coins have ever ſince the making of that law paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the values therein ſet, and been the meaſure of all contracts, to the full as much as dollars, have been at ſix ſhillings. No man for inſtance, at this day, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly poſſeſſed of a Joannes, whom it hath not coſt forty eight ſhillings. The government itſelf, in all its tranſactions with its creditors, and with its debtors, hath received and payed it always at that rate, and by its own example taught the ſubjects to receive and pay it at the ſame. In all the debts that have been contracted by private perſons, ſince the year 1750, a Joannes has been hitherto conſidered by the creditor, and by the debtor as forty eight ſhillings. Now if the debtor be compellable to pay, the individual Joannes he borrowed at two ſhillings leſs, than he received it for, and it was reckoned to make up his debt. Alas what have we gained by the year of jubilee? What avails the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our depreciating and deteſtable paper currency? Where is our perpetual invariable ſtandard? If god, hard gold, with the image and ſuperſcription of the Britiſh Caeſar on it can depreciate as well as old Tenor. Nay, on this ſuppoſition, are we not in a far worſe ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with reſpect to the public juſtice, than with the moſt deteſtable of our paper bills? For we had a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by which to know their depreciatiation. The courts compared the bills with the price of ſilver at the time they made up judgment and added as depreciation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that was more than the price at the time of the contracting the debt. This was eaſily known, it was only to ſend to the goldſmiths in Boſton; from them
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009283_0018_103226D64FB368C0"/>
the courts actually had tables of the riſe of ſilver, by which they eſtimated this depreciation. But in our caſe, where ſhall they find a table, which ſhall ſhow them "the proportion gold bears to ſilver in other parts of the world with which we have commerce?"</p>
            <p>Moreover, No injuſtice can be done to creditors, by making theſe gold coins, a tender at the rates the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has ſet on them. <hi>They</hi> will receive their own, with uſury, whereas infinite injuſtice may be done to <hi>debtors,</hi> if either gold coins may be wholly refuſed; or may be accepted only at the creditors price. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if public conſcience requires, that juſtice be done to all, without injuſtice to any; it requires that theſe gold coins ſhould be made money, and a tender at the rates the government have ſet them by their own law, and univerſal practice hath alſo confirmed.—In caſe his Honor is right and they are not already ſo. Let us now conſider that law, and ſee if the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof be not evidently ſo to make them.</p>
            <p>The act is 23d Geor. 2d. chap. 5. and is entitled an act for aſcertaining the rates at which coined ſilver and gold, and Engliſh half pence and farthings may paſs within this government.</p>
            <p>The preamble, reciting the clauſe, in the former law, relating to bargains and contracts payable in ſilver, adds, And whereas there is great reaſon to apprehend, that many and great inconveniences may ariſe in caſe any coined ſilver or gold, or Engliſh half pence, and farthings ſhould paſs at any higher rate than in a juſt proportion to Spaniſh pieces of eight, or coined ſilver, at the rates aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Then follows the enacting clauſe, that it ſhall not be lawful to receive or take any of the following coin at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Then follows the clauſe, making a forfeiture of fifty pounds to be incurred by any who ſhould receive or pay thoſe coins at any greater rate than <hi>at which the ſame is hereby regulated, ſettled, and allowed to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted,</hi> Note, this is the ſame penalty, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in like manner, as that for accounting dollars above ſix ſhillings a piece.</p>
            <p>Here his Honor ſaith, they (the gold coins) were not made a tender at thoſe rates. He has not been ſo good as to declare his opinion touching the ſpecies of ſilver coins, mentioned and regulated by the ſame act. Whether, for inſtance, an Engliſh crown be lawful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at ſix ſhillings and eight pence, and ſo of the other ſilver coins.—If, he ſays, they are lawful money at thoſe rates, and the others not, he ought to ſhow the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and why the ſame preciſely enacting words ſhould have ſuch different effects as theſe.—If he ſaith, that thoſe ſpecies of ſilver coins are not money at thoſe rates. I would aſk him, if it were not too bold whether thoſe alſo are to paſs, in the ſame proportion with ſilver, they bear in other parts of the world with which we have commerce.</p>
            <p>Now I apprehend that this law, eſpecially if taken in connection with the former law, 15 Geor. 2d. chap. 2d. makes theſe ſpecies both of gold &amp; ſilver coins mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, at the rates there ſpecified, my reaſons are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) This law expreſly determines thoſe rates to be <hi>in a juſt proportion</hi> to Spaniſh milled pieces of eight, and to coined ſilver at ſix ſhillings and eight pence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ounce. Now the former law enacting that other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhould be in proportion to ſilver, <hi>this law</hi> determining the proportion, taken together they certainly eſtabliſh them.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Settling by an act the value of coin, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the rates at which it may paſs, is in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion making it money at thoſe rates.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:009283_0020_10322A1555076470"/>
(3.) The legiſlature themſelves appear ſo to account it in this ſame law, for they ſay, <hi>ſhall receive. &amp;c.</hi> at <hi>any greater and higher rate than at which the ſame are hereby regulated, ſettled and allowed to be accounted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) The legiſlature in other laws referring to this appear ſo to look upon it. Particularly temporary laws 29 Georg. 2d chap 22d. The treaſurer of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince is directed to borrow from his excellency governor Shirley, the ſum of £. 40,000 <hi>lawful money,</hi> in Spaniſh milled dollars at ſix ſhillings each, or in coined ſilver at ſix ſhillings and eight pence per ounce, or <hi>in coined gold at the rate at which ſuch gold is ſet, or reſtrained from</hi> exceding by the act we are now conſidering. For that he is to give two receipts for £.20,000 lawful money each.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) In the act of Parliament 6 Ann cap 2d. made for aſcertaining the rates of foreign coins in her majeſty's plantations in America. Where the rates of pieces of eight and other coined ſilver is ſtated, and nearly the ſame words prohibotary of any perſons accounting at an higher rate as in the law we are now conſidering; there comes a proviſion in theſe words. <hi>Provided that nothing in this act contained ſhall extend or be conſtrued to compel any perſon to receive any of the ſaid ſpecies of foreign ſilver coins at the reſpective rates in the ſaid procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation mentioned.</hi> Hereupon this is my argument. This proviſo was needful to be put in, otherwiſe the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and the other part of the act would have been taken to be thus compulſory. The operation of law on the former part of the ſtatute would have made the coins there mentioned money and a legal tender at thoſe rates. Now in our law there is no ſuch proviſo, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the operation of the words are as aforeſaid. This argument is of the more force, as many expreſſions in the province law ſeem to be borrow'd from that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; the language whereof they adopt in the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but do not adopt the proviſo.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) The province law we are conſidering hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the royal aſſent. And therefore may be looked upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap> to a proclamation of his Majeſty.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009283_0021_10322A12E1BBD188"/>
Now as his Majeſty hath right to ſettle the rates at which foreign coins may be current in his dominions. Had he by one proclamation declared that Spaniſh milled pieces of eight ſhould be lawful money at ſix ſhillings each, and by a ſucceeding one, that ſuch ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of coin were in a juſt proportion to that, and ſhould not exceed ſuch a rate. I believe none could have doubted but that they became lawful money at thoſe rates. I add,</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) The proportion ſet in this law between gold and ſilver is the exact proportion they bear in the Engliſh mint at this day, and according to the laſt regulation made thereof by our Sovereign.</p>
            <p>Her late Majeſty Queen Ann by her proclamation dated the eighteenth of June 1704, (printed in the laſt edition of the provincial perpetual laws page 155) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that ſhe had cauſed aſſays to be made by the principal officers of her mint to determine the ſterling value of ſeveral ſpecies of foreign coins that paſſed in payment in her dominions in America. Among others her Majeſty mentions theſe peices of eight, and the ſterling value of them, ſet by her Majeſty in this proclamation is four ſhillings and ſix pence each. His Honor himſelf ſaith, that it was thought beſt to conform to this proclamation in the act for exchanging our paper bills. And in truth it is wholly by this th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Upon theſe reaſons and others that might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned I apprehend theſe gold coins to be money at the rates fixed in the law; and therefore I ſuppoſe it would be at the peril of the Sheriff to refuſe them at thoſe rates, and that he would ſubject himſelf thereby to the action of the party, whoſe gold he refuſed. And I have too much confidence in the juſtice of the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gentleman himſelf, to ſuppoſe the extrajudicial opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he hath given in the news paper, would influence even his own judgment; when the matter came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in tryal. At the ſame time I muſt ſay it is great pity that the honourable gentleman ſhould pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly in ſuch peremptory and ſtrong terms, declare his opinion on a queſtion, which in all probability unleſs ſome new law be made will one day or other come judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially before him.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I apprehend it highly imports the legiſlature of this province, to put this matter out of all poſſible doubt, and in words that cannot be winked out of ſight, to make theſe coins money at their preſent rates. I will even add that in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the diſputes that have ever been, between the ſeveral branches of the legiſlature of this province, are meer trifles compared with this.</p>
            <p>I cannot conclude, without adding that his Honor's propoſal, which I take to be, to let ſilver remain at the preſent rate, and to lower the rates of gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears highly unjuſt on the principles he himſelf lays down—He ſays "that whatever is the proportion between gold and ſilver bullion in England the ſame muſt be always kept in the colonies."

time of the exchange of our paper bills. Now his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's propoſal is to let ſilver remain with us at this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme low rate and to make gold lower ſtill, that is to ſay, the value of Joannes, is really greater than it was, at the time of the exchange aforeſaid, by the meaſure he himſelf propoſes to try it by: yet his Honor's project and propoſal is to force the debtor to pay it at a leſſer rate.</p>
            <p>In truth, if the miſchiefs his Honor points out are real (about which I pretend not to judge being no merchant) and if theſe miſchiefs require any interpoſition at all from the legiſlature, I conceive that interpoſition ought rather to be in raiſing the price of dollars than in lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of gold coins. I have (as I conceive) great authority with me in this. No leſs than the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuperior court. Every one knows, that as during our paper currency, when ſilver was continually riſing; they in making up judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on debts, contracted to be paid in bills of credit, added as depreciation whatever ſilver had riſen from the time of contracting the debts: So in the year 1750 and ever ſince, in making up judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on debts contracted to be paid in bills of credit in the years 1748 &amp; 1749, in which years ſilver was at £. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the market. Really it appears to me that all the facts his Honor points out ſhow plainly that dollars are much under-rated, and that it is from this under-rate of them, not the over-rate of the gold coins, that the diſproportion he ſpeaks of ariſes. His Honor ſaith they were eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too low at the firſt, they were worth at that time from four ſhillings and ſeven pence to four ſhillings and ſeven pence half penny ſterling, and they are worth now five ſhillings ſterling. It is their greater worth in England at this day that makes it more profitable to ſhip them there than gold. If it be ſaid that by raiſing them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trader loſes 3 or 4 per cent of his debt, I deny it, he loſes nothing, any more than the creditor to whom bills of credit were payable by contract in the years 1748 &amp; 1749. Both have the real value of their debts made good to them; and neither ought to deſire to have more than <hi>their own</hi> with uſury. I deſire however it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that I do not propoſe ſuch a riſe of ſilver. I only ſay if one muſt be done, either to raiſe ſilver, or lower gold, the former is moſt equitable and moſt agreeable to truth, and therefore to be preferred.</p>
            <p>In one thing I do agree with his Honor, that there is no difference between the public debts and private ones, reſpecting this matter. Money the wiſe man ſaith anſwers all things. However particular the obligation may be, the court makes up judgment for lawful money, not for the particular ſpecies of it that a whimſical cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor may pitch upon. And whatſoever is money will diſcharge a debt.—Let us ſuppoſe for inſtance an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to be made for a thouſand Engliſh ſhillings; no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> paid in any other money would diſcharge him.—The like obſervation holds with reſpect to the metals of which money may be made, whether gold or ſilver be ſpecially mentioned. Money anſwereth all things.—Nor will it be any injuſtice to the creditors of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for them ſo to conſider it, for it is very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the money lent the government <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

paid into the treaſury, in gold and ſilver, whatever the words of the acts for the loan might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.</p>
            <p>His Honor propoſes an objection to himſelf that is of great weight.—It is that his propoſal doth not go far enough, that we muſt have a ſcheme to keep both gold and ſilver among us, and then there will be no more need of reducing gold, than there has been in times paſt. He is ſo good as to ſay, if any perſon can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a method of effecting this he will give up his propoſal.</p>
            <p>I am ſo whimſical as to think, that without this ſcheme be effected, it is very immaterial to provide for any thing elſe. And that if we had money of one metal or even of one denomination only, a balance in other countries, which neceſſarily called for the exportation of it, would produce all the miſchiefs that his Honor points out. It would in reality if not in name raiſe the price of that one denomination.</p>
            <p>I am alſo whimſical enough to ſuppoſe, that it is not abſolutely neceſſary for us, by our luxury to be reduced to ſuch extreme poverty as his Honor mentions in order to bring our exports and imports to more equality, and prevent ſuch an heavy balance againſt us.</p>
            <p>

            <p>If once this public ſpirit could prevail, and univerſal attention be given to the real intereſt of the public, we might reaſonably hope, ſoon to ſee our trade on ſuch a foot, as that none of the miſchiefs his Honor points out would affect us.</p>

            <p>THIS ſubject may receive an additional light if placed in one other view.</p>
            <p>Let us ſuppoſe that when the exchange of our paper was made, our legiſlature had adopted a ſterling cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency inſtead of our preſent. As we could not expect to have our currency from the coins of the kingdom, it would have been neceſſary to have ſtated the rate of ſuch foreign coins as we might ſuppoſe would be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent here. Her Majeſty's regulation afore-mentioned would have fixed the rate of a dollar at four ſhillings and ſix pence, a Johannes would have been 36<hi>f.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now on this ſuppoſition all the miſchiefs his Honor points out muſt have happened. There would have been a gain on dollars of ſix pence or ſeven pence a piece ſterling, which would have tempted to the expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them rather than gold. If now the miſchief his Honor mentions, required any interpoſition to correct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> money. Whether would have been more juſt—to lover a Joannes to thirty four ſhillings and ſix pence, when it every day fetches in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

               </gap> thirty ſeven ſhillings, and upwards, or to raiſe dollars to five ſhillings, which is rather below than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>A blind man may determine this, and yet this once determined, an queſtion can remain.</p>
            <p>It was my intention to handle this ſubject, ſo intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to my countrymen, with entire freedom: And at the ſame time to preſerve the greateſt reſpect to a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſo much my ſuperior. I have not willingly

failed in either. It would be a great affront to his Honor to ſuppoſe that he demanded implicit belief from his readers, and that when he propoſed his projection to the public conſideration he ſhould be offended at, the freeſt diſcuſſion of it. Not doubting of his excuſe, I humbly take my leave of him and the public, with the words of Euripides, as tranſlated by Milton.</p>
