            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU have been Eye and Ear-Witneſſes of ſurprizing ſpiritual Conqueſts wrought by the King of <hi>Zion,</hi> thro' the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of ſome deſpiſed Servants of Chriſt among you. Theſe ſupernatural Effects of the Word with you, namely, humbling, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reforming of the moſt proud, prejudiced and profligate Sinners in many Places, does plainly prove the Work to be <hi>of God:</hi> For ſurely any Effect cannot exceed the Vertue of it's producing Cauſe. It is an Evidence of awful Blindneſs and Prejudice in any to aſcribe this Work to <hi>Nature,</hi> or the <hi>Devil;</hi> for a Man may as well make a new World, as renew his own Heart: And to
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:004822_0003_100DF82683909CE8"/>imagine that the Devil has a Hand in this Work, is to ſuppoſe that he acts contrary to his own Intereſt, and that therefore his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is divided againſt it ſelf, and ſo cannot ſtand. To aſcribe the proper Work of God's Spirit to the Devil by thoſe that have been convinced, comes near to the <hi>unpardonable Sin.</hi> This was the Practice of the Phariſees who liv'd in the Time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; theſe Men notwithſtanding of their ſtrict Form of Religion, were the moſt implacable Oppoſers of Chriſt and his Followers, altho' they had the cleareſt Evidence of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt's Doctrine and Miſſion; yet thro' the Prejudice of their natural Enmity, together with their Fear of loſing their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and worldly Intereſt, they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to oppoſe the ſpreading Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs by blackening the Character of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments whereby it was promoted, that ſo they might prejudice the People againſt them, and thus hinder the Succeſs of their Labours. In particular, they repreſented them as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Perſons and Diſturbers of the publick Peace, becauſe they were not careful enough to obſerve the Traditions of the Fathers, and on the Account of the Diviſions and Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances that attended their Labours in divers Places. Certainly, it muſt be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Church Rules do not bind when they hinder the Edification of the Body, for which
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:004822_0004_100DF82892502FC8"/>they are ſuppos'd to be made. And is it not reaſonable to conclude that Rules which may be proper in ordinary Caſes, may be hurtful in extraordinary; and therefore may there not be a Suſpenſion of ſome Rules for a Time when the Church is in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Situation, without the overthrow of Diſcipline. Do not general Rules admit of Exceptions; and do not the Formers of Church Rules acknowledge them to be alterable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to various Circumſtances? Now to be more zealous about the Obſervation of ſome Rules, than for the ſpreading Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, does it not look like the Phariſees tything Mint and Annis and Cummin, while in the mean Time they neglected the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Matters of the Law?</p>
            <p>As to Diſturbances &amp; Diviſions which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Men are ſo much afraid of, our Lord has warn'd us not to think that he came to ſend Peace on Earth, but Fire and Diviſion. It is not to be wonder'd at that the Seed of the Serpent ſhould riſe up and oppoſe the Seed of the Woman, when the Kingdom of the Devil is ſhaken; for thereby their falſe Peace is diſturb'd, and their Maſter is enrag'd, who will doubtleſs influence his Servants to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for him. <hi>Contentions</hi> and <hi>Diviſions</hi> even <hi>among Relations</hi> is no other than what our Lord foretold would be the Conſequence of the powerful preaching of his Goſpel.</p>

               <hi>My dear Friends,</hi> My earneſt Entreaty to you is, that you would ſubmit to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Zion</hi>'s King, and depend upon his Power and Promiſe that he will, maugre all Oppoſition of Men and Devils, promote and maintain the Intereſts of his Kingdom.

               </seg>N the preceding Verſes we have an Account of a cruel Combination formed againſt Chriſt and his Cauſe by the Grandees of the Earth. <hi>Kings and Rulers take Council together, and ſet themſelves againſt the Lord and his Anointed, ſaying,</hi> &amp;c. Great Men, alas, are ſeldom Good. But the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Danger of this impious Attempt is
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004822_0007_100DF830630E9048"/>juſtly expos'd in the 4th and 5th Verſes of this Pſalm; where we are told that the great Sovereign of the Univerſe who reſts and reigns in Heaven, derides their vain At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, which can no more diſturb his Peace controul his Power, or deſtroy his Intereſt, than the Waves of the Ocean the firm Rocks they daſh themſelves againſt. But tho' their deep Devices and effronted Efforts ſhall be ſurely rendered ineffectual as to him againſt whom they are directed, yet they will be ruining to themſelves; for the righteous God ſhall ſpeak to them in his Wrath and vex them in his ſore Diſpleaſure. And further to encreaſe the Terror of <hi>Zion</hi>'s Enemies, and revive the Hearts of her true Friends, our Text opens to our view, a ſolemn Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Inveſtiture of the Son of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Kingly Office.—Here let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the following Particulars,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Perſon inveſting. I;</hi> viz. God the <hi>Father,</hi> as appears from the 7th <hi>Verſe,</hi> where he ſpeaks concerning his <hi>Son.</hi> Here the Word <hi>I</hi> is taken oppoſitely, as if the Lord had ſaid, Altho' the Kings of the Earth extol them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet I have anointed my King, who ſhall confound their Deviſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Perſon <hi>inveſted,</hi> viz. The <hi>Meſſias,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt: This appears evidently from many Paſſages of this Pſalm: For in it, firſt He is called expreſly the <hi>Son of God,</hi> which Character belongs to Chriſt alone, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.
<pb facs="unknown:004822_0008_100DF8337520B158"/>A Son begotten by God to Day, <hi>i. e.</hi> From Eternity, for this was ſpoken of Chriſt long before his Incarnation. Again, He is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, <hi>Ver.</hi> 11.12. as the <hi>Object of religious Worſhip,</hi> the Foundation of Hope and Source of true Happineſs. And in the 8th and 9th Verſes as having <hi>the Heathen for his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the utmoſt Ends of the Earth for his Poſſeſſion.</hi> It's alſo obſerved in the 9th and 12th Verſes that Deſtruction and Ruin flow from his angry Frowns. Theſe Things can be juſtly aſcrib'd to Chriſt alone, and none but he.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Office</hi> in which Chriſt is inveſted, namely, that of a <hi>King,</hi> who is a Monarch and Head of a Kingdom. Now Chriſt is called the <hi>Lord's King</hi> in the Text to ſignify his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Generation, divine Anointing and Miſſion, as alſo the peculiarity &amp; peerleſs Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his Kingdom, which not only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers much from, but is infinitely ſuperior to all the Kingdoms of the World. He is a King worthy of God who rules with him and for him. Now the <hi>Subjects</hi> which King <hi>Jeſus</hi> governs over are deſcrib'd in theſe Words, <hi>My holy Hill of Zion. Zion</hi> was a certain Fort of the <hi>Jebuſites</hi> almoſt impregnable, which <hi>David</hi> having routed, the Inhabitants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a Palace for the Seat of his own Reſidence, on the Border of which was the Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> on which the Temple ſtood, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.9. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.1. But <hi>myſtical Zion</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:004822_0009_100DF83594253230"/>is the <hi>Church of God,</hi> which is ſo called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of it's unconquerableneſs. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour informs us, that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it; and alſo becauſe the Goſpel proceeds therefrom, Pſal. 110.2. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſend the Rod of thy Strength out of Zion.</hi> To this we may add, that <hi>David</hi> who was the King of the natural Zion, was a Type of Chriſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.23. Now Zion is called <hi>holy</hi> in the Text, <hi>relatively,</hi> becauſe of the Temple's being built on the neighbouring Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> by reaſon of which the Town and People were called <hi>holy,</hi> Dan. 9.24. <hi>&amp;</hi> Iſa. 63 18. and what is here intended by the holy Hill, viz the <hi>Church of God,</hi> is called holy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a holy God as it were dwells in her, and his holy Worſhip is celebrated by her, and becauſe ſhe is made holy by the Blood and Spirit of Chriſt, both imputatively and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently; as alſo becauſe it is her Duty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after, and labour for Holineſs in the higheſt Degree.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Act</hi> of inveſtiture, <hi>Set</hi> Yet have I <hi>ſet,</hi> or <hi>anointed,</hi> as it is in the Margin, or <hi>created</hi> or <hi>appointed,</hi> as ſome render it, by which we are to underſtand the Father's giving the Son a rightful Claim to exerciſe the kingly Office, as Mediator. The Words are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in the preter Tenſe, to ſhew that the Conſtitution of Chriſt to be King, was done of old in the Council of the Trinity, when the Device of Man's Salvation was form'd.
<pb facs="unknown:004822_0010_100DF8371C990798"/>The Word <hi>anoint</hi> may alſo denote the Father's conferring ſuch Qualifications upon Chriſt as Mediator, as were neceſſary for the right Diſcharge of all the Duties of his Kingly-Office<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7.</p>
            <p>That Jeſus Chriſt is King of his Church, and he only, appears by the following Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of the old Teſtament, concerning him, <hi>Gen</hi> 49.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Types</hi> &amp; <hi>Figures</hi> of his Kingly-Office which we find in ſacred Writ, ſuch as that of <hi>Melchiſedeck, David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. From the <hi>Kingly Titles</hi> which are fre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quently aſcrib'd to him, in the Book of God. Such as <hi>King of Zion, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Lord of Glory, Prince of Peace, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation, Head of the Church, Judge and Lawgiver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. From his <hi>ſolemn Inveſtiture</hi> into this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as in our Text.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From his <hi>own Confeſſion</hi> before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the Writing affix'd to his Croſs, by which his very Enemies acknowledged his Kingly Authority.</p>
            <p>Which Particulars aforeſaid can be aſcrib'd to none but Chriſt; for as no meer Creature is able to manage the Reins of Government, ſo none of them has a legal Claim thereto. To imagine that one Body the Church has two or more Heads is to deform her Beauty, defile her Honours, and render her monſtrous.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:004822_0011_100DF8395A4301D8"/>
Now the Kingly-Office of Chriſt may be more generally thus deſcribed, namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is that mediatorial Function by which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes and governs with all Power and Authority, whatſoever reſpects his People's Happineſs,</hi> Luk. 1.32, 33.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of Chriſt is indeed twofold, viz. Either <hi>eſſential</hi> or <hi>perſonal.</hi> His <hi>eſſential</hi> Kingdom is that infinite Power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which belongs to him as God, and is common to all the Perſons of the ſacred Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. His <hi>mediatorial</hi> Kingdom is that Power of Government which was committed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated to Chriſt as Mediator, God-man, by his Father, as our Text confirms; and this is alſo twofold, either <hi>univerſal</hi> or <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</hi> The <hi>univerſal</hi> mediatorial Kingdom of Chriſt extends to all Things, with a view to the Churches Good, Eph. 1.22. <hi>And gave him to be Head over all Things to the Church.</hi> The <hi>particular</hi> mediatorial Kingdom of Chriſt reſpects the Church only, and the compaſſing her Good in all the different Periods of Time, whither in this Life or that to come.</p>
            <p>But more particularly in order to have a clearer View of the Nature of Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Office, let us conſider the Anſwer in the Aſſembly's Catechiſm, to the 26th Queſtion concerning it; which is thus, <hi>Chriſt execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Office of a King</hi> (ſay they) <hi>in ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to himſelf, in ruling and defending us, and in reſtraining and conquering all his and our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004822_0012_100DF83C11319C80"/>Here are ſeveral Acts of kingly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pointed to by the Aſſembly, which deſerve our Attention;</p>
            <p>The 1ſt of which is, that of <hi>ſubduing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to himſelf.</hi> But who are theſe? why thoſe who were choſen from Eternity to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and given by the Father to Chriſt in the Covenant of Redemption, and no others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. Joh. 17.6, 8, 9. <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name to the Men thou gaveſt me out of the World.</hi> Now this Act of <hi>ſubduing to himſelf</hi> ſuppoſes, that theſe very Perſons who have been given by the Father to the Son are while in a State of Nature, Enemies to and Rebels againſt his Government, and that they will not be bro't any other ways to ſubmit thereto, but by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power and Conqueſt; and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed both Scripture &amp; Experience confirm, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. &amp; 8.7. Chriſt does not only as a Prophet propoſe to the Elect the Terms of Peace, but as a King by the Almighty Power of his Spirit, through his Word, convinces their Minds and perſwades their Wills freely to comply with them, <hi>Job</hi> 16.8, 9. <hi>Pſal</hi> 110 3. Sinners will never ſubmit kindly to Chriſt's Government, till the ſtrong Man armed be caſt out, and the ſtubborneſs of their Wills be ſubdued and broken.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Act of Chriſt's Kingly-Power is his <hi>ruling of his People,</hi> after they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued to himſelf; and this he doth outwardly by his Laws, and inwardly by his Spirit. The
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004822_0013_100DF83E713CC838"/>Government <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Churches is upon Chriſt's Shoulder; him hath the Father given to be a Leader and Commander to his People. As he has given a perfect Syſtem of Laws for their Direction, ſo he helps his Elect to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, love and obey them by his Spirit, ſincerely, unexceptionably, willingly, and perſeveringly. He <hi>puts his Fear in their Hearts that they ſhall not depart from him,</hi> Jer. 22.40.</p>
            <p>Therefore for any Men to deviſe new Laws and obtrude them on the Subjects of Chriſt, is as needleſs as it is preſumptuous, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to his royal Prerogative and their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Act of Chriſt's Kingly-Power is his <hi>defending his People.</hi> It is doubtleſs the Duty of a Prince to protect his Subjects, to procure and preſerve their Peace by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining good Government among them; as well as by guarding them from Violence by foreign Foes. Now the King of <hi>Zion</hi> has given his People a Peace, which their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can as little underſtand as bereave them of. The King of the Church preſerves her from outward Violence ſo far as ſerves her beſt Good, and any more would be a Loſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Benefit. If Chriſt had not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by the Arm of his almighty Power to ſcreen his People from the Rage of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, his Church would have been entirely deſtroyed long ago. And as the King of the Church defends the <hi>Perſons</hi> of his People, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004822_0014_100DF83FFA253D18"/>from or in Trouble, ſo as to make them iſſue in their Benefit according to his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. (<hi>By this the Iniquity of Jacob ſhall be purged, and this is all the Frait to take away his Sins.</hi>) ſo he defends their <hi>Graces,</hi> from being utterly deſtroyed, by the vigorous and unwearied Aſſaults of their inward Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and outward Enemies; by his Power they are revived out of their uncomfortable Deadneſs, and reduced from their ungrateful Strayings; and ſo guided by his Council and carried by his Strength to eternal Glory and Bleſſedneſs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.24. O if they were leſt to themſelves, they would be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwallowed up with Deſpair and Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, under their doleful Deſertions, or elſe loſe all Reliſh of Religion by Security and Sloth, and thus wander eternally from God. O! If our Stock were in our own Hands and we had no better Security for our ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but our own Endeavours, we ſhould all ſurely prove Bankrupts with our firſt Parents, and none of <hi>Adam's</hi> Poſterity would croſs the Threſhold of Glory: But bleſſed be the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, the Father, Son and Spirit by Men and Angels throughout all Eternity, that the Caſe is otherwiſe; <hi>Zion</hi>'s King is his People's Surety. His almighty Power is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, by his gracious Promiſe, for his People's final Perſeverance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>Job.</hi> 10.28. Our Power, Purpoſes &amp; Promiſes are little worth, God knows: O! But the Purpoſes of Chriſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004822_0015_100DF84198DA80C8"/>ſtand like Mountains of eternal Braſs. His Power all the Creation cannot withſtand, and his Promiſe will never, never ſail: We may with fulneſs of Confidence lay the ſtreſs of our eternal Salvation upon it. O! the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſionate King of <hi>Zion</hi> comforts thoſe that are caſt down; tho' he hideth his Face for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Moment, yet he returns! he returns! O he returns dear Brethren! to the equal Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and Conſolation of his People! When the poor People of God are dried like a Leaf in his Abſence from them, and almoſt quite diſcouraged, becauſe of the View they have of their own meaneſs, vileneſs, worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs and unprofitableneſs, O how ſtrangely does it affect them to behold their dear Lord coming again and again over the Mountains of <hi>Bether</hi> to their Souls Succour, after their manifold and ungrateful Abuſes of his Love-Tokens, after their repeated Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings and Breaches of their Vows, Purpoſes, and Promiſes. After Souls have been ſtain'd by Senſuality &amp; Sloth. O! How does it fill their Mands with Wonder, cover their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with Shame, and throughly break their Hearts into bitter weeping, from Love to think, that either God or Man ſhould take any kind Notice of ſuch poor, ungrateful, ſinful and worthleſs Worm; as they, the like of which they do not think is in all the World. Their Hearts are ſwell'd ſo big with Goſpel Grief and Gratitude, that they are
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004822_0016_100DF844F8EDAB60"/>ready to burſt in Pieces; the ſecret Language of their Souls this Occaſion, is perhaps to the following purpoſe; <q>
                  <hi>Dear Lord!</hi> How ſtrange and ſurprizing is the Glory of thy pure Grace, which thus purſues, with the moſt unwearied Patience &amp; endearing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, a wicked, wretched, worthleſs, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Worm, the like of which, in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is not among all thy rational Creatures! Merciful God &amp; dear Saviour, I bluſh &amp; am aſhamed at the Riches of thy free &amp; endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Kindneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Good Majeſty, wherefore wilt thou love the meaneſt Duſt, without a Motive? and continue thy infinitely va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Regard, after the vileſt Abuſe both of thy comforting &amp; chaſtening Providences? How, O how great God! ſhall I obtain Mercy to walk anſwerable to the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thy matchleſs Love, and return the Gratitude it demerits. Alas! wo is me, for my Inſtability and Ingratitude, my Senſuality and Sloth. But, O my God! how invariable is thine Affection, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied thy Patience, and how ſure and faithful is thy Word. Well, great Majeſty, I deſerve thy Rebukes, if thou wilt ſmite me dead or lay other heavy Rods upon me, I durſt not ſpeak againſt it, it would ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be righteous and juſt. I therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelf into thine Hands, O thou glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sovereign, do with me, thy poor Creature, what thou pleaſeſt, only if thou
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004822_0017_100DF84686B1AB38"/>art pleas'd to let me live, O let me live to thee, and ſerve thy Glory and Kingdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But a 4th Act of Chriſt's Kingly-Power is his <hi>reſtraining his and their Enemies.</hi> The Church of Chriſt in this World is compaſſed with many and powerful Enemies. She ſojourns in <hi>Meſech,</hi> in <hi>Kedar's</hi> Tents, among the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> She has her Seat of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reſidence in Dens of Lions &amp; on Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Leopards. Theſe cruel Beaſts of Prey, who are inceſſantly labouring to worry her, to rob her of her Honour, or Innocence, her Eaſe or her Life. Men, Devils and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions join in a helliſh League to Plot and procure her Ruin. The Children of the Bond-Woman, ſome of whom have a ſtrict but dead Form of Religion, like the old Phariſees, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute her under a religious Mask: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Keepers of the Vineyard will ſmite her, and take away her Vail from her: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times her Mothers Children, unexperienc'd Profeſſors of the ſame Religion, will be angry with her; yea ſo angry as to caſt her out of their Communion, and ſay, <hi>Let the Lord be glorified!</hi> In the mean time, the Devil goes about like a Lion rampant, roaring &amp; raging as if he would devour them at once; and indeed he would make ſhort Work with them all, if he had Liberty. Now with thoſe Enemies their Corruptions are ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire, for theſe do alſo War againſt their Souls,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004822_0018_100DF8481033C038"/>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. God's People are not able to withſtand one of theſe Enemies apart, how much leſs all together. How ſoon then would they be ruin'd by them if the King of the Church did not interpoſe by his reſtraining Power to check their Rage and blaſt their Devices. Indeed he does not deſtroy them at once, but lets them plot and conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Heritage, and when they think they have brought their hell-hatch'd Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to Ripeneſs and Perfection; he turns them to Fooliſhneſs, catches <hi>Ahitophel's</hi> in their Craftineſs, and puts Hooks in the Jaws of <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s, and reſtrains the remainder of their Wrath, that it ſhall not produce ſuch pernicious Effects as they maliciouſly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And thus the Power &amp; Love of <hi>Zion</hi>'s King is glorified in preſerving his Church which is afflicted &amp; toſſed with Tempeſts from being drowned in theſe Waters, in preſerving the burning Buſh from being conſumed by the Flames with which it is ſcorched. The Lord Jeſus does alſo reſtrain Satan from doing that Injury to God's People which he would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe commit, and will ſhortly bruiſe him under their Feet. Again, the King of the Church reſtrains the Corruptions of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from breaking out, as they naturally tend to, otherwiſe there is not one of his Subjects but would be a Reproach to his Prince and Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:004822_0019_100DF84A536E6168"/>
The laſt Act of Kingly-Power which the Aſſembly mentions is that of <hi>ſubduing his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</hi> Which he doth by Degrees that the Sincerity of his Subjects may be proved and their Graces exerciſed! But in the End of Time, he will gloriouſly triumph over all his Enemies, and at his Name every Knee ſhall bow.</p>
            <p>But it is Time to ſpeak ſomething of the <hi>Royal Prerogatives</hi> of the King of <hi>Zion;</hi> and they are principally theſe following;</p>
            <p n="1">1. His <hi>anointing,</hi> by which he receiv'd the Spirit and Power without Meaſure, yea the fullneſs of the Godhead bodily, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His <hi>inveſtiture,</hi> whereby according to God's eternal Decree, he was appointed to be King, and alſo promis'd &amp; prefigur'd, as was hinted before, as well as proclaim'd at his Birth by the Angels, and acknowledged at his Death by his Enemies. But,</p>
            <p n="3">2. Another royal Prerogative of the King of Zion is his <hi>Coronation,</hi> which was in his humbled State a little before his Death, by a thorny Crown in Deriſion, but after his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion into Heaven, by a Crown of Glory at the right Hand of his Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 29. A Crown is an Enſign of Kingly-Majeſty, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 1.11. Chriſt is ſaid to have many Crowns upon his Head, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.12. not only to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify that he is King of Kings, but alſo to point out the many Victories he hath gain'd
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004822_0020_100DF84C6E128288"/>over his and his People's Enemies. For it is the Cuſtom of victorious Kings to take the Crowns of the Heads off the conquered, and put them on their own, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.30. It was an afflictive Sight to ſee the bleſſed Head of Chriſt crown'd with Thorns. But O its joyful to behold him now crown'd with Glory &amp; Honour infinitely above the higheſt Angels! and to conſider that by his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he has purchas'd for his People an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible Crown, a Crown of Righteouſneſs, a Crown of Life, a Crown of Glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2.4. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 5.2, 3.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His <hi>Palace-Royal,</hi> which exceeds in Beauty and Magnificence any Ideas that we can form of it. Hence the Bleſſed and only Potentate is ſaid to <hi>dwell in that Light which no Man can approach unto,</hi> 1 Tim 6.15, 16. But indeed the Country Seat of this great King's Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is the contrite and humble Hearts of his faithful Subjects, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15.</p>
            <p n="5">5. His <hi>Throne:</hi> Now a Throne is a Seat for a King, an Enſign of royal State &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, <hi>Eſt.</hi> 5.1. The Throne of Chriſt is ſo far ſuperior to all earthly Thrones, that they are plac'd on his Footſtool, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1. Now the Throne of Chriſt is a Throne of Majeſty and Glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.1. a Throne of Grace &amp; Mercy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4 16. an exalted, eſtabliſh'd and eternal Throne, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8.</p>
            <p n="6">6. His <hi>Scepter,</hi> or <hi>royal Rod;</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Token of Kingly-Power &amp; Majeſty,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004822_0021_100DF84E8D269F78"/>
               <hi>Eſth.</hi> 5.2. Now the King of <hi>Zion,</hi> hath a two-fold Scepter, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Iron.</hi> His <hi>gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> Scepter is that by which he rules his Subjects, <hi>outwardly</hi> by his Word, eſpecially of the Goſpel, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2. and <hi>inwardly</hi> by his Spirit, which is on this Account call'd the Finger and Arm of the Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.20. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1. His <hi>Iron Scepter,</hi> is that by which he breaks and confounds his Enemies, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.27. Juſtly has the Apoſtle obſerv'd concerning this King of Zion, Heb. 1.8. <hi>Thy Throne O God is forever and ever, a Scepter of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the Scepter of thy Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. His <hi>Laws,</hi> that are <hi>holy, juſt</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> Rom. 7.12. Hence the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that there is but <hi>one Lawgiver,</hi> Jam. 4.12. It is the royal Prerogative to authorize the publick Coin, which the King's Image and Inſcription makes current among his Subjects, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.2. &amp; 20.21. ſo moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is only the Stamp of Chriſt's kingly Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that can give religious Laws ſuch a Sanction as deſerves the regard of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: And to coin others in addition to his is to confront his Wiſdom, uſurp his royal Prerogative, and enſlave his Subjects: But it is our Duty, our Honour, and our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to be as careful that we be not enſnared and enſlaved by the Commandments of Men in religious Matters, as of receiving coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Coin in civil Affairs, for they are both rebellious Cheats; It's faſeſt to walk in the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004822_0022_100DF85016328A78"/>King's High-Way to Heaven, obſerving the Directions of Chriſt's royal Law, and as for human Taditions in Religion, let us out of loyal Love to our King and Saviour reject them with Abhorrence, and ſtand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt has made us free.</p>
            <p>To the aforeſaid Particulars, I may add he following Prerogatives, viz. <hi>Tribute,</hi> a <hi>Treaſury</hi> or <hi>Armament,</hi> and <hi>judicial Power?</hi> The Tribute of Truſt, tranſcendent Love and religious Worſhip is due to Zion's King from Men and Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. He hath alſo a Magazine or Armoury ſufficient to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all his People in all their Combats with Sin, Satan and the World. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.11,—19, The King of Zion is alſo the ſupreme and final Judge of Life &amp; Death, having Power to pardon or condemn, <hi>Mark</hi> 25.3.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, it appears that the Kingdom of Chriſt is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Spiritual;</hi> tho' it hath ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the Kingdoms of the World, yet it's Nature differs much from them: Hence our Saviour obſerv'd that his Kingdom was not of this World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.36. It's not at tended with outward Pomp and State, but it's Adminiſtrations are ſpiritual; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was this that ſtumbled the <hi>Jews</hi> at Chriſt, for they expected that the Meſſias would come attended with the Enſigns of worldly Glory and Grandeun.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Property of Chriſt's Kingdom
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004822_0023_100DF851D0004870"/>is, that it is <hi>univerſal,</hi> as to all Times, all Places, and all Creatures, ſo far as they ſerve to promote the Weal of Chriſt's Subjects: <hi>His Kingdom ruleth over all,</hi> Matth. 28.18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Eternal:</hi> It's a Kingdom that <hi>ſhall ſtand forever,</hi> Dan. 2.44.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It's <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>glorious;</hi> hence it's call'd the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> of <hi>Light, Glory,</hi> becauſe it brings the ſweeteſt Peace and moſt perfect Felicity to all the ſincere Subjects of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the <hi>Improvement.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Subject ſerves to inform us of the Glory of Chriſt on the account of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Office. He is called the <hi>Lord of Glory,</hi> the <hi>King of Glory.</hi> Now the Glory of Chriſt is illuſtrated by divers Similitudes, as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by that of a <hi>Horn,</hi> Pſal. 79.24. in which conſiſts the Honour and Power of Beaſts: By a <hi>Lamp,</hi> which ſcatters its Splendor or Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.17. By a <hi>Crown flouriſhing, Pſal.</hi> 132.18. By <hi>Thrones,</hi> in which Monarchs manifeſt their State &amp; Grandeur, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.32. Now the kingly Glory of Chriſt was prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by the Magnificence of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon;</hi> and it will be the more affecting to us if we conſider the infinite Wiſdom, Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, Mercy and Power of this Prince, by which he is every way ſuitably qualified to manage the Reins of Government. He is the wiſe and wonderful Counſellor, the mighty-God of hoſts, the Wiſdom &amp; Power
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004822_0024_100DF855682B0908"/>of God, Juſtice and Love itſelf. His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is vaſt and ample, extending to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Boundaries of the Univerſe; for to him all Power is given in Heaven &amp; Earth. His Kingdom is peaceable &amp; durable, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the utmoſt Limits of Time; theſe Things may encline us to honour our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sovereign, by Thoughts, Words and Works, and to glory in him:</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Chriſt be the only King of Zion, by divine Appointment then we may learn, that <hi>it is a bold Invaſion of his Crown and Dignity to make new Laws without his Interpoſal, to govern his Subjects by, in religious Matters,</hi> and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally tends to ſet up a human King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the room of Chriſt's and in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it; as alſo to draw the Subjects of Chriſt from their Allegiance to him, and ſubject their Conſciences to the Humours and Luſts of their Fellow-Creatures, as well as to rend the Church of Chriſt into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of Parts. Whether the Pride and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of thoſe that frame new Laws in religious Matters, be a greater Evil than the Simplicity and Cowardiſe of thoſe that obey them, is hard to determine. I proceed to a</p>
            <p n="2">2d Uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Examination;</hi> Let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether the King of Zion has ſubdu'd us to himſelf? To this end,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Has Chriſt ſet up a Court in your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, and caus'd your guilty Conſciences to draw up an Indictment againſt you, for your
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004822_0025_100DF856EFD95BF0"/>Rebellion in State &amp; Practice; and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Evidence to prove this dreadful Charge? and have your Conſciences as Judges on the Bench, paſs'd Sentence upon you according to Law &amp; Evidence, that you were in your preſent Condition, Rebels againſt the great God, your rightful Sovereign, and that for this you were curſed by God, and muſt be damned to all Eternity, unleſs ye obtain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and Converſion?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Have ye bitterly bewail'd from your Hearts with Shame &amp; Indignation, that you have been ſo long, unjuſtly, ungratefully and fooliſhly Rebellious againſt the Son of God, the King of Zion? And has this your mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proceeded from Love, and been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeated? <hi>Pſal</hi> 51.4, 17, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.5, 6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Have you renounced your former Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Sin and Satan, and under a Senſe of your own Vileneſs, Miſery &amp; Inability, hank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accepted of the Act of Grace proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the King of Zion in his Goſpel, for the Pardon of returning Rebels? Did ye ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render your ſelves entirely to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and do you wholly lean upon his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for your Acceptance with God? <hi>Matth</hi> 6.24. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12,—14. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Are the Laws of the King written on your Heart? other Princes have their Image on their Coin, but Chriſt engraves his on his
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004822_0026_100DF8591046A040"/>People's Hearts. Do ye ſincerely &amp; habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally love Chriſt's Laws, ſo as to deſire ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and endeavour earneſtly &amp; generally to be conform'd to them without Exception? <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Are your Wills made ſubject to Chriſt as King? Temporal Princes may ty the Hands of Rebels, but cannot turn their Hearts; but Zion's King can &amp; does change the Hearts of the perverſeſt of Men, and make them willing in the Day of his Power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. Are ye now in the general as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Duties of Obedience, as before in Acts of Rebellion?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Do you ſincerely love God's People, and that for their Goodneſs ſake, and in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereto? of whatever Denomination they be? if you are reconcil'd to their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Father, you muſt needs love them, and deem them the moſt Excellent in the Earth. I proceed to a</p>
            <p n="3">3d Uſe, which is of <hi>Conſolation</hi> to thoſe that have experienced the aforeſaid Signs; O! What unſpeakable Reaſon have ye to rejoice, in that ye have ſuch a wiſe, powerful and merciful Prince to rule over you: In that ye are made the Subjects of ſuch a rich, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and everlaſting Kingdom; in that ye are rul'd by ſuch an eaſy Sceptre, equal Laws and ſweet Perſwaſions of the Holy Spirit. Does not your Souls experience, my Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, that Chriſt's Burden is light and his
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004822_0027_100DF85AED9D4EA0"/>Yoke eaſy? Rejoice Sirs! and again, I ſay, rejoice! <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous, and Joy for the Upright in Heart.</hi> Rejoice that ye ſhall quickly inherit a Crown of everlaſting Glory. Let Hell and Earth roar and rage againſt you; let Men and Devils conſpire and contrive your Ruin, yet rejoice, for Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's God and King reigns! Your Husband holds the Scepter of Government in his Hand, and can eaſily cruſh Men &amp; Devils into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by his Word. However numerous, crafty, malicious and powerful they be, they can't move a Hair's-Breadth farther againſt you than he gives them leave. You are ſafe and ſecure under the almighty Protection of your King, therefore <hi>rejoice greatly, O Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion, and ſhout O Daughter of Jeruſalem!</hi> Zech. 9.9. But,</p>
            <p>4thly, This Subject opens a Scene of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> to all thoſe that have not experienc'd the aforeſaid Signs of Subjection to Chriſt's Government; but are on the contrary ſtill in a State of carnal Security, going on in a Courſe of carnal Merriment &amp; obſtinate Rebellion againſt Chriſt's Authority, as well as of vain Confidence in his Mercy; whoſe Hearts have never been chang'd by the almighty Power of God; who tho' they cry, <hi>Lord, Lord!</hi> do not the Things that Zion's King commands, but in Works deny his Government: They alſo diſreliſh his Laws, his Ordinances, his People. Now all ſuch unhappy Souls are
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004822_0028_100DF85E3248BDE0"/>Enemies to him who is <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords;</hi> who ſhall <hi>rule in the middle of his Enemies, till he make them his Footſtool,</hi> Pſal. 110.1. Your King is the Black-Prince, the God of this World; ye are Slaves of Satan, the Servants of Perdition, whom our King, (if ye perſiſt) will ſurely <hi>ſpeak to in his Wrath, vex in his ſore Diſpleaſure, and daſh to Pieces like a Potter's Veſſel</hi> with his <hi>Iron-Rod:</hi> Joh 12.31. 2 Pet. 2.19. Pſal. 2.5.9. I proceed to a</p>
            <p>Uſe of <hi>Exhortation;</hi> And here I do beſeech all of you to <hi>perform all the Offices</hi> that are due to the Perſon of your Prince. Namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Ye ſhould kiſs him with a <hi>Kiſs of Homage,</hi> which was wont to be conferred on new Kings. Pſal. 2.12. <hi>Kiſs the Son leſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the Way.</hi> Ye ſhould kiſs the King of Zion with a Kiſs of Love, Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Submiſſion. You muſt love him above all Enjoyments, ſubmit to him in all Circumſtances, &amp; entirely depend upon him for the ſupply of all your Neceſſities. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Job.</hi> 14.6. Moreover, We owe to our King, Honour, Fear, Faith, Obedience &amp; Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. He ſhould be to us the chiefeſt among ten Thouſand, the Object of our Fear &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and Foundation of our Truſt &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. His Laws are the only Rules of our Obedience &amp; Charity. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96.8. We ought to perform theſe Offices to the King of Zion, becauſe they do of Right belong to him, who is King of Kings &amp; Lord
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004822_0029_100DF85FBAC58C28"/>of Lords; who confers upon his People ſuch durable &amp; valuable Benefits, and inflicts on his rebellious Enemies, ſuch inexpreſſible Torments, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſhould labour to <hi>promote the Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> in our ſelves and among others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Places, Abilities &amp; Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, by earneſt Prayer and laborious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. O let Sinners lay down their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Arms, and ſpeedily ſubmit to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Scepter of Zion's King, leſt they feel the Weight of his iron Rod; and if we are Inſtruments of promoting the Kingdom of Chriſt, what Comfort will it yield here, and encreaſing Comfort in the next State? O then let generous Projects for Zion's Proſperity, ennoble and inſpire our Minds; let ardent Deſires to ſerve her valuable Intereſts, inflame and oppreſs our Hearts, and unwearied En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, directed to the ſame excellent Mark, crown and adorn our Practice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let Magiſtrates <hi>imitate the perſonal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies</hi> of the King of Zion, as well as the <hi>excellent Manner of his Government:</hi> They ſhould adorn their Character by eminent Wiſdom, Holineſs, Humility, Meekneſs, and an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Adminiſtration of Juſtice, in protecting the Innocent from Oppreſſion and Violence, and puniſhing the guilty proportionable to their Crimes, in promoting Vertue &amp; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſuppreſſing the contrary. In ſo doing, they will caſt their Crowns, their
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004822_0030_100DF861490BAC80"/>Authority, at the Redeemer's Feet, and are like to receive a better and more durable Crown from him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> All Chriſtians ſhould endeavour to <hi>imitate Chriſt as a King,</hi> ſeeing they are made Kings by his Grace, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p>They ſhould be wiſe, juſt, merciful, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. As our King commands all, ſo ſhould we command our ſelves and our Affections, and not ſuffer our ſelves to be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of any. As our King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſpiritual Enemies, ſo ſhould we in his Strength oppoſe Satan and Sin, and ſo Fight the Fight of Faith. As Chriſt our King did not lead a worldly Life, but avoided all worldly Pride and State, ſo ſhould we be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and look upon all vain Pomp and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Love to other worldly Things, to be below our kingly Dignity. In this Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt conſiſts our greateſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and higheſt Happineſs; for if we are made like to Chriſt the King here by Grace, we ſhall be like to him in eternal Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>NOW to the King eternal, immortal, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the only true GOD, be Glory for ever.</hi>
