            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Conſcious therefore of my own inability, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to excuſe myſelf to all; and in this determination I perſiſted for ſome time, but at laſt, for my own ſafety, was obliged to capitulate and ſurrender on the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtipulations; Firſt, the infrequency of dramatic com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in America: Secondly, the torrent of ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from all quarters: Thirdly, the neceſſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to the entertainment of the city: Fourthly and laſtly, to put a ſtop (if poſſible) to the fooliſh and pernicious practice of ſearching after ſuppoſed hidden

But in order to give ſtrangers, and thoſe unacquainted with the ſtory ſome Idea of it, the following ſhort hiſtory is thought neceſſary— The ſcheme was planned by four humorous gentlemen, Hum, Parchment, Quadrant, and Rattle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap, to divert themſelves and friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and try what lengths credulity and the love of money would carry men. In order to put their ſcheme into execution, they fram'd a plauſible, well connected ſtory of hidden treaſure; and to gloſs the matter, adapted ſundry papers to their purpoſe, and pitch'd upon two ſuitable old fellows, Waſhball and Raccoon (as principle dupes) with others, to try the ſucceſs of their ſcheme; which had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired effect.— The moral ſhews the folly of an over credulity and deſire of money, and how apt men are (eſpecially old men) to be unwarily drawn into ſchemes where there is but the leaſt ſhadow of gain; and concludes with theſe obſervations, that mankind ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with their reſpective ſtations; to follow their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations with honeſty and induſtry— the only ſure way to gain riches.</p>

He, he, he. Truſhoop talks of building a chapel at his own expence, and employing a ſcore of prieſts, to keep up a continual rotation of prayers for the repoſe of the ſouls of thoſe poor fellows who buried it. As for M' Snip, he intends to knock off buſineſs, home to England and purchaſe a title. He, he, he. They'll both be here in half an hour.</p>
