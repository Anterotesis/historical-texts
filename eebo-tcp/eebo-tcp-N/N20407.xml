            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WITH pleaſure I take my pen to anſwer the queſtions you put to me. What is the RIGHT and POWER of Congregational Churches, <hi>to chooſe their Officers; to exerciſe Diſcipline; and to remove their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers from their Office, according to the</hi> CAMBRIDGE PLATFORM?</p>
               <p>Theſe enquiries are truly of importance: ſince peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple appear to be divided in their ſentiments about them.</p>
               <p>Perhaps I ſhall not be able to give a ſatisfactory anſwer to your queſtions; but, ſince you have deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, I will give you my idea of the ſubject, which I have acquired by attending to the principles and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Congregational Churches, as I find them by their writers, both before and ſince their Platform, as well as the Platform itſelf. This you will allow is a juſt way to determine the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> by the Platform; as thoſe who compoſed, and practiſed upon it, muſt be allowed to be the beſt interpreters of it.</p>
               <p>And though the Platform was compoſed by men under very different circumſtances from what we are in this day; and having a different phraſeology, and it being but ſhort and ſummary; there is ſome obſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026757_0003_0FD1C22B4B046F40"/>
as to the meaning of it, in all its parts; yet, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to the writings of thoſe who lived in thoſe days, we may find what their principles and practice were, and learn what the meaning and extent of the Platform is.</p>
               <p>You aſk, what is the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches to chooſe their officers, &amp;c. Many people ſeem to blend theſe together, as if whatever any one has <hi>power</hi> to do, he has <hi>right</hi> to do alſo. But you will readily grant there is a diſtinction to be made. Perſons may have a <hi>right</hi> to have, or to do things, which they have not <hi>power</hi> to do or perform: ſo alſo perſons have <hi>power</hi> to do many things which they have no <hi>right</hi> to do, elſe there could be no ſuch thing as evil works. Thus a thief has <hi>power</hi> to ſteal, to take ſome of my property from me; a ruffian may have <hi>power</hi> to wound and murder me; a ſlanderer may have <hi>power</hi> to deſtroy my character, and innumerable ways men may have <hi>power</hi> to hurt and wrong one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. But perhaps no one will in earneſt pretend he has any <hi>right</hi> to injure his neighbour.</p>
               <p>This may be applied to Churches: If they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have <hi>right</hi> to do every thing, they have <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> to do; the enquiry is wholly at an end, what is their <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power;</hi> becauſe, upon that ſuppoſition, they cannot do any thing wrong; and this, as extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant as it is, ſeems to be the real ſentiment of ſome; what elſe can be made of the profeſſed ſentiment and practice of thoſe, who aſſert that a Church may do as they pleaſe and not be reſponſible, or under any check or control whatever? Theſe however call themſelves Congregationaliſts, and ſometimes they will ſay they are <hi>Independents,</hi> as if both were the ſame thing. But the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026757_0004_0FD1C22CC1A40F28"/>
idea I have conceived of thoſe two denominations, by examining the writings of the founders of CONGRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GATIONALISM, is, that they are as different one from the other; as the ſyſtem of religion and policy, by Moſes, was, from the confuſion of Babel. Thoſe of Babel ſcattered into parties; and every perſon or party, did as they pleaſed, <hi>independent</hi> of each other. The ſyſtem of policy by Moſes was a well connected ſcheme, wherein was a proper ſubordination and check upon every individual family, and tribe; being reſponſible to each other for their conduct; with as much liberty to every individual as the preſent ſtate admits of.</p>
               <p>This is my idea of Congregationaliſm; it is a con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nected ſcheme, and, if well adhered to, would produce great beauty and order.</p>
               <p>You will ſee that, in my anſwer to your queſtions, I ſhall not content myſelf in ſaying what Churches will do, or have power to do; but what they have both <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to do: and this leads to enquire into the nature and conſtitution of Congregational Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which will be the ſubject of my following letters.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="letter">

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE definition of a Congregational Church, as I find it by the Platform and other writers, is, <hi>a number of profeſſing believers in Chriſt, ſuch as can conveniently congregate together for worſhip, covenanting and confed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erating together to obſerve all things whatſoever Chriſt has commanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:026757_0005_0FD1C2345ED9A0F8"/>This contains all his worſhip and ordinances; the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and diſcipline of his houſe; which conſiſts in a friendly watch over each other, and uſing ſuch means as Chriſt, the King, has inſtituted for the reclaiming and recovering of ſuch as have fallen into any fault: and purging out or rejecting ſuch as, after ſuch means are uſed with them as Chriſt has inſtituted for their re-recovery, continue incorrigible.</p>
               <p>This deſcription of a Church, excludes from it eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing of the nature of legiſlation. They covenant to execute laws <hi>already</hi> made by Chriſt, the King; and no other. They cannot therefore, make any thing a crime, which is not made ſo in God's word. Neither may they take any other method of proceeding, than what Chriſt has inſtituted: if they do, they go out of their province, profane the name of Chriſt, pretending to do that as a Church of Chriſt, i. e. in his name, which he has not inſtituted. It would be as great an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety for any Church to undertake to do thus; as it would be for any member of the judicial or executive authority in America, to undertake to execute the laws and cuſtoms of the piratical Algerines. And as much worſe for any Church to do thus, as much more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly impious, as Chriſt the Lord, in whoſe name they pretend to act, is greater than the authority of the American nation.</p>
               <p>That ſuch a covenanting together, is what conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes a Church, was the idea of the founders of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Churches in this country, appears by oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er writers as well as the Platform. Mr. Hooker, who was in the higheſt repute for his piety, learning, and political genius, both in Europe and America, who early emigrated into this country, and after a ſhort
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026757_0006_0FD1C2377AE7BA28"/>
ſtay at Newtown, near Boſton; he, with ſome planters, went to Connecticut River, to Hartford, there they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a new colony, which, with the colony of Newha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is now the State of Connecticut. It is ſaid that Mr. Hooker inſtituted ſuch a tranſcendent ſyſtem of ſtate policy and laws for the colony, as that, when they applied to the Crown for a charter, their conſtitution and laws commanded the admiration, aſtoniſhment and applauſe of the moſt ſage counſellors in that old coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which had for many ages been building on the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of the Romans and politicians of the whole world. This great man wrote his <hi>Survey of Church Diſcipline,</hi> ſome years before the Platform was made; and if you compare, you will find the Platform was very much founded upon it.</p>
               <p>In his Survey, Part 1, page 46, he ſays, "Mutual covenanting and confederating of Saints, in fellowſhip of the faith, according to the order of the Goſpel, is that which gives conſtitution and being to the viſible Church." Again, ſpeaking of the ſame thing, <hi>"This Covenant is an engagement to walk in the ways of Chriſt."</hi> "This covenant (he ſays) may be either <hi>explicit</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit.</hi> Explicit, when there is a formal <hi>covenant. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit,</hi> when they practiſe without a verbal, written, or formal covenant; yet is binding by their thus prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing." Page 50, to ſhew the reaſons of a Church Covenant; he compares it to <hi>corporations</hi> for civil purpoſes. By the combination they have power over each other, for the purpoſes for which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined.</p>
               <p>The ſame idea is fully expreſſed in the Platform, Chap. iv. Sec. 1. "Saints, by calling, muſt have a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible political union among themſelves; or elſe they
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026757_0007_0FD1C237834B8D38"/>
are not yet a particular Church." Sec. 2d. "Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches cannot be diſtinguiſhed one from another but by their forms.' Sec. 3d. "This form is a viſible covenant, agreement and conſent, whereby they give themſelves unto the Lord, to the obſerving of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt, together in the ſame ſociety; which is uſually called the Church Covenant. For we ſee not otherwiſe how members can have power one over another." Again, Chap. vi, Sec. 1. "A church is a company of people combined together for the worſhip of God."</p>
               <p>Mr. Davenport, who was firſt Miniſter of Newhaven after he came into this country in 1639, afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Paſtor of the firſt Church in Boſton, in his <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Congregational Churches,</hi> which he wrote about 18 years after the Platform, compares the Church to the <hi>natural body;</hi> to a body corporate; to a wife with her huſband; and ſays, "All voluntary relations are by covenant." "Viſible privileges, powers, &amp;c. muſt be by viſible confederation."</p>
               <p>This covenant is for life, as eſſentially as the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage covenant. Hence the Platform utterly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of perſons forſaking the Church, Chap. xiii, Sec. 2d. "They who are joined with conſent, ſhould not depart without conſent; except forced thereto." Which <hi>force,</hi> as explained by the Platform, and other writers, means perſonal or general perſecution.</p>
               <p>On this principle, the firſt ſettlers of New-England acted; they did not ſeparate from the communion of the Church of England, but were driven out by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and brought this noble Chriſtian ſpirit acroſs the Atlantic, and incorporated it into their Platform. This, I ſaid, was a Chriſtian ſpirit; for Chriſt himſelf
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026757_0008_0FD1C23786E7BEF8"/>
never ſeparated from the communion of the Jewiſh Church; though they were very corrupt and wicked in their principles and practices; but bore teſtimony againſt them. I might add, that Martin Luther never ſeparated from the Church of Rome, but ſtrove for a reformation; till he was driven out by the thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing BULLS of the LATERAN: which he conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a diſſolution of his ſolemn engagements. Thus he imitated his Lord and Maſter, Jeſus Chriſt; which every Chriſtian is bound to do. And, I doubt not you will join with me, when I aſſert, that for perſons to ſeparate from the Church, or withdraw from commun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with it, becauſe of ſome faults or errors, real or ſuppoſed, in opinion or practice, in the Paſtor or ſome of the members, or indeed by the whole Church; is ſchiſmatical, antichriſtian, and a flagrant violation of covenant obligations, and ſolemn vows.</p>
               <p>The Platform conſiders this covenant bond ſo indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvable, that, as it may not be broken by any part's ſeparating; ſo neither may the body of the Church diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any one. Chap. xiii, Sec. 7th. "The Church cannot make a member no member, but by excommunication."</p>
               <p>This is not meant to preclude perſons moving their habitations, when Providence calls thereto; but they are ſtill members of the ſame Church; until, by letters recommendatory, they move their particular relation from one particular church to another; and they are ſtill members of the Church by the ſame combination as long as they live, unleſs they ſo violate their covenant as to forfeit it.</p>
               <p>A forfeiture alſo diſſolves the marriage covenant and relation. And that God's Church, being formed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026757_0009_0FD1C239119C6C40"/>
by covenant, is of the ſame antiquity with the marriage covenant, Mr. Davenport aſſerts it was ſo, even from ADAM.</p>
               <p>As all covenants muſt be ratified before witneſſes: and thoſe of great importance before ſome proper authority; ſo, this covenant or combination of a Church, is to be ſolemnized and ratified in preſence of witneſſes; and the authority of a Council of Churches; at leaſt of Paſtors of churches; who conſider the propriety of their thus covenanting, and combining in church ſtate; as alſo the fitneſs of the covenant they propoſe; the members ſign the covenant in their preſence. And the Council of Churches, or Paſtors, thus publickly own the new church, a new branch, or member added to the body of the Churches. And thus they are conſociat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the other churches, by covenant of fellowſhip and combination, in their very formation. Their cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant among themſelves and their conſociation with oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er churches, are blended and ratified by a moſt religious ſolemnization. See Platform, Chap. xv, Sec. 3d. and Mather's <hi>Ratio Diſciplinae,</hi> page 8 and 9.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, I have given you my idea of the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Congregational Church; I ſhall in my next give you my notion of the ORGANIZATION of a Church with officers.</p>

               <p>ALTHOUGH a number of profeſſing believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers combined together to obſerve all things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſt has commanded, are a Church: yet they
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026757_0010_0FD1C23A85CB5E30"/>
cannot perform what they have covenanted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined for; without being ORGANIZED with Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
               <p>Chriſt has, therefore, inſtituted Officers proper for the executing of all thoſe laws and ordinances which he has commanded.</p>
               <p>What thoſe officers are, ſeems to have undergone a variety of ſentiments among Chriſtians of various denominations; and even among Congregationaliſts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hooker evidently ſuppoſed, there ſhould be <hi>Paſtor</hi> and <hi>Teacher, Ruling Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> And the Platform is evidently compoſed with the ſame idea. Yet the Synod which aſſembled at Boſton, in 1662, but 14 years after the Platform was made; in their reſult aſſert, that, <hi>"A Church with a teaching El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der have full power and authority, from the Lord Jeſus, regularly to adminiſter all the ordinances of Chriſt."</hi> This being ſo ſoon after the Platform was made, there can be no doubt but that moſt of the ſame men were in this Synod, that were in making the Platform. And this being done by the ſame authority, and moſtly by the ſame perſons the Platform was; may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an appendix to it, and of the ſame authority, in theſe churches with that: and the general practice of theſe churches, having been according to it, I ſhall not enquire after any other ruling Officer in Chriſt's Church, beſide a teaching Elder, Paſtor, or Biſhop.</p>
               <p>This Officer is to teach and adminiſter all things whatſoever Chriſt has commanded. He is neceſſarily and eſſentially a Ruler; for rule, government, and authority, muſt accompany a Teacher. Accordingly, the Miniſters of Chriſt are ſpoken of as <hi>Rulers in his Houſe,</hi> frequently in the New-Teſtament: and Chriſt's
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026757_0011_0FD1C23C2CBC06C0"/>
addreſſing the Churches, by addreſſing the Angel of the Church, is evidence that he conſiders it ſo. Such an Officer is now certainly belonging to the Church of Chriſt, as appears from what he ſays, Matt. xxviii. <hi>Lo I am with you always to the end of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is alſo another Officer inſtituted in Chriſt's Church to take care of the temporalities thereof, who is called Deacon.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Officers appear plain, according to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to belong to the Church. But the firſt is the principal one, without which the ſpiritual inſtitutions of Chriſt's Kingdom cannot be executed. Which therefore will be the principal ſubject of enquiry.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE in my former letter conſidered what Officers are eſſential to the Church of Chriſt. I will now ſay ſomething how a Church is to be furniſhed with thoſe Officers according to Congregational principles. I ſhall ſpecially attend to the firſt, without which the Church is incapable of carrying into execution what they have covenanted and combined to do.</p>
               <p>Here again are a variety of opinions and practices. Epiſcopatians ſuppoſe a National Church, of which the King, or Supreme Magiſtrate, is head; who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points Archbiſhops and Biſhops, having certain diſtricts or biſhopricks, containing a number of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes, over which the Biſhops appoint Curates, who
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026757_0012_0FD1C23E293FAD58"/>
are to their ſeveral pariſhes the ſame as Miniſters are to our congregations. But here is no ſelect Church, therefore no covenant, neither with each other, nor with their teacher; and he receives all his official au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the biſhop who ſend him. Here Church power and authority is derived from the King, prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; and to the ſeveral orders from the higher dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitaries.</p>
               <p>Preſbyterians ſuppoſe that all eccleſiaſtical authority is in the Seſſions, Preſbyteries, Synods and General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly: this laſt body is the higheſt authority in the Preſbyterian Church. They admit lay Elders; but the brotherhood have no more voice in chooſing their officers, exerciſing dicipline or removing their officers, than Epiſcopalian pariſhes have in chooſing their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſchemes, or plans of church policy, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationaliſts diſliked; ſuppoſing that they derived all church power and authority, both official and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, directly from Chriſt; that they were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on any ſuperior order of men therefor. Hence they were called <hi>Independents.</hi> This they alſo diſliked, and expreſsly rejected; as may be found in many of the early writers of this country, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly is rejected in the Platform, Chap. ii, Sec. 5th. For they held ſtrong to a reciprocal dependence, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and obligation upon, and toward each other: not only of members in the ſame congregation; but of Churches one upon, and to another. Hence one of their early writers, ſaid of Congregational Churches, that they were INTERPENDENT.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Independents</hi> admit of no ſuch reciprocal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, connexion or dependence; and hold themſelves
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026757_0013_0FD1C23FABEC6E38"/>
at a looſe to do juſt as they pleaſe, without any check or control. They ſometimes affect to have connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with Congregationaliſts, <hi>to ſerve a turn,</hi> and when it ſerves their <hi>turn</hi> will not admit they are connected. Wild enthuſiaſtic ranters, who do not admit ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Miniſters, but that every one might pray, exhort, &amp;c. RAPIN THOYRAS, in his Hiſtory of England, calls <hi>Independents;</hi> this however need not be conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as inconſiſtent with calling any other diſorderly people <hi>Independents,</hi> for they are properly the ſtrange woman, Solomon ſpeaks of. "Her ways are movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that thou canſt not know them," they are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an anarchy, a chaos; rather than any rule, order, or ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſettlers of this country were harraſſed and preſſed between theſe two extremes, of <hi>Prelacy</hi> on the one hand, and ſelfiſh, ſelf ſufficient, ungoverned diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly <hi>Independents</hi> on the other; and it is not to be wondered at, if their Platform is tinctured in phraſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy with both; but eſpecially with the latter, to avoid the former, by which they were greatly perſecuted. Yet inſpired with the generous and chriſtian principles of reciprocal duty, <hi>by love to ſerve one of another,</hi> conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering all Chriſt's Church as members one of another, members of the ſame body, having the ſame care one for another, that therefore all connexions and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his kingdom are voluntary covenant combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. They have conſidered, not only their embody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in church ſtate, a covenant combination: but their organization with officers a covenant.</p>
               <p>Thus Mr Hooker, "There is (ſays he) a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar covenant between thoſe that chooſe, and thoſe that are choſen' and ſays, <hi>"The relation between Paſtor
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026757_0014_0FD1C244A5050148"/>
and people is a covenant: that without this covenanting, there neither is, or ever was, or ever will be, a Paſtor and Flock"</hi> Mr. Hooker further aſſerts, that "By chooſing an officer they voluntarily ſubject themſelves to him, according to the laws and orders of Chriſt." The ſame ſays Mr. Davenport, "The relation between paſtor and people is a covenant." The Platform is very full in the ſame idea, Chap. viii. The organiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with officers is by the election of the Church and the acceptance of the perſon choſen. Here is all the form and eſſence of a covenant, a propoſal on the one part; and the acceptance of the propoſal on the other part. The Church chooſe him to be ſuch an officer therein as Chriſt has inſtituted; they covenant and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to ſubmit to him as ſuch an officer. And he, by his acceptance, covenants and engages to be ſuch an officer to them; ſo it is a mutual covenant and engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on both ſides.</p>
               <p>Here alſo, in the Congregational ſyſtem, the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate body or pariſh, including the Church; by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate act concur with the Church in their election or choice; and make propoſals to the officer for his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and maintenance, by which there is a parochial civil covenant and contract, blended with his office, to both Church and pariſh; by all which the Miniſter's relation to his people, becomes a complex relation; formed by a triplicate covenant with them. This alſo is for life, for it is ſo connected with the incorporating covenant of the Church, of which he is a member, and blended with his calling, which includes his local ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that they cannot properly or conſiſtently be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated; he is a member of the body, and covenants to be ſuch a member. This complex covenant, when
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026757_0015_0FD1C2482BE52308"/>
properly ſolemnized, cannot be diſſolved; unleſs by conſent of all parties concerned, or the Miniſter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits it, by doing ſomething inconſiſtent with his office, as Chriſt has inſtituted the office; for it is not for the Church to ſay what ſhall belong to the office; they may not preſume to add to, or diminiſh from the duties or powers belonging thereto; for Chriſt has determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the duties and powers of it. And it is not for the Church, or any man or order of men, to add to, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh therefrom; if they do preſume any ſuch thing, they expoſe themſelves, to have <hi>all the plagues added to them written in God's word; and to have their names taken away out of the Book of Life.</hi> Rev. xxii. 18, 19. This threatening in God's word, ſhould make all very careful how they treat the laws of Chriſt, both as to his Miniſters and all matters of diſcipline in his Church.</p>
               <p>But though a ſingle Congregational Church hath both <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to chooſe and covenant with their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, i. e. Elder or Paſtor. Or, as it is ſometimes term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>call</hi> to <hi>office;</hi> yet it cannot, according to ſcripture, or Congregational principles or cuſtom, put into office.</p>
               <p>I ſhall in my next letter give you my idea of the Congregational principles and practice of inveſting or puting into office.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>AS I wrote you in my laſt letter, I ſhall now ſpeak of ORDINATION, INSTALLATION, or <hi>putting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find much diſpute has been about <hi>ordination.</hi> Some think it ought to be before <hi>election.</hi> I ſhall not
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026757_0016_0FD1C249A2838688"/>
enter that diſpute; it being foreign from my purpoſe; for if a man has been <hi>ordained,</hi> yet according to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational principles and practice, he muſt be inſtall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in office where he ſettles; before he is conſidered as the officer in that place. In which every ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is performed, which is in ordination, except <hi>the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of the hands of the Preſbytery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This laying on of the hands of the Preſbytery in ordination, according to 1 Tim. iv. 14. is what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the ceremony confering the Preſbytery, which Chriſt has inſtituted in his Church; ſo that this is ſomething diſtinct from, and independent of, the perſon's particular relation to any people.</p>
               <p>But what I have to enquire after, is, the ordaining or inſtalling a man in that office relation to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. This, as I have before obſerved, from Mr. Hooker and others, is a covenant, and all covenants as I have before ſaid, muſt be ratified before witneſſes, and by proper authority, which the conſtitution, law, or cuſtom has aſſigned for that purpoſe. Eſpecially all covenants of any great importance muſt be ratified and ſolemnized with all thoſe formalities. So the Platform, Chap. i. Sec. 4. ſpeaking of Church affairs, ſays, "In reſpect of the manner according to <hi>civil and Church cuſtom.</hi>" And Chap. ix, Sec. 2. "Ordination is the ſolemn puting a man into his office in the Church, being like inſtalling a magiſtrate in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth." Mr. Hooker ſpeaks the ſame, Preface, page 16.</p>
               <p>Here then, according to the Platform and Mr. Hooker; Ordination is the ſolemn inſtalling the man in his office. And as it is fixing him in office relation
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026757_0017_0FD1C24B5B5C1EB0"/>
to a congregation or flock, it is ſolemnizing the cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant between him and his people by proper au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>This leads to enquire what is proper authority, for ſolemnizing this covenant, according to congregational principles and Church cuſtom.</p>
               <p>The Platform conſiders the power of ordination of their Paſtor to be in the Church; but with this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that the Elders of other Churches may do it, if the Church where the officer is to be ordained deſire it.</p>
               <p>This ſentiment in the Platform is obſcure, and ſeems to favour lay ordination, and is that on which ſome wild, haughty, arrogant, ſupercilious, ſeparately, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent people, have pretended to juſtify lay ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But though there might be ſome degree of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the firſt ſettlers of this country as to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet they are in my opinion, very excuſable, ſeeing they had been ſo oppreſſed, harraſſed and perſecuted with prelatical impoſitions and depoſitions of Paſtors; it would be ſtrange, if not a miracle, if mere men, however wiſe and pious, ſhould not vibrate in ſome degree into the oppoſite extreme; yet Dr. Stiles, who has ſpared no labour and attention to inveſtigate the principles and cuſtoms of theſe Churches ever ſince the firſt ſettlement in this land, ſays, "that he has nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er found with certainty, more than one inſtance of lay ordination of a perſon never before ordained, the laſt century; and this was done by advice, and under the inſpection, of Miniſters ordained by Biſhops in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, one of whom prayed at the ſolemnity of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and all gave their approbation and right hand of fellowſhip, which, in my opinion, ſays this eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026757_0018_0FD1C24C4EDD7B20"/>
hiſtorian, amounts to their performing the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination themſelves, they being preſent and aſſiſting in the tranſaction." (Election Sermon, page 60, 62.)<note n="*" place="bottom">It is worthy to be noticed, that although they a ſhort time entertained a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take about lay ordination; yet at the ſame time held to, and practiſed fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and conſociation of Churches in the puting or conſtituting in office; ſo that even their miſtake makes no precedent for what ſelf ſufficient, ſchiſmatical Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents pretend to make from it, viz. of a right and power to ordain and depoſe of themſelves alone.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctor further obſerves, the time was very ſhort in which this idea prevailed, and providentially brought no miſchief, as the body of the Paſtors had been ordained by Biſhops in England. And ſays, that the ordination of our Clergy is regular and ſcriptural and <hi>may be traced in the line of Preſbyters up to the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Through this miſtake, which thoſe pious <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of this country were, as I have obſerved, drove into; we may candidly and juſtly attribute that obſcurity in the Platform about <hi>ordination</hi> or <hi>inſtallation.</hi> Yet by oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er writings ſoon after, and the cuſtom which uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly prevailed among Congregational Churches profeſſedly on the Platform, it appears that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Platform is; that the power of ordination or inſtallation is in every Congregational Church in ſuch a ſenſe, as that no Biſhop, Prelate or Preſbytery have any right to impoſe a Miniſter upon them: but that their Miniſter or Elder, ſhall be ordained or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled by coordinate Elders or Preſbyters in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Churches of their own choice, jointly with their Paſtor elect, who is a party in the ſolemnity. So that here is another <hi>covenant;</hi> for upon Congregational principles every Church tranſaction is, according to covenant or confederation, a voluntary covenant tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026757_0019_0FD1C24DC72E3608"/>
in oppoſition to being forced by ſuperiour power: ſee Mr. Davenport, page 29, and onward. Thus, in ordination or inſtallation of a Paſtor, the Church ſends out, with conſent of the Paſtor elect, to ſuch Churches as they pleaſe, inviting them with their Paſtor and delegates to come and join in Council to ordain or inſtall their Paſtor elect. They come, look into their ſtate and order; their covenant with their Paſtor elect, and his qualifications for the office; and conclude to proceed, or not, as they find circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. If they find all things proper, they proceed; and in the moſt public and ſolemn manner, ordain and ſolemnize the covenant between Paſtor and People. And there covenant with both Paſtor and people, in that relation to each other, by the RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP.</p>
               <p>Here is the moſt public, ſolemn, religious cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and combination of fellowſhip, union and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procity, conſociating for mutual help, one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>Here is covenant upon covenant, one covenant ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing and ratifying another; the ſtrongeſt, moſt ſolemn and ſacred combination, profeſſedly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized, even as an oath before God, Angels and Men, as witneſſes to the confederation.</p>
               <p>That what I have ſaid, is the true intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Platform, though but obſcurely hinted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is evident; ſince the Synod in 1662, about 14 years after, in which muſt doubtleſs be moſt of the ſame members, who compoſed the Platform; in their reſult aſſert the communion, fellowſhip and conſociation of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026757_0020_0FD1C24F428B8510"/>
Churches; and that the ordination, tranſlation and depoſition of Elders are important things to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the conſociation of Churches.</p>
               <p>And this is of the more authority not only, as there were the ſame men to explain their meaning in the Platform: but it ſhews the ſenſe of both Church and State at that time; as this Synod was convened by the order of the General Court to anſwer certain queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, one of which was, <hi>"Whether, according to the word of God, there ought to be a conſociation of Churches; and what ſhould be the manner of it."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They anſwer that there ought to be a conſociation of Churches; and propoſe about the ſame which is now partly practiſed in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> viz. thoſe who live in a convenient vicinity to conſociate; though with liberty reſerved, without offence, to make uſe of others. They aſſert, that "there hath conſtantly been in theſe Churches a profeſſion of communion, in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the right hand of fellowſhip at the gathering of a Church and ordination of Elders, which importeth a conſociation, and obligeth to the practice of it." Here is the higheſt evidence of there being a <hi>conſtant</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of communion in theſe Churches from the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> in giving the right hand of fellowſhip at the gathering of Churches and ordination of Elders; for this was but about 41 years after the firſt arrival at Plymouth, and there cannot be a doubt but that there were many men in this Synod who had been eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes all that time of the things they aſſerted: there is alſo the witneſs of the General Court of the ſame thing in their approbation and acceptance of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult; which two bodies of men, ſo venerable, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026757_0021_0FD1C2589D1ACE40"/>
and reſpectable, is ſuch ſuperlative evidence of the order and fellowſhip of Congregational Churches in this country from the beginning, as ought to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and ſhame all thoſe ſchiſmatics who arrogantly and inſolently pretend to patronize their diſorderly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent ſentiments and conduct by the Platform.</p>
               <p>Dr. Increaſe Mather, who was on the ſtage when that reſult was made, in his Teſtimony, in 1720, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that agreeable to that reſult, there was a law of the Colony which required the approbation of three or four Churches to every ordination: ſo that we have it from the higheſt authority or evidence, that the ſenſe and practice of theſe Churches from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was, that ordination, tranſlation, and depoſition of Elders ſhould be by communion, fellowſhip, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation of Churches. And it alſo appears that both Church and State ſoon after the Platform was made, were ſo far from that <hi>independent,</hi> ſchiſmatical, deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſentiment, which ſome of late a vow, that every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual congregation hath <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> alone to call and put into office and diſmiſs from, and put out of office; that they made both a reſult of Synod and law of the State againſt it. But though they ſuppoſed the forming into particular conſociations proper; yet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the whole body of Congregational Churches one general conſociation, out of which they might chooſe and employ ſuch as occaſion called; this practice has uniformly prevailed, by which it is become a Church <hi>cuſtom,</hi> and, according to the Platform, is as binding as any thing can be. Hence the forming into partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular local conſociations has never prevailed in Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts or Newhampſhire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:026757_0022_0FD1C25A90F51850"/>You may perhaps conclude that I have brought in witneſſes enough already againſt thoſe ſchiſmatical, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent Independents, who do not bluſh to challenge the pious founders of Congregationaliſm to be for them. Doubtleſs when ſuch an auguſt body of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that venerable Synod of Divines, and that hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable aſſembly of Politicians are brought in againſt thoſe inſolent uſurpers, it is deſervedly enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them to perpetual baniſhment.</p>
               <p>But witneſſes throng in before me, as if eager to caſt in their weight againſt thoſe defamers of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and principles of thoſe pious fathers and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Congregationaliſm.</p>
               <p>Dr. Cotton Mather, in his <hi>Ratio Diſciplinae,</hi> aſſerts, that the manner and cuſtom of ſolemnizing the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a Paſtor is by inviting in a Council of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Churches and proceeding as above deſcribed. And this account which he gives, you will allow to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtibly true, ſince there is an atteſtation, to the truth of his account of the diſcipline of New-England Churches, by his father, Dr. Increaſe Mather; who according as he aſſerts his age, at the time of ſigning his atteſtation, was ten years old when the Platform was made, and had been above ſeventy years an eye witneſs of the practice of the Churches upon it from the beginning. And it is well known that he was a man of unqueſtionable probity, great learning, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal knowledge, uncommon obſervation and accuracy. And he, in the ſame atteſtation, aſſerts in behalf of New-England Churches, that they diſliked and diſclaimed the name <hi>Independent:</hi> And that the reaſon that name was impoſed upon them was, becauſe
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026757_0023_0FD1C25C16EEC5F8"/>
they diſowned a dependence on ſuperiour eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power on earth, from which to derive their forms and officers: But ſays, they revere Synods and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Councils. He alſo in the ſame atteſtation ſpeaks of Mr. Hooker's <hi>Survey of Church Diſcipline;</hi> as being eſteemed a moſt accurate logical compoſure; as unanſwerable; had the approbation of all the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters that were then in that, and the next colony, (i. e.) Connecticut and Maſſachuſetts Bay colonies. The ſame Mr. Hooker ſays, the Dr. "has leave to profeſs, that all or nearly all the Elders of thoſe colonies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of what he had written, under their hands, and, by their deſire in a common meeting, of his publiſhing it." From which writers, we have ample evidence, what the general ſenſe and practice of the Miniſters and Churches were, before and at the time of making the Platform; and ſince for ſeventy years, which brings it to the time of many perſons now living.</p>
               <p>Another witneſs againſt Independents, that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a Paſtor is a covenant, and aſſerting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation of Churches, is Dr. Samuel Mather, who in his Apology, ſays, <hi>"That our platform of Church diſcipline is deemed a Covenant."</hi> And for the proof of this, he obſerves, that the platform was compoſed by theſe churches in a body repreſentative. And further to eſtabliſh this idea, he notices the unanimous vote of the Synod in 1679, approving of the Platform for the ſubſtance of it, deſiring that the Churches might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtedfaſt in the order of the Goſpel according to what is therein held forth, from the word of God.' The Dr. here obſerves, that the original compilers of the Platform, as well as this Synod; reſerved an entire
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:026757_0024_0FD1C25DB460D810"/>
and perpetual liberty in their covenant and combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſearch the Scriptures and go according to them; that, doing thus, they were ſtill within this Conſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Covenant, and fully kept it. He further argues, "that it is to be deemed a covenant from the Synods and Councils which have met by virtue of it; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a conſtant fellowſhip, in many federal overt acts; and ſo have tranſmitted this covenant they made to ſucceeding generations, in gathering new churches, and ordaining Paſtors from time to time; theſe churches, he ſays, have ſo often renewed their original pact or cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant.</p>
               <p>You will readily ſee from what has been offered from the writings and practice of Congregationaliſts, why they ſo much diſliked <hi>Independents.</hi> All men of principle muſt deteſt them, they are properly a peſt to ſociety, while they hold themſelves at a looſe from check or control; but Congregationaliſm is all by covenants, holding themſelves under the ſtrongeſt ties, the moſt ſacred obligations: the whole ſcheme of church order and diſcipline, is by covenants, by which the parties confederate together in the moſt ſolemn mutual engagement; in which are many covenants blended together, viz. The Church Covenant, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or connecting an individual Church; which is blended with the Conſociating Covenant that combines the Churches together; and here is the Paſtor's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with his people, both eccleſiaſtical and parochial, blended with the Church and Conſociating Covenant by the manner of ordaining or inſtalling him in office by the Fellowſhip of Churches. All which if it were only merely lawful thus to unite, without its being any
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026757_0025_0FD1C25F02351428"/>
duty thus to combine, would be of the nature of a <hi>vow;</hi> and could not be violated in any branch thereof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being highly diſpleaſing to God. Eccle. v. 4. <hi>When thou voweſt a vow vnto God defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleaſure in fools.</hi> Hence for any people after they have choſen and inſtalled a miniſter; if they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conceive a notion that he is weak or not ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite or popular a ſpeaker as they wiſh for, or whatever; if it be not a real crime that he is guilty of; for the people to raiſe a cry againſt him to turn him away; is at leaſt, <hi>after vows to make enquiry,</hi> as in Prov. xx. 25, or, <hi>Saying before the Angel it was an error,</hi> Eccle. v. 4, that they have made a fooliſh choice and covenant. This neither the law of God or man admits of, that men ſhould avail themſelves of their own blunders, or to <hi>ſtuliify</hi> themſelves; for God has ſaid, in this very caſe, he <hi>hath no pleaſure in fools,</hi> but is angry with them <hi>to deſtroy the work of their hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſcriptures are very full and frequent in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the violating of covenants; covenant break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are repeatedly reckoned in ſcripture, in the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt catalogue of criminals, and God often threatened and puniſhed covenant breakers in the ſevereſt manner. Thus the <hi>covenant</hi> which <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the princes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael made with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> though it was obtained by colluſion, and they were not the people they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they were, yet, God would not ſuffer that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be broken with impunity. You recollect how God afflicted the whole nation of Iſrael for <hi>Saul's</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating this Covenant with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> many gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations after it was made; and how <hi>Saul's</hi> poſterity of the third generation had to ſuffer even a violent igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026757_0026_0FD1C2675208D628"/>
death for his breaking this Covenant; this ſhews how greatly God abhors Covenant breakers; and will not forget their perfidy; they entail curſes on their poſterity.</p>
               <p>This affair of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and God's dealings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting it, ſhews the abſurdity of their notion, who pretend that anceſtors have no right to make cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants binding on their poſterity, that parents cannot make covenants to affect or bind their children, that rulers cannot make covenants to affect or bind their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And, in a word, argue that no one can be obligated only by his own perſonal act: Such very highly and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly impeach the divine conduct in the affair of the <hi>Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For there was a covenant made by <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the princes of the congregation, with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> which God held ſacred above four hundred years after, and puniſhed all Iſrael with famine three years ſucceſſively for <hi>Saul's</hi> breaking this Covenant. And finally <hi>Saul's</hi> children and grandchildren many of them muſt die for it, and then God was entreated for the land.</p>
               <p>Covenant breakers of all kinds; and eſpecially thoſe who break this ſacred complex Covenant of which I am treating, in any branch of it, either with individuals in the ſame Church, by ſeparating, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; or with their Miniſter, by forſaking of him, or by violently turning him away; or with other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, by breaking fellowſhip with them; they would do well to conſider what an accumulated ſcene of wrath and curſes from the Almighty they are treaſuring up for themſelves and poſterity.</p>
               <p>Inſtances of God's threatening and puniſhing cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant breakers are numerous. You remember how
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026757_0027_0FD1C26AC19B6080"/>
God threatened and puniſhed <hi>Sennacharib</hi> for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy in breaking Covenant with <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> The Angel of the Lord deſtroyed an hundred and eighty five thouſand of his army in one night, and wholly broke it up: he went home and there was treacherouſly and paricidiouſly aſſaſſinated when at his devotion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zedekiah</hi> is another inſtance of God's threatening and puniſhing perfidy; when he had ſworn fealty to the King of Babylon, ſent to Egypt for help againſt the king he had ſworn to. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, ſurely in the place where the King dwelleth, who made him King, whoſe oath he deſpiſed, and whoſe Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he broke, even with him in the midſt of Babylon he ſhall die.</hi> Ezek. xvii. 16.</p>
               <p>I need not multiply inſtances; you well remember, that God ſays, <hi>Though it be but a man's Covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man diſannulleth, or addeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when it is conſidered that theſe Covenants of which I am treating are not merely man's Covenants, but are God's Covenants, what he has inſtituted for us to obſerve; and that his dealings with man are feder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; even in innocency it was a Covenant; and the ſcheme of reſtoration by <hi>grace,</hi> is a Covenant with Chriſt, and through him with all believers, has given him for a Covenant of the people; and has ſet us ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ordinances to perform, commanding us to do them. And when Chriſt, who is the Covenant of the people, in his laſt prayer, prayed for their unity, and, by his Apoſtle, aſſerted, that his Church is one, as the natural body, all the members caring one for another. This Church combination, will appear to be, not merely a
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026757_0028_0FD1C26BCFCBC708"/>
man's Covenant; and not only a perſonal covenanting one with another; but a Covenant with God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him, and is the ſtrongeſt obligation upon every one of the members, bound by ſo many ſacred Covenants, that whoever preſumes to violate this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated confederation, they make ſuch a wound, frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or diſlocation in the body of Chriſt, as they can never anſwer before him, who has declared, that, <hi>Who ſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the ſea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if offending the leaſt member deſerves ſuch a heavy doom; what ſhall they deſerve who offend and wound the whole body; therein trampling on the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law; and violating their own moſt ſolemn and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred vows and covenant perſonal obligations.</p>
               <p>By this view of the matter may be ſeen, in the moſt ſtriking light, why Mr. Hooker, the Platform, and other venerable writers, were ſo decidedly againſt ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arations from the Church, and other ſchiſmatical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; even though there are ſome things amiſs which ought to be healed. And thoſe who are ſenſible of the diſeaſe ſhould be in the uſe of ſuch means as Chriſt inſtituted for healing; and not rend away, wounding and diſmembering the body.</p>
               <p>If thoſe that deſpiſed human temporal Covenants were ſubjected to ſuch a heavy doom, as Saul, Sennacherib and Zedekiah were; of how much ſorer puniſhments ſhall they be thought worthy who tread under foot ſo many ſacred Covenants with God, Jeſus Chriſt, and one another.</p>

               <p>A CHURCH formed and organized as I have ſaid, is fitted to execute all thoſe laws and ordinances they confederate for.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things which are merely official, ſuch as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing the word and ordinances, leading and ruling the Church; are peculiarly and ſolely the province of the Paſtor, therefore do not ſtrictly come under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enquiry about the <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of the Church. But there is a <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of a Church thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized to exerciſe DISCIPLINE; they all covenant to watch over each other, not for their halting, but for their good; that if any one falls, the other may help him up; if any one goes aſtray, i. e. does any thing contrary to any divine rule; to uſe ſuch means as Chriſt has inſtituted to recover him. Hence, the Platform repeatedly aſſerts, that it is to be done to ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IFICATION. In the 1ſt, Chap. Sec. 4th, ſays, with reſpect to the <hi>end,</hi> muſt be done to <hi>edification.</hi> Again in the ſame Sec. "Muſt be done in ſuch a manner as is moſt expedient for edification; ſo that the end in view, or object to be obtained in Church diſcipline, and the manner of obtaining it, muſt be for <hi>edification.</hi> Or, as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>by love to ſerve one another.</hi> And the Platform in Chap. xiv. repeatedly aſſerts, that the object of Church diſcipline is, to recover and gain a lapſed member.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:026757_0030_0FD1C26F15684538"/>In this every member has a <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power;</hi> and, it may be added, is under obligation, by the laws of God, and by his own Covenant, to tell his <hi>brother his fault,</hi> privately; and endeavour to recover him; and if he hear thee thou haſt gained thy brother. If he will not, then to take one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every word may be eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>But, if he neglect to hear them, tell it to the Church, Mat. xviii. This is plain, ſimple, and eaſy to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; and is directed to by the Platform, Chap. x. Sec. v. yet has of latter years ſeldom been prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed.</p>
               <p>Many abſurd notions, and wicked practices have been advanced to evade, and avoid this plain ſimple law of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the ſole King and Law-giver of his Church. Some have in earneſt pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this law of Chriſt reſpected only private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal offences, known only to the offender, and one individual offended. But it is plain this cannot be any thing intended; for no WORD is to be advanced to the Church, but what may be eſtabliſhed by the mouth of two or three witneſſes.</p>
               <p>To ſupply the want of witneſſes they will obliquely charge the Perſon with ſomething, and demand of him whether it is not ſo? We underſtand you did, or ſaid— You know whether you ſaid ſo! Or, you muſt be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that you * * * *. You ought to own the truth: DID NOT YOU SAY SO? If he will not deny it, he is to be deemed guilty; or, however, if he declines own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or denying of it; he is condemned as criminally obſtinate. All ſuch kind of procedures, you will join
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026757_0031_0FD1C277E0879F18"/>
with me in ſaying, are horridly wicked practices; have for their precedent the <hi>Papal Inquiſition;</hi> and that it is a real virtue in any one not to anſwer ſuch queſtions; becauſe it is following the example of Chriſt, when he in like manner, was accuſed and interrogated; and it ought to be remembered that, that great example of the world, and eſpecially of all chriſtians, never did give a direct anſwer to any captious queſtion, in all we have recorded of him. And the conduct of Chriſt when he was under trial ſhew that he infinitely abhors ſuch a practice; that therefore he was infinitely far from intending any ſuch thing, in his Law in Matth. 13th. And as all ſuch or ſimilar practices are not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of Chriſt, but are contrary to human rights, as have long been adopted and eſtabliſhed in the Engliſh nation, and particularly and expreſsly by the American States; <hi>that no man ſhall be compelled to accuſe or excuſe himſelf, or produce witneſſes againſt himſelf.</hi> Therefore ſuch practiſe is an inſult upon, if not treaſon againſt the conſtitution and laws of both God and man.</p>
               <p>Another wicked practice to avoid this divine law of the Supreme Majeſty of heaven and earth, is, the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting in companies either with or without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who is the object of their enquiry, to confer with him, or with one onother, to be agreed how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with a brother, or Paſtor: if it is the Paſtor; a very proper preparatory for ſuch meeting is, to collect in companies on Sabbath-noons, and ſome of the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church members find fault with his preaching, and one tells one thing, another another thing, and many of the things ſo long ago that if they are true, muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be in a great meaſure, if not wholly forgot.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026757_0032_0FD1C27A14F12138"/>
Or however or whatever the particulars are, they are <hi>talking againſt him by the walls, and in the doors of the houſe,</hi> as the people did againſt Ezekiel;<note n="*" place="bottom">This is an <hi>ungodly digging up evil with burning fire in their lips. Like the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing devices as againſt</hi> Jeremiah, ſmiting with the tongue, defaming on every ſide; report ſay they, and we will report it. Prov. xvi. 27. and Jer. xviii. 18. and xx. 10.</note> and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time they are prepared to have a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral collection or meeting, and require the object of their inquiſitions to be with them. Such kind of meetings whatever they may call them, are unlawful aſſemblies, they are riots both as to Church and State, being expreſsly repugnant to the conſtitution, laws and rules of both. Mr. Hooker ſays, <hi>"Such a company wants precept or example."</hi> He means examples to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it. For as to examples of people meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in an unlawful, riotous manner, there are a multitude of them recorded in Scripture. Thus the people gathered together againſt Moſes and Aaron, againſt David, and many of the Prophets; thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, Stephen and many of the Apoſtles: The collection againſt the Apoſtle Paul, at Epheſus, was an eminent pattern for all ſuch kind of meetings.</p>
               <p>But for any Church of Chriſt, or company of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to pretend to meet as a Church of Chriſt, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into matters of complaint againſt any of its members; without matters properly ſtated, and the accuſed's being privately and previouſly informed of what they have againſt him, according to the law, in the xviii th of Matth. and to pretend to proceed to act upon matters of complaint thus; is a high, and (when objected to by any of its members) is an audacious profanation of the name, and inſult of the majeſty of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:026757_0033_0FD1C27B92FDD8D0"/>
the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And it is no leſs an inſult of the conſtitution of Maſſachuſetts, which expreſsly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides that <hi>"No ſubject ſhall be held to anſwer for any crime or offence, until the ſame is fully and plainly, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially and formally, deſcribed to him." Declaration of Rights,</hi> Art. xii. Hence if any Church Member in Maſſachuſetts be arraigned before a Church, to anſwer to any matters not introduced according to the 18th of Matth. and ſaid Declaration of Rights, he has full <hi>right,</hi> according to the Platform, to deny their juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and avoid their action: for that aſſerts, that as to the <hi>manner</hi> of Church proceedings, it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Civil and Church <hi>cuſtom.</hi> The Bible, the Platform, the Conſtitution therefore, are all againſt them; and if they pretend to proceed in that manner it is no better than riotous conduct, and void by all the rules and order of proceedings in both Church and State.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hooker in his Survey, ſpeaking of Church procedings in diſcipline, ſays, "Common human infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities muſt not be made crimes of. If the matter be doubtful, and yet ſo much ground that we think we cannot be clear without rebuking him; ſearch into the matter; for it is a ſafe rule when there is not ground of conviction, not to cenſure. If there is ground of conviction, then proceed according to the rule in the 18th of Matthew. He ſays, if theſe things were well attended; thoſe miſtakes, claſhings, ſayings, gainſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the many offences committed among breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, while they come to reform an offence given, would eaſily be prevented through the help and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt; if the party that comes to rebuke would be ſure,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:026757_0034_0FD1C27D0783D7E8"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the ſin was committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he hath evidence, that ſuch a broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er committed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> That ſuch a <hi>rule</hi> is fair and full to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of ſuch a ſin.</p>
               <p>The Majeſty of Chriſt's Ordinance would appear with much evidence; and with much eaſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort on all hands; in all the degrees of it; in private, before <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> or before the Church."</p>
               <p>He further ſays, "The preparation of the action lies in two things.</p>
               <p>The Cauſe muſt be examined preſently.</p>
               <p>The Examination recorded exactly.</p>
               <p>HE THAT COMPLAINS MUST KNOW TWO RULES.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He muſt not dare complain, <hi>unleſs he can plainly and peremptorily lay in his accuſation of another, touching ſuch ſpeeches and carriages.</hi> I ſay, <hi>peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſe.</hi> Becauſe I would prevent ſuch weak and windy kind of expreſſions, as too often we meet with. <hi>I take it ſo: I conceive it ſo: It was ſo reported: I met with it in that manner.</hi>"</p>
               <p>If Mr. Hooker was againſt ſuch weak and windy accuſations or witneſſing; moſt certainly he would be againſt ſuch a wicked and abuſive accuſation or witneſſing as the following: <hi>There is a gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al uneaſineſs: It is in every body's mouth: We really believe he is a bad man: He muſt be caſt out: Away with him.</hi> By ſuch kind of witneſſing or rather clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, the virtuous <hi>Naboth,</hi> and the Holy <hi>Jeſus</hi> loſt their lives. Of Naboth they ſaid, <hi>He blaſphemed God and the King,</hi> but told no fact or words of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: For they knew he had uſed none.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:026757_0035_0FD1C27ECD512A18"/>So as to Chriſt: <hi>Away with him: Crucify him.</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſaid, what evil hath he done? They would not riſque the iſſue upon FACTS: but ſay, <hi>If he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him unto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All ſuch kind of accuſations, witneſſing, or clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, where <hi>facts</hi> are not clearly ſtated and proved, are falſe and wicked; and will moſt certainly be rejected and deteſted by all rational judicious people.</p>
               <p>We will hear further from Mr. Hooker, he ſays, "<hi>Secondly,</hi> as his (i. e. the complainer's) accuſation muſt be plain; <hi>ſo his proofs muſt be direct and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> that ſuch words for the ſubſtance and reality of them were ſpoken, and ſuch things done.

               </p>
               <p>ON THE ELDERS' PART TWO RULES, if attended to, make great riddance of occaſions, and prevent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, let the accuſation be preſently and exactly record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> together with the anſwer thereto, in like manner; for experience teacheth, that in a multiplicity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, parties are apt to forget, or elſe not willing to remember; and ſome ready to miſtake, add, alter, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in expreſſion as they ſee there may be an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage come to their own, or diſadvantage to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Let the Elders confine all parties to the point in hand,</hi> and not ſuffer them by extravagancies to darken the truth."</p>
               <p>Speaking of Church cenſures, he ſays "It muſt not be for ſmall petty aberrations; but ſuch as are abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; carry the face of evil in their forehead, upon the firſt well grounded conſideration of reaſon; pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly and obſtinately perſiſted in."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:026757_0036_0FD1C2801F0836C0"/>From what has been extracted from Mr. Hooker, it appears, that the only proper ſeaſon of complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of an offending member, is immediately. Mr. Hooker ſays, <hi>preſently.</hi> This in every view is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; not only that it be done, while things are freſh in the mind, ſo as that truth may be inveſtigated; but to ſuffer ſin long on a fellow member, they make themſelves tranſgreſſors; and to rake up old things, or pretend matters of long ſtanding, when things muſt in a great meaſure be forgot; muſt have all the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of falſehood and ought to be treated as ſlander.</p>
               <p>The Civil law provides that actions of treſpaſs ſhall be outlawed in a ſhort term of years; with proper ſavings, where inevitable neceſſity prevents bringing the action within the general limitation. And the Platform ſays, that Church matters ſhould be conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to <hi>civil cuſtom.</hi> And Chriſt has limited actions of traſpaſs in his Kingdom even ſhorter than any civil State, Luke xvii. 3, 4. <hi>Take heed to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; if thy brother treſpaſs againſt thee rebuke him; and if he repent forgive him. And if he traſpaſs againſt thee ſeven times in a day; and ſeven times in a day turn again unto thee ſaying, I repent; thou ſhalt forgive him.</hi> All this proves in the moſt decided manner that Chriſt's Law is, that the accuſation ſhall be made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. <hi>Take heed to yourſelves; if thy brother treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, thou ſhall rebuke him.</hi> As much as to ſay, if you neglect rebuking of him you make his ſin your own. Therefore <hi>take heed to yourſelves,</hi> that you do not make his ſin your own: his ſpeaking in the next verſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times in a day, proves that he means it ſhould be done immediately; elſe, there could not be ſo many times in a day. He does not ſet any particular length
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:026757_0037_0FD1C281AA21C440"/>
of time; the caſe may be ſuch that it cannot be done inſtantly after the fault is committed; the perſon may not be in a proper temper of mind to admit a rebuke; or ſome other circumſtances. But, it is a plain law that it ſhall be done as ſoon as circumſtances and the nature of things will admit of it; or it is outlawed in his Kingdom; the perſon has fixed the ſin on himſelf, and if he brings an accuſation againſt his brother af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, it is ſlander. All this perfectly agrees with Mr. Hooker, where he ſays, "It muſt be done PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENTLY."</p>
               <p>You will alſo readily ſee by what I have entertained you with, from that great divine and politician Mr. Hooker; the ſame which I have ſaid before: That the only proper or legal way of introducing accuſations into the Church and conducting them therein, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the xviiith of Matthew. Firſt privately tell the offender, or ſuppoſed offender, his <hi>fault:</hi> This can be no other than, to point out to him the <hi>fact</hi> he has done, and the divine <hi>law</hi> or <hi>rule</hi> he has thereby violated. And this Mr. Hooker has proved, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable reaſons, ſhould be done in writing. This muſt be attended to in the next trial before one or two; alſo before the Church; and this is the moſt peaceable and likely way to recover a lapſed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and to maintain order and peace in the whole Church.</p>
               <p>In this way, the perſon is privately and previouſly certified what he has to anſwer to, as I before ſhewed, that the Bible, Platform and Conſtitution; or rights of mankind require.</p>
               <p>Although different <hi>faults</hi> require different Church animadverſions; as hereſy is to have a firſt and ſecond
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:026757_0038_0FD1C289C2E4E3F8"/>
admonition before rejection: But moral ſcandal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires immediate rejection; yet there is but one way to introduce all matters of offence for trial into the Church, viz. as above ſtated from the Bible and the rights of mankind.</p>
               <p>And if any Church pretends or preſumes to act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a caſe, any other way introduced; and eſpecially when that is claimed by the party accuſed; they act out of character, and it invalidates all their procedings therein; and though they may have <hi>power</hi> to paſs votes and condemn a member; yet they have no <hi>right</hi> to do ſo any more than a civil Court have <hi>right</hi> to arreſt a man contrary to the Conſtitution and law; which if any Judges of court ſhould preſume to do, their being judges would not legitimate their conduct; any more than if any other men ſhould ſet up a mock court and trial and condemn a man: but it would be much worſe for judges to do thus, as they thereby vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate their truſt, and inſult that authority which had thus dignified them. And it is ſtill as much more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous for a Church of Chriſt to preſume to go on ſo, in a pretended trial contrary to his law; as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning Divine Authority, and violating their own moſt ſolemn vows and engagements.</p>

               <p>A CONGREGATIONAL Church, organized as I have ſaid, and regularly aſſembled with a cauſe before them, introduced according to Chriſt's law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the preſidency of their paſtor, have both <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> to proceed decently and orderly to hear, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, try and finally determine the cauſe; if they can do it to the general ſatisfaction of the whole body. But if there ariſes a difference to that degree they cannot acquieſce; they are then according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the xvth chap. of Acts, to refer it to a Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, or Council of Churches, verſe 2d. <hi>When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paul and Barnabas had no ſmall diſſenſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, ſhould go up to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, unto the Apoſtles and Elders about this queſtion.</hi> Here was a diſſenſion among them, and a mutual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement to refer it to a Council of Apoſtles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at Jeruſalem. It appears that it was a mutual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, becauſe both parties had an equal voice in it. Paul and Barnabas were evidently one party, and they went to this Council; and no doubt thoſe <hi>certain others</hi> who were ſent, were of the other party. Hence therefore, is a Scripture example for a mutual Council, by which is meant mutual in the choice of the parties, or an equal choice in both parties. Not that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Council ſhould come together agreed in ſentiment about the matter in queſtion. Such a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil would not anſwer to the pattern, for there was MUCH DISPUTING in that Council, verſe 7th. Here therefore is a divine rule for all Chriſtian Churches when there is a diviſion and diſſenſion among them.</p>
               <p>And eſpecially Congregational Churches, are under covenant obligation by their Platform, in caſe of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and diſſenſion to refer it to a Council, ſee Chap. xv. Sec. 2. "If a Church be rent with diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, or lie under any open ſcandal, and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:026757_0040_0FD1C28C1A337948"/>
yet refuſe to conſult with other Churches, for healing or removing of the ſame, it is matter of juſt offence, both to the Lord Jeſus and to other Churches."</p>
               <p>Agreeable to what I have now ſaid; you may find that Mr. Hooker, in his <hi>Survey of Church Diſcipline,</hi> Part III. p. 40, ſays, "When evils are preſented to the Church and there is a <hi>mutual and joint concurrence of all;</hi> every particular congregation hath received power from Chriſt to proceed to excommunication without any more ado. But in caſe things prove doubtful and the difference grow wide and great, it is then ſeaſonable to crave the help of neighbouring Churches, that they may ſee the truth cleared, the erring parties may be convinced, the way alſo warranted; <hi>which being done either all will agree; or the major part of the Church hath</hi> POWER <hi>and</hi> RIGHT <hi>to proceed; and the diſſeating part are bound to ſit down ſatisfied therewith.</hi> But in caſe the Council of conſociated Churches ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to withold, <hi>they muſt ſtay their proceedings.</hi>"</p>
               <p>Mr. Hooker here plainly aſſerts a deciſive power in Councils, ſo far, that all parties muſt be guided by their reſult. And his ſentiment herein exactly agrees with the pattern Acts xv. That Council had a right and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to lay a <hi>burden</hi> on the Church, i. e. aſſign them ſomething to obſerve, verſes 28 and 29, and they were under obligation to obſerve and do according to what they directed; for it was an ordinance of Chriſt that his Churches ſhould be thus counſelled and directed by other Churches in Council, and <hi>it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> If, therefore, they neglected or refuſed to obſerve and conform to the reſult, they rebelled againſt Chriſt, the King and reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:026757_0041_0FD1C28D884A92E8"/>But here ſome will ſay, that Council, in Acts, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpired, and could ſay, <hi>it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> what they wrote. I am willing to allow that they were divinely inſpired to ſet an example, for all Chriſtians and Councils, how to inveſtigate the truth, and find out the will of God, viz. by diſputing, by attending to <hi>facts</hi> and comparing them with the Scriptures. This it is evident that Council did. Firſt there was much diſputing, verſe 7. Then Peter, and Paul, and Barnabas gave in their teſtimony; that the HOLY GHOST and God's miracles attended the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, making no difference between them and the circumciſion. Then James ſums up the evidence and compares it with the Scriptures, and obſerves that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the words of the Prophet. From all which they deduce by fair reaſon and argument, that it SEEMED GOOD TO THE HOLY GHOST; and when they had thus argued it out, and proved that it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good to the Holy Ghoſt; it ſeemed good to them too, i. e. according to reaſon. So all religious or ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical deciſions ought to be as fairly argued as that Council did, by comparing <hi>facts</hi> with Scripture, ſo as to appear ACCORDING TO GOD'S WORD AND HUMAN REASON.</p>
               <p>But though it is not to be expected that a Council of uninſpired men, will always proceed ſo impartially, accurately and judiciouſly, in examining evidence; and comparing of <hi>facts</hi> and Scripture, as that Council in the xvth of Acts did; yet they are doubtleſs as likely, and more ſo, to act impartially, accurately and jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iciouſly, than the brethren of a Church heated with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and biaſed with prejudice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:026757_0042_0FD1C28F02E8E750"/>Councils therefore being an ordinance of God, and as likely a way to have diſputes and differences ſettled properly as the imperfection of human affairs admits of; differing parties in Churches are under obligation by the word of God, and human reaſon, to agree and refer their differences to an Eccleſiaſtical Council: as the differing parties in Antioch did, to the Council at Jeruſalem. Who, when the matter was referred to them, had a right to judge, and direct them what to do; or, as they term it, lay a <hi>burden</hi> upon them, which they were under obligation to obſerve and conform to.</p>
               <p>But for a party to go off from the reſult, even if it is the major part; let them call themſelves THE ORIG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INAL CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH; or, THE NEW REFORMED CATHOLIC SOCIETY; or whatever; or if it is nearly every member of the Church againſt their Paſtor; or even the Paſtor and Church againſt a private member; it is diſorderly and ſchiſmatical, reſiſting God's ordinance, in that pattern in Acts, and a violation of their own ſolemn Covenant and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, as Dr. Mather terms it, in many overt acts; eſpecially in their inviting in ſuch Council. And ſuch Church, or part of a Church, are by ſuch conduct out of fellowſhip of all Congregational Churches; and ought to be ſo treated: As they violate the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Churches, and reject their advice, they ought to be rejected by all to whom they ſeek for aſſiſtance; until they comply with the advice given them; or otherwiſe ſettle it to the ſatisfaction of the parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wiſe, in his vindication of New England Churches, ſpeaking of decrees or reſults of Synods or, Councils, aſſerts, "That they are obligatory; elſe it
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:026757_0043_0FD1C29239F032F8"/>
would be fruitleſs to make weariſome journies with great coſt and pains to determine ſuch things as they judge expedient for the Churches well being; if after all it were indifferent whether they were obeyed or not; eſpecially when things are fairly ſettled by joint ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage in Synods: Some ſmall ſet of wiſe men, hold themſelves wiſer than whole Synods; and afterwards of their own heads, in their more private apartments, ſet forward new ſchemes; which is itſelf diſorderly; and a way to keep the Churches conſtantly fluctuating like the ocean; conſidering that, in Synods, all ſorts of perſons have their full liberty in debates and votes, in drawing up their deciſions; it is a bold intruſion, and little better than defying and trampling under foot the unity of the Churches, to run counter with Synodical ſettlements, till they are fairly repealed by the like power which made the ſettlements."</p>

               <p>WHEN it will ſerve a turn and perſons wiſh to avoid a reſult, or part of it, and regard only what their own humour or caprice dictates, you will hear it confidently aſſerted, Councils are only ADVISORY; that they are not binding or deciſive; but all <hi>power</hi> is in the Church.</p>
               <p>But though we allow the executive power is in the Church; yet they have not <hi>right</hi> to exerciſe this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in caſe of diviſion, or reſpecting their Paſtor, unleſs it be agreeable to the advice of Council.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:026757_0044_0FD1C296B6FDF508"/>The Platform in the very beginning of it, fixes as a fundamental maxim of the whole ſtructure of Church order and diſcipline; that, "<hi>In reſpect to the manner; decently and in order, according to the nature of the things themſelves,</hi> AND CIVIL AND CHURCH CUSTOM."</p>
               <p>You will readily grant there is no decency nor order, for Churches to go on and continue in a broil, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and diviſion, without ſeeking help for a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their diviſions or differences; neither that it can be decent or orderly, when they have invited a Council, to ſet their reſult at nought, or to mutilate, mangle or diſtort a reſult to juſt what they pleaſe, or to nothing, or to take part and reject the reſt of it.</p>
               <p>You will alſo grant that this is not according to Church CUSTOM, as we have it from Mr. Hooker, the Platform, the Mathers and other venerable writers.</p>
               <p>And if we examine the matter by Civil CUSTOM we ſhall find it will exactly agree with what Mr. Hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſays about Councils, that the Church muſt proceed or not, according to the advice of Council. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wiſdom and experience of ages, the Supreme Executive in civil policy, is to do the moſt important executive acts <hi>by and with the advice and conſent of Council.</hi> And it would be invalid, and ſuch a high handed uſurpation as would merit an impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and degrading from his office, if he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do ſuch things without, or contrary to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Council. Thus it is with the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, thus with the Preſident of the United States, thus alſo with the Governor of the Commonwealth of Maſſachuſetts. Do our Churches or ſome parties of them claim a more deſpotic power than the King of England, whom they have long ſince dubbed a tyrant.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:026757_0045_0FD1C29A1F036C30"/>
Do they wiſh to be more uncontrolable than Preſident Waſhington, who is ſo univerſally eſteemed one of the firſt characters for probity, wiſdom, impartiality and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity? And why ſhould any of our Churches or parties of them, claim to themſelves an exemption from all check or control, ſo much above the Governor of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts; who cannot appoint and commiſſion a common Juſtice of the Peace; nor iſſue out a death warrant againſt a malefactor, even after he has had a full and fair trial by jury, in a Judicial court, without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and conſent of Council? Yet ſome of our Churches, or parties of Churches, claim an excluſive right and prerogative to appoint and inveſt officers; and to degrade them at pleaſure; and to be accuſers, witneſſes, judges, and executioners; and have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence to claim all this by the Platform; when that, in the very firſt chapter, places the SCRIPTURES and CIVIL and CHURCH CUSTOM as the foundation of the whole ſuperſtructure of Church proceedings and diſcipline; but according to what is already obſerved, the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Church Cuſtom</hi> are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt them.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>prerogative</hi> which they claim, outvies the claims or pretenſions of the deſpots of ancient Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, who had their Counſellors; and even ſhames the puſillanimity of the whore of Babylon who reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over the Kings of the earth; whoſe Executive, the POPE himſelf, with all his infallibility and deſpotiſm, does not preſume or pretend to determine and execute his important Church matters without the <hi>advice</hi> of Council, viz. the CARDINALS in CONCLAVE.</p>
               <p>Well might Dr. Mather ſay, as in his Apology, ſpeaking of the conſociation of Congregational
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:026757_0046_0FD1C29E1FEA5190"/>
Churches, and of ſuch as will not conſociate, "they (i. e. Congregationaliſts) judge it will not be ſafe or prudent for any Chriſtian to commit his ſoul to the direction and conduct of ſuch an independent Church."</p>
               <p>Mr. Wiſe, alſo in his Vindication of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of New England Churches, ſpeaking of regular eſtabliſhments of civil and Church communities, ſays, "for particular ſubjects to break in upon them, is to violate the Law of Nature, and is a high uſurpation upon the firſt grand immunities of mankind, and ſays, ſuch rebels in States, and uſurpers in Churches, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the world.</hi>"</p>
               <p>But here is an outcry about conſcience; that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils muſt not have any deciſive power, control or check upon the Church, for ſay they, that will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon the <hi>conſcience</hi> of the Church!</p>
               <p>This appears to be a partial defiled <hi>conſcience,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is only on one ſide; and does not allow all to have a conſcience. For ſuppoſe a Church have a complaint againſt a member, and the major part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him; a Council comes, and adviſes to take off the cenſure; is the Church's conſcience encroached upon? they ſay it is. I ſay then the conſcience of the minor part is encroached upon by the major part; and have as good a right to challenge exemption from conforming to the major part, as the major part have right to challenge exemption from the determination of the Council.</p>
               <p>Hence this muſt be a partial <hi>conſcience;</hi> monopoliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all conſcience to the party which makes the cry.</p>
               <p>But here again they will ſay, that reſults of Council bind no farther than they are according to the word of God. Upon the ſame ground I demand, are individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:026757_0047_0FD1C29B00E9D748"/>
in a Church bound any further than the doings of a Church are according to the word of God? And another important queſtion ariſes, Who is to be judge, whether the doings of a Council, or a Church, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the word of God? The anſwer muſt be, the party or perſon it reſpects, and who diſlike it; or the objection means nothing, has no force in it. So here is a conſcience which effectually prevents any iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue or ſettlement of differences, throws all into parties, breaks up ſocieties; which I think cannot be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of offence, either toward God, or toward man, but muſt be offenſive to both, therefore muſt be an evil conſcience.</p>
               <p>You may aſk what caſes properly require a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil? I will not be ſo vain as to pretend I can deſcribe all caſes that may ariſe, and which properly require a Council. However, you will readily ſee by what has been adduced from the Scriptures, the Platform, and other approved authors, that, the ſettling and remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Paſtor require Councils.</p>
               <p>Alſo when there is a diviſion in a Church which they cannot reconcile among themſelves. This implies that there muſt be proper eſſays among themſelves for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; therefore, that things ſhould, when the condition and circumſtances of the Church will admit, always be heared and tried in the Church before they are brought to a Council. Here, if the parties agree, and ſend for a mutual Council, there is no difficulty. But if either party refuſes, it is a queſtion of conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable importance, what ſhall be done? The Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form aſſigns the third way of communion; this would anſwer if the Churches would carry it into execution, but through a modeſty in the Churches leſt
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:026757_0048_0FD1C29F891E6190"/>
they ſhould ſeem officious, this has rarely ever been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted. Both Church and State were ſoon ſenſible of the imbecility of this method; therefore, about 14 years after, viz. in 1662, the General Court called a Synod, to anſwer ſome queſtions, one of which was, "Whether, according to the word of God, there ought to be a conſociation of Churches, and what ſhould be the manner of it?"</p>
               <p>The Synod anſwer, that "there hath conſtantly been in theſe Churches a profeſſion of communion in giving the right hand of fellowſhip at the gathering of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and ordination of Elders; which importeth a conſociation, and obligeth to the practice of it."</p>
               <p>They propoſe conſociations of thoſe who live in convenient vicinity; though with liberty reſerved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, to make uſe of others. But conſidering all Congregational Churches as one general conſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, out of which any parties may chooſe at pleaſure; that plan of claſſical or local conſociations never was adopted in Maſſachuſetts; yet, in conformity thereto, moſt of the Miniſters have formed themſelves into aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations. The queſtion therefore returns; what ſhall be done in caſe of difficulty in a Church, and one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty refuſes to join in calling in a Council? It will no doubt be anſwered, if we were formed into conſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according to the propoſal of that Synod, they might apply to the Conſociation and that would be val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id, being eſtabliſhed by both Church and State. But it was equally acknowledged by both Church and State at the ſame time; that all Congregational Churches are one general conſociation. Hence by plain and concluſive reaſon; if one party is obſtinate and will not join in applying to the Conſociation,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:026757_0049_0FD1C2A22E34E738"/>
when the caſe requires it; according to the principles and conſtitution of Congregational Churches; the other party, after having uſed proper means to induce them to it, has a <hi>right</hi> to call in ſuch Churches as they think proper, and it muſt be valid; for every man ought to find his remedy, and not be defeated becauſe his antagoniſt is obſtinate, and the other party is juſtly holden to abide the conſequences; for, in the very formation of a Church they are conſociated, and ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery member is included in the conſociating covenant, and all are bound to conform to conſociation acts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting them; and if they refuſe, they break their covenant, and forfeit their relation, and ought to be conſidered as excommunicates, or <hi>outlaws;</hi> till they will regularly reunite with the Conſociation, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to their decrees; or properly join with the other party, in mutually applying to the Conſociation according to Church uſage or cuſtom.</p>
               <p>But here ſome make a difficulty in what you will ſcarcely think they can make any, viz. about a <hi>Mutual Council.</hi> You will ſcarcely believe this can need any explanation.</p>
               <p>I aſſure you I ſhould not think it needed any; had I not heard ſeveral abſurd and contemptible <hi>aphoriſms,</hi> in earneſt aſſerted, and obſtinately maintained; to ſerve a ſelfiſh, contracted deſign. In which are the following, viz. <hi>A Mutual Council is one choſen by both Parties involving into one Body! Or when one Party</hi> (for certain reaſons) <hi>gives up to, or conſents that the other Party may chooſe all;</hi> this is a Mutual Council. Theſe you will readily conceive are made by the <hi>Party</hi> who know they have numbers ſufficient to ſwallow up the other <hi>Party</hi> and not feel any incumbrance thereby
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:026757_0050_0FD1C2A362DA7858"/>
You will alſo readily ſee that theſe ſchemes are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to any ſuch thing as <hi>Mutual:</hi> where there is but one acting body, there can be no mutual actions of parts or parties, <hi>ſimplicity</hi> and <hi>mutuality</hi> being repugnant to each other.</p>
               <p>But I have heard other ſchemes for a <hi>mutual</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which though not ſo ſelfiſh as the above, yet are a great miſtake, and wholly inconſiſtent with the pattern we have in the 15th Chap. of Acts. The ſcheme is, <hi>for both parties to agree to all the men, ſo as to get a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil all of one mind as much as poſſible.</hi> This certainly is not according to the <hi>pattern,</hi> for there was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting among them. And, in ſuch a Council, all of one mind about a queſtion before them, there is no means to bring the truth to light; and if they happen to be in an error, they are likely to remain ſo. Conſequently where there are differing parties, it appears moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture and reaſon, that each party ſhould equally chooſe; and this is the only way there can be any mutual choice; conſequently <hi>Mutual Council.</hi> But many object againſt this, ſaying the Council come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like two armies. But ſo long as we know that this method is according to Scripture, reaſon, and the moſt likely way to inveſtigate the truth; we need not be terrified by any epithets that may be put upon it.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I NOW give you my thoughts, as to the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of Congregational Churches to diſmiſs or remove their Officers. I ſhall confine myſelf to the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:026757_0051_0FD1C2A92908D260"/>
diſmiſſing of a Paſtor; for other Officers of the Church, even if they have Ruling Elders, are never conſidered as having any official power out of their own Church; or to do any official act. Hence their introduction into office is never taken notice of by other Churches, neither were they conſidered by the Synod in 1662, as being eſſential to the organization of a Church. Moreover, as to any other Officer in the Church beſide the Paſtor; their being in office or out of office does not affect their local ſituation, or temporal circumſtances. But a Paſtor's or Miniſter's local ſituation and condition of life are wholly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by his office. <hi>For the Lord hath ordained, that they who preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel;</hi> even as all other occupations live of their labours, or by their occupations. For Chriſt, when he ſent out his Diſciples, forbade their taking with them of their own eſtate to live upon; either <hi>purſe</hi> or <hi>ſcrip; for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer is worthy of his meat,</hi> and of his wages or hire. Hence, God provided in his law to Iſrael, even that the Prieſthood ſhould be hereditary, with a ſuitable living annexed; ſo that the miniſtering office in his Church might not run out, and be void. For it would be irrational and inconſiſtent with God's creation of man and inſtitutions to him, for any man to undertake a calling which in its own nature would diveſt him of all the ſocial enjoyments, and good things of this life; which God had created for man and conferred upon him. And though God has not made the miniſterial office in the Chriſtian diſpenſation hereditary; yet he has very plainly inſtituted, that a Biſhop ſhould have a family, and ordained that he ſhould live by his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in his office, and lay up for his family, as another
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:026757_0052_0FD1C2AC73F6AC60"/>
man may, by his labour and occupation. All which are abſolutely incompatible with an unſettled life; therefore fully amounts to an inſtitution of God, that a Biſhop's office is for life; indefeaſable, unleſs he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits it by miſdemeanor. Hence the Platform aſſigns <hi>incorrigible offending</hi> as the only ground of removing an Elder from his office. This eſſentially implies that there have been means uſed to reclaim the Elder, for no one can be deemed incorrigible, till means have been uſed to recover or gain him. This muſt be done according to Chriſt's law, as I have before ſhown, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting diſcipline; or it can be no means to recover or gain him. There be thoſe who pretend that theſe private ſteps are not to be uſed with the Paſtor; but no one that ever I heard, did or could aſſign any ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or reaſon why a Paſtor ſhould be deprived of this privilege. Chriſt no where makes any ſuch exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but by the Apoſtle Paul to Timothy, appears rather to ratify it to them, above others, where he ſays; <hi>a gainſt an Elder receive not an accuſation, but before two or three Witneſſes.</hi> This, ſo literally referring to the law in the 18th of Matth. is a plain command or interdiction, againſt calling an Elder in queſtion as faulty, unleſs on the moſt regular proceſs and decided proof according to law.<note n="*" place="bottom">This being ſpoken to Timothy, exactly agrees with what Mr. Davenport ſays, Page 137, that a Church's dealing with their Elder, and queſtioning him muſt do it by the advice, and under the preſidency, of neighbouring Paſtors and to this anſwers the common uſage of Churches having a neighbouring Paſtor motioned for, when a difficulty is with a Miniſter.</note> It is evident by the expreſs letter of the Platform, that a Miniſter ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved for ſome foibles; or as Mr. Hooker calls them <hi>petty aberrations;</hi> nor even if he is overtaken in a real
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:026757_0053_0FD1C2ADC971C150"/>
                  <hi>fault,</hi> ſome violation of a divine rule; unleſs he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue irreclaimable in it. All this muſt be manifeſt, Chap. viii. Sec. 7. Here is a queſtion. To whom is this to be manifeſt? Is it to the accuſers? Why may we not as well ſay it muſt be manifeſt to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed? One party has as good a right to be judges as the other. What is ſaid in the 10th Chap. Sec. 6, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides this; it muſt be manifeſt or evident to the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of other Churches;</hi> who are to <hi>direct to the removal of an incorrigibly offending Elder;</hi> in order that the Church may have <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to diſmiſs or remove him.</p>
               <p>That this is the true intent and meaning of the Platform, as to diſmiſſing an Elder; you will readily allow when you recollect what I before mentioned from Mr. Hooker, where he aſſerts, that a Church muſt proceed or not, according to the advice of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. And you will be further eſtabliſhed in this conſtruction of the Platform, by viewing the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or various other writers both before and ſince the Platform, and the uniform practice of the compil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it, and their ſucceſſors for above an hundred years; in which you will find previous to the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, beſide Mr. Hooker, Mr. Cotton on the Keys: which book it is aſſerted by ancient writers, was uſed as a guide or Platform, by the New England Churches, before the Platform was made. Dr. Increaſe Mather and other Miniſters of Boſton, in their Teſtimony to the order of the Churches, in the year 1720, ſay, that in Mr. Cotton's Book of the Keys he aſſerts, "That it is an ordinance of Chriſt, for particular Churches to join together in a conſociation among themſelves, to adminiſter their Church affairs which are
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:026757_0054_0FD1C2AFC2DD71B8"/>
of <hi>weighty, difficult, and common concernment;</hi> of which kind he reckons <hi>the Election, Ordination or Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of an Elder or any Perſon of public note.</hi>"</p>
               <p>You will be gratified in hearing ſomething from the compoſitions and writings ſince the Platform.</p>
               <p>In this venerable throng, is the Synod in 1662, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 14 years after the Platform) which aſſert the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and importance of Conſociations or Councils, in <hi>matters of more than ordinary importance; as Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Tranſlation, and Depoſition of Elders and ſuch like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is evident that writers both before and ſince the Platform, conſider the relation between Paſtor and People very ſacred, and not to be raſhly and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately diſſolved, even if both ſides were diſpoſed for it, not to be done without the advice or concurrence of a Council of other Churches. Dr. Increaſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and other Miniſters, in their beforementioned Teſtimony, ſay, "That as there is, according to the order and practice of theſe Churches, a Council for the <hi>ordaining a Paſtor;</hi> it ſtands to reaſon that there ſhould as much be requiſite for his removing."</p>
               <p>But there are ſtill more important reaſons thoſe writers allege againſt the diſſolution of the relation between a Paſtor and his People, viz. becauſe they conſider it a Covenant and very ſimilar to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage relation.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot forget Mr. Hooker. He ſays it is of the nature of the marriage relation in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. And Mr. Wiſe, in his Church's Quarrel Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed, compares the relation between Miniſter and People to the marriage relation. His words are. "Huſband and Wife, Paſtor and Church, by our ſort of government, are bound for term of life, or ſo long
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:026757_0055_0FD1C2B1898174D8"/>
as both ſhall live; theſe Churches are ſettled Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational, and by their principles, the <hi>ordination</hi> is, as it were, the nuptials or marriage day of two lovers, that nothing but death, or a bill of divorce (for betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glory of the union) can part." This, as far as I have had opportunity to obſerve, has been the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral notion and ſenſe of people: but however more or leſs general it may have been; yet Mr. Wiſe's ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſervation and compariſon will appear to be juſt, when we conſider, that, upon Congregational principles, the Miniſter's relation to his people is by mutual and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary choice and covenant; and his office relation is blended with his relation as a Brother in the Church, and alſo blended with his local ſituation and living in the world, through the whole of his life; that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be parted: and has therefore nearly all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual indiſſolvable ties that the marriage relation has.</p>
               <p>And when we advert to ſcripture, we ſhall find, that God made it more indiſſolvable than the relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween huſband and wife: for the latter he allowed to be diſſolved becauſe of the hardneſs of their hearts; but the former he made hereditary. Yet this was not ſo, but that for high crimes and miſdemeanors they might be depoſed. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> thruſt out <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ather,</hi> for treaſon. This is the only inſtance we have in the Bible of any Prieſt's being regularly depoſed by lawful authority. And Chriſt, though he reprobat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the practice of their putting away their wives for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very cauſe; yet he allowed that the relation might be diſſolved in caſe of <hi>fornication.</hi> And very ſimilar to that, as if copied in imitation of it, the Platform al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a People to put away their Miniſter, for <hi>incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly offending.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:026757_0056_0FD1C2B6E38D41E0"/>But as the marriage relation is not to be diſſolved by either party, even in caſe of <hi>fornication,</hi> without the decree of divorce by proper authority: So neith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may a Church put away their Miniſter, even in caſe of <hi>incorrigibly offending,</hi> without the <hi>Council of other Churches properly introduced, directing thereto.</hi> When, according to ſuch <hi>direction,</hi> they have both <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to remove him from his office; or put him away.</p>

               <p>IN my laſt letter, I ſaid that <hi>Abiather</hi> was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtance in the Bible, of a Prieſt's being regularly depoſed by lawful authority; which I ſuppoſe you will allow to be true; notwithſtanding Jeroboam when he ſet up his falſe religion, caſt out, and in a ſenſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the Prieſts of the Lord. And his having the major part of Iſrael on his ſide did not ſanctify his conduct herein; but it is always ſpoken of as his ſin.</p>
               <p>But, in the New Teſtament, we read of no Biſhop or Elder's being ſuperſeded or depoſed: Or of their forſaking or leaving their people.</p>
               <p>Yet ſome in our day aſſert, <hi>that a Church may, or have a right to diſmiſs, or turn away their Miniſter, when they pleaſe, with a Council, or without; or contrary to a Council, and it will be valid. Otherwiſe, as the caſe may be, they cannot get rid of a Miniſter when he ought to be diſmiſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="unknown:026757_0057_0FD1C2BA0E054778"/>This ſentiment will juſtify all the villany that can be committed. Upon this doctrine or ſentiment, a man may turn his wiſe out doors, when he pleaſes, and it will be a valid divorce.</p>
               <p>A ruſſian may aſſaſſinate a man when he pleaſes; and it will be a lawful and juſt putting him to death.</p>
               <p>A thief or a robber may take away a man's proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from him when he pleaſes, and it will be a righteous converſion of property.</p>
               <p>For <hi>the caſe may be,</hi> that a woman <hi>ought to be divorced,</hi> a man <hi>ought to die,</hi> a man <hi>ought to have</hi> his dues of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; when neither of theſe things can be obtained in due courſe of law; on this ſentiment, therefore, the woman is not abuſed by her huſband, nor the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed injured by the aſſaſſin, nor the plundered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wronged by the robber: for according to this ſentiment, the huſband, the aſſaſſin, the robber, have a <hi>right</hi> to perform all thoſe acts of violence: and there is no outrage or villany which may not be amply vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by it; and eſpecially all perfidy, breach of faith, and violation of covenants and contracts; for this, which is aſſerted in the very ſentiment itſelf, is a <hi>right</hi> to break the moſt ſolemn, ſacred and complicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed covenants that can poſſibly be made.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of this caſt call themſelves <hi>Independents;</hi> and have the audacity to father their ſentiments on the Platform; when that utterly rejects <hi>Independents.</hi> But let them call themſelves what they will, according to what I have before noticed from the Synod in 1662, and from Dr. Mather, of the determinations of the General Court; and the practice of the Churches from the beginning; theſe <hi>Independents</hi> are OUT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAWS of both Church and State, and they very groſly
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:026757_0058_0FD1C2BB42B7C530"/>
defame the Platform in pretending to father ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents upon it; and they are unſufferably aſſuming and arrogant; for by their pretending to father ſuch ſentiments on the Platform, they no leſs than boldy aſſert that they underſtand it, better than the compil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it, and Miniſters and General Court in the time of it; and for ſome years after, while the compil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it were alive. Such arrogant monopolizers of wiſdom, as Mr. Wiſe ſays, "<hi>Defy and trample under foot the Honour and Authority of the Churches;</hi> and as he ſays in another place, <hi>ſuch Uſurpers in Churches, Affront the World.</hi>" And that the more, when the way they muſt explain or read the Platform to get their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from it, muſt be to read it, as the vain wretch did the Bible, to prove from it, <hi>there is no God;</hi> who reads only theſe words, and aſſerts that it is proved from the Bible there is none. Or as another, to prove that the Bible directed to hearken to bad advice, reads it, <hi>My ſon if ſinners entice thee conſent</hi> THOU. But if they ſhould ſay, theſe are fabulous; they may turn to Mat. iv. 6. and find an example; which you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, they cannot deny, either the authenticity of the example; or the fitneſs of the Author for their pattern. The example is, <hi>It is written he ſhall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up.</hi> Here the words, <hi>To keep in all thy ways;</hi> are omitted in what was pretended to be quoted. So theſe Independents, as they call themſelves, muſt read the Platform to make what they pretend from it. <hi>As the Church had power to call to office, ſo they have power to remove him from his office.</hi> Here, as in the above text of Scripture, an eſſential part is omitted, viz. <hi>The Council of other Churches, where it may be had, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:026757_0059_0FD1C2BD37DDDD58"/>But though the Platform is ſomewhat obſcure as to this matter and many others, and is eaſily accounted for; conſidering they had ſo newly eſcaped the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of Prelacy, and kept their eye ſo intently on that, to guard againſt it, that they did not ſo ſtrongly, in words, guard againſt evils among themſelves. Yet it is evident they were far from practiſing any ſuch things, as the licentious pretended Independents of the preſent day, claim by it. And the Synod in 1662, as I have frequently obſerved, ſet this matter in a clear light; whoſe reſult, is of as much and the ſame author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity with the Platform itſelf, being ſanctioned by both Church and State as much as that, and is as really a part of the Platform of theſe Churches, as the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory Charter by King <hi>George,</hi> was really a part of the Charter of the Maſſachuſetts Bay, as that by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> Or as a codicil to a will, is as real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part of the will as the body of it; and muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, as much as any part of it.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ancient worthies, were not ſo vain and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant as to ſuppoſe they had arrived at the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of wiſdom, when they firſt compoſed the Platform in 1648.</p>
               <p>Again I have ſeen it in writing ſeriouſly aſſerted for a SENTIMENT, <hi>"That, the majority of a people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing their minds againſt their Miniſter, that he ſhould not continue their Miniſter, it ſo vacates his office relation to them, that it is right for any other man to officiate in his place, whether he is willing or not."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſentiment has for its precedent in the Bible, the conduct of Jeroboam and the majority of Iſrael, thruſting out the Prieſts of the Lord, and ſupplying their place with others; which I mentioned to you
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:026757_0060_0FD1C2BE4869E670"/>
before; and you will join with me in ſaying it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not as to its being <hi>right,</hi> whether thoſe that are introduced to ſupply, <hi>are of the loweſt of the people;</hi> or thoſe that eſteem themſelves the <hi>higheſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This SENTIMENT alſo cenſures the conduct of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> that they did not leave the people and give place to <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> when the major part of the people had ſo expreſsly decided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> the ſervant of the Lord, and <hi>Aaron</hi> his Prieſt. For according to this ſentiment, it was right for <hi>Korah,</hi> to aſſume and occupy the Prieſt's Office inſtead of <hi>Aaron,</hi> when the majority of the people were ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidedly for it. And it alſo impeaches the divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the miraculous fire, and chaſm in the earth, which deſtroyed them and their aſſociates; and that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were not rather the victims of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance for their obſtinacy and impiety in not being willing immediately to give place to them, when the majority of the people had ſo expreſsly decided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their continuing in office: For <hi>Vox populi, vox eſt Dei;</hi> Et, <hi>Voluntas populi Suprema eſt lex.</hi> Theſe are fundamental maxims: yet the Declaration of Rights in Maſſachuſetts Conſtitution of Government, has the audacity to claim that it ſhall be a <hi>Government of Laws, and not of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The above ſentiment is no doubt founded on a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken notion many people imbibe and obſtinately hold, as to the temporary miſſion of Chriſt to the twelve; when he ſent them to preach <hi>the kingdom of Heaven is at hand,</hi> to work miracles, &amp;c. He tells them whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall not <hi>receive you,</hi> &amp;c. when ye depart out of that houſe or city, <hi>ſhake off the duſt off your feet,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:026757_0061_0FD1C2C014E9C280"/>
and in the ſame miſſion he tells them, if they <hi>perſecute you in one city, flee to another.</hi> This direction of Chriſt to his Diſciples in this ſhort temporal itinerant miſſion, they obſtinately hold and urge is a direction to ſettled Miniſters. But it cannot be any thing to them; for as to them, the people have received them; and if they ſtart off and flee, when difficulties, or ſome diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things ariſe, they prove themſelves not to be true Miniſters of Chriſt, or Paſtors of his flock; but <hi>hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> who flee when they ſee the wolf come or coming.</p>
               <p>This direction therefore of Chriſt to his Diſciples, in that miſſion to paſs from one place to another, can be no direction to ſettled Miniſters; to ſuppoſe it to be a direction to them carries in it a contradiction in terms.</p>
               <p>But the Commiſſion which was to laſt to the end of the world, was, to preach the Goſpel to every Creature; to teach them to obſerve all things whatſoever Chriſt has commanded, which includes all the divine precepts, and to adminiſter his ordinances; all which was at firſt to the Apoſtles, extraordinary Officers from Chriſt, who were to introduce the Goſpel, being accompanied with the power of Miracles. This belonging to their miſſion, it was incompatible with a ſettled life. But after they had planted Churches, they ordained Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, Paſtors, Teachers or Elders, to rule and feed the Church; whoſe office relation was more eſpecially ſtated and local, which is the office now in the Church of Chriſt which is under conſideration.</p>
               <p>This office relation, as you have heard, is blended with ſo many covenant ties, and connected with ſo many conditions and circumſtances of very great mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude and importance; and ſo ratified, eſtabliſhed
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:026757_0062_0FD1C2C21BB41638"/>
and made permanent by God's Word; that it may not be trifled with, or ſlightly diſſolved. Thus Dr. Math<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and other Miniſters of Boſton, in their Teſtimony before mentioned, ſpeaking of the removal of a Paſtor, where the Paſtor himſelf is for parting, ſay, it muſt be proceeded in with great caution, <hi>that it becomes not any Miniſter to ſeek it by offering himſelf to it.</hi> That the reaſons for removal be laid before authentic judges, ſuch as are moſt likely to paſs an impartial judgment upon them, that nothing leſs than a Council of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es may be thoſe judges, and that the reaſons be found ſuch as are conſiſtent with the ſolemn vow he is under.</p>
               <p>In the Preface of ſaid Teſtimony it is ſaid that, about 20 years after the Platform, it was aſſerted and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, that the ordaining, depoſing and tranſlating of a Paſtor ſhould be by common conſent; and that it was ſo in the next ages after the Apoſtles. By this <hi>common conſent,</hi> they mean not only the Paſtor and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but other Churches.</p>
               <p>From all which you will ſee that it is a violation of our Congregational principles, and therefore unlawful, for a Paſtor and people to part, by his motion, or by theirs, or both; or by the people pretending a fault in him; without the advice and concurrence of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. As the Platform makes no proviſion for remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Elder from his office; <hi>but upon incorrigibly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, and the Council of other Churches directing to the diſmiſſion.</hi> All other pretences of diſmiſſion of an Elder are abſolutely unknown by the Platform.</p>
               <p>However I will not pretend to aſſert that there can be no diſſolution of the relation, between Paſtor and People, unleſs by his <hi>incorrigibly offending</hi> and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:026757_0063_0FD1C2C3A0D17188"/>
of Council. There may be by agreement to part, and a Council aſſenting to it, as Dr. Mather and Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of Boſton propoſe; which you recollect; and I will not ſay it is a violation of Congregational princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or unlawful. And there have been inſtances of later years where Councils have adviſed to a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on account of the uneaſineſs of the people; with proviſo for a ſettlement of his contract; ſimilar to Moſes' ſuffering Iſrael to put away their wives becauſe of the hardneſs of their hearts. <hi>But from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was not ſo.</hi> Neither from the beginning of God's inſtituting the Prieſthood; nor from the beginning of ſetting up Congregationaliſm in this country. For as I before ſaid, the Platform knows of no ſuch way of Miniſter and People parting. But though theſe various grounds or occaſions of Paſtor and People's parting, have been tolerated, and may be thought to be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or lawful where it is done by agreement or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all parties, viz. the Paſtor, the People, and the Conſociation, i. e. a Council of Churches. Yet for any Miniſter to break from his People without their conſent, and the advice of Council; or for any people to pretend to diſmiſs or turn away their Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of themſelves at their own pleaſure, and by their own power, is ſuch a breach of faith and infraction on the whole foundation of ſociety as I preſume cannot be found among the moſt ſavage nations; I am very certain the aboriginals of this country would ſcorn ſuch perfidy. And for them to pretend to juſtify it by the Platform, becauſe the Platform poſitively aſſerts and ſcrupulouſly reſerves to Miniſters and People the right of covenanting and contracting, and of holding this right, in oppoſition to prelatical impoſition or deſeaſance;
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:026757_0064_0FD1C2CA577F9C18"/>
and therein ſaying that they have a right to <hi>chooſe</hi> and <hi>refuſe;</hi> that the Churches' having a right to covenant; no power, without their conſent, can diſſolve it. For any to ſay, or pretend to argue, that becauſe a people have a right to make a covenant or contract, they have a right to break it and avoid their obligation at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, without the agreement or conſent of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or a forfeiture on one ſide; is a heinous reproach on the compilers of the Platform, and an affront upon common ſenſe.</p>
               <p>And for any people to turn away or reject their Miniſter when he is old, or by infirmity is paſt, or nearly paſt, his labour; reſembles the practice of thoſe ſavage nations who turn off their parent into the deſerts in their old age, to periſh.</p>
               <p>A reflection on what I have wrote in this and the foregoing letter, I doubt not will induce you to join with me, in ſaying, that the practice which is ſo preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and growing at this day, of Miniſter and People making particular agreements about parting, on any other conditions, or in any other way, than the general plan of the Scriptures and Platform, is very improper, and a great evil. It is unſafe both for Miniſter and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Many people ſeem to be fond of having it expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their ſettling a Miniſter, that he ſhall be diſmiſſed when a major part or a major vote ſhall be againſt him. They muſt allow the ſame to the Miniſter. Such a precarious tenure is no ſettlement either of Miniſter or People, and muſt in its own nature keep Miniſters and People perpetually fluctuating.</p>
               <p>The Miniſter does not ſtand upon <hi>good behaviour,</hi> but upon <hi>pleaſure;</hi> he is therefore under a temptation to be a timeſerver, if he wiſhes to ſtay with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:026757_0065_0FD1C2CCE4B71410"/>
And at the ſame time he is alſo under a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be plotting for a more promiſing and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent place and employment; and prudence and duty will dictate, that he always is looking out and ready for a retreat. And in this caſe, if he has a proper forecaſt, he will ſee that he has a much larger ſalary that he may lay up for old age, or infirmity, when he is near paſt his labour. When it will be almoſt a miracle if the people do not take care to rid themſelves of a burden; when he is ſo old or infirm he cannot ſettle again, or go into any other buſineſs, and muſt loſe the reſt of his time: and if he does not take care of this to have an additional ſalary, it will be his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to avail himſelf of his own liberty to go, and take his day before him. And this precarious ſcheme muſt in its own nature tend to breed jealouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Miniſter and People; and it is inviting to reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, litigious minds, innumerable occaſions to excite a party and diſmiſs a Miniſter in a heat; it may be, in revenge upon the Miniſter, or ſome other perſons in the town or pariſh.</p>
               <p>I have not mentioned all the evils I diſcern in that way; neither do I ſuppoſe I could poſſibly think of all it is expoſed to. I will only add, that it is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what God has eſtabliſhed, as to the religious order of men, that doubtleſs it muſt be expoſed to innumerable evils; the greateſt of which is, it tends to run out the Miniſtry, and all religious order, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſince it is a departure from order and a breach of the Fellowſhip of Churches.</p>

               <p>THEORY, which leads into the principles of any art or ſcience, will leave it ſtill in a great meaſure in obſcurity without experience. Thus you ſee it was with the compilers of the Platform, and other writers of that day, there appears profound theory in their compoſitions; but for want of experience, ſome dark ſayings, which men of corrupt minds wreſt as they do alſo the holy Scriptures: notwithſtanding thoſe wiſe and pious worthies, by practice and experience, ſoon diſcovered and explained them, not only by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar able writers, but by the ſame formality and author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity by which the Platform itſelf was made. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the light which they have offered and left for their ſucceſſors, thoſe who chooſe darkneſs rather than light, who love not the truth, but delight in iniquity; have furniſhed us of the preſent day with many very ſtriking inſtances of the ſubverſion of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Congregationaliſm.</p>
               <p>A few caſes of this kind may reflect ſome light on what I have eſſayed to give you as the theory of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationaliſm.</p>
               <p>Among which caſes you will join with me in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering it as a very dark ſcene in PROVIDENCE, when a People violently break off from their Miniſter; and, becauſe they can have a majority, employ a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, like a young <hi>Korah,</hi> to crowd out their aged Paſtor, whom they ought highly to eſteem, in love, for his work
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:026757_0067_0FD1C2D097A22BC0"/>
ſake; and to venerate as a Father. Yet they load him with calumny, by accuſations to deſtroy his min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſterial character. And like the people running upon <hi>Stephen,</hi> ſtop their ears againſt his repeated and earneſt entreaties to join with him in calling in a Mutual Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. They pretend to diſmiſs him, yet refuſe to give an official copy of their proceedings. To crown their inſults, <hi>a boy</hi> is ſent to inform him they <hi>have no more ſervice for him.</hi> The Paſtor, with a few friends that adhered to him, called in a Council twice, who inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly laboured to bring them to peace, but unſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; they acquit the Paſtor of the accuſations againſt him, and approve of his conduct. But the majority, like the multitude againſt Chriſt, cry out, away with this man and chooſe <hi>Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> So here they choſe another, rather than their ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Reverend Paſtor, to rob him of his people, his Meeting Houſe and his living; and ſend to other Churches, as the people applied to Pilate to aſſiſt and gratify them in their outrage.</p>
               <p>What they will ſtile themſelves, I know not; neith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er do I know of any ONE claſs or denomination they rank with. I will therefore for the preſent, leave them with the ſtile of POLYKAKONONYMOUS.</p>
               <p>There is no pleaſure in relating ſuch <hi>tales.</hi> But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil conduct and conſequences, by the divine direction, are ſometimes to be related for an admonition to thoſe that come after; to the intent they ſhould not luſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evil things.</p>
               <p>A wealthy people who had always been favoured with Miniſters of the moſt reſpectable characters, their Miniſter by age and incidental infirmities became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſupply; they employ a candidate, they invite
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:026757_0068_0FD1C2D1C2A75A10"/>
him to ſettle with them, colleague with their aged Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; he accepts their invitation. But, before ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeveral reſpectable characters in the pariſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſuſpicious of his character; a large and reſpectable Council was invited for ordination, who had ſeveral ſeſſions, and after a long and deliberate hearing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, it was not proper he ſhould be ordained there.</p>
               <p>The major part determined they would have him, in oppoſition to this full, fair and deliberate trial and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of that Mutual Council, the only conſtitutional power to determine it; break off from Congregation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſm, erect themſelves into a ſeparate ſociety by the name of <hi>The New Reformed Catholic Society in</hi>—. Their refuſe condidate joins with them, and they ſend to Churches, and raiſe a <hi>Poſſe</hi> to FOSTER their proceedings and conduct; and thus a venerable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and once happy people, are almoſt deſolate.</p>
               <p>The wiſe Man tells us, the way of the ſtrange wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is variable. You will not wonder therefore that the following caſe differs in many things from thoſe I have related.</p>
               <p>A reſpectable town which had long been noted for union and good order; ſettled a Miniſter in peace. But ſoon there aroſe a diſaffection, and ſome move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt him. <hi>The beginning of ſtrife is as when one letteth out water:</hi> The breach is conſtantly increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So here the contention increaſed till the diſaffected party called in an ex parte Council, who adviſed them to deal with their Paſtor according to the xviiith of Matth. and, if they could not obtain ſatisfaction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to ſeek for a Mutual Council. They execute the proceſs. The Church acquit the Paſtor. The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:026757_0069_0FD1C2D74AAAED30"/>
are not ſatisfied; the Church offer to join in a Mutual Council. But the diſaffected do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to it: they call in their ex parte Council again; who, upon their arrival, expreſs their <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize;</hi> and being ſo ſenſible of their condition, they prudently waved entering into any examination of the <hi>Scripture Authority</hi> of the proceedings of the Church; and RETIRED.</p>
               <p>Both parties then joined and invited a large Mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Council, who came, deliberated on their matters, and reſulted thereon. In which they adviſed the Church <hi>to exerciſe tenderneſs and candour to their Paſtor, and all parties concerned, carefully to guard againſt prejudice and cultivate a ſpirit of Chriſtian love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Within a month after this Mutual Council, a town meeting was called to take meaſures to remove their Miniſter; and to chooſe a committee to ſupply the pulpit with a preacher, and to take care of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe until it can be done. Many of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants proteſted againſt their proceedings.</p>
               <p>They met, and voted they had no further ſervice for their Miniſter.</p>
               <p>About ſix weeks after the above Mutual Council and advice; without any new matter offered to the Paſtor or Church; part of the Church ſend out for a Council. They came, expreſſing their <hi>regret</hi> of a diviſion in the town; they recognize thoſe that are diſaffected with their Miniſter <hi>The Original Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after this, about half the Church form, and ſtile themſelves, <hi>The Original Church, in</hi>—, vote the diſmiſſion of their Miniſter. The town vote it alſo.</p>
               <p>Soon after theſe movements the Paſtor warned a Church meeting. In which meeting, the Paſtor
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:026757_0070_0FD1C2DCF00019E8"/>
and Church mutually agreed to invite in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to look into their ſituation and give their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. They came, attended to their matters, and reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that the Mutual Council, <hi>left the Paſtor and Church in good ſtanding, and that they have done nothing ſince to forfeit their ſtanding, and adviſe to hold on and perſevere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Between the time of ſending for this Council, and their coming; the town ſhut the meeting houſe againſt the Paſtor. And ſoon after ſupply the pulpit with oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er preachers.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, thoſe who conduct thus, are not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationaliſts; they do not act as if they were under any covenant obligation, either to their Paſtor, or to one another; or in any conſociated connexion or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to other Churches; nor under any obligation to their Paſtor or one another to ſeek and conform to conſociated advice and counſel. Certainly they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſidered as Congregationaliſts. Neither can they be called <hi>Independents;</hi> for they ſeek help from other Churches; which is incompatible with Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency.</p>
               <p>But theſe, though they ſeek help; it is not that they hold to any reciprocity of duty or obligation; what they are after is to get their own ends anſwered; but they do not hold themſelves reſponſible, or under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obligation to conform to their advice or determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as you ſee in the caſes.</p>
               <p>You will aſk, if they are neither <hi>Congregationaliſts</hi> nor <hi>Independents.</hi> What are they?</p>
               <p>I anſwer. They are a <hi>mongrel</hi> production between both. And you will recollect that <hi>mongrels</hi> and <hi>muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> and <hi>linſey woolſey,</hi> were forbidden by the divine law; it is ſuppoſed by expoſitors that this law original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had a ſpecial eye to mixtures in religion, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:026757_0071_0FD1C2DFA8DC6360"/>
them; to guard them from admitting any heathen inſtitutions with the ordinances of God. In this view you will grant that law is of as much force now as ever. Hence the Bible is expreſsly againſt them.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe you will not envy any ſet of exiſtences the honour of being the <hi>ſires</hi> or <hi>manufacturers</hi> of ſuch <hi>mongrels</hi> or <hi>linſey woolſey</hi> productions.</p>
               <p>However, though the Bible is againſt them, yet there is a ſampler of them in the Bible; turn to the xviith Chap. 2d Kings. You find that the people who dwelt in the cities of <hi>Samaria</hi> were infeſted with lions; which they attributed to their not knowing the manner of the God of the land; and they got one of the Prieſts of the land to teach them the manner of the God; and he taught them. <hi>Howbeit every nation made Gods of their own. So they feared the Lord and ſerved their own Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will pleaſe to obſerve the analogy. It is thoſe that occupy the place of <hi>Congregationaliſts,</hi> as thoſe of old did the land of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> They meet with difficulty in their religious ſchemes. They ſend for Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaliſts, to teach them the manner of the God, or to put on the maſk. Howbeit they are not Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaliſts after all. They ſtill <hi>ſerve their own Gods.</hi> Serve their own views, without any regard to recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal duty and reſponſibility. The analogy goes through, thoſe of old and theſe now; all agree in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing help as to their difficulties from the Prieſt of the Lord. Yet there was then a variety among them as to their Gods. One was <hi>Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gol,</hi> another <hi>Aſhimo,</hi> &amp;c. So it is now; one is the <hi>New Reformed Catholic,</hi> another <hi>The Original Church,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:026757_0072_0FD1C2E0C4A7C1D8"/>The analogy appears to me ſo exact, that I ſee not why they may not with thoſe of old, properly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated SAMARITANS.</p>
               <p>In the 4th Chap. of Ezra you find, that thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Samaritans applied to the Governor, Prieſt, and chief Fathers, offering to join and be connected with them in building the houſe of God; but they would have nothing to do with them, or have any connexion with them. Which no doubt you will eſteem a divine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, how to treat all ſuch <hi>Samaritaniſt</hi> people. And as thoſe wiſe and pious Fathers aſſerted they would build the Houſe of God, as the King had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: So Congregationaliſts, I ſuppoſe, would do well to be tenacious of their conſtitution as was eſtabliſhed by civil authority.</p>
               <p>After I had written the foregoing caſes I recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a caſe of a Miniſter with his people which I ſaw publiſhed in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Spy,</hi> 25th of April, 1793.</p>
               <p>It would be too tedious to give you even a minute account of what is there publiſhed. I will give you the general idea which I collected from ſaid publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which is, that there aroſe a diſturbance with the Miniſter about his domeſtic affairs, particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his daughter; that they accuſed and judged him without any regard to the law of Chriſt in the 18th Chap. of Matth. That the Miniſter repeatedly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to refer all matters to a mutual Council; which they as often refuſed.</p>
               <p>But at length, in December 1791, they had a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which they claimed the excluſive prerogative of chooſing all themſelves. The Miniſter conſented to this. This Council reſult, that a ſeparation take place
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:026757_0073_0FD1C2E298EA5390"/>
upon condition that if they could not agree on the pecuniary terms of their ſeparation, they ſubmit the matter to indifferent men mutually choſen, and abide the award. The Miniſter offered to leave them, ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cording to that reſult of their own Council. But the people would not comply with it, although they vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to comply with it; but inſtead of doing any thing to comply with their reſult, they pretended to diſmiſs their Miniſter themſelves: and did ſhut the Meeting Houſe againſt him. The Miniſter has ſince often call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them to ſettle with him according to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult; and uſed proper means to induce them to join with him in calling in a mutual Council, which they have always rejected. They applied to gentlemen to preach with them; but being unſucceſsful, they appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Church under the care of the Moderator of their own Council, to ſend their Miniſter to preach, &amp;c. among them. That Church returned anſwer to them that they could not think their Miniſter was diſmiſſed according to the reſult. The Miniſter called in a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable Council, who in their reſult ſay, that his paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oral relation continues, notwithſtanding all the people have done to diſmiſs him, and that he is in good ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not having forfeited his miniſterial character. And very ſolemnly exhort the people to return to their duty under his miniſtry, or if they wiſh for a diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to comply unreſervedly with the reſult of their own Council. The Miniſter has ſince repeatedly urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to a ſettlement; and it appears has always of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and ſtood ready, to ſubmit all their differences to indifferent men mutually choſen; but the people al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways refuſed, claiming to themſelves the ſole and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive prerogative of accuſing, judging and execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:026757_0074_0FD1C2E3CFCAC538"/>
and of diſſolving their own engagements at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, though ratified in the moſt religious and ſacred manner; defying and condemning all advice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions, of men and bodies of men, even when they had deſired it, and promiſed, (i. e. voted) to comply with it. They are not <hi>Independents,</hi> for they ſeek help, but it is in a ſupercilious manner as if all were to ſerve them. They are not merely what I have above called <hi>Samaritans;</hi> for they vie with the <hi>Pope,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting himſelf with INFALLIBILITY above all <hi>obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> uſurping a <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to break FAITH and diſpenſe with obligations at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>You will aſk, if they are neither Independents nor what I have denominated Samaritans; what are they? I know not what they will ſtile themſelves. You know people of high taſte affect to name their children after ſome high perſonage, and to ſtile or denominate themſelves by ſome eminent patron, high character, perſonage or important name. I am content they ſhould ſearch the whole world for a patron, perſonage, or name, till they come to ADAM, and then they may denominate themſelves ADAMITES.</p>

               <p>YOU will obſerve in the courſe of theſe letters, that the Miniſter's connexion with his people includes in it a civil covenant or contract blended with his other covenants with them; which is of great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:026757_0075_0FD1C2E436437EA8"/>
ſince his office is ſo blended with his occupation, his local ſituation, his domeſtic comfort, and almoſt all circumſtances of life.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, the Platform does not fail to aſſert the right and duty of civil authority's making proviſion for the ſupport and maintenance of Miniſters, which the civil authority have generally done where Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationaliſm has prevailed; and I am well aſſured there was an old law of the Province of Maſſachuſetts Bay, among other laws ratified and perpetuated by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Maſſachuſetts: Which enacts, <hi>"That the reſpective Churches ſhall be encouraged in the peaceable and regular profeſſion and practice of their Church order and diſcipline."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have in theſe letters given you my idea of what their order and diſcipline is; as eſtabliſhed by their Platform, Synods and uſage; now for more than an hundred and forty years. And Mr. Wiſe, in his Church's Quarrel eſpouſed, ſays "Cuſtom, when full of days, and of noble examples, becomes the common law of a nation, and is as ſovereign and pleadable as the dictates of parliamentary power." But you will readily join with me, in ſaying, there is no <hi>peace, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity</hi> or <hi>order,</hi> in ſuch conduct as the caſes I have mentioned. Nor any cuſtom of noble examples to legitimate or countenance them.</p>
               <p>But ſuch conduct, if countenanced and prevalent, muſt, in its own nature, run out the Miniſtry; for it muſt be inconſiſtent with common prudence for men to undertake a calling which in its own nature and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor of it, deſtroys them as to this world. It is what God never required of any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of men; but his word is expreſsly and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:026757_0076_0FD1C2ECAAB9C650"/>
againſt it, eſpecially in his inſtituting religious offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, both in the Old and New Teſtament. It is very common for many people to cry out againſt a miniſter; if he takes any proper care of his ſecular intereſt, to call him a worldling, and ſay he is only after money; or ſome ſuch opprobrious epithets. But therein they very highly and audaciouſly reproach the divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution concerning that order of men, as well as vilify his ſervants.</p>
               <p>But ſuch diſorder and clamour, not only deſtroys Miniſters; but deſtroys ſociety, makes diviſions in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes, and diſables them from ſupporting the public worſhip of God; and thus deſtroys religion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats ſocial happineſs, and not only oppugnates the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law, but undermines civil government: and in Maſſachuſetts may properly be conſidered as a conſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acy againſt their conſtitution, which ſtates as a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental maxim, <hi>"That the happineſs of a people, and the good order and preſervation of civil government</hi> ES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENTIALLY <hi>depend upon piety, religion, and morality.</hi> And that theſe cannot be generally diffuſed through a community; but by the inſtitution of the public worſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ip of God and of public inſtruction in piety, religion, and morality; therefore provides that the ſeveral towns, pariſhes, &amp;c. ſhall make ſuitable proviſion, at their own expenſe, for the inſtitution of the public worſhip of God, and for the ſupport of public Proteſtant Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of religion, &amp;c. And that the ſeveral towns, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes, &amp;c. ſhall contract with their Teachers for their, ſupport and maintenance." Hence ſuch ſchemes and practices as are inconſiſtent with, and ſubverſive of the regular eſtabliſhment of public Teachers of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, morality, and piety, are <hi>eſſentially</hi> treaſon againſt that conſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="unknown:026757_0077_0FD1C2EE57A3ECF8"/>Should therefore any ſuch caſes come before the civil authority, may we not depend that the civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, who are the guardians of Liberty and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Conſtitution, will exert their authority to cruſh ſuch treaſons, and hold ſuch covenants and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts ſacred; not ſuffering people wantonly and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily to avoid their contracts; or diſpenſe with their own engagements.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE inveſtigation of CONGREGATIONALISM has required the obviating ſo many perverſions which ſelfiſh minds have loaded upon it, to ſerve partial views: and has lead into ſo many obſervations on the various falſe notions and wicked practices which have been fathered upon the Platform; that I doubt not you will take pleaſure in a <hi>ſummary review</hi> of the whole; in a concluding epiſtle.</p>
               <p>CONGREGATIONALISM, as contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and explained by the Platform and other approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed authors, <hi>Is Congregations' covenanting to Walk in all the Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. So many as can conveniently congregate togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or whoſe local ſituation and circumſtances conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently admit of it; covenant to obſerve all things whatſoever Chriſt has commanded.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. This Covenant being of ſo great importance, it muſt be ratified before proper witneſſes and author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity;
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:026757_0078_0FD1C2EFC4CE87A0"/>
which is called the gathering a new Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the countenance, and by the advice and aſſiſtance of a Council of Churches; or at leaſt of miniſters. The members of the New Church ſigning in their preſence, and receiving from them the <hi>right hand of fellowſhip:</hi> Or at leaſt, an owning of them in ſome explicit manner, a new branch added to the body of the Churches. This is a Conſociating Covenant.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. This Congregational Church, thus formed, have <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to chooſe proper Officers, ſuch as Chriſt, the King, has inſtituted. And particularly which is the moſt important, a <hi>Paſtor.</hi> Which choice or election is a propoſal to him for a Covenant to be ſuch an officer among and over them, as Chriſt has inſtituted. And he, by accepting; it becomes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation between them. And the pariſh or corpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rate body including the Church, concurring, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting with him as to temporalities; it becomes a threefold Covenant between Paſtor or Miniſter and people.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. Although each Congregation hath an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive <hi>right</hi> to chooſe and Covenant with their own offic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; yet as to their Paſtor, they have not right by their own immediate hands, to put him <hi>into office:</hi> But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by a Council of other Churches, with their Elders; which Council, the Church, with the conſent and concurrence of the Paſtor elect, hath both <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to call in. Which Council, hath <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to approve or diſapprove of their proceedings: and if they diſapprove of their proceedings, their choice will be void; becauſe official authority to adminiſter Chriſt's ordinances is derived from him by laying on of <hi>the hands of the Preſbytery;</hi> and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Covenant between Paſtor and People is of
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:026757_0079_0FD1C2F145E36E58"/>
ſuch importance, that, it muſt be ratified before proper witneſſes and by proper authority. Which only is ſuch a Council; according to Congregationaliſm. But being performed by them, another, viz. a Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating Covenant, by the <hi>right hand of fellowſhip,</hi> is added to, and blended with the Paſtor's and peoples' Covenants, and their relation becomes a fourfold covenant relation.</p>
               <p n="5">5th. A Church thus organized with a ruling Officer, hath <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to exerciſe all parts of Diſcipline of Chriſt's Inſtitution, according to his laws: Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing all matters of complaint or accuſation into the Church for a hearing and trial according to the 18th Chap. of Matth. having previouſly ſtated in writing the <hi>fact</hi> committed, and the <hi>Divine Law tranſgreſſed,</hi> to the perſon accuſed, in the firſt and ſecond ſtep with him; for there can be no treſpaſs, ſin or fault, where there is no Divine Law or Rule tranſgreſſed.</p>
               <p>The caſe thus before the Church, they have <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to proceed according to the Laws of Chriſt, under the preſidency of their Paſtor, and finiſh it; unleſs there is a <hi>diviſion</hi> about it; or it reſpects the <hi>Paſtor:</hi> In which caſes they are to call in a Council.</p>
               <p>Here the caſe is plain, if both parties mutually agree, and invite one by mutual choice. But if one party is obſtinate, and will not join in ſuch mutual choice and invitation; it is a queſtion of ſome import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; what ſhall be done?</p>
               <p>The Platform propoſes the third way of Communion. But this has rarely ever been attempted to be carried into practice; it is probable, for the ſame reaſon, that when a matter is of public notoriety in the Church,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:026757_0080_0FD1C2F4B2493310"/>
every one excuſes himſelf from undertaking to deal with an offender that he may not ſeem officious.</p>
               <p>It ſeems both Church and State early ſaw this; therefore called together the Synod in 1662, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the queſtion, Whether there ought not to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations? The Synod anſwered, there ought to be. Yet this never was carried into execution. Perhaps all would ſay, if there were claſſical conſociations and one party would not join; the other would have a right to complain to the Conſociation, as well as to complain to a Civil Court in a civil matter.</p>
               <p>I query why he may not complain to the Conſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now, taking ſuch and ſo many of them as he thinks proper, after he has properly invited and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably waited on the adverſe party to join with him? I ſee not why this ſhould not be valid, and the adverſe party holden to abide the conſequences. For all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Churches, are conſidered as one general Conſociation combined for thoſe purpoſes; ſo combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the manner of gathering a Church, and ſettling a Miniſter, in which tranſactions every party and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual by the nature and deſign of them, covenant and engage to call in Councils; in all ſuch caſes as Congregational principles require them.</p>
               <p>Such a Council ought not to be deemed a party Council, any more than a Civil Court, is a party court, becauſe one man ſues another before it, whom he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not induce to ſettle with him otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>This can give no countenance to thoſe ex parte Councils, who take up matters before they have been properly prepared; or who go directly in the face of a fair mutual Council; or ſoon after them, and pretend
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:026757_0081_0FD18D575E91AF00"/>
to act relative to thoſe things which have been before the mutual Council, contrary to what they have done. Such may be called party Councils indeed; and may doubtleſs be reckoned of thoſe who, Mr. Wiſe ſays, <hi>defy and trample under foot the Honour and Authority of the Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will readily notice, from what I have ſaid in the courſe of my letters, that, upon Congregational principles, a ſingle Church is the executive power, in matters of diſcipline; yet muſt execute or ſtay execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in caſes of diviſion, and reſpecting their Paſtor, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to advice of Council, ſimilar to executive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in civil adminiſtration. Which if they neglect or refuſe to do; their doings are invalid and void: And they forfeit the Fellowſhip of Churches; and a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil have a <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to declare ſentence of <hi>Noncommunion</hi> againſt them.</p>
               <p n="6">6th. A Church has <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to remove their Paſtor from his office, for <hi>offending incorrigibly; a Council of other Churches directing thereto.</hi> And they may, by advice of Council, diſmiſs their Paſtor in other caſes, as I have ſaid in the foregoing letters, when it is agreed to by all parties.</p>
               <p>But their having a <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to chooſe their Officers; or to call to office, by no means gives them or implies a power to reject them at pleaſure, or to put them out of office, after they are in office; any more than a man's having a right to chooſe a wife and to chooſe the officer that ſhall marry them, implies that he has a right to turn away his wife at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But people having this right to Covenant with their Miniſter, makes ſo much ſtronger againſt their break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:026757_0082_0FD1C2F8DE1ECCD8"/>
from him, or pretending to turn him away: as a man's own voluntary act, is ſtronger againſt him than what is in any ſenſe impoſed upon him. So the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, Chap. viii. Sec. 6th, "The Church being free, cannot become ſubject to any, but by a free election; yet when ſuch a people do chooſe any to be over them in the Lord, then they do become ſubject."</p>
               <p>And as a man has no right to break from his own voluntary Covenant; ſo no one has any right to abſolve him from his Covenant; or defeaſe him of it.</p>
               <p>This brings up to view the true intent and meaning of the Platform. Where it ſpeaks of the right of the people to chooſe and remove their own Officers. It is an aſſertion of a Congregation's having a <hi>right</hi> to Cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant with their Officers, and to hold and enjoy their choice, in oppoſition to <hi>Prelatical</hi> impoſition, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſance of Church Officers. And thus to aſſert and fix this Covenant, where it ought to be, viz. on the ſame ground with all other Covenants of importance. Hence alſo Congregationaliſts do not admit that a Council ſhould diſſolve this Covenant. Neither can one party diſſolve it.</p>
               <p>But all covenants, being by mutual, voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of parties, cannot be diſſolved; but by mutual conſent and agreement of the original covenanting contracting parties, or by forfeiture on the one part.</p>
               <p>And here you will notice that a Miniſter's cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with his People is involved in the conſociating covenant by the manner of ſolemnizing and ratifying of it. The Covenant between Miniſter and People, therefore, cannot regularly be diſſolved without the conſent and concurrence of a Council of Churches.
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:026757_0083_0FD1C2FC81FA2E08"/>
This is ſacredly reſerved to every individual contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party, the mutual and excluſive right of voluntary conſent, to diſſolve his voluntary Covenant.</p>
               <p>Hence, ſhould a Miniſter break away from his People without conſent or agreement; he breaks Covenant with them, both eccleſiaſtical and civil; and breaks Covenant alſo with the Conſociating Churches, and thereby forfeits his Covenant relation to them; and official character; and breaks his civil contract, forfeits that; and ought to pay damages as indifferent men ſhall judge, and this has been the caſe in ſeveral inſtances; where the Miniſter did not break away; but only was the firſt mover for parting, and they parted regularly by Council.</p>
               <p>It is in all reſpects the ſame on the other ſide as to the People; with reſpect to their Miniſter. Should they wiſh to have him leave them, or the relation diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved without his <hi>incorrigible offence,</hi> it ought to be by advice of Council, and an allowance of damages to him as indifferent men ſhall judge.</p>
               <p>But if they crowd him away without his conſent or the concurrence of a Council, they forfeit their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Conſociating Churches; and ought to continue his ſalary till they give a regular diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and aggravated damages beſide: as indifferent men ſhall judge.</p>
               <p>Again ſhould both Miniſter and People agree and diſſolve their Covenant, without a Council; it would be irregular, inconſiſtent with Congregational princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and a breach of Fellowſhip of Churches.</p>
               <p>Again, ſhould an Elder <hi>offend incorrigibly,</hi> whereby he forfeits his Covenant and contract with his People.
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:026757_0084_0FD1C3034C8BAF68"/>
The People being one party, cannot, according to any rule of God or man, be judges of the delinquency or forfeiture of the other party; any more than the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er party may be judge of himſelf, which certainly he has as good a right to; as they have to judge him. Moreover, they not being coordinate officers; nor of a coordinate calling: neither having authority to put into office; cannot be proper judges of his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial character, nor put out of office, according to the very words of the Platform. Chap. viii. "to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in office, and remove from office; are acts belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame power."</p>
               <p>But a Council of other Churches properly introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and regularly hearing and judging upon the cauſe, and finding him <hi>incorrigibly offending;</hi> and <hi>directing to a diſmiſſion.</hi> The Church hath then <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to diſmiſs him.</p>
               <p>Yet even then, if the Church will not diſmiſs, will not conſent to give up their Covenant with him, he is not diſmiſſed; the Council cannot deſtroy the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The right of covenanting contracting parties muſt forever remain ſacred to the parties who made the covenant, contract or confederation. Yet howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they cannot be conſidered in Fellowſhip with oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Churches ſo long as they remain ſo, until ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is conformed to: or, as Mr. Wiſe ſays, is repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a like power which made it.</p>
               <p>I have now, my dear Friend, in compliance with your deſire, in the courſe of my letters, given you my idea of CONGREGATIONALISM: have endeavoured to wipe off the reproach, and obviate the abſurdities which
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:026757_0085_0FD1C306CB6AD230"/>
many have loaded it with, by their fooliſh ſentiments and wicked practices, which they have audaciouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to it.</p>
               <p>That IT may be rightly underſtood and carefully practiſed by our CHURCHES,</p>
               <closer>

With ſentiments of cordiality, Your humble Servant.</signed>
