            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AT a juncture like the preſent; when the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional reputation of Britain, as well as her abſolute ſafety, ſtands tottering on the brink of deſtruction; when liberty and freedom, the great pillars of the conſtitution, are, by force and fraud undermined, and tumbling into ruins; when the bloody ſword of tyranny is drawn againſt America, and ſoon to be plunged into the bowels of her innocent inhabitants; when the preſent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, aided by a deſpicable junto, the rebel, outcaſt, and refuſe of Scotland, and a parliament not returned by the free ſuffrages of the people, are rioting with impunity in the ſpoils of an inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed powerful kingdom; when they, by cruel op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, have ſpread terror and civil war in every part of the Britiſh empire; when they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed or ſuſpended her trade, and ſapped the credit of public ſecurity; when the moſt iniquitous and unjuſt laws are daily paſſed to curb the ſpirit, and bind in chains, the hands of a brave and free
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013936_0002_0F925DBACB7CC3F0"/>people; when St. James's is made the SLAUGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER HOUSE of AMERICA; when the Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign is become a national executioner, and for a ſceptre carries a bloody knife; when by a moſt ſcandalous and ſhameful profuſion of the public money, we are hourly robbed and plundered, to anſwer all the purpoſes of King-craft and villany; when new taxes are daily impoſed upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in time of peace, to the almoſt entire ruin of the ſtate; when the minions of deſpotiſm a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the land forces, for the open and avowed purpoſe of wading knee deep in blood, through the liberties of Britain; when the Proteſtant religion is openly ſubverted, and the Britiſh ſubjects in Canada deprived of thoſe great ſecurities of their perſonal liberty and property, the habeas corpus act, and trial by juries; when a ſuſpending and diſpenſing power is aſſumed by the crown; when oppoſition, to the moſt cruel and wanton acts of lawleſs power, is deemed rebellion; when the Senators, deſigned the protectors of the people, are become their deſtroyers; when the appointed guardians of public freedom are become baſe apoſtates, and conſpirators againſt the liberties of mankind; when neither oaths, nor conſcience, can bind the Sovereign or his Miniſters; when both public and private juſtice is denied to a ſubject, nay to the whole body of the people at large; when our lives are expoſed to falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and our perſons to arbitrary impriſonment, and heavy fines; when the judges before whom we are to ſtand upon life and death, and before whom all caſes, concerning liberty and property, muſt be brought, too much devoted to the will and pleaſure of the crown, and enemies to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013936_0003_0F925DBB79FEB5D0"/>rights of mankind; when juries, who are to decide our fate, packed, bribed, or modelled to the pernicious deſigns of a wicked and deteſtable miniſtry; when every poſt, civil, naval, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, is filled by northern flatterers and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, by men of no principles, by paraſites, pimps, catamites, and the advocates for arbitrary power; when the people can ſee nothing but miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſlavery before their eyes; when this vaſt and mighty empire, the admiration and envy of the world, is, through corruption and villany, fallen into ruins.</p>
            <p>At ſuch a juncture as this, and under theſe dreadful and alarming circumſtances of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced and impending danger, it becomes the duty of every Engliſhman to ſtand forth to defend his life, his liberty, and his property from lawleſs vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and to ſave his country from perdition.</p>
            <p>So highly did our brave and virtuous anceſtors value and eſteem their rights, liberties and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, that they ſpared neither blood nor treaſure in their defence, when invaded, as they too often were, by ſome of our Kings, who, in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of lawleſs power, pulled down all the fences of liberty, and broke in, like the preſent Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign, upon the conſtitution, ſo far that the lives, liberties, and properties of the ſubjects of this realm were hourly in danger, and many fell ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to royal or miniſterial vengeance.</p>
            <p>Then it was that our generous forefathers nobly aſſociated themſelves in defence of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents and legal rights, and made an offering of the beſt and choiceſt blood in the kingdom to the ſhrine of Liberty, that we, their poſterity, might be free and happy. To them, and the glorious
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013936_0004_0F925DBC5E230AC8"/>ſtruggles they made with power, we owe all the bleſſings we enjoy, and the Engliſh conſtitution, our greateſt boaſt, and their greateſt glory.</p>
            <p>It was in ſuch times as theſe, when our brave progenitors behaved like Britons, with a true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot zeal, with which almoſt every breaſt was fired, they ſpurned the yoke, and broke the chains that were prepared for them, letting their king and his minions know, they would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him nor them to deſtroy their birthrights, and diſpenſe with the known laws of the land, by which they were reſolved to be governed, and not by his will, or any other lawleſs power upon earth.</p>
            <p>Let us at this time, in this hour of imminent danger, follow ſo bright and glorious an example, by a well timed noble reſiſtance to the preſent royal and miniſterial plan, for ſubverting the laws and religion, and overturning the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Britiſh empire, in England and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; a reſiſtance that will ſecure freedom to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and immortal honor to ourſelves; the field of glory is open before us; let us rouſe from a ſtate of apathy, and exert ourſelves in a manner becoming of Engliſhmen, worthy of men who love liberty, and deſerve to be free. Let us ſhew to the world, we are not to be enſlaved by one, nor by five thouſand tyrants, for the ſons of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, corruption, and deſpotiſm will purſue their bloody deſigns, with greater vigour, and with all the unrelenting malice of barbarians, againſt our fellow ſubjects in America, in proportion as we are tame and acquieſcing; and if once they can ſucceed, through our baſeneſs and cowardice, the ſword will be immediately turned againſt us, the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013936_0005_0F925DBD12406CA0"/>ſacred conſtitution of our empire diſſolved, and we ſhall fall deſpiſed, unlamented, and deteſted, into the ſame horrible gulph of arbitrary power.</p>
            <p>Let us take advantage of the preſent opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, while our reſentments boil high, while every Engliſh breaſt is fired with indignation againſt thoſe who are the authors of all our paſt and preſent cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, which now convulſe the ſtate to its centre; let us by all proper, juſt, and legal means, exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary puniſh the paricides, and avowed enemies of mankind; let neither private acquaintance, nor perſonal alliance, ſtand between us and our duty to our country; let all, who have an intereſt in the public ſafety, join in common meaſures to defend the publc ſafety; let us purſue to diſgrace, deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and even death, all thoſe who have brought this ruin upon us, let them be ever ſo great or ever ſo many; let us ſtamp, and deep engrave in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters legible to all Europe at preſent, and to all poſterity hereafter, what vengeance is due to crimes, which have no leſs objects in view than the ruin of nations, and the deſtruction of millions; let us fruſtrate their preſent deſperate and wicked attempt to deſtroy America, by joining with our injured fellow ſubjects, and bravely ſtriking one honeſt and bold ſtroke to deſtroy them; nay, although the deſigns of the conſpirators ſhould be laid deep as the centre, although they ſhould raiſe hell itſelf, and ſhould fetch legions of votaries from thence to avow their proceedings, yet let us not leave the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit till we have their heads and their eſtates.</p>
            <p>Hear part of the addreſs of your injured and oppreſſed fellow ſubjects in America, to you upon this melancholy occaſion, upon the dreadful proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of impending ruin; then let every Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lay his hand upon his heart, and declare whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013936_0006_0F925DBDBB8A2060"/>he does not think they have been moſt cruelly treated, and whether he can in juſtice, conſcience, and humanity draw the ſword againſt them; or whether he would not rather join with them, and endeavour to obtain a deciſive victory over ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, or fall gloriouſly with the liberties of his country. Theſe are their words.</p>
            <p>"When a nation, led to greatneſs by the hand of liberty, and poſſeſſed of all the glory that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm, munificence, and humanity can beſtow, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to the ungrateful taſk of forging chains for her friends and children, and inſtead of giving ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to freedom, turns advocate for ſlavery and oppreſſion, there is reaſon to ſuſpect ſhe has either ceaſed to be virtuous, or been extremely negligent in the appointment of her rulers.</p>
            <p>"In almoſt every age, in repeated conflicts, in long and bloody wars, as well civil as foreign, againſt the many powerful nations, againſt the open aſſaults of enemies, and the more dangerous trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of friends, have the inhabitants of your iſland, your great and glorious anceſtors, maintained their independence, and tranſmitted the rights of men, and the bleſſings of liberty, to you their poſterity.</p>
            <p>"Be not ſurpriſed, therefore, that we who are deſcendents from the ſame common anceſtors; that we, whoſe forefathers participated in all the rights, the liberties, and the conſtitution, you ſo juſtly boaſt, and who have carefully conveyed the ſame fair inheritance to us, guarantied by the plighted faith of government, and the moſt ſolemn compacts with Britiſh ſovereigns, ſhould refuſe to ſurrender them to men, who found their claims on no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of reaſon, and who proſecute them with a deſign, that by having our lives and property in
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013936_0007_0F925DBF2532FAD0"/>their power, they may, with the greater facility, enſlave you.</p>
            <p>"The cauſe of America is now the object of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal attention; it has at length become very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. This unhappy country has not only been oppreſſed, but abuſed and miſrepreſented; and the duty we owe to ourſelves and poſterity, to your intereſt, and the general welfare of the Britiſh empire, leads us to addreſs you on this very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſubject.</p>
            <p>"We call upon you yourſelves, to witneſs our loyalty and attachment to the common intereſt of the whole empire; did we not, in the laſt war, add all the ſtrength of this vaſt continent to the force which repelled our common enemy? Did we not leave our native ſhores, and meet diſeaſe and death, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the ſucceſs of the Britiſh arms in foreign cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates? Did you not thank us for our zeal, and even reimburſe us large ſums of money, which, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, we had advanced beyond our proportion, and far beyond our abilities? You did.</p>
            <p>"To what cauſes, then, are we to attribute the ſudden change of treatment, and that ſyſtem of ſlavery which was prepared for us at the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peace.</p>
            <p>"Let juſtice and humanity ceaſe to be the boaſt of your nation, conſult your hiſtory, examine your hiſtory, examine your records of former tranſactions, nay turn to the annals of the many arbitrary ſtates and kingdoms that ſurround you, and ſhew us a ſingle inſtance of men being condemned to ſuffer for imputed crimes, unheard, unqueſtioned, and without even the ſpecious formality of a trial; and that too by laws made expreſly for the purpoſe, and which had no exiſtence at the time of the fact committed. If it be difficult to reconcile theſe proceedings to
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013936_0008_0F925DBF5AAF38F8"/>the genius and temper of your laws and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the taſk will become more arduous when we call upon our miniſterial enemies to juſtify, not only condemning men untried, and by hearſay; but involving the innocent in one common puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the guilty, and for the act of thirty or forty, to bring poverty, diſtreſs and calamity on 30,000 ſouls, and thoſe not your enemies, but your friends, brethren, and fellow ſubjects.</p>
            <p>"Admit that the miniſtry, by the power of Britain, and the aid of our Roman Catholic neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, ſhould be able to carry the point of taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reduce us to a ſtate of perfect humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſlavery. Such an enterprize would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs make ſome addition to your national debt, which already preſſes down your liberties, and fills you with penſioners and placemen, We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume alſo that your commerce will ſomewhat be diminiſhed. However, ſuppoſe you ſhould prove victorious—in what condition will you then be? What advantages or what laurels will you reap from ſuch a conqueſt?</p>
            <p>May not a miniſtry with the ſame armies enſlave you—it may be ſaid, you will ceaſe to pay them— but remember the taxes from America, the wealth, and we may add the men particularly the Roman Catholics of this vaſt continent, will then be in the power of your enemies—nor will you have any reaſon to expect, that after making ſlaves of us, many among us ſhould refuſe to aſſiſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing you to the ſame abject ſtate,"</p>
