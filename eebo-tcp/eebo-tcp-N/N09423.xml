            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>TO <hi>do good, as we have opportunity,</hi> and according to our reſpective abilities, is a duty clearly pointed out by NATURE, and repeatedly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the more expreſs language of REVELATION.</p>
            <p>EVERY man's own particular frame— his innumerable wants of aſſiſtance from others—his ſituation as a member of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety—and the tendency of this practice to improve and dignify the Agent; are <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> proofs of our obligation to perform kind and beneficent actions, or, in the words of my text, to <hi>do good unto all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SUCH are the nature and frame of man, that what is moſt worthy of the name of Happineſs is found, by experience, to be utterly inconſiſtent with an <hi>unfeeling</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs. He that confines his aims and proſpects to his own private intereſt, is <hi>a ſtranger</hi> to, and <hi>doth not intermeddle with,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:012008_0005_0F893FDD34C579C8"/>
the moſt ſubſtantial and cordial ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which this life affords. There is a generous, noble and exquiſite pleaſure, experienced by the friendly and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, which is incomparably ſuperior to what a perſon of his character has ever felt, or can feel. As therefore the Author of our nature has annexed a much greater degree of happineſs to the exerciſe of the benevolent, than of the ſelfiſh, Affections; it is evidently his will and intention, which are the foundation of all <hi>moral</hi> obligation, that every human creature ſhould, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offers, perform acts of kindneſs and beneficence.</p>
            <p>THE innumerable wants of aſſiſtance from others, which we conſtantly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are alſo a manifeſt indication of the ſame intention. No man, for any conſiderable time, in the preſent ſtate of the world, can even ſupport life, by his own endeavors. Not a ſingle day paſſes, from his firſt entrance upon this ſtage of exiſtence until he makes his final <hi>exit,</hi> in which a man would not be miſerable, were it not for the labor and aſſiſtance of other people<note n="*" place="bottom">See this point well illuſtrated by Mr. WOLLASTON, in his <hi>Religion of Nature delincated.</hi> Sect. vii.</note>. If he is poſſeſſed of riches, for which he is always chiefly
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:012008_0006_0F893FDDEEAD5B28"/>
beholden to others; he muſt know that bare riches—that ſilver and <hi>gold,</hi> how much ſoever ſome men may place their <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> in them, will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feed nor cloath him. They are in reality no otherwiſe uſeful to him, than as they may be exchanged, for what will immediately anſwer his neceſſities and wants. If he has <hi>bread enough and to ſpare</hi>; yet he finds that, in the literal ſenſe of the expreſſion, <hi>man doth not live by bread alone</hi>; but that other things are as neceſſary as his daily food. The ſame obſervation might be extended to all the different circumſtances of life. No ſituation can be aſſigned, in which a man does not frequently want aſſiſtance, nor any in which he is not, in his turn, capable of giving aſſiſtance to others that want it, in ſome form or other. But if he refuſes to give aſſiſtance, he has no right to demand it; the claim being mutual and conditional. This farther ſhews it to be the deſign of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, in placing him in ſuch a ſtate, that he ſhould be aſſiſting to others; or, that he ſhould <hi>do good</hi> to them, as he has opportunity, and as caſes may require.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:012008_0007_0F893FDEAFBDB5D0"/>THIS obligation will appear in a light that is ſtill more ſtriking, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ourſelves as members of ſociety. All the individuals belonging to the human ſpecies, however diſperſed or diſtant from one another, or however differing in ſentiments, manners, or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical intereſts, yet conſtitute one ſociety or ſyſtem, which is united together by many inviolable bonds. This general ſociety is divided into various diſtinct bodies or leſſer ſocieties; the members of which are linked together by ſtill cloſer ties, than thoſe which connect the diſtant members of a larger ſyſtem. Thus the ſubjects of every kingdom, or the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of any country that are united under the ſame government, form a diſtinct civil ſociety; and they have a more intimate connection with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than what ariſes from their relation as men, or as belonging to the ſame ſpecies. So again: the profeſſors of the ſame religion, the diſciples of the ſame maſter, conſtitute a ſociety of a different kind; compared by St. Paul <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 12.</note>, in one inſtance at leaſt, to the human <hi>body</hi>; all the parts or <hi>members</hi> of which have their reſpective uſes and functions aſſigned
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012008_0008_0F893FDF71069D08"/>
them, and are mutually ſubſervient to one another. And it deſerves our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that in proportion as ſociety is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into a ſmaller compaſs by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſion, the members of it become of more conſequence, and their mutual good offices are more neceſſary.</p>
            <p>If we conſider ourſelves then as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſociety, whether in a larger or more confined view, whether in a civil or religious ſenſe; it will appear to be our duty to <hi>act</hi> as members of ſociety. Now to act as members of ſociety, is to perform all thoſe offices towards the body in general, and our fellow-members in particular, which the ſtation aſſigned us, and the relation we are in, require; that is, according to our power, to contribute, in the firſt place, what is neceſſary to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then to the well-being, both of the body, and of any of its members; or, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, to do all the good that we can.</p>
            <p>SUCH conduct appears alſo to be our duty, as it naturally improves us; for we are under the ſame obligations to improve and perfect ourſelves, as we are to preſerve ourſelves. Every right act has a tendency to produce a right habit and diſpoſition of mind; and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of any moral agent conſiſts as
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012008_0009_0F893FE030EAE360"/>
much, at leaſt, in a right habit and diſpoſition, as in intellectual capacity or power. The Supreme Being is infinite perfection; and the more any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſembles him, the farther he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards a ſtate of perfection. And the more any creature performs acts of goodneſs and kindneſs, and has acquired the habit of performing them, the more he reſembles that adorable Being, whoſe goodneſs is perpetually exerciſed, and extends to all the parts of the creation; and who delights in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly beholding millions of his creatures, of different ranks and orders, from the higheſt Angel down to the loweſt reptile, enjoying the various degrees of perfection and happineſs, which they have derived from his bounty.</p>
            <p>THE ſame conſiderations that prove it to be our duty to <hi>do good</hi> at all, prove alſo that we ſhould do it, <hi>to all men, as we have opportunity.</hi> Why we ſhould be bound to do good, and not to do all the good in our power, will be impoſſible to ſhew. To ſuppoſe that a man has ten degrees of ability to do good, and yet that he is under obligations to exerciſe no more than five of them, is to ſuppoſe that the other five degrees of this ability
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012008_0010_0F893FE0EE4C3028"/>
were given him for no purpoſe. But, in truth, the obligation is always in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the power and opportunity; ſince it ariſes from the circumſtances and connections in which GOD has placed us.</p>
            <p>AS we are connected with all men, and are fellow-members with them of one general ſociety, we ſhould be diſpoſed to <hi>do good unto all men.</hi> But as the moſt important relation we bear to others in many reſpects, is that of fellow-chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; our obligation to do good to thoſe, who are in this relation to us, is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably ſtronger. We are, according to the juſt diſtinction in my text, <hi>as we have opportunity,</hi> to <hi>do good unto all men</hi>; but more <hi>eſpecially,</hi> and with peculiar attention, <hi>unto them which are of the houſhold of faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT the light of nature thus teaches to be our duty, the voice of revelation univerſally confirms. Under the Moſaic inſtitution indeed, the precepts injoining kindneſs and good offices have common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a particular reference to thoſe, who were members of the Jewiſh tribes; who, for wiſe reaſons, were ſeparated from all the families of the earth, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed with peculiar privileges; and whoſe affections, ſtill wandering after the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012008_0011_0F893FE1AE9677C8"/>
vanities and ſuperſtitions of the idolatrous nations around them, it was neceſſary to call off and reſtrain, with great ſtrictneſs and ſeverity. Yet notwithſtanding, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are not wanting under that diſpenſation, in which kindneſs and acts of beneficence were required towards STRANGERS; <hi>i. e,</hi> perſons who were unconnected with them by any political or religious ties, being, in the language of St. Paul, <hi>aliens from the commonwealth of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS general benevolence to mankind was recommended to them, and urged, from the example of GOD himſelf, as well as from the conſideration of their own former experiences. HE <hi>doth exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the judgment of the fatherleſs and widow, and loveth the</hi> STRANGER, <hi>in giving him food and raiment. Love ye</hi> THEREFORE <hi>the</hi> STRANGER; <hi>for</hi> YE <hi>were ſtrangers in the land of Egypt.</hi>

            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING, as has been already obſerved, and as my text inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, this great and eſſential qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not a blind and <hi>undiſtinguiſhing</hi> affection, leading us equally to love all men, without any regard to the difference of their characters. The love of GOD extends to all men; but ſome are the objects of his peculiar affection, as being in reality more worthy than others.

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:012008_0017_0F893FE6EEDD96D0"/>EVERY man is intitled to ſome degree of eſteem, on this account. The worſt of men poſſeſs ſomething that is valuable. They bear, in ſome reſpects, the image of their Maker. They are, at leaſt, the workmanſhip of GOD; and therefore they are not to be deſpiſed. They are alſo of the ſame nature with ourſelves, and originally of the ſame family, being deſcended from the ſame anceſtors. And however they may be ſituated, and whatever may be their characters, in other reſpects; yet ſtill, as they are men, they are intitled to our kindneſs, and if we are able to relieve their neceſſities, both nature and religion oblige us to relieve them.</p>

us—thoſe who are united to us by the ties of the ſame common religion—and the members of the ſame particular church, worſhiping GOD in the uſe of the ſame ſolemn offices; who are, according to reaſon, and to revelation, intitled to our peculiar affection and kindneſs.</p>
            <p>OF all religions, that of the Goſpel produces the moſt intimate union among its profeſſors. They are all governed by the ſame laws, and intitled to the ſame privileges, and included in one general purchaſe; and not only ſo, but they are taught to conſider themſelves as ſo many <hi>branches</hi> of the ſame <hi>vine</hi>—as ſo many limbs or members belonging to the ſame body. <hi>As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body; ſo alſo is</hi> CHRIST: <hi>for by one ſpirit we are all baptized into one body, whether we be</hi> (originally) <hi>Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have all been made to drink into one ſpirit</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 12.</note>. And, in another paſſage, the Apoſtle lays it down, and argues from it, as an eſtabliſhed principle, that Chriſtians <hi>are members one of another</hi>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:012008_0019_0F893FE87040A170"/>SUCH are the illuſtrations, in Scripture, of the inſeparable connection of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans with CHRIST, and with one another. No ſociety, whether civil or religious, introduces ſo cloſe an union between its members as the Church of CHRIST does: our obligation therefore, as <hi>fellow-chriſtians,</hi> to cultivate brotherly love, and to <hi>do good</hi> to one another, is greater than it is, or can be, in any other religious ſociety.</p>
            <p>IN collective bodies of men, as well as in the natural body, all the members have their reſpective offices aſſigned them, more or leſs honorable—of greater or leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; and they who perform the more important and honorable Offices, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to proportionably greater kindneſs and reſpect, than others who are placed in an inferior ſtation. In <hi>the houſhold of faith,</hi> they who are appointed, as <hi>ſtewards,</hi> to diſpenſe to the various members of it that proviſion which is to nouriſh and ſupport them, are, on account of their rank, and eſpecially if faithful to their truſt, in the eſtimation of St. Paul, <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of double honor</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> v. 17.</note>. The honor due to them evidently appears to be, not an uſeleſs, unavailing reſpect, but an active principle, performing all thoſe good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012008_0020_0F893FE930403410"/>
by which eſteem and affection are properly ſignified.</p>
            <p>THE loweſt inſtance of this nature, is, if poſſible, to <hi>prevent</hi> their falling into diſtreſs or neceſſitous circumſtances; and, where this hath not been done, to relieve their diſtreſſes, and ſupply their wants. So much indeed is due to them on the common foot of humanity; and they would have a right to expect it, were they ſtrangers or enemies. They are ſtill more intitled to this kindneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as Chriſtians. For if any one that deſerves the <hi>name of chriſtian</hi>—if <hi>one of the leaſt of</hi> our <hi>brethren,</hi> is known to be in ſuch a condition, we are to <hi>give him meat;</hi> if he is <hi>thirſty,</hi> we are to <hi>give him drink;</hi> if he is a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> or deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of particular friends to receive him, we are to <hi>take him in;</hi> if he is <hi>naked,</hi> and unable to provide for himſelf, we are to <hi>cloath him;</hi> if he is <hi>ſick,</hi> or <hi>in priſon,</hi> we are to <hi>viſit him,</hi> with a view of relieving him. All this is commanded, and you know the penalty: <hi>Depart from me ye curſed, into ever laſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels</hi>

            <p>BUT ſurely ſomething more muſt be due to the CLERGY, than to Chriſtians
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012008_0021_0F893FE9F03998A8"/>
of the loweſt degree! for, as has been obſerved, they are the moſt important members of the myſtical body of CHRIST, without whoſe functions the body muſt ſoon periſh. We are not forward to ſpeak on this ſubject, nor to ſay what we eſteem to be our <hi>juſt rights</hi>; — in an age wherein the leaſt intimation of our claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſuperior reſpect, or kindneſs, on account of our ſtations in the Church, is ſo liable to be treated as PRIESTCRAFT. However, we ought ſometimes to remind men, in what manner our office is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in Scripture; and briefly to do this, on the preſent occaſion, I doubt not but the candid will think excuſable.</p>
            <p>THE clergy then are ſpoken of, by our Saviour himſelf, as <hi>ſterwards,</hi> whom their <hi>lord has made rulers over his houſhold, to give them their portion of meat in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon—as ſhepherds, ſet over the flock of Chriſt—as the ſalt of the earth, the light of the world</hi> &amp;c. St. Paul ſpeaks of them as <hi>embaſſadors for Chriſt,</hi> employed by him to negociate matters that concern the ſalvation of ſinners. They are in other places repreſented as perſons appointed and commiſſioned by CHRIST, to diſpenſe the myſteries of his Goſpel, to apply the ſeals to his covenant, and to convey thoſe
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012008_0022_0F893FEAAFCE1920"/>
ſpiritual mercies which are infinitely more valuable than all earthly enjoyments. And we know that it is alſo a part of their office, to preſent the homage and adoration of their fellow-chriſtians, before the throne of the Divine Majeſty. Such are their office and employment, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the language of Scripture; and we can freely leave it for <hi>others</hi> to judge, whether perſons of this rank and diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church of CHRIST, are not intitled to peculiar kindneſs and reſpect from Chriſtians in general.</p>
            <p>AMONG the ſeveral ways in which this kindneſs and reſpect are to be ſhewn, I ſhall confine myſelf to a ſingle one; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not loſe ſight of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our preſent aſſembling, to which all that has been hitherto ſaid has a particular reference. The inſtance then that I ſhall mention, is that of providing a comfortable and decent maintenance for them and their families. As they are commonly ſituated, this is a natural expreſſion of that reſpect which is due to them; and, at the ſame time, it would contribute greatly to their uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as it would enable them to devote themſelves to their proper buſineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtraction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:012008_0023_0F893FEB6E6CB848"/>EASY circumſtances, in ſome meaſure, animate and enlarge the mind, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire it with ſuitable confidence, vigour and reſolution: whereas the faculties are cramped, and cannot be exerted to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage (as many of <hi>us</hi> can tell <hi>you</hi> from experience), by a perpetual anxiety to procure, <hi>what we ſhall eat, and what we ſhall drink, and wherewithal we ſhall be cloathed.</hi> To this may be added, (what ſome of <hi>you</hi> perhaps can tell <hi>us</hi> from experience), that leſs attention is paid to the inſtructions and exhortations of the clergy, when they are known to be in mean and indigent circumſtances, than when their condition is otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>HAD I time, I might eaſily ſhew, that it was the opinion of the moſt celebrated legiſlators of antiquity, and of thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are moſt reſpected for their wiſdom and ſound policy <note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012008_0024_0F893FEC2DF503C0"/>
ſupport ought to be provided for the miniſters of religion; and that it was chearfully contributed. I might ſet before you the conduct of the Jews in this caſe; which ought to have the more weight, as GOD himſelf was pleaſed to preſcribe it. But I will only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, with regard to the Jews, that although the tribe of Levi, which was ſet apart for the performance of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic offices of religion, was the leaſt of all the tribes; yet to the Levites was aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>tenth</hi> part of all the produce of the labour, land and ſtock, of the other tribes. Beſides all this, they had the property of forty-eight cities in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent parts of that dominion. The Prieſts had alſo the firſt fruits of the cattle, corn, wine, oil &amp;c, which were annually dedicated to GOD. To which may be added, that they received a certain price for the redemption of every <hi>firſt-born;</hi> to ſay nothing of many voluntary oblations,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012008_0025_0F893FEDD6EA7C50"/>
and the remainder of all the things, part of which had been offered in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. All this muſt have amounted to a large ſtanding revenue, and has been calculated at a third part of the whole produce of the country; out of which is only to be deducted, what was expended in ſupporting the ſervice of the tabernacle, and afterwards of the temple <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Potter</hi> on <hi>Church-government.</hi> CHAP. v. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9.—and compare with it <hi>Lowman</hi> on <hi>the civil government of the Hebrews.</hi> CHAP. vi.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>poſitive</hi> part of this law, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, has no obligation upon Chriſtians; nor do the miniſters of the Goſpel claim the ſame maintenance, either as to <hi>kind</hi> or <hi>degree,</hi> with the Jewiſh Prieſts. But the <hi>moral</hi> law obliges us, and the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive law of CHRIST obliges us; and both theſe laws require an honorable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſupport for the Chriſtian clergy; whoſe office demands much greater abilities and application in order to execute it properly—is much more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and honorable in itſelf—and requires a much greater preparation for it, than that of the Jewiſh Prieſts.</p>
            <p>OUR Bleſſed Saviour indeed has not preſcribed to his followers, how large a ſupport, nor after what <hi>mode,</hi> they ſhould provide for his miniſters. But when he
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012008_0026_0F893FEE89927468"/>
firſt ſent out his Apoſtles, he directed them to make no proviſion for themſelves during their miſſion; aſſigning this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>the workman is worthy of his meat</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> x. 10.</note>. And when he ſent forth his ſeventy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he gave them the ſame direction, repeating the ſame reaſon <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> x. 7.</note>. From whence it is evident, that he expected and intended, that the preachers of the Goſpel ſhould receive a full maintenance.</p>
            <p>ST. Paul ſtrongly aſſerts, and proves, and inſiſts upon, the <hi>right</hi> of the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Goſpel to be ſupported by it; and, that Chriſtians ought not to think it any <hi>great matter</hi> to make due proviſion for them. Speaking to the Corinthians on this ſubject, he ſays: <hi>who goeth a warfare at any time at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Or, who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? Say I theſe things as a man, or ſaith not the law the ſame alſo? For it is written in the law of Moſes, thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox, that treadeth out the corn. Doth</hi> GOD <hi>take care of oxen, or ſaith he it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together for</hi> OUR <hi>ſakes? For our ſakes, no doubt, this is written; that he that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012008_0027_0F893FEF2EB5B7C8"/>
ploweth, ſhould plow in hope; and he that threſheth in hope, ſhould be partaker of his hope. If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things?—Do ye not know that they who miniſter about holy things, live of the things of the temple; and they who wait at the altar, are partakers with the altar? Even ſo</hi> HATH THE LORD ORDAINED, <hi>that</hi> THEY WHO PREACH THE GOSPEL, SHOULD LIVE OF THE GOSPEL <note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix.</note>.</p>
            <p>IN this paſſage, St. Paul proves the right of the clergy to a maintenance, from the reaſonableneſs of the thing, which requires that a man ſhould be rewarded according to his ſervices; and this he illuſtrates by the caſes of ſoldiers, huſbandmen, ſhepherds &amp;c. He enforces his argument from the Jewiſh law; which expreſsly provided, that thoſe who miniſtered at the altar ſhould be ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. And he concludes with the moſt deciſive argument of all, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of CHRIST himſelf; who <hi>ordained,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that they who preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS ordinance and law of CHRIST he eſteemed to be of ſuch great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012008_0028_0F893FEFF4555E90"/>
in the Chriſtian church, that a due attention to it is made one of the articles of his charge to Timothy. <hi>Let the elders, ſays he, that rule well, be accounted worthy of double honor, eſpecially they who labor in the word and doctrine.</hi> That this <hi>double honor</hi> principally means a liberal ſupport and maintenance, is evident from the next words: <hi>For the Scripture ſaith, thou ſhalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn: and the laborer is worthy of his hire</hi>

You want not to be informed, that this <hi>annual meeting</hi> is in order to promote the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable deſign of our CORPORATION, which is to raiſe and conduct a fund, FOR THE RELIEF OF THE WIDOWS AND CHILDREN OF CLERGYMEN IN THE COMMUNION OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN AMERICA. This deſign correſponds exactly with St. Paul's
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012008_0029_0F893FF0B0335330"/>
exhortation in my text; which is to <hi>do good unto all men</hi> in general, but more ESPECIALLY <hi>unto them which are of the houſhold of faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BY <hi>the houſhold of faith</hi> is undoubtedly meant the Chriſtian church; and, in the exerciſe of kindneſs, or in doing good, why a diſtinction ſhould be made by Chriſtians in favor of their fellow-Chriſtians, has been particularly ſhewn. It has alſo been ſhewn, that the reaſon for this preference extends farther, and equally requires, that ſome Chriſtians ſhould be treated with a higher degree of reſpect and kindneſs than others: and that this may juſtly be ſaid of the <hi>clergy,</hi> whoſe ſtation in the church is more uſeful, more important, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently more honorable, than that of Chriſtians in common.</p>
            <p>AMONG the proper methods of doing good to them, one has been particularly noticed; namely, that of ſecuring to them a freedom from the diſtracting cares of the world, by providing for them an eaſy and comfortable maintenance— ſo far as mens circumſtances enable them to make this proviſion. Beſides the reaſonableneſs of doing this, and its being an eſſential part of that beneficence
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012008_0030_0F893FF1702F28C8"/>
which is recommended in my text; more direct proof has been made, from the declarations of our bleſſed Saviour, and the words of an eminent Apoſtle, that this is a neceſſary and important duty, not to be evaded conſiſtently with the Chriſtian character.</p>
            <p>WHEREVER therefore it has been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, the clergy have been debarred from a <hi>juſt night;</hi> and the injury, like all other injuries, ought to be repaired, as ſpeedily and effectually as poſſible. And wherever the failure has been owing to want of ability, (which, if <hi>real,</hi> and not <hi>pretended,</hi> is always a ſufficient excuſe, in the ſight both of GOD and man), care ought to be taken to render the ill conſequences as light as the caſe will admit of.</p>
            <p>THAT the clergy of our church in theſe colonies, ſome individuals excepted, receive, upon the whole, but a ſcanty ſupport <note n="*" place="bottom">Although the bounty of the <hi>venerable ſociety</hi> to the clergy of theſe three provinces, in many inſtances, far exceeds the contributions raiſed by their congregations. which however commonly plead that they do as much, in this way, as they can: yet conſidering the expences of living—expences which the clergy cannot avoid, it may be truly ſaid that they have no more than <hi>a ſcanty ſupport.</hi> The ſociety's ſalary is always punctually paid: and they expect from their miſſions, even in the pooreſt parts of the country, that the people, beſides providing a convenient and comfortable parſonage-houſe and glebo, will alſo punctually pay the annual ſum of £ 30 ſterling to the miſſionary; and ſo much, at leaſt, I believe, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>promiſed</hi> at the time of the application for the ſociety's bounty. But in what manner it is <hi>performed</hi> by ſome congregations; whether it is done wholly, or with that <hi>punctuality</hi> which is neceſſary; it concerns all thoſe, who have thus ſtipulated, and have any regard to their juſt and formal engagements, as honeſt men and as Chriſtians ſeriouſly to conſider.</note>;
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012008_0031_0F893FF230BAD698"/>
a few moments attention to their caſe will convince men of <hi>liberal</hi> ſentiments, who perhaps are the only competent judges. When I declare that our main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is generally deficient, I mean, that it is not an adequate compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the expences we have been at in preparing ourſelves for this ſervice; —that it does not allow us to devote ourſelves intirely to the buſineſs of our functions;—and that it does not enable us to leave our families in comfortable circumſtances when we are taken away from them.</p>
            <p>THE expences attending our education for the miniſtry may be eaſily imagined. It requires the application of many years, to make a tolerable proficiency in the learned languages: a long time is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſpent by us in other academical improvements: and theſe ought always to be ſucceeded, as I truſt they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are, by a courſe of theological ſtudies
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012008_0032_0F893FF2F0AA8AB8"/>
—before we preſume to offer ourſelves as candidates for holy orders. During the two former of theſe periods, that is, during the long time of our claſſical and academi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal education, beſides food and apparel ſuitable to our ſtations, inſtruction muſt be paid for, and many books muſt be purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When we are ready to offer ourſelves for the ſervice of the church, which muſt be at an age <note n="*" place="bottom">By the ſtatute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and by <hi>Canon</hi> xxxiv, none can be admitted to <hi>Prieſt</hi>'s orders under the age of 24 years. No diſpenſation is allowed of.</note> when men may have been long ſettled in any other employment, there is ſtill a heavy load of expence (to <hi>whoſe</hi> reproach ſhall I ſpeak it? for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it certainly is;) to be ſuſtained, in a voyage to a diſtant quarter of the globe for ordination. This laſt expence, heavy as it is, is a hardſhip peculiar to the candidates of our own church in the colonies; and ſuch an one as, I am perſuaded, is not to be paralleled in the annals of hiſtory.</p>
            <p>THOSE of us who live to return from this voyage (for it has proved fatal to the lives of many of our candidates) <note n="†" place="bottom">Particularly of meſſrs. Bradſtreet, Brown, Miner, Dean, Checkley, Colton, Johnſton, Uſher, Giles and Wilſon.</note> are fixed in pariſhes or miſſions, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012008_0033_0F893FF3AFC1DC50"/>
of which are greatly inferior to the profits of other callings, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not more than half the time, nor ſo much as half the expence, to prepare for them. With theſe incomes we are expected to live, as other people in public and reputable ſtations live—to be not behind them in ſhewing hoſpitality —and to be the very foremoſt in every work of charity. If we anſwer not theſe expectations, many will impute it to avarice, to churliſhneſs, or to any thing, rather than to its true cauſe. If ſuch an opinion of us once gets abroad, perhaps the whole order is reproached with us; at leaſt, our own miniſtrations are ſlighted, and the intereſt of religion proportionably ſuffers.</p>
            <p>IT is not within the power of many of us to avoid theſe evils. We are not allowed to call in to our aid any ſecular employ, one only perhaps excepted, for which but few of us are qualified; nor indeed can we eaſily find leiſure, from the important buſineſs of our ſacred profeſſion, to purſue one. Such of us therefore as have any independent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of our own, find it neceſſary to expend from it; and the reſt of us are obliged to ſhift as well as we can. In
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012008_0034_0F893FF4701C0270"/>
the mean while, as to ourſelves, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a reward in a better country will greatly ſupport our ſpirits under our hard fortune in this; but ſtill it muſt neceſſarily give us pain to conſider, what may become of our poor widows and children, after our departure.</p>
            <p>IMAGINATION can hardly picture to itſelf ſcenes of deeper diſtreſs, than are ſometimes really to be found in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of clergymen, when the ſource that ſupplied them is at once dried up. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of their ſupport—deprived of their habitations—turned abroad to the world, <hi>wounded,</hi> and <hi>half-dead,</hi> in a more piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſenſe than the traveller bound from Jeruſalem to Jericho was <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> x. 30.</note>; their condition is ſuch, as would move the compaſſion even of a Samaritan. How then muſt it affect every tender, humane and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous heart in this Chriſtian aſſembly! Indigence is terrible in all caſes; but when it ſucceeds fulneſs of bread—when it comes ſuddenly—when it falls upon perſons of delicate ſenſibility <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <q>The cauſes of pleaſure and pain are relative things: and in order to eſtimate truly their effect upon any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſubject, they ought to be drawn into the <hi>degrees of perception</hi> in that ſubject. When the cauſe is of the ſame kind, and acts with an equal force, if the perception of one perſon be equal to that of another, what they perceive muſt needs be equal. And ſo it will likewiſe be, when the forces in the producing cauſes and the degrees of perception in the ſentiments are reciprocal. For (which doth not ſeem to be conſidered by the world, and therefore ought the more particularly to be noted) if the cauſe of pleaſure or pain ſhould act but half as much upon A, as it does upon B; yet if the <hi>ſenſibility</hi> of A be double to that of B, the ſum of their pleaſures or pains will be equal. In other caſes they will be unequal.</q> 
                  <bibl>WOLLASTON.</bibl>

<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012008_0035_0F893FF530C78898"/>
their former way of life are peculiarly unable to help themſelves, it is more than doubly diſtreſſing.</p>
            <p>NOW, to remedy ſuch diſtreſs, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to prevent it as far as poſſible, which is ſtill a greater act of humanity; a <hi>corporation</hi> has been erected, conſiſting of the clergy in general, and gentlemen of the firſt rank and character in theſe three colonies; whoſe countenance and aſſiſtance, in this good work, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged with all gratitude. A fund is now eſtabliſhed by <hi>charter;</hi> to which the clergy themſelves are large annual ſubſcribers, and to which ſeveral gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous donations have been already made. That venerable ſociety, which is famed throughout the Chriſtian world for its charity—a charity, to which our church in theſe colonies, in a great meaſure, owes its exiſtence—contributes a yearly
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012008_0036_0F893FF5F0C23D20"/>
allowance of £ 60 ſterling. Collections have been made in ſeveral congregations, the largeneſs of which is not leſs honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them, than to this inſtitution. But notwithſtanding all that has been done, much remains ſtill to be done, in order to make our fund adequate to the purpoſe for which it is intended: and we muſt depend upon the farther kindneſs and compaſſion of our friends, to aſſiſt in making up the deficiency.</p>
            <p>AND in order to obtain it, can it be neceſſary to do more, than to give a plain and true repreſentation of the deſign? Can it be needful to make uſe of arguments or entreaties, to prevail with our friends, who are of the ſame <hi>houſhold</hi> with ourſelves, to aſſiſt us in a work, in which, at the ſame time, their own reputation is peculiarly concerned, as well as the honor of their religion?</p>
            <p>IT has been ſhewn, in this diſcourſe, that the clergy have an undoubted right to a comfortable maintenance for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their families; which right ought to take place, where the ſtate of a country will admit of it: yet, for want either of inclination or ability in their friends, that their maintenance is deficient in theſe colonies. But, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012008_0037_0F893F827292B378"/>
we relinquiſh the claim. We are not now contending for <hi>rights;</hi> nor do we demand any thing for ourſelves: we only requeſt your CHARITY, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome decent proviſion for the relief of our wives and children, when they ſhall come more ſenſibly to feel the bitter effects of that ill fortune which has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto attended us. We make this application and requeſt, in full confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of your humanity and compaſſion. We are perſuaded that you will not, that you cannot, diſregard ſo pitiable a caſe, and <hi>paſs by on the other ſide;</hi> a caſe, perhaps as worthy of your notice, of your friendly interpoſition, all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attended to, as the providence of GOD has ever called you to conſider.</p>
            <p>WE deſire you to do no more, on this occaſion, than what your abilities will fairly admit of—to give no more, than what you can conveniently ſpare, or what may eaſily be retrenched from the ſuperfluities of living; of which every man is allowed to judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And you may be aſſured, that whatever ſhall be given in this way will be faithfully applied, if not for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſupport of the clergy themſelves, yet for the ſupport of thoſe who are as
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012008_0038_0F893FF6AE79F300"/>
dear to them as themſelves, when they ſhall need it moſt. Whatever is given in this way will therefore lay <hi>us</hi> under equal obligations, with what is given to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>AND, at the laſt day, when all our accounts, both of juſtice and charity, ſhall be publickly <hi>audited,</hi> each of us will make the acknowledgment, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to what you ſhall contribute to this fund, for the relief of our widows and children: <hi>inaſmuch as ye have done it unto my little ones,</hi> whom I left behind me in a helpleſs condition, and to her who was moſt dear to me on earth, <hi>ye have done it unto me.</hi> The like acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment will alſo be made by one, whom you are under infinitely greater obligations to regard; even <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> when <hi>he ſhall appear,</hi> ſurrounded with <hi>his Angels,</hi> and ſeated on the throne of his glory <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> xxv.</note>.</p>
            <p>THAT our conduct on this, and all other occaſions, may meet with appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation in that day, may GOD of his infinite mercy grant, through the merits and mediation of JESUS CHRIST, whoſe charity and compaſſion led him to die for us; to whom therefore, with the Father and Holy Ghoſt, be glory and dominion, adoration and praiſe, now and forever!</p>

            <p>THE PUBLIC has been already informed, that this charity is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the <hi>clergy in general</hi> and a number of very reſpectable gentlemen of the <hi>laity,</hi> who are incorporated for that purpoſe by three diſtinct charters of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tenor, veſting the ſame members with all the powers requiſite for the diſcharge and execution of this benevolent truſt, in the three provinces of <hi>New-York, New-Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> A
<q>public and grateful teſtimony has been given of that readineſs and cheerfulneſs, with which the ſeveral governors conſented to the grant of theſe charters in their reſpective provinces.</q>
And the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the corporation do, further, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledge themſelves indebted to the officers of government in theſe

provinces, for their kindneſs and generoſity in refuſing to accept the fees, to which, on that occaſion, they were by law intitled. The following is a copy of the charter granted by his Excellency the governor of New-Jerſey.</p>
            <p>GEORGE the third, by the grace of GOD, of Great-Britain, France and Ireland, King, defender of the faith, and ſo forth; TO all to whom theſe preſents ſhall come GREETING. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it hath been repreſented unto us, that the clergy of the church of England in our American colonies, and eſpecially the miſſionaries in the ſervice of the ſociety for the propagation of the goſpel in foreign parts, have in general but a ſmall ſupport, and have always found it difficult to make any tolerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for their families, ſo that their widows and children are often left in great diſtreſs; and whereas, in order to provide a remedy for theſe growing diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, humble application hath been made to us, that we would erect and conſtitute a corporation in our province of New-Jerſey, for receiving managing and diſpoſing ſuch ſums of money as may be ſubſcribed and paid in from time

               <p n="3">III. IN order to have a certainty, both as to the quantum, as well as the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the annual rates, each contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſhall abide by that rate or claſs

And if an occaſional meeting of the corporation ſhould be found at any time neceſſary, and the ſtanding committee of buſineſs, to be appointed agreeably to the rules of the ſociety, ſhould apply in writing to the preſident of the corporation,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012008_0057_0F894005AEAC68F8"/>
to call ſuch meeting at any particular place within the ſaid three provinces, the preſident ſhall call ſuch occaſional meeting at the place requeſted by the committee, giving ſuch public notice thereof, by the ſecretary, as is directed above. And at all ſuch meetings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſional or ſtated, any number of members met, not being leſs than fifteen, ſhall have power to make by-laws, and in general, ſhall have all the powers granted by charter to this corporation, other than the making, altering or repealing funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental laws and regulations; provided always, that when any part of the ſtock of the corporation is to be diſpoſed of, or any augmentation of annuities to be made, the ſame ſhall be expreſſed in the previous public notices hereby directed to be given of ſuch meetings.</p>

                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:012008_0058_0F8940066F067B90"/>ALTHOUGH the foregoing laws and regulations were enacted upon as full and mature deliberation as the time would admit, yet, upon reconſidering them carefully the next day, when the number of members preſent was not ſufficient to authorize any alteration or amendment, ſome things, relative to the payments to be made by thoſe of the clergy whoſe widows and children were to be intitled to annuities, ſeeming to have been tacitly <hi>implied,</hi> which ought rather to have been fully <hi>expreſſed,</hi> in order to prevent any future miſapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſenſe of thoſe articles; it was therefore thought expedient, that an <hi>explanatory article</hi> ſhould be added, to be agreed to and ſubſcribed by all the clergy preſent, and, in future, by every clergyman who ſhould become a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributor, in order to intitle his widow and children to an annuity from this fund; until ſuch time as a majority of the members of the corporation ſhould again be met, to give this explanatory article, ſuch further ſanction as might be thought neceſſary.

a contributor, in order that his <hi>widow</hi> and <hi>children</hi> may be intitled to an <hi>annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> at <hi>his deceaſe,</hi> is <hi>to continue the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his yearly contribution during his life,</hi> and <hi>not to ſtop at the end of fifteen years</hi>; the whole calculations being on the principle of payments for life. And they further declare their ſenſe of the articles to be, that if any clergyman ſhould die in arrears of his annual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>all his arrears, with the penalty of one penny in the pound per day,</hi> are to be <hi>deducted out of the annuity</hi> payable to the widow and children.</p>

               <p>BY the foregoing laws and regulations a plan was ſettled for the management and diſpoſition of a fund, that was, partly, to ariſe from the <hi>ſtated contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of thoſe whoſe families were to be intitled to relief and aſſiſtance from it. Theſe contributions of the clergy are conſidered as the annual ſavings of a ſtrict and ſevere economy, laid out in the purchaſe of ſmall annuities, to be kept in reſerve for their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in caſe they ſhould come to be <hi>widows</hi> and <hi>orphans.</hi> To ſuch a fund, where the parties to be benefited by it were themſelves to exert their utmoſt ability towards its eſtabliſhment, it could
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012008_0060_0F894007EE7B4AC0"/>
not be doubted that large additions would be made by the generoſity and charity of the benevolent and tender-hearted; eſpecially as the wants and diſtreſſes of thoſe, who by this inſtitution are to be relieved and aſſiſted, could not fail to have been <hi>peculiarly</hi> intereſting and affecting to perſons of humanity and ſenſibility. Two years, only, and a few months, have paſſed ſince the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was erected; and the members of it have the pleaſure to acknowledge, that they are already indebted to the worthy and humane, for as much aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as could have been expected in ſo ſhort a time; and they are encouraged to promiſe themſelves a continuance of the public favor to the excellent charity, which they have undertaken to manage and conduct.</p>
               <p>IT was intended, that a full account of the benefactions, received during the former year, ſhould have been annexed to the ſermon, preached before the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration at New-York, and publiſhed, at their requeſt, by the Revd. Dr. <hi>Auch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muty;</hi> to whom ſuch an account was accordingly tranſmitted by the ſecretary: but, by ſome accident, it was loſt. This occaſioned the omiſſion of ſeveral articles,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:012008_0061_0F894008AE1706C8"/>
which, otherwiſe, would have been then acknowledged. A general account is, therefore, here inſerted, of the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and aſſiſtance hitherto received by the corporation; who now return their ſincere thanks for the following benefactions, which, as nearly as it could be aſcertained, are mentioned accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order of time in which they were received.</p>

               <p>BESIDES the benefactions above ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, it remains to mention one, which (though not yet come to hand) is no leſs intitled to the public thanks of the corporation. At the annual meeting in <hi>New-York,</hi> October 2d, 1770, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee being named, to deviſe a proper ſeal for the corporation, <hi>Jocob Le Roy</hi> Eſq. offered to pay the expence of any ſeal that ſhould be agreed upon, the price not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ten guineas. This generous offer was politely accepted by the board; and
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012008_0064_0F89400BAE6DF0C8"/>
a ſeal was accordingly ordered, and is daily expected from <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND here alſo it is, with pleaſure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the ſincere thanks of the corporation are due to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Thomas Wharton,</hi> rector of St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s at <hi>Bridgetown,</hi> in <hi>Barbados;</hi> who, on the firſt intelligence he received of this chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table inſtitution, warmly intereſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in its behalf, ſoliciting his brethren and acquaintance, in that Iſland, to join with him in contributing
<q>to ſo lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo worthy an undertaking.</q>
Such are the terms in which he expreſſes his approbation of the ſcheme, and his zeal for its ſucceſs, in a letter to Dr. Smith, dated ſo early as May, 1770; in which he intimates to the corporation his hope of procuring ſome conſiderable contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to their fund. The corporation have not yet received any direct account of the ſucceſs of his application; but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and zeal with which it has been ſeconded and ſupported by the <hi>clergy,</hi> and by many of the principal gentlemen of the <hi>laity.</hi> in Barbados, appear from the following advertiſement, which was lately inſerted, for ſeveral weeks together, in the Barbados Mercury.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:012008_0065_0F89400C730245F8"/>The benevolent and humane are acquainted, that a ſubſcription has been opened for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the widows and orphans of the clergy of the eſtabliſhed church in North-America, and that the members of the aſſembly, and ſeveral other principal gentlemen of the Iſland, have been pleaſed to encourage the laudable ſcheme, by cheerfully contributing to the charitable deſign. Notice therefore is hereby given, that the ſeveral clergymen of the Iſland will receive ſubſcriptions, from ſuch of their pariſhioners as will be pleaſed to offer their bounty; and the ſums ſubſcribed will be duly tranſmitted, by Henry Duke Eſq. and the Rev. Thomas Wharton.</p>
