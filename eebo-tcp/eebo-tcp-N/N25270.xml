            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SINCE this volume was written, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of Mr. Adams with France hath reached a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis. The directory diſmiſſed with diſdain our triple Braintree embaſſy. The robbery of American ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping has burſt into tenfold magnitude; and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident's boſom beats with rapture at the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſummation of his wiſhes. Oppoſed as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending partiſans, the republic might addreſs this moſt infatuated of all ſtateſmen in the language of the poet,
<q>
                  <l>One look from Crononhotonthologos</l>
                  <l>Shall ſtare thee into nothing!</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The French may begin by blockading American ſeaports with ten or twelve frigates. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the merchants lay up their ſhipping. Their bills are proteſted by quires. The counting houſes are deſerted. The jails are crouded. Stocks tumble to forty per cent. below par. The banks bolt their doors. Hard money vaniſhes. Drays un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yoked rot by dozens on every wharf. The treaſury ſuſpends payment, and cannot borrow a ſhilling; becauſe, after deducting import duties, its own expences, and the intereſt of public debt, become twelve times greater than the public income<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide American Annual Regiſter.</note>. Of courſe the federal government expires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:033485_0003_0FF71EDAB1EB7AE0"/>Mr. Sitgreaves ſpoke of dying in the laſt ditch. If Jourdan diſembarks at Newcaſtle, he may find an excellent opportunity for dying in the <hi>firſt</hi> ditch. We have nine hundred thouſand negroes ripe for inſurrection; and not a ſingle fort fit to be the pigeon-houſe of a Flanders baſtion. Even the Alps and Pyrenees have been ſcaled in their moſt inacceſſible faſtneſſes; while five years of French victory have eclipſed five centuries of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fame. Many people ſay that the United States are popular in France, and that the government dares not to declare war. This argument is only fit for a drowning ideot catching at a ſtraw. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory need but to print a few columns from Mr. Fenno's gazette, and the charm is diſſolved. At the end of the conteſt in Europe, France will overflow with turbulent veterans, and a diſtant expedition may very likely be planned, merely for the ſake of ſending them out of the country.</p>
            <p>All men of property are intereſted in perſuading Mr. Adams immediately to retire from office. An hundred thouſand, or even a million of dollars, would be wiſely beſtowed to purchaſe his reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if the ſenate of the fifth congreſs ſhall give that example, they will act as the <hi>negative</hi> ſaviours of their country.</p>

Of theſe, at leaſt nine millions are comprehended in America<note n="*" place="bottom">Carey's American Edition of Guthrie's Geographical Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, vol. I. p. 36.</note>. This area is about ninety times larger than that of Britain and Ireland, which poſſeſs a population of fourteen millions. When the forge, and the plough ſhall have ſtretched their dominion to the ſources of the Miſſouri, when a regular body of civilized nations, extending from the St. Laurence to Patagonia, ſhall cheer and gladden the ſurface of the earth, America may, without difficulty, ſupport a thouſand millions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; or moſt likely, a much greater number.</p>
               <p>Though this continent hath been diſcovered for three centuries, it is yet but imperfectly known to the nations of Europe. Travellers, in deſcribing it, have aſſumed their wonted privileges of embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſtortion. The ſtrangeſt fables have been circulated and believed, with regard to its climate, its aſpect, its natural productions, and the manners of its people.</p>
               <p>When an American opens one of thoſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous deſcriptions of this country, that are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Europe, he is commonly ſtruck with the multiplicity of miſtakes that occur in almoſt every page. To give an accurate account of any country requires a conſiderable ſhare both of induſtry and accuteneſs. But peculiar difficulties attend this taſk, on the weſtern ſide of the Atlantic. The habits of the people are more various and fluctuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than in regions which have been long and thickly ſettled. Alterations and improvements of all kinds advance with ſuch rapidity, at leaſt in the territory of the United States, that what was, five years before, a juſt picture, often differs widely from the preſent condition of the ſame territory.

The immenſe extent of the continent preſents ſuch a variety of temptations to the forming of new ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, theſe are ſo widely diverſified from each other, in their ſituation, climate, and produce, and ſuch numbers of people are conſtantly retiring backwards from the eaſtern coaſt, into the receſſes of the wilderneſs, that many years muſt paſs over before it can be poſſible to ſketch a picture of America, which will remain for any conſiderable time, an exact reſemblance of the original<note n="*" place="bottom">A farmer of Kentucky, ſometime ago, mentioned in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, that he had reſided in that ſtate, for about eighteen months.

               <p>As a ſpecimen of the ſtrange miſrepreſentations, with regard to America, which are current in Europe, a few paſſages ſhall be here ſelected from ſome of the books popular in that part of the world. Dr. Robertſon informs us that, <q>Over all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of North-America, a north-weſterly wind and <hi>exceſſive cold</hi> are ſynonimous terms. Even in <hi>the moſt ſultry weather,</hi> the moment that the wind veers to that quarter, its penetrating influence is felt in a tranſition from heat to cold no leſs violent than ſudden.

               <p>Charlevoix is quoted as an authority for this tale. When he wrote it, he muſt have been thinking of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033485_0011_0FF71EF1B38D99F0"/>
the north-weſt wind of Canada, through which he travelled. He did not viſit the Britiſh colonies; ſo that he could not ſay whether ſuch a phenomenon prevailed in them or not. From extravagant accounts of this kind, it is not ſurpriſing that the people of Europe form an alarming idea of the American climate. To the greater part of the territory of the United States, perhaps to the whole of it, this deſcription bears no reſemblance. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levoix wrote above ſeventy years ago; and even though his account had been accurate for that time, yet the climate has ſince undergone great alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. Mr. Jefferſon relates<note n="*" place="bottom">Notes on Virginia. ART. CLIMATE.</note>, that formerly the ſnows in Virginia covered the ground, for about three months in every winter, but that now, in the lower parts of the country, they very ſeldom lie aweek. He remarks, that, <q>In Virginia, both heats and colds have become much more moderate with in the memory even of the middle-aged.</q> Dr. Robert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon mentions a prodigious froſt, at Charleſton, in South-Carolina, in February, 1747. For many years paſt, ſnow and ice have been hardly ſeen in that city.</p>
               <p>The ſame hiſtorian attempts to explain the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive cauſe of the extreme degree of cold in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. His reaſonings appear to be ſomewhat incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent. As to the northern extremity of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent he obſerves that, <q>though the utmoſt extent of America towards the north be not yet diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we know that it advances nearer to the pole than <hi>either Europe or Aſia.</hi> The latter have large ſeas to the north, which are open during part of the year; and even when covered with ice, the wind that blows over them is leſs intenſely cold <hi>than that which blows over land</hi> in the the ſame high la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes. But in America the land ſtretches from the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033485_0012_0FF71EF3471D3678"/>
river St. Laurence towards the pole, and ſpreads out immenſely to the weſt. A chain of enormous mountains, covered with ſnow and ice, runs thro' all this dreary region<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtory of America. Book IV.</note>.</q> He goes on to aſcribe the peculiar ſeverity of the north-weſt American winds to their blowing over <q>ſuch an extent of high and frozen <hi>land.</hi>
                  </q> The reſult of his inquiry is, that the climate of North-America is more cold than that of Europe becauſe the land is broader and approaches nearer to the north pole. The doctor has omitted to give us any reaſon, why a wind that blows over <hi>frozen land</hi> muſt be colder than another which blows over <hi>a frozen ſea;</hi> ſo that his theory of explanation reſts on a mere aſſumption. But let us admit the juſtice of his aſſertion, that the northern extremity of the continent is <hi>colder</hi> than that of Europe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>broader,</hi> and advances <hi>nearer to the pole.</hi> We are certain then, that the ſouthern extremity of America, muſt be a great deal warmer than the ſame latitude in Europe; for the land approaches only within thirty four degrees of the ſouth pole, that is, to the latitude of Dunbar, a town in the ſouth-eaſtern part of Scotland. The continent, beſides, is very <hi>narrow;</hi> and its ſituation is indeed a perfect contraſt to the northern extremity. But here again, the author takes up a quite different doctrine. <q>The moſt obvious and probable cauſe of this ſuperior degree of cold towards the ſouthern extremity of America, ſeems to be the <hi>form of the continent there.</hi> Its breadth gradually <hi>decreaſes,</hi> and its dimenſions are <hi>much contracted.</hi>
                  </q> This hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis he explains in a long note. Thus in one end of America, the <hi>breadth,</hi> and in another end the <hi>narrowneſs</hi> of the continent, is advanced as a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical explanation of extreme cold.</p>

                  <q>Another peculiarity in the climate of America is its <hi>exceſſive moiſture in general.</hi> In ſome places, indeed, on the weſtern coaſt, rain is not known; but in all other parts, the moiſtneſs of the climate is as remarkable as the cold. The foreſts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is every where covered, no doubt, partly, occaſion the moiſture of its climate; but the moſt prevalent and obvious cauſe is the vaſt, and Pacific Oceans, with which America is <hi>environed on all ſides</hi>

In the Gentleman's Magazine, for February 1793, there is an article, dated the 27th of that month, which may ſerve to aſſiſt us, in forming ideas on this point. "The climate of England," ſays the writer, <q>in the opinion of many, has, of late years, undergone a conſiderable change. Formerly we uſed to have ſmart froſts in winter; and hot and ſometimes <hi>dry ſummers.</hi> For ſome years back, both winters and ſummers have <hi>generally been wet,</hi> with ſo little ice, that luxury, by its agents, has been obliged to procure it from foreign parts. In the courſe of laſt year, thoſe who kept a regiſter of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033485_0014_0FF71EFADE8310D0"/>
the weather, tell us, there were but <hi>one hundred and three dry days!</hi> For the little that is paſſed of the preſent year, we have ſcarcely had ſix dry days.</q> It is not eaſy to conceive a more dreadful picture of the atmoſphere of any part of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate zones, than what is here ſet before us. As it comes from the Engliſh themſelves, and is atteſted in a reſpectable publication, it would be trifling to doubt of its general accuracy. Nor is ſuch a quantity of rain and moiſture a novelty, as the author ſeems to hint, in the Britiſh iſlands. <q>We have rain, ſays a proverb, for nine months in the year, and wet weather for all the reſt of it.</q> Even Americans ſeem to have adopted an erroneous opinion reſpecting the comparative moiſture of their climate. Dr. Morſe has obſerved, that, <q>the quantity of rain which falls in England annually is computed to be twenty four inches; in France eighteen inches, and in New-England from forty-eight to fifty inches; and yet in New-England they ſuffer more from drought than in either of the fore-mentioned countries, although they have <hi>more than double</hi> the quantity of rain."<note n="*" place="bottom">American Univerſal Geography, vol. I. p. 310.</note> In New-England they ſuffer more from drought,</q> becauſe there is not one-half, nor, perhaps, one-ſixth part of the rain annually that falls in England; where, as we have ſeen above, there is rain for five days in the week. If double the quantity of rain actually fell in New-England, it would follow, as a neceſſary conſequence, that every day in the year muſt be wet; but on the contrary, weeks together often paſs in New-England without a ſingle ſhower.</p>
               <p>The American climate is colder than that of European countries under the ſame latitudes, where the woods have been cleared, and the ſoil culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated for many centuries. But this implies not, as it
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033485_0015_0FF71EFC6E953F48"/>
has been ignorantly pretended, any ſingular malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the climate of the new world. France, Italy, and Spain, were much colder, in ancient times, than at preſent, and for the very ſame reaſon. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levoix even ſays, that the French ſettlers in Canada conſidered the climate as improved by the very ſlight degree of cultivation which exiſted in that province, about ſeventy years ago. Our thick and boundleſs foreſts prevent the rays of the ſun from penetrating to the ſurface of the earth; hence the ſnow cannot diſſolve ſo quickly, as in an open country. The north-weſt wind ruſhing over ſo vaſt a tract of ice and ſnow, ſtill further cools the air. But this wind is only felt extremely cold, while ſnow covers the ground. Whatever may formerly have been the caſe, the ſtate of Pennſylvania, and the others to the ſouthward, feel at preſent very little inconvenience from it. <q>In the moſt ſultry weather,</q> it is extremely ſalutary and refreſhing, and not an object of terror, as Dr. Robertſon, and ſome other writers have repreſented it to be<note n="*" place="bottom">In an Engliſh verſion of Chaſtellux's Travels, there is a note ſubjoined, by the tranſlator, which contains theſe words, <q>In the middle of the hotteſt day in July, or Auguſt, where the heat was ſo intolerable as almoſt to prevent reſpiration, I have frequently known the wind ſhift ſuddenly round to the north-weſt, attended with a blaſt, ſo cold and humid, as to make it immediately neceſſary to ſhut all the doors and windows, and light large fires.</q> Vol. II. p. 52. This is a very high degree of colouring. That heat ſhould be ſo exceſſive, in this country, as to endanger reſpiration, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what next to incredible. The ſummer of 1793, was the hotteſt remembered in Philadelphia, for many years paſt; yet there was no difficulty in reſpiration. This writer acknowledges, in the ſame note, that the climate is improving ſo rapidly as to make the change ſtrikingly perceptible in a few years. In his ſecond volume, a note appears reſpecting the young men and women of Philadelphia, which is ſo very indecent, as well as untrue, that it cannot admit of an extract.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of two or three generations, at fartheſt, the climate will correſpond with that under
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033485_0016_0FF71EFEF627B948"/>
the ſame degree of latitude in Europe. Many tracts of land, that now lie buried in ſnow, for ſix months of the year, will then rival the fineſt regions of the world. Quebec ſtands a degree and fifty-five minutes to the ſouth of Paris, Halifax, in Nova-Scotia, four degrees and ten minutes to the ſouth of it, and only one degree and four minutes north of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelier in Languedoc. Montreal is but ten minutes north of Milan in Italy, and one degree and fifty-nine minutes north of Montpelier. Philadelphia is only two minutes north from the ſame latitude with Pekin in China; and in this city, for half of the year, we enjoy delightful weather. Even the coldeſt winters are conſidered as the moſt healthy. In autumn, for a month together, there is frequently not a ſingle cloud to be ſeen, while a regular and plentiful dew ſupercedes the fear of drought. At the ſame time of the year, the rains of Britain fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently continue during a conſiderable time, for ſix days in the week, and rot the harveſt, while Britiſh philoſophers are gravely employed in deſcribing and deprecating the malignant moiſture of America. In Pennſylvania, aſthmatic complaints are ſaid to be leſs frequent than in Britain, which is a neceſſary conſequence from the ſuperior mildneſs and purity of our ſky. The climate of London is ſuppoſed to be equal to that of moſt other parts of England, and is certainly much better than that of ſome counties, ſuch as Lancaſter and Cornwall. Yet from a writer there, we learn that of the firſt fifty-eight days in the year 1793, hardly ſix were dry. We are told, on the ſame authority, that in the year 1792, England had two hundred and ſixty-two days of rain, which is more than a proportion of five days in the week. The Britiſh climate alſo is thought to be growing worſe; while it is remarked all over this continent, that ours is conſtantly grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033485_0017_0FF71F0490C390A0"/>
better. Marſhes are every where begun to be drained. Whole foreſts are daily cut down. The free circulation of air is thus promoted, while an exuberance of moiſture is checked. Ten times more land is now cleared in one year, than was cleared in the ſame ſpace of time before the war of 1756. We may infer that the improvement of the climate will hear ſomething like an equally augmented proportion. Hence it is weak in a modern hiſtorian, to refer implicitly, upon this head, to writers of fifty or an hundred years old. He ought to enquire with diligence how circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances actually exiſt. A literary man is apt to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he knows much, when he has only read much. He finds twenty different travellers concur in aſſerting that the climate of a diſtant country is extremely intemperate. Like Dr. Robertſon, he reſts with confidence on ſuch complicated atteſtations, though, perhaps, three-fourths of theſe writers have only tranſcribed the opinions of each other.</p>
               <p>The beſt evidence of the ſalubrity of an atmoſphere is derived from the ſuperior good health of its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants and, excepting the low lands, towards the ſea, in Delaware, and the ſouthern ſtates, the continent may, in this reſpect, bear a favourable compariſon with Europe. This fact will be beſt illuſtrated by examining the proportion of births to that of deaths, in the two continents.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barton <note n="*" place="bottom">American Philoſophical Tranſactions, vol. III. p. 25, et feq.</note> has collected a variety of eſtimates of this kind for particular periods of time, from which are ſelected a few ſpecimens.</p>

               <p>There is a copious collection of eſtimates of this kind, which aſcertain, that the number of births is in proportion to the number of deaths much greater in North-America than in Europe. Mr. Barton has likewiſe printed comparative tables of the longe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the inhabitants of Britain and America; and it appears that the advantage is not on the ſide of the former country. In Connecticut, ſeventy-four perſons, out of every thouſand who are born, ſurvive the age of eighty years; whereas, at North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton in England, only forty ſurvive that period; and at Norwich in the ſame country, but thirty-one. The citizens of the northern and middle ſtates of this continent may reſt perfectly ſatisfied by the conviction, that they have an equal chance for health and long life, with the natives of any other quarter of the globe. To complaints of heat and cold, theſe calculations give a ſatisfactory anſwer.</p>
               <p>Dr. Robertſon tells us, that <q>the vaſt number, as well as <hi>enormous</hi> ſize of the trees in America, indicate the extraordinary vigour of the ſoil in its native ſtate.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtory of America. Book IV.</note>

In fact, a very large propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of American trees are of the common ſize
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033485_0019_0FF67B86B16E1168"/>
of thoſe in the old world, and there are ſtill to be ſeen in England, the remains of ſeveral very ancient oaks, of a greater magnitude than any trees yet heard of in America. Some of theſe, indeed, riſe to a larger bulk than is uſual in Europe, but in general, the difference in this reſpect is only trifling. In America, vegetation is more vigorous than in the Britiſh iſlands, and a tree has acquired in this country a greater magnitude in twenty years than it can generally reach in England during forty years.</p>
               <p>There is a common ſuppoſition, among the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the old world, concerning the woods of America, which has been countenanced by Dr. Robertſon: <q>As trees and plants derive a great part of their nouriſhment from, air and water, if they were not deſtroyed by man and other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, they would render to the earth more, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, than they take from it, and feed rather than impoveriſh it.

               <p>This ſource of American fecundity is chimerical. It is true that here, as in the old world, the foreſts ſhed their leaves during autumn, and theſe cover the ground in prodigious quantities, but without forming or perceptibly deepening the ſoil. When theſe leaves are turned up to the depth of four, ſix, or perhaps twelve inches, the ſurface of the earth is frequently found heaped with naked ſtones, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out almoſt a ſingle mark of vegetation; and this is, ſometimes, the caſe for whole miles together. What, then, has become of thoſe immenſe maſſes of vegetable putrefaction that have been heaped on the ground for at leaſt four thouſand years? Or where is that peculiar mould of earth, formed by thoſe leaves, of which the writers in Europe are
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033485_0020_0FF71F0B42026B68"/>
ſpeaking? The proper anſwer ſeems to be, that they do not exiſt. In Europe, a large extent of country is often covered with foreſts, and when the land has been cleared, the ſoil is frequently found barren. But if the rotting of the falling leaves in America forms a mould of peculiar fertility, the ſame cauſes muſt in Europe have produced the ſame conſequences. As in that continent, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, no ſuch conſequences are to be met with, a moderate degree of reflexion might have convinced the advocates of this idea, that the ſame caſe muſt happen in America. Many tracts of this country are entirely diveſted of trees, and yet are equally fertile with any other part of the continent. By this ſyſtem, however they ſhould have been compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively barren. Beſides, a doctrine of this kind leads to extravagant concluſions. If the fall of leaves is to deepen the ſoil at all, we may at leaſt allow an additional depth of the twentieth part of an inch annually, or five inches in the courſe of a century. At the end of four thouſand years, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the earth in North-America, ſhould, by this calculation, have been bedded with a mould to the depth of two hundred inches, or upwards of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen feet and an half. But no perſon will affirm, that ſuch a depth of ſoil is, perhaps, any where to be found. It is in vain to fabricate plauſible theories in oppoſition to the teſtimony of the human ſenſes; nor is it of the ſmalleſt weight, that ſuch a doctrine may have been adorned by the combined eloquence of Raynal, Robertſon, and Buffon.</p>
               <p>As an evidence of the malignity of the American atmoſphere, it has been remarked, by Dr. Robert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the animals in this country, when diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Columbus, were leſs various in their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies than thoſe of the old world. <q>Nature was not only leſs <hi>prolific</hi> in the new world, but ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

likewiſe to have been leſs vigorous in her productions. The animals, <hi>originally</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this quarter of the globe, appear to be of an inferior race, neither ſo robuſt, nor ſo fierce, as thoſe of the other continent. America <hi>gives birth</hi> to no other creature of ſuch bulk as to be compared with the Elephant or rhinoceros, or that equals the lion and tyger in ſtrength and ferocity. The <hi>tapyr</hi> of Braſil, the quadruped of the <hi>firſt magnitude</hi> in the new world, is not larger than a calf of ſix months old. The <hi>puma</hi> and <hi>jaguar,</hi> its fierceſt beaſts of prey, which the Europeans have inaccurately denominated lions and tygers, poſſeſs neither the undaunted courage of the former, nor the ravenous cruelty of the latter. They are inactive and timid, hardly formidable to man, and often turn their backs upon the leaſt appearance of reſiſtance. (So much the better.) The ſame qualities in the climate of America which ſtinted the growth, and enfeebled the ſpirit of its <hi>native</hi> animals, have proved per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to ſuch as have <hi>migrated into it volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily</hi> from the other continent, or have been tranſported thither by the Europeans.

Mr. Jefferſon, in his Notes on Virginia, has fully vindicated the climate of America from theſe unjuſt imputations, and the reader will turn, with peculiar ſatisfaction, to a work, which unites the ſweetneſs of Xenophon with the force of Polybius, information without parade, and eloquence without effort. Mr. Williams, alſo, in his hiſtory of Vermont, proves, by a multitude of examples, that many animals in America exceed the bulk of the ſame ſpecies in the old world. Some places in this citation, deſerve particular notice.</p>
               <p>From the inſpired writings we learn, that, all quadrupeds, now on the face of the globe, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated from Aſia, after the deluge. It is hard then to ſay, what the writer means by <hi>animals originally belonging</hi> to this continent, and <hi>native</hi> animals; which he holds up in oppoſition to thoſe which have <hi>migrated into it voluntarily.</hi> If he ſuppoſes that the tapyr, the puma, and jaguar have been the produce of ſeparate creation, or that, as he expreſſes it, America has <hi>given birth</hi> to them, it is as likely that the bears, wolves, and deer, of America, have alſo been <hi>created</hi> in the new world. We are fortunate in wanting the ſtrength and perfection of the rhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceros, the lion, and the tyger, for we certainly never ſhould have been the better for them, But the mammoth alone was much larger than the elephant, the rhinoceros, and all the carnivorous quadrupeds put together. This is ſurely a ſufficient evidence of the vigour of nature. Mr. Jefferſon mentions an American biſon that weighed eighteen hundred pounds, a bear, four hundred and ten pounds, and a red deer, two hundred and eighty-eight pounds. He quotes Buffon, as admitting that the beaver, the otter, and ſhrew-mouſe, are <hi>larger in America than in Europe.</hi> The black mooſe, is ſaid by Kalm, to be as high as a tall horſe, and by Cateſbey, to be
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033485_0023_0FF71F12BAB41F38"/>
about the bigneſs of a middle-ſized ox. Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon adds, that the white bear is as large in America as in Europe. If the domeſtic animals of North-America are inferior to thoſe of Europe, it is only from want of care in thoſe who breed them. <q>It may be affirmed with truth, that in thoſe countries, and with thoſe individuals of America, where neceſſity or curioſity has produced equal attention, as in Europe, to the nouriſhment of animals, the horſes, cattle, ſheep, and hogs of the one continent are as large as thoſe of the other.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Notes on the State of Virginia. ART. PRODUCTIONS.</note> Buffon reckons two hundred and twenty-ſix different ſpecies of quadrupeds.

The labour of each child, <hi>before it can leave the houſe,</hi> is computed to be worth one hundred pounds <hi>clear goin</hi> to them. A young widow, with four or five young children, who, among the middling or inferior ranks of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Europe, would have little chance for a ſecond huſband, is there frequently conſidered as a ſort of fortune. The <hi>value</hi> of children is the greateſt of all inducements to marriage. We cannot, therefore, wonder that the people in North America ſhould generally marry <hi>very young.</hi> Notwithſtanding the great increaſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by ſuch early marriages, there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual complaint of the ſcarcity of hands in North-America.</q>

of the ſea-port towns of the United States, where ſubſiſtence has univerſally become very expenſive, as in any part of England. Yet, ſuch marriages occaſionally take place in both countries. In the country, where food may be had for a trifle, an American farmer might not be much afraid of ſuch an incumbrance with a wife, yet he would conſider four or five children to be one. The value of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, regarded merely as working machines, would be an idle motive to matrimony, ſince it would be more expedient to hire ſervants. The preſent generation is ſufficiently diſpoſed to leave another behind it; but not for the money that is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by rearing of children. As to the great increaſe by ſuch early marriages, in a conſiderable portion, at leaſt, of this continent, marriages are not perceptibly more early than in Europe, or, if a difference can be found, it is but ſmall. Mr. Barton, in the article before quoted, has made a large collection of the various amount of births in proportion to marriages, in France, England, Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, Switzerland, and other parts of Europe. For theſe four countries, the births are about four to every marriage, or ſomewhat leſs. He quotes the regiſter of marriages and births for a town in Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts, during the courſe of fifty-four years. The former amounted to five hundred and twenty-one, the latter to two thouſand two hundred and forty-ſeven. This gives four births to every mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, with an overplus of one hundred and ſixty-three, or leſs than one-third. But no ſingle inſtance can be a ſatisfactory evidence of the ſuperior num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of births to a marriage, for the whole of ſo vaſt a continent.</p>
               <p>One would imagine that, at leaſt, of the great ſea-port towns in America, the writers of Europe ſhould have a competent knowledge. This does not

Mr. Payne, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing Philadelphia, has favoured his readers with the following information, <q>It (the city) is ſeated between two navigable rivers, the Delaware on the <hi>weſt,</hi> and the <hi>Schuylkill</hi> on the <hi>eaſt.</hi> Every owner of a thouſand acres has his houſe in one of the two fronts facing <hi>the river,</hi> or in the high ſtreet, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the middle of one front to the middle of the other.—Several canals are let into the town from <hi>each river,</hi> which add to the beauty and convenience of the place.—Its <hi>quay</hi> is two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred feet ſquare.—The city contains about twenty thouſand inhabitants.</q>

                  <q>It cannot be ſaid, that the Indians originally invited us to their coaſts; we went uncalled, and unexpected, to nations who had no imagination that the earth contained any inhabitants ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and ſo different from themſelves.

               <p>The queſtion has been warmly debated, what right Europeans ever had to territories in America? When the Spaniards laid waſte populous and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized empires, the nature of their conduct needs no illuſtration. We ſhall here ſpeak only of the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of thoſe colonies, that are now compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the federal union. With regard to them, hiſtory will not ſupport or juſtify the harſh language that has been ſometimes employed.</p>
               <p>New-England contains nearly one-fifth, part of the people in the United States. It was originally colonized by perſons who conducted themſelves on the principles of ſtrict juſtice. In March, 1621, Maſaſſoit, one of the principal Indian chiefs, viſited the Plymouth ſettlers. He entered into a treaty with them. It was inviolably obſerved by himſelf and his ſucceſſors for fifty years; and, at this day, the name of Maſaſſoit is remembered in New-England with reſpect and gratitude. New-York was firſt planted by the Dutch; and this event does not ſeem to be marked by any ſtrong ſymptoms of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, or of fraud. The lands of Pennſylvania were honeſtly purchaſed from the Indians. They adhered peaceably to their bargain, and no third party is entitled to object againſt it. As to Virginia, Mr. Jefferſon, in his Notes, obſerves, <q>that the lands of this country were taken from them (the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives) by conqueſt, is not ſo general a truth as is
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033485_0029_0FF71F24292C5820"/>
ſuppoſed. I find, in our hiſtorians and records, repeated proofs of purchaſe, which cover a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the lower country; and many more would, doubtleſs, be found on further ſearch. The upper country we know has been acquired altogether by purchaſe, made <hi>in the moſt unexceptionable form.</hi>
                  </q> As for the other ſtates, we ſhall find, that, in general, the lands have been acquired at a price which was conſidered as adequate, by both parties. Subſequent breaches of treaty have been committed on each ſide. In conſequence, quarrels enſued, juſt as they do in Europe. They could not always be avoided here, any more than in the old world, unleſs the new ſettlers had deſerted their lands and left North-America to remain a wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>In ſome parts of Virginia, Mr. Jefferſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, that the Indians were as one to every ſquare mile. Other regions of the continent were ſtill more deſolate. Of this Dr. Robertſon gives the following inſtances. A miſſionary travelled from the Illinois to Machillimackinac. In twelve days, the party did not meet with a ſingle human creature. Dr. Brickell, in an excurſion from North-Carolina towards the mountains, did not, in the courſe of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days, meet any perſon whatever. The continent, with a few exceptions, contained, perhaps, not more than a thouſandth part of the people whom it was capable of ſubſiſting. Such vaſt tracts of excellent land ought not to lie waſte; and they never would have been peopled by the Indians. The Europeans purchaſed extenſive territories on the coaſt, and colonized them. If the natives found themſelves incommoded for want of room, they had it in their option to retire backwards into the deſart; where a hunter might range for a fortnight without meeting a rival. They had, therefore, no great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033485_0030_0FF71F26C799D8B8"/>
to be diſcontented. It might be ſaid, that they could ſubſiſt by hunting only, and that to deprive them of their hunting ground was to ſtarve them. We muſt admit, with many exceptions, the idea that their chief ſubſiſtence was derived from the chace. The tribes on the north and ſouth-weſtern frontier of the union, have large plantations of Indian corn, and raiſe cattle; ſo that they now, at leaſt, are in very little danger of ſtarving, though they ſhould never hunt at all. When general Sullivan marched into the country of the Six Nations, he found exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive orchards and cornfields. General Wayne, in Auguſt, 1794, declared, that the Miamis had the largeſt corn fields which he ever ſaw in America; and it has been ſaid, that they extended to five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand acres. Some writers indeed ſeem to think that it was culpable to take Indian lands, upon any terms, and expatiate on the trifling prices paid for them. But theſe lands are in reality worth very little to a tribe of hunters compared with their value to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of farmers and manufacturers. There is no harm in <hi>buying</hi> ground from an Indian community any more than from a private perſon in Europe. Why ſhould a tribe of two or three hundred hunters engroſs an extent of land equal to the ſupport of five hundred thouſand or a million of people? The Indians on our frontier are not, at preſent, famed for ſimplicity; as will appear in a future part of this volume.</p>
               <p>Mr. Guthrie, in his Geographical Grammar, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates the whole inhabitants of America at one hundred and fifty millions. This is a very wild miſtake. The amount may be aſcertained with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable accuracy. The ſubject is curious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our attention.</p>
               <p>By the cenſus of 1791, the United States contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, three millions, nine hundred and twenty-nine

thouſand, three hundred and twenty-ſix perſons; ſome diſtricts were not included. The whole, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Morſe, vol I. p. 207, may have been three millions, nine hundred and fifty thouſand. In 1784, Canada, by a cenſus, was found to have one hundred and thirteen thouſand and twelve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, beſides ten thouſand loyaliſts, in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts of the province. The total population of the Britiſh dominions of North-America can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceed two hundred thouſand. The native In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians may be gueſſed at an equal number; and the ſettlers in the Spaniſh part of North America, at an hundred thouſand. Theſe make together half a million. About ſeven years have elapſed, ſince the cenſus of the United States. The people may be now augmented by one million. Thus, if we allow five millions to the federal government, and five hundred thouſand to the Spaniards, the Britiſh, and Indians, we have, in whole, five millions, and an half. The empire of Mexico is divided into nine dioceſes; and in 1741, a cenſus was made of the people in four of theſe, and in ſome part of a fifth. The Indian families were two hundred and ninety-four thouſand, three hundred and ninety-one, which, at five to a family, make one million, four hundred and ſeventy-one thouſand nine hundred and fifty-five. Dr. Robertſon, who gives this ſtatement, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins, that in two of the dioceſes omitted, <q>the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian race is more numerous than <hi>in any</hi> (other) <hi>part of New Spain.</hi>
                  </q> In Nova Galicia, which he terms a vaſt province, the people, of only <q>a ſmall part of it,</q> were numbered.

in ſaying, that <q>the number of Indians in the Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican empire exceeds <hi>two</hi> millions.</q> By his own account, they muſt have been not leſs than three millions, in 1741, when this imperfect cenſus was made in four dioceſes only, and part of a fifth one, out of the whole nine. About fifty-three years have ſince elapſed. They are, upon the whole, increaſing, of which Dr. Smith has brought ſome evidence<note n="*" place="bottom">Inquiry into the Wealth of Nations, Book V. Chap. vii. Part II.</note>, ſo that by this time, they are, moſt likely, four millions. The other inhabitants of Mexico are, by the higheſt computation of Dr. Robertſon, three millions. Thus we have ſeven millions for Mexico, and Peru is not beleived to be more populous. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting theſe two empires to contain fourteen mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of inhabitants, and the other Spaniſh dominions on the continent of South-America two millions, we have thus ſixteen millions. Four millions will be ſufficient for Braſil and Paraguay. The reſt of that continent, a few ſpots excepted, is a deſart. Hence the total number of inhabitants in South-America does not amount to more than twenty millions, nor thoſe in North-America to more than five millions and an half; at leaſt the over-plus cannot be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of the United States have, by various calculations, been found to double upon a medium, in twenty-five years. Hence, in 1847, their preſent population of five millions will have extended to twenty, and in 1897, to eighty mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions. By the ſame progreſs, the cloſe of the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century would comprehend an augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to twelve hundred and eighty millions; and as, before that time, the northern continent muſt be over-ſtocked with people, the over-plus will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally find vent in the ſouthern continent. Under

many difficulties, the people of New-England, in particular, have continued for an hundred and fifty years to multiply in the preceding proportion; and there is no reaſon to think, that the ratio will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after decreaſe.</p>
               <p>Peru was conquered about two hundred and fifty years ago, and Mexico at a more early period. Since that time, theſe countries have remained in tranquillity; and yet it is very doubtful whether, including every colour, they contain at preſent five times the number of people which were to be found in them immediately after the Spaniſh conqueſt.</p>
               <p>Since the firſt torrent of emigration, in the reign of Charles I. very few individuals have ever gone to ſettle in New-England; but there has been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtream of emigration from it into the other colonies. The original ſettlers amounted, by Hutchinſon's account, to about twenty thouſand, and, including Vermont, that part of the union has now a million of people. Thus, in a century and an half, the firſt colony has augmented to fifty times its primitive number; while the increaſe in the Spaniſh provinces bears not any thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to a correſpondent proportion. Such is the eternal difference between freedom and ſlavery. Under a government like ours, the Spaniſh colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies might, by this time, have made the banks of the Amazon and the La Plata, as populous as thoſe of the Delaware and the Hudſon.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AS the native Americans were, in a a great meaſure, defenceleſs, the ſovereigns of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope immediately marked out this continent for their prey; and a conſiderable portion of it continues to languiſh in their fetters. By flagrant uſurpation, they aſſumed the right of granting patents and charters, for diſcovery and colonization, on the weſtern ſhore of the Atlantic. If Columbus had accompliſhed a voyage to the moon, or if Cabot had aſcended to the planet Herſchel, a king of Spain or England, might, with equal plauſibility, have claimed a title of parcelling out theſe regions to Cortez, or to Penn. This was a violation of natural juſtice, which had no precedent among the ancients. When the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian republics diſperſed colonies on the coaſt of Aſia, they never attempted to aſſume that ſort of dominion, which hath ſince been claimed by the monarchs of Europe. The Americans, during the late revolution, might have ſpared much of their labour in proving what rights they had acquired,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:033485_0035_0FF71F346BE7E9F8"/>
by their charters, from the Britiſh crown. All go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which is not founded on the legitimate conſent of the people, and conducted by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, is, in itſelf, uſurpation Hence, when a Britiſh monarch gave a title to countries which were not his own, it was to be ſuppoſed that his ſucceſſors, in the ſame ſpirit of robbery, would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the firſt temptation to break their part of the engagement. But this breach, on their ſide, was of little conſequence; becauſe, ſuch patents and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters formed an inſult upon common ſenſe, and the primitive rights of mankind.</p>
               <p>If the Britiſh government had been at any charge in founding colonies in North America, there might have been ſome reaſon for aſſuming a privilege to give them laws, to ſmother their manufactures, and reſtrict their navigation. But, in place of money or aſſiſtance, ſhe gave them nothing, or next to nothing, but charters, for poſſeſſing territories that were not her's to beſtow, and of which ſhe did not always know under what degree of latitude they were placed. The numerous miſtakes in extending royal grants have produced confuſion and litiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the colonies. The ſettlers of America were able, without foreign aſſiſtance, to have made laws, and marked out boundaries for themſelves. Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land interpoſed in this way for one ſingle purpoſe only, that, as ſoon as the colonies became a fit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for taxation, or monopoly, ſhe might ſecure to herſelf the whole benefits that could be drawn from them. People, to this day, and even on this ſide of the Atlantic, perſiſt in terming Britain the <hi>mother</hi> country. If her relation to her colonies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a domeſtic name, it was that of a jealous and bloody ſtep-mother.</p>
               <p>In the exportation of their own ſurplus produce, the Britiſh colonies, both of North-America, and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:033485_0036_0FF71F3636D96990"/>
the Weſt-Indies, were greatly reſtricted by acts of parliament. Part of their productions could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported only to Britain. By confining tobacco and cotton, for inſtance, to the home market, the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh merchants expected that they would be able to buy them cheaper in the plantations, and to ſell them with a better profit in Britain. They likewiſe propoſed, by this regulation, to eſtabliſh, in their own favour, between the colonies and foreign countries, an advantageous <hi>carrying trade,</hi> of which Britain was to be the centre, as the only country in Europe into which theſe commodities were firſt to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Britain encouraged America in the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of pig and bar iron, by exempting them from duties to which the like commodities were ſubjected, when imported from any other country. Yet an abſolute prohibition was impoſed upon the erection of ſteel furnaces, and ſlitting mills in any of the colonies. England would not ſuffer her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts to work in thoſe more refined manufactures, even for their own conſumption. They were to purchaſe, from her merchants and manufacturers, all goods of this kind, for which they had occaſion.</p>
               <p>She prohibited the exportation from one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to another by water, and even the carriage by land upon horſeback, or in a cart, of hats, of wools and woollen goods of the produce of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. This regulation prevented the eſtabliſhment of any manufactures of ſuch commodities for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſale; and confined the induſtry of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans in this way, to ſuch coarſe and houſhold ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, as a private family commonly makes for its own uſe, or for that of ſome of its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the ſame province. After reciting theſe reſtrictions, Dr. Smith adds, that <q>to prohibit a great people from making all that they can of every part of their own produce, or from employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033485_0037_0FF71F38EA953AD8"/>
their ſtock and induſtry in the way that they judge moſt advantageous to themſelves, is a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt violation of the moſt ſacred rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi>

For the author adds, that theſe prohibitions were <q>only <hi>impertinent badges of ſlavery</hi> impoſed upon them (the colonies) without any ſufficient reaſon, by the groundleſs jealouſy of the merchants and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers of the <hi>mother</hi> country.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This account ought to calm the raptures of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican gratitude towards the ſupremacy of Britain, even in its beſt days, and its mildeſt form. Her commercial regulations have always been adapted, or, at leaſt, deſigned, to ſerve her own intereſt at the expence of the reſt of the world, her colonies not excepted. How far ſhe was ſucceſsful in this effort, may be gathered from the intereſting ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exhibited by the ſame author<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. Part III.</note>. We ſhall now inveſtigate ſome of the principal features of her adminiſtration, where the concerns of the mercan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile intereſt did not give an impreſſion.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, it does not appear that the crown of England bore almoſt any part of the charges of founding the colonies, that now compoſe the ſixteen United States. Before the year 1589, Sir Walter Raleigh had expended forty thouſand pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in attempting to ſettle adventurers in Virginia. This ſum was equal in value to one hundred and fifty or two hundred thouſand pounds ſterling at
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033485_0038_0FF71F3C87C28AB0"/>
this day. Raleigh was <q>
                     <hi>obſtructed occaſionally by the crown,</hi> without a ſhilling of aid from it<note n="*" place="bottom">Jefferſon's Notes on Virginia, ART. CONSTITUTION.</note>.</q> His ſubſequent expences muſt likewiſe have been very great. Raleigh was, in 1603, impriſoned, and, in 1609, James the firſt, granted a charter for ſettling Virginia to a company.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The king and company quarrelled, and, by a mixture of law and force, the latter were ouſted of all their rights, <hi>without retribution,</hi> after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expended a hundred thouſand pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in eſtabliſhing the colony, <hi>without the ſmalleſt aid from government.</hi> King James ſuſpended their powers by proclamation of July 15th, 1624, and Charles the firſt took the government into his own hands<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</q> Mr. Jefferſon mentions a variety of ſubſequent uſurpations. The grant of Maryland to lord Baltimore is one of the number. This was obtained in 1632, from Charles the firſt. It was not till after many years of ſolicitation, that Charles the ſecond permitted William Penn to found the colony of Pennſylvania. Yet Charles himſelf had no title to the country, except that general one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the voyage of John Cabot; and the grant itſelf was to coſt him nothing. This was the inſolence, perverſeneſs, and rapacity of a court. Charles the ſecond, had owed conſiderable ſums to admiral Penn, father to William, ſo that the grant was the diſcharge of a debt. New-York and New-Jerſey were torn from the Dutch by Charles the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<note n="‡" place="bottom">In 1496, this mariner ſailed from England, in queſt of <hi>China.</hi> He fell in with the north ſide of Terra Labrador. On this notable atchievement were founded the territorial titles of the crown of England to her North-American dominions. The French, in one of their voyages to China, found themſelves, in May, 1544, in the Gulph of St. Lawrence; a circumſtance, from whence <hi>they</hi> deduced their right to Canada: Carey's American Edition of Guthrie, Vol. II. p. 244.</note>

in one of his piratical wars againſt their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public. He afterwards made a gift of New-Jerſey to his brother, James the ſecond, who ſold it to private adventurers. The two Carolinas and Georgia were ſettled in the ſame way; and, if the founders received pecuniary aid from the Britiſh government, it was too trifling to deſerve detailed notice.</p>
               <p>Maſſachuſetts was firſt ſettled in 1620. A number of Engliſh partizans, perſecuted at home, purchaſed a tract of territory, ſituated within the juriſdiction of the Plymouth company. Theſe emigrants were driven from their native country with every mark of hoſtility and contempt. Archbiſhop Land, under the auſpices of Charles the firſt, perſecuted all kinds of non-conformiſts with unrelenting fury. The puritans, on the other hand, were ready to ſubmit to all the rigour of perſecution, rather than to give up their religious opinions, and conform to the church of England. America opened an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive field; and Land, even from principles of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical expediency, ſhould have been glad to free Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land from ſuch diſſatisfied and dangerous inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. The vengeance of this clergyman was not appeaſed by the exile of thoſe who differed from his tenets. Many thouſands of diſſenters, indeed, eſcaped from their inſular confinement; but had not Land interpoſed his prohibition, the population of New-England might, at this day, have doubled its preſent amount.</p>
               <p>Beſides the difficulty of obtaining leave to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in America, the coloniſts had another formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able obſtacle to encounter and ſurmount. The crown of England had parcelled out the country to ſome of its hungry dependents. To theſe men a new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony was of no value, but for what could be ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of it. They were careful to exert their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in a ſtyle worthy of the ſource from which
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033485_0040_0FF71F40C2632520"/>
it was derived. The arbitrary proceedings of the king and parliament, in aſſuming a power to make laws for the colonies without their concurrence, filled up the meaſure of American wrongs. Britain, evidently thruſt herſelf into the government of this country for the ſake of what ſhe could get; and, accordingly, when the colonies had made ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in agriculture, ſhe was careful to cramp their commerce and induſtry, by vexatious and oppreſſive edicts. In this account there appear no traces of maternal affection. The royal, or parliamentary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, along with that of the patentees, was, in all caſes, and without exception, a groſs deſpotiſm, founded on the helpleſsneſs of the original ſettlers. Between the patentees, however, a diſtinction muſt be made. Of Gorges and Maſon, the colony of Maſſachuſetts knew little, but by the law-ſuits raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſupport of their claims. As far as they or Penn had expended money in ſettling or improving the colonies, they were entitled to compenſation; and certainly no farther.</p>
               <p>This kind of reaſoning cuts ſhort all claims of gratitude on the part of America towards England. As England never had any right of making laws for America, it is not worth while to deſcend to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances, where theſe laws were oppreſſive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wiſeſt and beſt of them were, in equity, as truly void, as the gift of an eſtate by a perſon who is not the lawful owner. The conſtant tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of all ſorts of criminals from Britain to the colonies, was an inſult, of that kind, which might have excuſed the Americans, for overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even the greateſt obligations. Lewis the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, if aſked, would very chearfully have ceded Canada, Cape Breton, and Nova Scotia to England. Theſe opportunities were neglected. Judge Hutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon thinks it likely, that, if the French had been
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:033485_0041_0FF71F4254A8D180"/>

In reality, it does not appear that the Engliſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in any ſingle inſtance, paid ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the intereſt of the colonies.

The Spaniſh war, of 1739, was <hi>principally undertaken on their account;</hi> in which, and in the French war, that was the conſequence of it, Great Britain ſpent upwards of forty millions, a great part of which <hi>ought juſtly to be charged to the colonies</hi>

That they did not actually do ſo, muſt be attributed to Engliſh jealouſy. <q>The defence of her colonies was a great expence to Great Britain. The moſt effectual mode of leſſening this, was to put arms into the hands of the inhabitants, to teach them their uſe. But England wiſhed not that the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans ſhould become acquainted with their own ſtrength. She was apprehenſive, that, as ſoon as this period arrived, they would no longer ſubmit

The leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a military ſpirit was therefore to be guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt; and, although a war then raged, the act, organizing a militia, was diſapproved of by the miniſtry.

               <p>The animoſity of the Engliſh nation towards France, has plunged them into many unprovoked wars againſt that people. One of the principal cauſes of that in queſtion, was their jealouſy of the ſhare which the French had in trade with the Indians. Some of the latter paſſed by Albany to Montreal, two hundred and fifty miles farther, to buy goods, which they could have had cheaper at Albany. Guthrie, in his Geographical Grammar, ſtates this circumſtance, and adds, with a tone of regret, <q>ſo much did the French exceed <hi>us</hi> in the arts of winning the affections of theſe ſavages!</q> If the

                  </gap>uchery and extirpation of a race of naked barbarians. This traffic was not an object of rational ambition to either party. Their common eagerneſs to purſue it, may readily be traced to their ſtrong deſire of purchaſing furs from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, at a very cheap rate, in order to ſell them at an exorbitant price in Europe. The ſpiritous liquors, which formed a ſtaple commodity in this commerce, have utterly deſtroyed whole tribes of the primitive Americans: of thoſe who ſtill exiſt, the havoc has been very great. The Six Nations, for example, are ſaid to have ſhrunk from a very ſuperior number, to hardly fifteen hundred fighting men<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>There are in the Six Nations, according to an accurate eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, lately made by the reverend Mr. Kirkland, miſſionary among them, ſix thouſand, three hundred, and thirty ſouls. He adds, that among theſe there <hi>is,</hi> comparatively, but very few chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</q> Morſe, vol. I. p. 44.</note>. In a moral ſenſe, therefore, this trade was extremely deteſtable. But, even as a ſource of wealth, its expediency might have been very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. We are told that the Indians would ſometimes give away their whole property for a dram. But the traders were frequently robbed and murdered, by the ſavages, whom they had intoxicated for the purpoſe of cheating them. This is the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033485_0045_0FF71F4EFB0563E8"/>
and termination of knavery. After all, the furs were to be tranſported acroſs the Atlantic, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could be ſold again. Hence, if we take into conſideration, the numerous hazards of all kinds that were to be ſurmounted, before the ſkin of a beaver was finally brought to market, it ſeems very likely, that, upon the whole, theſe wandering pedlars from Europe, would have been employed more honourably and more profitably, both for their countrymen and themſelves, at home, in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary occupations of domeſtic life. But the futility of this plan of commerce is placed beyond all doubt by another conſideration. Canada was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal cauſe of the bloody war of 1756. This war coſt England one hundred and eleven millions, two hundred and ſeventy-one thouſand, nine hundred and ninety-ſix pounds ſterling of public money<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtory of the Public Revenue of the Britiſh Empire, by ſir John Sinclair, vol. II. p. 99.</note>. The expences of France were certainly as great. Thus it is evident that a ſingle campaign coſt either nation more than all the furs in the world were worth. Since Britain became poſſeſſed of Canada, her trade with that country has been computed to employ about ſixty ſhips, and a thouſand ſeamen. The exports from the province, at an average of three years, in ſkins, furs, ginſeng, ſnake-root, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillaire, and wheat, amounted to one hundred and five thouſand, five hundred pounds ſterling per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. The imports from Britain were eſtimated about the ſame ſum<note n="†" place="bottom">Guthrie, p. 887.</note>. It may be ſuppoſed, that the number of ſhips and ſeamen engaged in this trade, is at preſent much greater, than has been above ſtated; for the trade itſelf has, of late years, been conſiderably augmented. In 1786, the exports from the province of Canada amounted to three hundred
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:033485_0046_0FF71F51A52C1530"/>
and forty-three thouſand, two hundred and ſixty-three pounds ſterling. The imports of the ſame year, were three hundred and twenty-five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, one hundred and ſixteen pounds ſterling<note n="*" place="bottom">Morſe, vol. I. p. 109.</note>. Thus the extent of the commerce between Britain and Canada ſeems to have trebled ſince the peace of 1763. We ſhall lay aſide the extravagant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the conqueſt, as well as that of preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wars for Canada, and of its defence in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of 1775. Let us then eſtimate the preſent advantages derived by Britain from this addition to her dominions. The amount of Britiſh goods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to Canada, ſince the conqueſt, in 1763, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, upon an average up to this time, (January, 1798) be higher than two hundred thouſand pounds ſterling per annum. This calculation may be ſafely reſted on the particular ſtatements above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is always reckoned a good trade, where a clear profit is to be gained of ten per cent. At this rate, England obtains, by the poſſeſſion of Canada, twenty thouſand pounds annually. It is uſual, in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating the benefits ariſing to a nation in Europe, from one of its American colonies, to ſpeak of the whole profits of the commerce, as if they were ſome peculiar ſpecies of emolument, that could have been acquired only by the poſſeſſion of that indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual ſpot. This ſort of political ſophiſtry has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſome very bloody and fruitleſs wars. In the caſe before us, for inſtance, the ſame capital could have been employed by Britiſh merchants in other branches of trade; and therefore the acquiſition of the country did not deſerve a ſtruggle. We are, indeed, informed, of the immenſe advantages that are obtained by the procuring from Canada of raw materials for manufactures<note n="†" place="bottom">See Guthrie, p. 887.</note>. This is another part
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:033485_0047_0FF71F5386994CF0"/>
of the mercantile catechiſm, that has impelled man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to innumerable crimes. <hi>The raw materials</hi> of manufactures may always be had, by thoſe, who, like the Britiſh nation, are able to pay for them. But we ſhall admit that they could only be found in Canada, and that upon theſe raw materials, there is a ſecond clear profit of ten per cent. amounting altogether, to a benefit of forty thouſand pounds per annum, to Britain. Still that nation is a great loſer by the retention of Canada. The expences of her civil and military eſtabliſhment cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly aſcertained, yet they will hardly come to leſs than an hundred thouſand pounds a year; for the ſingle fortreſs of Gibraltar, even in time of peace, coſts England annually twice that ſum<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtory of the Public Revenue, vol II. p. 172.</note>. In time of war, the expences both of Gibraltar and of Canada, become infinitely greater. If the military eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Canada be two thouſand men, theſe are ſo many hands ſubtracted from the domeſtic manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Britain, to an extent of loſs, perhaps, not leſs than fifty thouſand pounds a year. Thus, in one way or other, this province draws from Britain an hundred and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling per annum, even in time of peace, while its profits are forty thouſand. Ireland, in the reign of Elizabeth, required for its peace eſtabliſhment, more than four times the product of the whole revenue that tyranny could rend from its vitals<note n="†" place="bottom">C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For the ſake both of Europe and America, it is to be deſired, that the colonial ſupremacy, held by the former, over ſome regions of the latter, may ſoon expire. This uſurped authority has uniformly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced bad conſequences to all parties. Spain, for inſtance, with the moſt wealthy and tempting por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new world, hath been reduced to ruin. Her colonies, at the ſame time, groan under odious oppreſſion. Peru and Chili excepted, the culture of the vine and olive are forbidden to the Spaniſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts. They muſt buy the wine and oll for which they have occaſion from old Spain. The difficulty of tranſporting ſuch bulky articles acroſs the Iſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus of Panama, is the only reaſon for exempting Peru and Chili from this edict of deſolation. No veſſel belonging to the Spaniſh colonies was ever permitted to carry the commodities of America to Europe. No veſſel of any foreign nation is openly received into the harbours of the Spaniſh dominions on the continent of America. The pains of death, and the confiſcation of moveables, are denounced againſt every inhabitant who trades with them. Yet, in ſpite of all theſe regulations, the king of Spain is defrauded of half his revenues. An author, quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033485_0049_0FF71F595E9ED248"/>
by Dr. Robertſon, gives a ſtriking picture of the ſtate of government in the Spaniſh colonies. <q>We have, ſays he, viceroys, preſidents, gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, oydors, corrigidors, alcaldes, and thouſands of alguazils abound every where; but, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe, public abuſes continue to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtory of America, Book VIII.</note>.</q> With ſuch a ſcene before them, the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the United States cannot be ſufficiently thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that they have eſcaped from the talons of the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> country. Had the king of Britain ſucceeded in his plan of conqueſt, the ſubjects of Spain would have found no cauſe to envy the condition of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh colonies.</p>
               <p>It is pleaſing to obſerve how the rapacity of deſpotiſm overſhoots its aim. The Spaniards, both in Europe and America, have their invention continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the ſtretch to elude the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The very officers appointed to check contraband trade, are often employed as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in carrying it on; and the boards inſtituted to reſtrain and puniſh it, are the channels through which it flows. In Mexico and Peru, the annual eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment for defraying the charge of adminiſtration, exceeds one-half of the revenue collected. The annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al amount, in ſterling money, exacted by Spain from America and the Phillipine iſlands, is computed by Dr. Robertſon at only two millions and ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds ſterling, of which one-half is expended in ſupport of the adminiſtration. If theſe dominions contain ſixteen millions of people, the king of Spain gains by them about one ſhilling and eight pence per head. A poor reward for the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a human being! But for their oppreſſed ſituation, the Spaniſh colonies might, perhaps, have
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033485_0050_0FF71F5DA0A6CB90"/>
been thrice as populous, and certainly much more improved than they are at preſent. Spain has had a ſtill worſe bargain of her colonies than Britain. Even in point of economy, it would have been for her advantage, to declare them independent an hundred years ago. The bloody war of 1739, excluſive of many other quarrels, muſt have coſt her altogether, at leaſt twenty-five or thirty mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions ſterling. The very intereſt of this ſum would have been more than the whole net revenue that ſhe draws from her colonies. Ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

England, by the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her colonies, and the breaking up of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly trade, has not loſt a ſingle farthing; ſince her commerce with the United States is much more extenſive than that with her North American colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ever was before the revolution. This might be a leſſon to the crown of Spain.</p>
               <p>The following is a remark made in an Engliſh magazine for the year 1791.—<q>Such is the fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm and ignorance of the Spaniards, that it is moſt probable their ſettlements will be in the hands of <hi>the United States,</hi> before their eyes are opened to the light of knowledge and liberty.</q> The United States will certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their own intereſt better than to attempt ſuch an acquiſition, or even to accept of it, if prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for nothing.

In ſummer laſt, Mr. Robert Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per held out to Congreſs, the conqueſt of the two Mexicos, as a temptation for America to league with England againſt France. The above detail ſhews how inſignificant theſe poſſeſſions are even to Spain herſelf; and thus, on the ſide of avarice, the ſcheme is blaſted, even if the regions deſtined to federal plunder could be ſeized without reſiſtance. Mr. Harper, at the ſame time, railed at the French for conquering the dominions of monarchs, who had endeavoured to conquer them. Spain hath not warred againſt the United States, ſo that his own plan was evidently by far more atrocious than any which he had aſcribed to the republic. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal for robbery more unprovoked, more ſhameleſs, more criminal, was never ſuggeſted in the cabin of Blackbeard, or the camp of Brandt. Had his end been to liberate an injured people, the humanity of the viſion might have atoned for its madneſs. The view in which the member held out his ſcheme was not the diſpenſation of freedom to ſlaves, but the acquiſition of booty to conquerors. The moſt ſerious conſideration is, that the incendiary of Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Six, ſpoke, to be ſure, only as the <hi>avaunt courier</hi> of his party, who act with the regularity of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man legion<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <q>THE way to empire cannot be too ſhort,</q> ſaid Tullia, when ſhe drove her chariot over her father's dead body. <q>The way to Spaniſh gold cannot be too ſhort,</q> exclaims the federal orator to congreſs. The wiſdom of Mr. Harper's ſcheme is equal to its honeſty. For the trifling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of ten millions of dollars, the United States might aſſemble twenty thouſand men at the mouth of the Ohio. They have then only to deſcend with the ſtream, till they gain ſome proper place for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embarking. They next daſh through a foreſt three hundred leagues wide, which leads them to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of New Mexico. Some ſlight objections occur. Three-fourths of the army will die of hunger on the march, from the difficulty of taking ſufficient proviſions along with them. Three-fourths of the remainder will periſh of fatigue and the flux; and the Indians may, probably, knock the reſt on the head. But theſe are the petty cavils of cowardice. Cortez did not calculate, and why ſhould we?</p>
               <p>If this plan had only been ſpouted in a ſit of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it had not been worthy of attentive remark,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:033485_0053_0FF67B885DD730D0"/>
But Mr. Harper, in a printed letter to his conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, dated May 25th, 1797, dwells upon the idea, Recommending an alliance with England, he ſays, that the colonies of Holland and Spain <q>muſt ſink under the arms of the two countries:</q> viz. of Britain and the United States. A long extract, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this aſſertion, he been circulated in one, at leaſt, if not others, of the federal newſpapers. If the friends of order, in congreſs, had never propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated any ſcheme equally profligate and audacious with this, charity would be led to ſuppoſe, that Mr. Harper acted only by the impulſe of his own folly. But their ſtruggle for rejecting the Indian, Algerine, and Spaniſh treaties, unleſs linked with that of Jay, was a branch from the ſame root. The war with France, into which they make ſuch vigorous efforts for driving America, is altogether as frantic as Mr. Harper's plan; and hence it is not injuring them to believe that they approved of his propoſal for the Mexican expedition.</p>
               <p>On the 2d of June, 1797, a number of American captains at Port-au-Prince, in St. Domingo, preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a petition to governor Simcoe. They repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that eleven American veſſels, with cargoes, amounting to three hundred thouſand dollars, had been captured by Britiſh privateers, and were then lying at that port, in expectation of a trial. They had applied for it, and had been told in anſwer, that they were to be ſent for adjudication to Mole St. Nicholas. They ſtate, that ſome of the veſſels can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed to that place without conſiderable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs: others, had been abandoned by their crews, Some, with their cargoes, were likewiſe in a ſtate of ſuffering. Many of the petitioners, being entire ſtrangers, were reduced to inconvenience from want of money. Some crews and ſupercargoes, from ſickneſs, diſappointments, and mortifications, were
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:033485_0054_0FF71F65EDC03050"/>
reduced to the moſt diſtreſſing circumſtances. They affirm, that they had carried on a legal trade, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Britiſh treaty. They ſupplicate that a court of admiralty may be appointed at Port-au-Prince for trying their cauſes, and conclude with ſome compliments to the perſonal character of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coe himſelf.</p>
               <p>His anſwer was haughty and reproachful. He promiſed to recommend to the judge of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, Mr. Combauld, to decide their caſes at an early period; but he gave them no reaſon to think that there would be a court erected for that end at Port-au-Prince. He hoped that they would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted of that contraband traffic which many ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of the United States carried on with the French government in St. Domingo. He cloſed with telling them that this illicit trade might, at no remote diſtance, <q>ſeriouſly diſturb the national re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and affect the <hi>ſecurity</hi> of the American con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</q> This menace appears ſomewhat inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable. He cannot ſurely mean that England is to affect our ſecurity by land, as a conſequence of her having robbed our ſhips at ſea. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, of itſelf, enough in all conſcience. Thus American veſſels are liable to be taken into an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh port, and to be kept there till their crews deſert, their cargoes ſpoil, and themſelves rot for want of an Engliſh trial. When no longer capable of ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they are ordered to make a voyage in queſt of adjudication. Mr. Harper and his friends think that they have gained every thing, becauſe they have at laſt exaſperated the French into the ſame ſyſtem of privateering, which the Britiſh have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on for four years and an half, and in which they ſtill ardently perſiſt.</p>
               <p>It would require conſiderable room to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate all the Britiſh confiſcations of American pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty

in the Weſt-Indies, within the laſt ſix months. Captain Dunlevy remained in Hiſpaniola from the 9th of June, to the 20th of October, 1797. The following is a ſummary of his account, as to Mr. Combauld's operations. Eighteen veſſels, with their cargoes, were condemned. Two of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of theſe ſhips were detained three months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could get their papers, which could have been had with eaſe in three days, or a much leſs time. Another of theſe captains died of grief. A nineteenth veſſel, with her cargo, was ſold to pay the coſts of court. A twentieth was cleared, but the cargo condemned. Seven were diſcharged on paying coſts. This is manifeſt injuſtice; for, if the Engliſh were not warranted in ſeizing them, it was highly oppreſſive to make them pay any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence whatever. They ſhould rather have them reimburſed for their detention. But what could be expected, when the ſame nation were both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and judges? Some others in the above liſt were under trial, when captain Dunlevy came away. The whole amount to thirty one, and ſeveral veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were likewiſe detained, of which the trials had not come on. Many ſuch details of the preſent year might be given, as to Engliſh piracy. Yet the Adamites always ſpeak as if piracy were confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the French only.</p>
               <p>The relative ſpirit of the American miniſtry to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the two nations is fully exhibited in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing narrative. Citizen Adet had complained to Mr. Pickering reſpecting the French corvette L'Eſperance. She was taken by the Britiſh ſhip Argonaut, who went with her prize into Lynnha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven bay, in Virginia. According to Adet, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vette was there fitted out by admiral Murray, as a Britiſh cruiſer, and this Adet urged as a violation of the treaty of Paris. Pickering, in his letter to
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033485_0056_0FF71F6D433AF720"/>
Charles Pinckney, undertakes to anſwer this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. He firſt remarks, that the captain of the corvette, and the French conſul at Norfolk, had both been applied to, and ſhewed no diſpoſition to complain of any improper conduct on the part of the captors. Thus far all is well; but Mr. Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering proceeds thus: <q>the governor (of Virginia) having heard that a reſpectable pilot by the name of <hi>Butler,</hi> was acquainted with the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this affair, he directed his depoſition to be taken; it was taken, and imported, that admiral Murray himſelf, purchaſed the prize and manned and fitted her in Lynnhaven bay for a cruize; but Butler's <hi>depoſition</hi> was afterwards taken on the part of the Britiſh, in which <hi>he contradicted all the material facts recited in the former depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which he accounted for by ſaying, that he could neither write nor read, and that there had been inſerted in his firſt depoſition what he had never ſaid <note n="*" place="bottom">Meſſage from the Preſident, of January 19th 1797, p. 46.</note>.</q> Mr. Pickering then mentions to Pinckney his anxiety for further information. This had been ſupplied by the Britiſh miniſter, Mr. Hammond, in a letter from admiral Murray, who declared that he ſent the corvette back to ſea, as ſoon as wind and weather would permit.</p>
               <p>From the face of this ſtory, it ſeems that our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of ſtate acted right. The French conſul and captain, at leaſt as he pretends, would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with complaining. Butler, the only evidence againſt Murray, retracted upon oath; and ſince the admiral himſelf denied his having fitted out the L'Eſperance, as a privateer, Mr. Pickering had no choice but to give him credit.</p>
               <p>Now comes the oppoſite ſide of the queſtion. On the 24th of March, 1795, Butler emitted his <hi>firſt</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="unknown:033485_0057_0FF71F6F45D79330"/>
depoſition, purporting, as above, that the corvette was fitted out by admiral Murray, for a privateer. But it is NOT TRUE, as Mr. Pickering affirms, that Butler ever contradicted this teſtimony in a ſecond depoſition. That of the 24th of March, 1795, was immediately ſent forward to Mr. Pickering, and by the latter communicated to Mr. Hammond, who ſent a copy of it to captain Cochrane of the Thetis, which was then under repair at Norfolk. When Cochrane was ready to ſet ſail, he ſelected Butler, as his pilot; and after the ſhip had got into Hampton roads, he began to charge the man with having acted as a ſpy on board of Engliſh ſhips. He read in evidence, a copy of Butler's depoſition of the 24th of March, and threatened to carry him off, and treat him as a ſpy. Under thoſe circumſtances, Cochrane preſented a paper, which he called of the nature of a counter declaration, and required Butler to ſubſcribe it. The pilot was glad to ſign any thing, rather than run the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hazard of being carried away from his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, his family, and his country; beſides the proſpect of being ſtarved, flogged, and probably murdered by a gang of barbarians. He was not indulged with a copy of the paper, nor made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with its contents. Captain Cochrane did not offer to adminiſter an oath.</p>
               <p>When Butler got on ſhore, he made a depoſition before three magiſtrates of the county of Norfolk, and in preſence of a number of reſpectable citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. He therein related the circumſtances of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, compulſion, and alarm, under which Coch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane compelled him to ſign a paper contradictory to his depoſition of the 24th of March. This ſecond depoſition was taken on the 4th of May, 1795, and forwarded to Mr. Pickering. Yet our ſecretary, takes not the leaſt notice of it, and modeſtly gives
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033485_0058_0FF71F71F79F1ED8"/>
the title of a <hi>depoſition</hi> to the paper obtained by captain Cochrane. Theſe particulars are abridged from a copious detail furniſhed by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Joſiah Parker, who has been five times elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a repreſentative to congreſs, and who, for claſſical propriety of expreſſion, is excelled by no ſpeaker in that houſe. This gentlemen has docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for proving what is above related. After this explanation, it will be difficult to defend the vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of colonel Pickering. Mr. Waſhington, along with a copy of this letter to Pinckney, ſent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, as uſual, an introductory meſſage. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in theſe words: <q>A government which required only a knowledge of the <hi>truth</hi> to juſtify its meaſures, could not but be anxious to have this fully and frankly diſplayed.</q> Canting is always ſuſpicious. Mr. Waſhington, in the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable exerciſe of his mind, <hi>muſt</hi> have known that this inflammatory letter contained other bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling attempts at impoſture, as well as that about the Norfolk pilot. Such cobwebs may laſt for a day, but the bruſh of hiſtory quickly ſweeps them down, and conſigns them to their native dunghill.</p>
               <p>This is the cabinet that makes ſo much noiſe about its <hi>morality.</hi> From contemplating the preſent ſecretary of ſtate, we naturally turn to one of his predeceſſors. For a long time before Thomas Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon reſigned his place, the federal prints were diligent in reproaching him, as unworthy to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with ſo high an office. Since he gave it up, they have cenſured him for a reſignation, of which they were extremely glad. The Minerva con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a letter, copied into a Jerſey Gazette, of October 11th, 1797, which has theſe words: <q>The good and the wiſe ſaw him ſuddenly retreat from a poſt of honour, and eſſential ſervice, at a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when his country was in a ſituation ſo cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:033485_0059_0FF71F7571CDF830"/>
as to require all the efforts of wiſdom, and the poſture of firmneſs and dignity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If Mr. Jefferſon is ſo dangerous a man as the ſix per cent. writers have conſtantly repreſented him to be, it was unſuitable to regret his retreat. Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica was well rid of him. But theſe ſcribblers had terms to keep with the great body of citizens, upon whom his abilities and his ſervices had made a laſting impreſſion. His retirement was heard of with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal concern, unleſs among the immediate leaders and agents of the ſtock-holding and Britiſh faction; and with them it was neceſſary to conceal their triumph. Enlightened men looked around them, and ſaw no other character capable to fill the gap. Motives of prudence compel Mr. Jefferſon's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, Phocion excepted, to ſpeak with defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his talents.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of reſignation may be told in a few words. The late preſident has a reſerved ſullen temper, which of itſelf muſt be extremely tireſome. He had likewiſe a ſtrong bias to the Hamiltonian and Antigallican ſyſtem, ſo that Mr. Jefferſon found himſelf in very frequent minorities. When the three ſecretaries, and Mr. Randolph, attorney ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, were convened with the preſident, report ſays, that Randolph uſed to argue on the ſide of Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and when the vote came, to agree with Knox and Hamilton. To a man of independent fortune, and of a literary turn, this ſituation could have no charms; and as few aroſe from the emoluments of office. Theſe reaſons form a good apology for his retiring; as the events that ſucceeded his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, compoſe the beſt encomium on his abilities. Within three ſhort months thereafter, the preſident ſtumbled into that pit of deſtruction, the plan for a Britiſh treaty. The next four months produced what Mr. Hamilton choſe to call a <hi>rebellion.</hi> All the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:033485_0060_0FF71F77081DED38"/>
reſt of our hiſtory has been as calamitous as it well could be, when ſhort of actual war. At laſt, matters grew ſo very bad, that general Waſhington himſelf durſt no longer hold the helm. If reſignation, at a critical moment, be culpable, the charge falls a thouſand times more heavily on the preſident than on his ſecretary.</p>
               <p>And here, inſtead of what has been done, let fancy ſuppoſe what might have been done, ſince the fatal 16th of April, 1794, if Mr. Jefferſon, with a ſound majority of congreſs to ſupport him, had conducted the adminiſtration of America. Inſtead of aukward inſtructions, which the executive bluſhed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, the meſſage would have been open, conciſe, and deciſive; and the repreſentatives would have been conſulted about it. "Send back," it would ſay, <q>our impreſſed fellow citizens, with double wages for the time of their detention. Send back our veſſels, taken in contempt of juſtice. The ſubject is complicated, and will require time. But as a pledge of your ſincerity, depoſit in our treaſury before hand, a million of dollars, for the relief of the families of impreſſed ſeamnen<note n="*" place="bottom">Notice, on this head, the whining of Mr. Pickering. When aſſigning the motives for Jay's miſſion, he ſays,—<q>Did not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſment of our ſeamen, like the ſpoliations on our commerce, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite an univerſal complaint?</q> Letter to Pinckney, p. 15. The public have already ſeen the two curious cards reſpecting impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, between Jay and Grenville.</note>, and of thoſe merchants who have gone to jail in conſequence of your piracies. Unleſs you do ſo, we forbid the exportation of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the Britiſh Weſt-Indies, and ſhall anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate your armies without firing a piſtol. We want no treaty of commerce with you, till the end of the war ſhall decide your future ſituation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this firm but reaſonable tone, England might have learned to reſpect the United States. France,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:033485_0061_0FF71F79985435E0"/>
courting their amity, would have reſtrained her cruiſers, as ſhe actually did, till July, 1796, when ſhe heard of the final ratification of the Britiſh trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is the confeſſed cauſe of her preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations.</p>
               <p>As for the weſtern inſurrection, Mr. Jefferſon has never expreſſed impatience for the burning of Pittſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh; of courſe, he would have quelled the riots in their infancy, at an expence of five hundred dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Inſtead of refuſing to pay the militia who burnt Nickajack, inſtead of inveighing againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratic ſocieties, and boaſting of Creek friendſhip, he would have authoriſed generals Clarke and Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens to enter the country of theſe cut-throats, at the head of five thouſand men, to teach them ſome reſpect for treaties, and ſome dread for offended juſtice.</p>
               <p>The writer in the Minerva proceeds to declaim upon a letter ſaid to be written from Mr. Jefferſon to one Mazzei at Florence. Much clutter has been made about this piece, which, unfortunately for the enemies of Mr. Jefferſon, contains only ſtrict truth. The following is the moſt intereſting part of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Our political ſituation is prodigiouſly changed ſince you left us. Inſtead of that noble love of liberty, and that republican government, which carried us triumphantly through the dangers of the war, an Anglo-monarchico-ariſtocratic par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has ariſen.—Their avowed object is to impoſe on us the ſubſtance, as they have already given us the form, of the Britiſh government. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, the principal body of our citizens remains faithful to republican principles. All our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of lands are friendly to thoſe principles, as alſo the maſs of men of talents. We have againſt us (republicans) the executive power, the judiciary power, (two of the three branches
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:033485_0062_0FF71F7D610D8858"/>
of our government,) all the officers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all who are ſeeking offices, all timid men, who prefer the calm of deſpotiſm to the tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſea of liberty, the Britſh merchants and the Americans who trade on Britiſh capitals, the ſpeculators, perſons intereſted in the bank and the public funds; eſtabliſhments invented with views of corruption, and to aſſimilate us to the Britiſh model in its corrupt parts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This letter was originally tranſlated from a French newſpaper by Webſter, who ſpoke of it as if it had been <hi>treaſon.</hi> That an Engliſh faction has ariſen, and obtained an undue influence in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, can hardly be denied, when, beſides a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of other traits, we ſee one preſident after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haranguing againſt French piracy, and paſſing over in guarded ſilence, the ſea-robberies of Britain. The conſtitution, of which the letter ſpeaks, is, upon the whole, a good inſtrument, but liable to numerous and important objections. One of theſe is the immenſe patronage beſtowed on the preſident, and a ſecond, the univerſal negative of the ſenate. It has been ſhewn<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtory of 1796, Chap. VIII.</note>, that a preſident, with eleven ſenators to help him, can abſolutely ſtop the whole buſineſs of the legiſlature. This may be called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative government, but it is evidently the dregs of monarchy and ariſtocracy.</p>
               <p>The ſame piece in the Minerva, that has been above cited, ſpeaks of Virginia as uncommonly prone to inſurrection. The American Annual Regiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Hiſtory of 1796, comprehend a variety of remarks in anſwer to the calumnies heaped upon that ſtate by the federal party. The ſubject has not, however, been exhauſted, and it is of infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to undeceive the people who may have been
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:033485_0063_0FF71F7FE636C2B8"/>
miſled by their artifices. The fact then is, that if true republicaniſm, if a genuine ſenſe of order and of freedom, ſhall be driven from every other ſtate in the union, their laſt ſtand will be made in Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. Previous to the actual commencement of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities in 1775, little or nothing was heard of mobs in that province; for its inhabitants were ſenſible that the burning of effigies, the bedaubing of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs individual with tar and feathers, was not the way to reflect honour on a ſtruggle for inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence<note n="*" place="bottom">It is not here affirmed that <hi>nothing</hi> of that kind may have taken place; but that, upon the whole, the behaviour of the colony was exemplary.</note>. While the Britiſh newſpapers were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the noiſy and tumultuous proceedings of other colonies, Virginia remained in comparative order and tranquility. Her loyalty was a conſtant ſubject of miniſterial exultation; for it ſeemed plain enough, that if ſhe ſtood by the old country, all the projects of New-England were to end in diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When matters, however, came to an extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it was found, that Virginia was as zealous in the common cauſe as any other ſtate, and much more ſo than moſt of them. Connecticut tories ſupported a bloody ſhare in the partizan war of the frontiers. Mr. Williams, one of the repreſentatives of New-York, ſaid, laſt winter, in congreſs, that at the commencement of the revolution, one half of the people of that ſtate were tories. In Pennſylvania, the revolutionary party never could have ſtood upon their legs, but by the concurrence of Iriſh emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants. In the two Carolinas and Georgia, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fought deſperately among themſelves. But it is believed that, during the whole war, no body of Virginian citizens ever raiſed the Britiſh ſtandard. They did not even ſubmit, when Britiſh armies entered the ſtate. Ramſay ſays, that, in general,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:033485_0064_0FF71F8177D672E8"/>
they choſe to retire out of the way, when Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis was burning all before him. In battle they were inferior to no troops in the union. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, whom they ſubdued, uſed to ſay, that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia was <hi>the great knife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſtate, ſo frequently ſtigmatized as <hi>anti-federal,</hi> was the very firſt that ſuggeſted a fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral union. In 1785, this propoſal was made in the Virginian houſe of delegates. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, an imperfect continental convention was, in 1786, held at Annapolis, and this proved the ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of that convention which formed the preſent conſtitution. "Virginia," ſays Morſe, <q>has taken a leading, active, and influential part in bringing about the late grand revolution in our federal government<note n="*" place="bottom">American Geography, London Edition of 1792, p. 400.</note>.</q> Ever ſince that time, the ſtate has remained in tranquility, and in perfect ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the laws. To Virginia, America is, in a a great meaſure, indebted both for her indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and her preſent conſtitution. To upbraid her then, as antifederal, is the very pinnacle of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, of audacity, and fiction.</p>
               <p>The ſtock-jobbing party accuſe this ſtate as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of a war with England. No Virginian above ideotiſm, ſhould ever deſire a foreign war. Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected almoſt throughout by navigable ſtreams, Virginia lies more open to the ravages of a mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time enemy than any other ſtate in the union. This truth was ſeverely felt during the war of 1775; and conſequently, this will be one of the laſt ſtates that would ever wiſh for actual hoſtility. The cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour excited againſt her, as anxious for a war with England, is, only a branch of the <hi>truly federal</hi> ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of impoſture.</p>
               <p>Virginia has been reproached for permitting the continuance of ſlavery. But we have the authority
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:033485_0065_0FF71F84055E7360"/>
of Mr. Jefferſon <note n="*" place="bottom">Notes on Virginia.</note> for ſaying, that, long before the revolution, the ſtate wanted to prohibit the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſlaves; a meaſure prevented by England. In 1786, the aſſembly, by an act, put an end to this vile commerce; and a general abolition is gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally going forward. In a petition, lately preſented to congreſs, by ſome negroes, it tranſpired, that Virginia affords an aſylum to fugitive ſlaves from the more ſouthern ſtates. She does not, with the ſavageneſs of North-Carolina, prohibit their eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation. While Maſſachuſetts connives at eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical oppreſſion, Virginia has eſtabliſhed an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal right of conſcience, and no man is obliged to pay for religion, unleſs he pleaſes. The clergymen of New-England, or a part of them, cannot avoid being much hurt at a precedent, ſo dangerous to the commercial intereſt of the church; and they have, undoubtedly, ſwelled the torrent of calumny with which Virginia has been overwhelmed in the eaſtern ſtates.</p>
               <p>The vindication of Virginia has been taken up in this place, becauſe the federal party appear very much diſpoſed to extrude her from the union. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their projects and menaces are ſo cloſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven with downright madneſs, that it ſeems difficult to believe the ſincerity of the party. And yet, after their attempt for a conditional rejection of three foreign treaties, unleſs they could obtain a fourth; after their propoſed ſtanding army of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five thouſand men<note n="†" place="bottom">American Annual Regiſter.</note>; their doctrine of partitioning the United States<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>; their French war; their Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can excurſion, with other frenzies equally wild and diſtracted, wonder ceaſes at the propoſed extru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Virginia; or, as Webſter and other federal writers term it, a ſeparation from the whole ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:033485_0066_0FF71F87EE648A88"/>
ſtates. By ſuch a disjunction, the continent, as to all its external relations, would ſink into the loweſt inſignificance and wretchedneſs. Yet a Connecticut newſprinter has publiſhed a ſeries of letters in defence of this propoſed ſeparation; which, among other effects, implies an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate annihilation of public and private credit, and conſequently of the national debt. The federal party revile Virginia, becauſe its members in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs have conſtantly oppoſed their funding ſyſtem, the overgrowth of preſidential influence, and other matters connected with theſe. Yet if left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Mr. Sedgwick and Co. would long ſince have extinguiſhed the preſent government, the funds, and all together. If they can juſt now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle the union in a French war, this cataſtrophe may ſtill be expected. The following anecdote diſplays the genuine ſpirit of the ſtockholding party.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When the bill for eſtabliſhing a national bank was under conſideration, he (Mr. Madiſon) had oppoſed it, as <hi>not warranted in the conſtitution,</hi> and incidently remarked, that in the convention a motion was made and negatived, for giving congreſs a power to grant charters of corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="*" place="bottom">Bache's Debates on the Britiſh Treaty, vol. I. p. 378.</note>.</q> Mr. Madiſon ſubjoins, that, for this ſlight reference to the convention, he was attacked by ſeveral ſpeakers, and among others by Mr. Gerry of Maſſachuſetts, who had been a member of the convention.</p>
               <p>On the ſubject of this bank, Mr. Alexander Hamilton gave in to congreſs a report, dated 13th of December, 1790, and which fills twenty-one folio pages. He ſays not a ſingle word as to its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing authoriſed by the conſtitution, which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033485_0067_0FF71F8A9F48D9A0"/>
gives no ſuch power. But here we learn that it was directly negatived by the framers of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument; and expreſsly contradicted the ſpirit and deſign of it. Indeed, a power of creating corporations, would have veſted in congreſs an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive degree of influence, repugnant to the geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of a free government.</p>
               <p>Mr. Madiſon was cenſured for referring to what paſſed in the convention. When an obſcure paſſage occurs in a living author, the beſt mode of expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is by an appeal to himſelf. When a bond or indenture appears ambiguous, the ſureſt way to get its meaning is, by enquiry at the parties who drew and ſubſcribed it. The reference to the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, therefore, ſtrictly proper; and Gerry, and others who objected to it, betrayed impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable effrontery. The bare omiſſion of ſuch power in the conſtitution, was enough to warrant the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the plan; but when the point had been abſolutely debated and negatived in the convention, this added, if poſſible, to the ſtrength of the caſe. Congreſs had ſworn to ſupport the conſtitution. By paſſing the law for incorporating the bank of the United States, they, at the ſame inſtant, broke their own oaths of office, and violated the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. So far from pocketing the reproof for refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Mr. Madiſon and his friends ought to have advertiſed, in the newſpapers, the true picture of this enormous ſtride of venality. Yet this junto af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peculiar reverence for the conſtitution; and hold themſelves out as its excluſive guardians. All who queſtion their purity are its enemies. What aſtoniſhing hardineſs!</p>
               <p>Gerry, and great part of his majority, were deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to be partners of the future bank, thus found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a breach of the conſtitution. Theſe are the immaculate legiſlators whom Virginia deteſts, and
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:033485_0068_0FF71F8D2514AD00"/>
Connecticut admires. If the firſt federal congreſs wanted the comprehenſive information, the dignity of ſentiment, and enthuſiaſm of eloquence, that ſometimes mark a Britiſh parliament, they did not fall ſhort of the ſervility, meanneſs, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of its blackeſt era.</p>
               <p>A writer in the New-Jerſey <hi>Centinel of Freedom,</hi> of January, 1797, has well drawn the portrait of ſuch partiſans as Webſter. <q>The writer of this paragraph," ſays he, "by good government only means the Hamiltonian adminiſtration; by good order, ſubmiſſion to this adminiſtration; by federal ticket, a ticket favourable to this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration; and by peace, peace with England and war with France. It is curious to obſerve with what effrontery ſome people talk of good government, good order, peace, and federaliſm. Every one knows that the Hamiltonian par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have diſcovered a much greater diſpoſition towards antifederaliſm than their political oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents; for they have on all occaſions endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>quarrel with the ſouthern ſtates,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affect them to the union. Their love of order has only been diſcovered by their ſubmiſſion to an adminiſtration under their own controul; but as ſoon as the majority of the houſe of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives checked their progreſs to dominion, they immediately became refractory, abuſive, and attempted to menace the immediate repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people into an unconditional compliance with their will: their love of peace has only been ſhewn by an humiliating ſubmiſſion to Britiſh inſolence and depredation, and in a proſtituted commendation of a treaty that has tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the luſtre of America.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The fulſome compliments which have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly paſſed between the preſident and congreſs,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:033485_0069_0FF71F8EB451F390"/>
betray that ſpirit of monarchy, of which the letter to Mazzei complains. This ſervility is carried far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by congreſs than in the Britiſh houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, where a royal ſpeech is always criticized with freedom and minuteneſs. Among other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums bandied between Mr. Waſhington and the firſt congreſs, one turned on his accepting of no ſalary but for his perſonal expences. <q>I muſt decline," ſays he, "as inapplicable to myſelf, any ſhare in the perſonal emoluments.—And pray that the pecuniary eſtimates for the ſtation in which I am placed, may, during my continuance in it, be limited to ſuch actual expenditures as the public good may be <hi>thought to require.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The anſwer of the repreſentatives, dated May 5th, 1789, tells him that this reſtriction, <q>cannot fail to demonſtrate the <hi>purity,</hi> whilſt it increaſes the <hi>luſtre</hi> of a character, which has ſo many ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to <hi>admiration!</hi>
                  </q> Thus they began, and thus they have ever ſince gone on. Of all the vulgar artifices for popularity ever heard of, this as to accepting of no ſalary is perhaps the moſt pitiful; and yet ſuch has been public infatuation, that, while drawing for every cent of his allowance, general Waſhington has been celebrated for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to take more than his net houſhold charges. The granting of ſo large a ſum had bad effects, by adding the wet of avarice to that of ambition.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AS our preſidents and friends of order, are ſo wonderfully delicate on the ſubject of Engliſh piracies and impreſſments, this chapter ſhall begin with ſome recent anecdotes of that kind. Every federal artifice has been employed, from the two ſpeeches of Mr. Adams to congreſs, down to the ſcurrilous paragraphs in Mr. Fenno's gazette, with the view of exciting the tempeſt of public indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt France. A ſummary, like that which follows, will help to preſerve in equipoiſe the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of reſentment.</p>
               <p>On the 27th of July, 1797, Nathaniel Silſbee, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the ſhip Betſey, addreſſed a letter to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Salem newſpaper. He had arrived at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem three days before, from Madras. He left in that port nine Engliſh ſhips of war. One of theſe was the Sybille frigate, captain Cook, who preſſed from captain Silſbee Edward Hulen, a native of Salem. He alſo threatened that if complaint ſhould be made by Silſbee to the governor, on ſhore, he would not only take every ſeamen, but alſo every officer from the Betſey. He did not commit this violence from ſcarcity of hands; for he told cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Silſbee that he had thirty-five men <hi>over and
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:033485_0071_0FF71F967A6CF860"/>
above his ſhip's complement.</hi> He added, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved fifteen of them to be real American born citizens. He ſaid that he had preſſed them from on board of American ſhips at Liſbon, in ſpite of the remonſtrances of the American conſul at that place. Cooke farther declared, that he would keep theſe men in perfect ſecurity, till the end of the war.</p>
               <p>After the impreſſment of Hulen, the Betſey was daily viſited by a lieutenant from the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bille. During his ſtay on board, this officer took full command of the ſhip, muſtered the crew regularly on the quarter deck, and would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any ſhip's duty to be carried on at theſe times. He farther threatened to correct the American officers for not manning the ſhip's ſide, and paying him ſuch reſpect as he ſaid that the preſence of any Britiſh officer ought to command. Hulen has left an aged and diſconſolate mother, who depended entirely for ſupport upon her ſon. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Silſbee adds that ſeveral other American ſeamen were, about the ſame time, preſſed from other Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſhips at Madras. The caſe of Edward Hulen, muſt afflict every friend to the United States. But it will give joy to that Britiſh junto, in this city, who, by a recent meaſure, have done their utmoſt for promoting aſſaſſination. The late and preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of American tories afford an able vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for the prudent ſeverity of the French re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public.</p>
               <p>A letter from a Philadelphian captain, dated Cape Nicholas Mole, 13th July, 1797, gives the following account. Off Tortuga, his veſſel, which was bound for Gonaives, a French port, was taken by an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh frigate. That ſame evening, while the ſhips were lying within twenty yards of each other, the frigate fired a twelve pound ſhot <q>in hopes to ſink
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:033485_0072_0FF71F99054AF718"/>
me,</q> ſays the captain. On arriving at Cape Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas, his papers were examined, and returned; but government would neither buy his proviſions, nor permit him to proceed on his voyage; <q>they pay no attention to the treaty here.</q> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for detaining him ſeems to have been leſt he ſhould ſail for a French port; as he ſubjoins that he was to ſail for Kingſton by the firſt convoy. The captain further ſays that the Engliſh bring in for adjudication all American veſſels going to or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from French ports. Thoſe <hi>going to</hi> are libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for having in their invoices nails and knives, French letters, French ſupercargoes; or in ſhort any trifle ſerves as a pretence, and they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally condemned. Thoſe <hi>coming from</hi> French iſlands are libelled for having coffee on board, ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the French adminiſtration, and are generally condemned as <hi>French Amoricans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Engliſh conſider Jay's tranſaction as a mere jeſt. The twenty fifth article of that paper ſays that <q>nothing in this treaty contained ſhall, however, be conſtrued or operate contrary to former and exiſting public treaties with other ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns or ſtates.</q> Now, before this war began, England did not pretend that ſhe had any title to ſtop American veſſels bound to a French port; nor did ſhe ever attempt to ſtop them. The violation would not have been endured in a ſingle inſtance, and was in itſelf too extravagant ever to have been projected.</p>
               <p>By the twenty-third article of the treaty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, ſigned at Paris, in 1778, it is declared, that "free ſhips ſhall alſo give a freedom to goods;" thus, that Engliſh property in an American ſhip ſhall be ſecure from a French privateer. The twenty-fifth clauſe of Jay, as juſt now quoted, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends a protection of the treaty of Paris; and
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:033485_0073_0FF71F9AD8547848"/>
yet, in practice, the Engliſh have broken it many hundreds of times, to the entire ruin of a multitude both of French and American citizens. They were not contented with this. They ſeized, alſo, Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can veſſels bound to or from French iſlands, which tended directly to deſtroy the trade of the latter. Thus the French were put upon the moſt unequal and diſtreſſing footing. They were not to interrupt American trade with the Engliſh Weſt-Indies, while England was deſtroying American trade with the French Weſt-Indies. Inſtead of interfering, our palſied executive, through the medium of the ſenate, were encouraging Mr. Fenno to publiſh daily co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns of invective againſt the French revolution.</p>
               <p>It was not to be ſuppoſed, that any people, and much leſs that a people intoxicated with victory<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The French government lately publiſhed a ſtatement on this head, from the 8th of September, 1793, to the 10th of February, 1797. The republic has, by this account, gained thirty one pitched battles, and two hundred and thirty leſſer actions. Her troops have killed an hundred and fifty-two thouſand, ſix hundred men; and taken, an hundred and ninety-ſeven thouſand, ſeven hundred and eighty-four priſoners; ſeven thouſand, nine hundred, and ſixty-three pieces of cannon; an hundred and eighty-ſix thouſand, ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty-two firelocks; four millions, three hundred and eighty-eight thouſand pounds weight of powder, and five hundred and fifty-ſeven important cities, or camps, forts, redoubts, and other places of ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>This is ſuch a catalogue of ſucceſs, as, perhaps, no other nation ever could exhibit. The number of the ſlain is certainly not magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Thoſe who periſhed in hoſpitals were, moſt likely, four times as numerous.</p>
                  </note>, were long to endure ſuch partial treatment as that above deſcribed, without feeling reſentment and meditating vengeance. The frigid neglect of Mr. Waſhington has been ſucceded by the boyiſh petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or factious malignity of Mr. Adams; and both have gone directly to the extirpation of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can mercantile intereſt. Had Mr. Jefferſon been elected preſident, France would have placed ſome
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:033485_0074_0FF71F9FE51B0218"/>
confidence in the known purity of his republican principles. This national choice, would have held out a kind of pledge for the general good will of the citizens of the United States; and the deluge of commercial deſolation muſt, in that caſe, have had a fair chance for being, in ſome degree, ſuſpended. But when the French found, that Mr. Adams, the friend of England, was raiſed to the chair, they foreſaw that extremities were to be the ſole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource.</p>
               <p>And here it is grateful to obſerve, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely deceit has overſhot its mark. With many honourable exceptions, the great body of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile intereſt, in this city, is devoted to England, as exiſting, in ſome meaſure, by credit obtained in that country. The printed ticket, the ballot-box, and poſt-office manoeuvres, as well as the <hi>legal opinion,</hi> ſo timeouſly tendered, during the late elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for preſident, were the work of the federal party, of whom our Britiſh merchants compoſe ſuch a powerful diviſion. Having, by the moſt ſcandalous artifices, obtained the election of Mr. Adams, as preſident, they now reap the fruits of it in the ruin of their trade, and the probability of a French war, into which their hero is ſtraining every nerve to plunge them. Had they permitted the election to proceed in an honeſt way, Mr. Jefferſon muſt have been preſident, and our affairs with France might have been in a train of accommodation.</p>
               <p>The letter from the Weſt-Indies, laſt quoted, has neither the name of the ſhip nor captain, and this might afford room for doubting its authenticity. But the ſubſtance of its contents has been verified from a thouſand other channels. The printer of the Philadelphia Gazette has no diſpoſition to tell faults of England, but on the beſt evidence. The ſuppreſſion of the veſſel's name ariſes, moſt likely,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:033485_0075_0FF71FA174A8E948"/>
from the prudence of its owner. His bills, indorſed by ſome federal friend, are, probably, lying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted at the banks; and the guilt of having ſent ſuch a piece to the preſs, would be an adequate reaſon for ſending <hi>him</hi> to priſon. He muſt know little of the paper-money party, who fancies them incapable of ſuch a proceſs. It will be wonderful indeed, if, before this time, the Scotch tories at Norfolk, have not commenced the ruin of the pilot Butler.</p>
               <p>It is not true, by the way, that even yet the French univerſally capture American ſhips. Here follows an inſtance to the contrary. On July 28th, 1797, the ſchooner William, captain Linnel, arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Norfolk, from Grenada. On the 4th current, while in company with a ſchooner, of and for New-London, two French privateers brought them too. After examining their papers, the French told them that they had particular orders not to ſtop or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb any American veſſel, and were very ſorry for having put them out of their courſe. The mate of the William had ſix hundred dollars under his care, and they told him that he had no occaſion to hide them, as they ſhould take nothing but what appeared to be Engliſh property. A French ſailor was ſeverely threatened by his captain for attempting to ſteal a pig. On the 23d of May, 1797, James Hammond, an American ſeaman, was preſſed from the ſhip Hope of New-York, captain Pierce, at Madeira. This was done by captain James, of the Britiſh brig of war, El Corſo. Some days after, the ſame brig impreſſed five others of his men, two of whom were, with difficulty, recovered. Hammond and other three were kept. On the 28th of June, the brig Abigail, capt. Lake, while lying in the port of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar, was boarded by the Hamadryade, a Britiſh frigate. Four of his crew were forcibly taken away.
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:033485_0076_0FF71FA409C76330"/>
Two of them had been recently redeemed from ſlavery at Algiers. Captain Lake, who gave this account, arrived at Philadelphia on the 31ſt of Auguſt, 1797. Other inſtances of Britiſh impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be collected, but theſe are ſufficient for a ſample of the admirable effects of our Britiſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>A Boſton newſpaper, of December 8th, 1797, has the following ſingular ſpecimen of Britiſh friendſhip. Captain Coffin, in the Joanna of Nantucket, had ſailed on a voyage to the South ſea whale fiſhery. After great hardſhips in attempting to double Cape Horn, he returned to Fiſhby to repair. He would then have made a plentiful cargo, but was prevented by a Britiſh letter of marque, the captain whereof had orders not to let any American veſſel catch fiſh, till the Britiſh ſhips were ſupplied. Thus captain Coffin lay idle during half the ſeaſon, till the letter of marque ſailed away. The Britiſh fiſhers then ſuffered him to proceed in his buſineſs; but they ſhewed him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, excluding all American veſſels from killing whales, till the Britiſh had left the ſtation.</p>
                     <p>As the United States have, for ſome years paſt, become a mere receptacle for external indignities, no trifle of this kind can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to make an impreſſion.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtory of 1796, exhibits oceans of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration that the dread of a Britiſh war, in the event of congreſs rejecting Jay's bargain, was the joint of offspring of ignorance, and knavery. Dr. Smith, Mr. Sedgwick, and the other ſix per cent. leaders, panted for nothing ſo much as alliance with a monarchy, which furniſhed ample prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for every ſpecies of financial corruption, and which held their political opponents in mortal ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence. The merchants kept in view compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for previous piracies, a perpetuity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of their Britiſh credit, and the domeſtic danger of perſecution from the banks, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected this concluſive ſtep of the Hami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nian ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. The people, at large, who could have no intereſt but that of their country, believed aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the timid republican repreſentatives hardly ventured to contradict. Thus was the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:033485_0077_0FF71FA762B56040"/>
of the United States ſacrificed to the ſhort-ſighted proſpects of intereſt and fear. General infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation overlooked the moral certainty that France, having already broke down one half of Europe, would demand and extort from America a tenfold atonement for the ungrateful and injurious prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence given to the moſt deteſted of her enemies.</p>
               <p>The ſeaſon of repentance and degredation has at length arrived. Like Ceſar's ides of March, it has come, but it has not gone. On this head, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland Journal of June 18th, 1796, contains a few remarks that, like the prophecies of Caſſandra, will find belief when it is too late. They were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the capture of the Mount Vernon, a few days before, and are as follows.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Phoedrus, tells a ſtory of a man with whom two females were in love. His hair was half black and half grey. One of his admirers pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out all the grey hairs to make him look young; and the other all the black hairs to make him look o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> He very ſoon became bald.</p>
                  <p>The preſent condition of American commerce may be quoted as a corrollary to this fable. On one hand, the Britiſh, under the moſt frivolous or ſcandalous pretences, ſeize, plunder, and confiſcate American veſſels, beat or preſs the crew, and in the caſe of Mr. Boſſon, murder the captain. On the other hand, the French captain of the Flying Fiſh deliberately leaves his dwelling houſe at No. 399, North Front-ſtreet, Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, goes aboard of his veſſel, ſails down the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, captures one of our merchantmen, and ſhews the maſter a liſt of others which he is reſolved to take. He then ſtands in for the coaſt, turns the crew into a pilot boat, gives them his name and addreſs, and tells them that he has orders to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:033485_0078_0FF71FA9F0164998"/>
ſeize every veſſel which he knew or even <hi>ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> of being bound to or from Britain.</p>
                  <p>Thus the head of the axe is at once buried in the root of our commerce. Citizen Paris plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiders himſelf as acting by legal authority. He does not hide his candle under a buſhel. He has reſided in Philadelphia, where his family and houſhold furniture are ſtill very likely to be found, and where he is himſelf well known. When boarding the Mount Vernon, he behaves like a man conſcious of rectitude, and diſdainful of oppoſition, frankly tells his name, his place of reſidence, his inſtructions, and his intentions. It requires very little judgement to ſee that the captain of the Flying Fiſh is not a pirate. He muſt therefore be ſomething elſe; and it is not preſumptuous to think him only <hi>part of a ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous whole;</hi> in a word, that five hundred other privateers, belonging to the republic, have, or very ſoon will have, commiſſions of the ſame te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor with his.</p>
                  <p>The circumſtances announce profound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for this country. If France did not like our treaty with her Britiſh enemy, ſhe might have attempted to defeat it by negociation. But this ſhe ſcorned to do; for, though the Boſton Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel and the Minerva, have repeatedly ſaid that about fifty members of congreſs are traitors to their country and French tools, no body is weak enough to believe ſo impudent an aſſertion. France finds that ſhe can, by this time, do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, and ſcorns to enquire what are our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Proviſions are now as cheap and plentiful in France as here, and the want of them was the chief reaſon why ſhe courted our good will with ſo much aſſiduity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="unknown:033485_0079_0FF71FACAE147A70"/>Indeed many features in our behaviour to France ſeem deſigned to diſguſt her. Newſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and pamphlets have teemed with abuſe of the moſt inflammatory and indecent nature againſt the republic. They have been circulated with induſtry, and read with approbation, by a very numerous party among us. The word <hi>jacobin</hi> has been tranſplanted into the vocabulary of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican billingſgate; and, in fine, grinning where they could not bite, one half of our political au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, orators, and printers, have repreſented the French, by the lump, as the vileſt monſters that ever diſgraced the human form. It was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the French ſhould not be offended at ſuch childiſh inſolence, ſuch toothleſs malignity. We are now reaping the harveſt that we have ſown.</p>
                  <p>The naval power of Britain is a juſt object of terror to this country; but that of France, though inferior to the former, is yet, by a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of times, ſuperior to that of a nation whoſe navy conſiſts of three or four frigates, that have been for two years on the ſtocks, and are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to remain there. By a quarrel with Britain we might have had the miſerable revenge of plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering part of her commerce, but, from France, we can gain nothing better than bloody noſes and wooden legs. She has few trading ſhips at ſea; and, as for taking her privateers, the Flying Fiſh would hardly ſell at vendue for as much powder and ball as, in the common rate of fighting, would be wanted to ſink her.</p>
                  <p>Pretences for ſea-robbery are always to be had. The republic may declare Britain to be in a ſtate of ſiege; and with as much reaſon as the Britiſh have declared Guadaloupe to be ſo. She is then, by the law of nations, warranted to capture all
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:033485_0080_0FF71FAF31287CE8"/>
that goes out or comes in; and, between the two rivals, America is exactly in the ſame plight with the man in Phoedrus between his two miſtreſſes.</p>
                  <p>If France had ſent a dozen men of war to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack our ſea coaſt, it would have ſhown that ſhe at leaſt thought us capable of reſiſtance; but when a canoe of ſix nine pounders is made the inſtrument of alarm and vengeance, we may gueſs that her reſentment is exceeded by her contempt.</p>
                  <p>Much has been ſaid of the benefits reſulting to America from the privilege of trading in neutral bottoms during the preſent war. But the war has cauſed a riſe in the price of proviſions ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to many individuals. For one example, out of an hundred thouſand, there is a perſon now in a printing-office in Baltimore, whoſe wages were, three years ago, a dollar per week higher than they are now; while, at the ſame time, a dollar will not go half as far now as it did then. Individuals who are in this ſituation, plainly pay a perſonal tax, extending to half their income, on account of the war. To them it is evidently and highly oppreſſive.</p>
                  <p>The Engliſh have often envied the rapid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of America in the carrying trade. They have laboured in vain to thruſt her out of it. By a policy more acute than honourable, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is now within ſight of affecting her purpoſe. France, has, for many years, been fighting the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of America, but citizen Paris has now begun to fight thoſe of Britain. If he acts without autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the miſtake may coſt him his life, in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try like France, where the head of a man is ſometimes cut off with as little ceremony as the quarters of a bull frog.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:033485_0081_0FF71FB0C226A8C0"/>It is generally underſtood, that, in the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 1787, a form of government, in ſubſtance monarchical, was propoſed and rejected. Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton conducted this party. At the period of accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſtitution, the republicans were diſpleaſed by the length of time for which the ſenate hold their ſeats; and, it has been affirmed, that their friends in the convention, only acceded to it as a matter of compromiſe. If the ariſtocratical party had carried the point of a preſident and ſenate elected for twelve, or even eight years, this would have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, very completely, all the purpoſes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. They could, as at preſent, throw out every bill from the repreſentatives, which did not ſuit their views. In the mean time, their chief, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, had the abſolute diſpoſal of the loaves and fiſhes; and ſo long a period of uſeleſs reſiſtance, could not fail to wear out the obſtinacy of almoſt any republican in the lower houſe. Here then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold royalty in all its deformity of ſtrength and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption! The federal ſenate of twelve years were likely to have been more flexible, more abject, than even a Britiſh houſe of peers. The latter, in general, enjoy an independent property twenty or forty times greater than that of moſt American ſenators. Hence the former are leſs acceſſible than the latter, either to foreign or domeſtic corruption. Had Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton, therefore, and his party, obtained this object of a longer period for the election of a ſenate and preſident, the whole fruits of the revolution muſt have been forfeited. Of the two ſyſtems, Britiſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy would have been the leſſer evil. There is no peculiar ſublimity in American legiſlators, that would render them impenetrable to an argument from the mint. Franking, for inſtance, was not more odly perverted by an Engliſh member to pay the wages of his footman, than by Roger Sherman

               <p>The actual plan of a federal conſtitution, as laid before the convention by Mr. Hamilton, was never expoſed to the public view. A copy of it has been obtained for inſertion in this volume. It was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by a gentleman who has long held an important ſituation in the government of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. By ſingular good fortune, his character has eſcaped the ſhafts even of federal calumny; and his name is at the ſervice either of Mr. Hamilton, or of any gentleman who ſhall, at his deſire, enquire for it. In two or three ſentences he may have va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a word, from inaccuracy of tranſcription, but he is poſitive as to having preſerved the ideas, in every article, with ſtrict fidelity. The paper has alſo been read, in preſence of two members of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, to a gentleman who ſat in the convention; and he declared his belief that it was a faithful copy of the plan ſuggeſted by Mr. Hamilton. After this previous explanation, as to the authenticity of the paper, nothing remains but to give a copy of it, annexing to ſome of the articles a few obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                           <p n="1">I. The ſupreme legiſlative power of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States of America to be veſted in two differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent bodies of men; the <hi>one</hi> to be called the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; the <hi>other</hi> the ſenate, who together ſhall form the legiſlature of the United States, with power to paſs all laws whatſoever, ſubject to the <hi>negative</hi> hereafter mentioned.</p>

                           <p>[One year is long enough. The Senate are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably liſtleſs about the trifling buſineſs which they have to do; and this may be juſtly aſcribed to the length of time for which they are elected. The nation cannot hold its legiſlators by too ſhort a bridle.]</p>
                           <p n="3">III. The ſenate to conſiſt of perſons elected to ſerve during good behaviour; their election to be made by electors choſen for that purpoſe by the people; in order to this the ſtates to be divided into election diſtricts. On the death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, or reſignation of any ſenator, his place to be filled out of the diſtrict from which he came.</p>
                           <p>[This clauſe is exceptionable. To ſerve during good behaviour means to hold the office for life; ſince if a ſenator votes with the majority, it is about impoſſible to get him diſmiſſed. This has been proved by two well known caſes in the preſent ſenate. As for this mode of electing by electors, it gave room for that juggling by which Mr. Adams obtained the preſidency. The paper muſt imply, though it has not been ſo expreſſed, that the ſenate were to have a negative on the acts paſſed by the repreſentatives. Thus legiſlation would iſſue in an ariſtocracy holding their ſeats for life. It would be far preferable to ſend back for an Engliſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor.]</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. The ſupreme executive authority of the United States to be veſted in a <hi>governor</hi> to be elected during good behaviour; the election to be made by electors choſen by the people in the election diſtricts aforeſaid: the authorities and functions to be as follows; to have a <hi>negative</hi> upon all laws about to be paſſed, and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all laws paſſed; to have the direction of
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:033485_0084_0FF71FBA3A22C060"/>
war, when authoriſed or begun; to have, with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, the power of making all treaties; to have the ſole appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the heads or chief officers of finance and foreign affairs; to have the nomination of all other officers, ambaſſadors to foreign nations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, ſubject to the approbation, or rejection of the ſenate; to have power of pardoning all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, except treaſon, which he ſhall not pardon without the approbation of the ſenate.</p>
                           <p>[America has been taught, by experience, that the ſenatorial check on the preſident is a mere ſhadow. The number of ſenators is ſo ſmall, and the offices which he has to beſtow are ſo many, that a preſident always has comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and always may command, the acquieſcence of a majority in any meaſure that he thinks fit. The contrary can only happen by a very unuſual combination of circumſtances. But when this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and ſenate hold their ſeats for life, nothing but jobbing and corruption can be expected to enſue. The executive negative on the laws en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting the welfare of a whole people to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or folly of a ſingle man, is one of the very worſt features in monarchy. The power of making treaties, as explained by congreſs in the caſe of Jay, implies any thing and everything. Inſtead of holding his office for life, a preſident ſhould not hold it for more than two years at a time, leaving the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to elect him a ſecond time if they ſaw proper. This would diminiſh the probability of his becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a penſioner to ſome foreign power; as the ſhortneſs of his ſtay in office would make it leſs worth while to purchaſe him. Such a ſale is far within the chapter of poſſibilities. Suppoſe that ſome future chief magiſtrate of America ſhall write an encomium, in three volumes, on the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:033485_0085_0FF71FBC063EA200"/>
conſtitution of Ruſſia; that the latter country ſhall be at war with England; and that he ſhall, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of the intereſt of his conſtituents, and to the apparent ruin of the government itſelf, attempt to plunge America into the quarrel, as an ally of Ruſſia. Reaſon muſt conclude, that the court of Peterſburgh has paid him handſomely for his efforts. The probability of a ſecret penſion will be increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if it ſhall tranſpire, that this preſident, before his elevation, correſponded, in a very diſhonourable mode, with ſome ſpy or informer at Peterſburg.</p>
                           <p>With the powers conferred by Mr. Hamilton's propoſal, an American <hi>governor</hi> would want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of royalty but the name.]</p>
                           <p n="5">V. On the death, reſignation, or removal of the governor, his authorities to be exerciſed by the preſident of the ſenate, till a ſucceſſor be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI.

                           <p>[The ſole power of declaring war is, in itſelf, ſuch a ſweeping privilege, as could not be ſafely entruſted but to the immediate repreſentatives of the people. This would be a complete ariſtocracy.]</p>

So immenſe an accumulation of patronage, would have made them as abſolute as the late kings of France. Such a ſyſtem as that here ſketched out was a direct extirpation of the liberties of America. General Waſhington, as a member of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, knew this plan; and that it met with his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation is plain; for when raiſed to the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, he appointed Mr. Hamilton to be ſecretary of the treaſury. This office, in the way by which Mr. Hamilton conducted it, immediately comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twenty times the real influence enjoyed by Mr. Jefferſon, as ſecretary of ſtate. The preſident thereafter continued to foſter Mr. Hamilton with augmenting confidence, and never failed to ratify all the ſtatutes of his majority. Theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſpeak very diſtinctly; nor will the preſident's tuneful periods in praiſe of republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment obliterate the ſtain. Mr. Waſhington ought to have held in deteſtation every man capable of inventing or defending ſo vile a ſcheme. Inſtead of that, the apoſtle of a federal throne was preſſed to his boſom.</p>
               <p>When ſuch plans were in agitation, it is not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing that a party in the convention became ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to ſhut their doors. But time has, at length, rent the veil of ſecrecy; and the primitive prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and projects of Mr. Hamilton and his friends are now fairly committed to the world.</p>
               <p>When, in the convention of 1787, the vote was carried for ſhutting the doors, the republican par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould have walked out of the houſe. Their want of firmneſs hath been the ſole cauſe of their depreſſion. It was of infinite conſequence that the opinions and arguments of every member in the convention ſhould be exactly known. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans could not have committed a greater er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror than by flinching from the publicity of debates.
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:033485_0088_0FF71FC5738387D0"/>
As the convention met in order to frame a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative government, their numbers ought to have borne ſome proportion to the importance of the ſtates from whence they came. For though the meeting voted ſeperately by ſtates, and not in an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual maſs, yet ſtill that ſtate which ſent the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt number of repreſentatives had the beſt chance of obtaining its own wiſhes. Five lawyers in a cauſe have the advantage over two of equal abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. To this convention Pennſylvania ſent eight repreſentatives, Delaware five, Maſſachuſetts two, Virginia three, and New-York one. The conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was indeed to be thereafter ſubmitted to the ſtates ſeperately; but, when once framed, it was difficult to get an alteration without rejecting the whole plan.</p>

                  <p>Remarks on Mr. Alexander Hamilton's explanation of his correſpondence with James Reynolds.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ON Auguſt 25th, 1797, a pamphlet was publiſhed at Philadelphia, under the following title: <q>Obſervations on Certain Documents, contained in No. V. and VI. of <hi>the Hiſtory of the United States, for the year</hi> 1796, in which the Charge of Speculation, againſt Alexander Hamilton, late Secretary of the Treaſury, is fully refuted. Written by Himſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This piece extends to thirty-five pages, beſides an appendix of fifty-eight. The firſt part compriſes the author's reply to the accuſation againſt him. The latter contains fifty-ſix letters and other papers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="unknown:033485_0089_0FF71FC74A3E2970"/>Mr. Hamilton opens his pamphlet with a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of the jacobins of America. In his dialect, the word jacobin comprehends one-half of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of the United States; for, at the late election of preſident, the two parties, under the reſpective names of Adams and Jefferſon, were exactly ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced. By accident, or fraud, a part of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of Pennſylvania were prevented from tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their votes to this city, within the time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by law. Hence Mr. Jefferſon had only thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſuffrages from this ſtate, when the voice of the people had given him fifteen. The transference of theſe two votes to the oppoſite ſcale, decided againſt Mr. Jefferſon. He loſt the preſidency by a minority of ſixty-eight ſuffrages againſt ſeventy-one. Had the remainder of the Pennſylvania votes been accepted, he would have been preſident by ſeventy againſt ſixty-nine.</p>
               <p>When two parties are thus minutely poiſed, they ſhould, if poſſible, ſpeak about each other with temper and decency. Such conduct ought eſpecially to be expected from Mr. Hamilton; who filled, for about ſeven years, one of the firſt offices under the federal government. An idea of gravity and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is annexed to ſuch a ſtation.</p>
               <p>Of American jacobins our ex-ſecretary ſpeaks thus. <q>The moſt direct falſhoods are invented and propagated, with undaunted effrontery, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting perſeverance. Lies, often detected and refuted, are ſtill revived and repeated, in the hope that the refutation may have been forgotten, or that the frequency and boldneſs of accuſation may ſupply the place of truth and proof.—If truly this be, as every appearance indicates, a conſpiracy of vice againſt virtue, ought I not rather to be
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:033485_0090_0FF71FC9D0632120"/>
flattered, that I have been ſo long and ſo peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly an object of perſecution<note n="*" place="bottom">Obſervations, &amp;c. p. 4.</note>?</q>
               </p>
               <p>This martyr of virtue, this exulting object of perſecution, this antagoniſt of falſhood, has publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ninety-three pages to prove, that he was guilty of conjugal infidelity, that is of <hi>breaking an oath;</hi> for the latter is one of the crimes comprehended within the former. This is the man, who, at the ſame moment, has the hardineſs to announce <q>a conſpiracy of vice againſt virtue.</q> Mr. Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſhould ſpeak with reſerve as to the faults of others. The portrait which he draws of American jacobins, correſponds, preciſely, with the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and meaſures common, though not univerſal, among the writers and leaders of the federal party. No man has plunged farther than Mr. Hamilton himſelf into the ocean of calumny. He ſhould, therefore, be one of the laſt men to complain about it.</p>
               <p>The entire form and eſſence of this vindication is ſo vile, ſo diſguſting, ſo groſsly indecent, that one hardly knows either how to tranſcribe or abridge it. Some of the principal facts are as follows.</p>
               <p>In ſummer, 1791, Maria, the wife of James Reynolds, waited upon Mr. Hamilton at his houſe in Philadelphia. She told him that her huſband had treated her with cruelty, and deſerted her; that her relations reſided in the ſtate of New-York, and ſhe ſolicited money to pay the expence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to them. Mr. Hamilton, for the purpoſe of beſtowing charity, paid a viſit to Mrs. Reynolds at her lodgings. "She met me," ſays he, <q>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me into a <hi>bed</hi> room.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After this, adds our author, I had frequent meetings with her, moſt of them at my own
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:033485_0091_0FF71FCFCAA11D78"/>
houſe; <hi>Mrs. Hamilton, with her children, being abſent on a viſit to her father.</hi>
                  </q> OBSERVATIONS, p. 18. The ex-ſecretary might have ſpared the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional offence of this palliation. If he had really felt that remorſe and ſhame to which he pretends, Mr. Hamilton never could have printed this lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage of circumſtances. They were not requiſite even to "wipe away <hi>a more ſerious ſtain.</hi>" OBSERVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS, p. 10. Their omiſſion could not have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired the force, but they add to the ignominy of his exculpation. Mr. Hamilton might have copied the delicacy of the painter, who caſt a veil over the face of Agammenon, to conceal what it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to expreſs.</p>
               <p>An indignant huſband ſoon makes his appearance; and Mrs. Reynolds, in a letter to the colonel, ſays that he had been ſwearing he would write to Mrs. Hamilton. This was in December 1791. No. II. of the appendix is a letter from the huſband demanding <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> which he affirms that he <hi>will</hi> have, "before one day paſſes me more." In No. IV. he ſays <q>I have this propoſal to make to you. Give me the ſum of one thouſand dollars.</q> There next follow two receipts for this money, the one for ſix and the other for four hundred dollars. The lady was unwilling to quit ſo good a friend. She addreſſes him in love ſick epiſtles, real or forged, and declares that till he ſhall viſit her, <q>my breaſt will be the ſeate of pain and woe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Reynolds himſelf, alſo, writes a letter to the colonel, dated March 24th, 1792. He expatiates on his own good nature in permitting the ex-ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary's viſits, gives hints of his power to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and of his diſpoſition to oblige. Some other letters ſucceed, demanding money. They had been complied with, for it appears by No. XV. da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted April 17th, 1792, that the colonel continued
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:033485_0092_0FF71FD15E3ED7F8"/>
his viſits. On the 2d of May, he received a formal prohibition from ever ſeeing the lady again. <q>I was in hopes, ſays Reynolds, that it would ware off, but I find their is no hopes.</q> Solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for money follow. The two hundred dollars mentioned by Clingman<note n="*" place="bottom">Documents, No. 4.</note> were obtained to fit up a boarding houſe. The laſt letter is dated Auguſt 30th, 1792. In the OBSERVATIONS p. 9, Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton calls this an <hi>amorous</hi> connection. If this account be true, it merited a coarſer name.</p>
               <p>The object in publiſhing this correſpondence is to prove that the connection between Reynolds and the ex-ſecretary did not refer to the purchaſe of certificates, but to the charms of Mrs. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Yet Mr. Hamilton and his friends have always enlarged on his poverty. The ſcale of expence in this affair diſagrees with that ſuppoſition. In eighteen months Maria, muſt have coſt him at leaſt about eighteen hundred dollars. The expence is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant in proportion to its end. It revolts againſt his well known character for economy. He ſays that he was afraid of having the matter known to Mrs. Hamilton. Yet in her abſence, he had frequent interviews with Mrs. Reynolds at <hi>his own houſe.</hi> This betrays but ſmall regard for the ſecret. <q>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, have ears, as well as other people,</q> ſays Slipſlop. It appears, likewiſe, that he received nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous meſſages and letters from the parties, and that Reynolds paid him ſeveral viſits at his houſe. All this diſcovers little attention to the dread of diſcloſure; and indeed the ſtory was well enough known.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hamilton reſts much upon the profligate character of the parties, and the improbability of his having entruſted ſuch a being as Reynolds with

his ſecrets of ſpeculation. But, by his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he did commit his confidence to this man, and protracted the connection with his wife during a whole year after he had been menaced with a diſcovery.</p>
               <p>His pamphlet, full as it is of defiance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation, puts a cloſe to his claims for ſuperior ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity. He who acknowledged the reality of ſuch epiſtles, could feel no ſcruple to forge them. The latter ſuppoſition is as favourable as the former to his good name. He ſpeaks much about his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Mrs. Hamilton, while he ſquandered what was due to his family, and rambled, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, for eighteen months in the embraces of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
               <p>The evidence or preſumption againſt the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity of the letters printed by Mr. Hamilton ſtands thus. Reynolds affirms, that Mr. Hamilton had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed him as an agent of ſpeculation. This the ex-ſecretary denies; but, their probity being upon a par, we know not which of them to believe. Mrs. Reynolds adds her teſtimony, as to the belief of ſpeculation, and ſays, that the correſpondence and receipts for money, ſince publiſhed by Mr. Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, were fabricated by him and her huſband<note n="*" place="bottom">Documents, No. V. See Hiſtory of 1796, Chap. VI. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel has reprinted the other papers, but leaves out No. V.</note>. But if they actually were ſo, it remains to be gueſſed <hi>why, when,</hi> and <hi>where</hi> they were compoſed.</p>
               <p>On this hypotheſis we are to believe that Mr. Hamilton, on the motive of threats from Reynolds, and of his being viſited in priſon by Meſſrs. Muh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenberg, Monroe, and Venable, haſted his enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This happened, on the evening of Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the 12th of December, 1797. The interview between Mr. Hamilton and the members was on the evening of Saturday following. The correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:033485_0094_0FF71FD4A220E870"/>
muſt have been framed in the interval; and a day or a few hours were ſufficient for that effect.</p>
               <p>In No. IV. Clingman, ſays, that Reynolds, on the night of his liberation, ſent a meſſage to Mr. Hamilton, and by deſire waited on him on Thurſday morning. In No. V. he relates ſome particulars, which, according to his account from Reynolds, paſt at this interview. Clingman, in a poſt-ſcript to No. V. ſays, that, as Mrs. Reynolds aſſured him, the letters were <hi>fabricated by her huſband and Mr. Hamilton.</hi> The latter, in this publication, takes no notice of the allegation by Clingman, that <hi>he,</hi> (Mr. Hamilton) <hi>ſaw Reynolds after his enlargement.</hi> He ought, in conſiſtency to have denied it. But he had already owned the fact to the three members. Mr. Hamilton, a rake, and Mr. Reynolds, a ſwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dler, alternately give each other the lie. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of untruth and fraud upon each ſide is ſo great, that it is impracticable to determine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them<note n="*" place="bottom">In the Hiſtory of 1796, it is ſaid, by miſtake, that Mr. Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton received a copy of the whole documents therein publiſhed. From the Obſervations it comes out, that he never ſaw No. V. till in print.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the appendix, No. XXXIII. we meet with a letter to Mr. Hamilton, from Meſſrs. Muhlenberg and Monroe, dated 17th of July, 1797, wherein they write thus: <q>the explanation of the nature of your connection with Reynolds, which you then gave, removed the ſuſpicions we had before entertained of your being connected with him in ſpeculation.</q> There is another from Mr. Vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſame effect. The ex-ſecretary reſts much upon this admiſſion. But every other perſon is now equally well qualified with theſe gentlemen to judge of the evidence; ſo that this is nothing more than the opinion of three individuals.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:033485_0095_0FF71FDC1B9683E8"/>Yet even their opinion is unfortunately mutila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Mr. Hamilton has printed thirteen letters that paſſed between himſelf and Mr. Monroe. From theſe it appears that Mr. Monroe ſtill entertained conſiderable doubts. They were grounded on the information given by Clingman, which cloſes No. V, and bears date the 2d of January, 1793. In one letter Mr. Monroe ſays, <q>whether the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations againſt you as to ſpeculation, are well or ill founded, depends upon the facts and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which appear againſt you upon your defence. If you ſhew that they are ill founded, I ſhall be contented.</q> Mr. Hamilton, in a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding letter, writes thus: <q>the reſult in my mind is, that you have been and are actuated by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives towards me <hi>malignant</hi> and <hi>diſhonourable.</hi>
                  </q> The parties wrote on till they were at the point of fighting a duel. The ſecond claſs of doubts excited in Mr. Monroe, by Clingman, as to the innocence of the ex-ſecretary, did not take place till ſome weeks after the three members had received the explanation from Mr. Hamilton. The one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance happened on the 15th of December, 1792, and, the other on the 2d of January thereafter. Now, the exculpatory letters from the three mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers refer to nothing ſubſequent to the former date; and as the ſuſpicions of Mr. Monroe were revived by Clingman, it is natural to imagine that thoſe of Meſſrs. Muhlenberg and Venable were likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited. Whether this was the caſe, or not, appears of little conſequence, unleſs, becauſe it ſhews the very ſlippery nature of the vindication derived from them. If this was the beſt defence which they would give to Mr. Hamilton, he has but ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty room for triumph.</p>
               <p>The colonel dwells, with much complacency, on his own tranſcendant dignity of character. <q>It is
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:033485_0096_0FF71FDDB08C6BC8"/>
morally impoſſible," ſays he, "I ſhould have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fooliſh as well as depraved <hi>enough</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſo vile an inſtrument as Reynolds for ſuch inſignificant ends, as are indicated by different parts of the ſtory itſelf.</q> OBSERVATIONS. p. 10. The ends alledged were, ſpeculation to the extent of thirty thouſand dollars. Mr. Hamilton pretends that he employed Reynolds as a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent huſband. This end was <hi>infinitely</hi> more inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant than the other; ſo that the inference in the above paſſage evidently contradicts the fact.</p>
               <p>On p. 13, he ſpeaks of <q>the general improbabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that I ſhould put myſelf upon paper with ſo deſpicable a perſon, on a ſubject which might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me to infamy.</q> The improbability has actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally been fulfilled.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>As to the diſappearance of the parties after the liberation, how am I anſwerable for it? Is it not preſumable, that the inſtance diſcovered at the treaſury was not <hi>the only offence of the kind of which they were guilty?</hi> After one detection, is it not very probable that Reynolds fled to avoid detection in other caſes?—Reynolds was conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably in debt. What more natural for him than to fly from his creditors?</q> OBSERVATIONS, p. 35. <q>Could it be expected that I ſhould ſo debaſe myſelf as to think it neceſſary to my vindication to be confronted with a perſon ſuch as Reynolds? Could I have borne to ſuffer my veracity to be expoſed to the humiliating competition?</q> Ibid p. 36. This tone does not become Mr. Hamilton. People of regular morals, think that the profligate, who debauches another man's wife, cannot be <hi>degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> by confronting her huſband.</p>
               <p>As to the diſappearance of Reynolds, after his enlargement, Mr. Hamilton has not even offered to deny the having ſeen him privately on the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:033485_0097_0FF71FDF70CC4770"/>
day at his own houſe. In No. V. of the documents, he owned to the three members of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, <q>that he had received a note from Reynolds in <hi>the night,</hi> at the time ſtated in Clingman's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and that he had likewiſe ſeen him in <hi>the morning following.</hi>
                  </q> This looks ſomewhat myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious. The diſmiſſion of Reynolds from priſon, without trial, remains to find a decent apology; but, if it was preſumable that he had been guilty of other and ſimilar offences, this highly aggravated the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of diſcharging him. As to his running away for debt, there does not appear any particular reaſon for thinking that he fled on this account. Reynolds, in his torn letter to Clingman, gave a more natural and ſimple account of his intended diſappearance. <q>He has offered to furniſh me and Mrs. Reynolds with money to <hi>carry us off.</hi> If I will go, he will ſee that ſhe has money to <hi>follow me.</hi>
                  </q> The word <hi>he</hi> can refer only to Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton, which is clear from the reſt of the letter. He was writing in full confidence to Clingman, and could have no imaginable reaſon to frame a fiction.</p>
               <p>The confronting of Reynolds with Hamilton, before the three members of congreſs, would have been more ſatisfactory to them than the production of any papers. Beſides, although our ex-ſecretary profeſſes ſuch diſdain of being placed in a ſtate of compariſon with him, yet the inſtinctive indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of innocence, would have prompted moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to drag forward ſo perfidious an accuſer; and, in preſence of the gentlemen, to have extorted a confeſſion of his fraud. The ſame ſhyneſs of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing to the original parties, appears in this pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet. Clingman and the lady have been married. They reſide now at Alexandria. Reynolds himſelf lives, it is ſaid, in New-York. If the letters pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Mr. Hamilton in the name of Maria are
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:033485_0098_0FF71FE108A58810"/>
genuine, it would be very eaſy to obtain her atteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the fact. A juſtice of peace, at Alexandria, could diſpatch the buſineſs in half an hour. She could be directed to give a ſample of her hand; and, by comparing this with the letters, it would be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained whether or not they really came from her pen. But Camillus dares not to meet this teſt.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of ſuch an obvious and deciſive elucida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Mr. Hamilton <note n="*" place="bottom">Appendix, No. XLI.</note> brings forward Mary Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams, keeper of a boarding houſe in Philadelphia. This woman ſwears, that ſhe is well acquainted with the hand writing of Mrs. Reynolds, and that ſhe is <hi>well ſatisfied</hi> of the letters being genuine. She gives no particulars of her acquaintance with Mrs. Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, except the declining to admit of her as a lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. This is as lame a kind of evidence as can well be conceived. Why not appeal to the lady herſelf, in place of ſuch a circuitous method?</p>
               <p>Theſe letters from Mrs. Reynolds are badly ſpelt and pointed. Capitals, alſo, occur even in the midſt of words. But waving ſuch excreſcences, the ſtile is pathetic and even elegant. It does not bear the marks of an illiterate writer. The conſtruction of the periods diſagrees with this apparent incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of ſpelling. The officer who can marſhall a regiment, muſt know how to level a muſquet. A few groſs blunders are interſperſed, and theſe could readily be deviſed; but, when ſtript of ſuch a veil, the body of the compoſition is pure and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. In the literary world, fabrications of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have been frequent. Our ex-ſecretary admits that he has been in the habit of writing to this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in a feigned character. The tranſition was eaſy to the writing in a feigned ſtile. Mrs. Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds herſelf may have wrote theſe epiſtles from
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:033485_0099_0FF7201A2D340198"/>
the dictating of the colonel; for <q>the variety of ſhapes which this woman could aſſume was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Obſervations, p. 31.</note>.</q> It is natural, then, to ſuſpect, that ſhe real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may have acted that part. But if the colonel is not afraid of her ſpringing a leak in the bottom of his tale, why does he avoid her teſtimony, and try to divert our attention by the prattle of Mary Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams?</p>
               <p>But even admitting that the love letters and others were genuine, this does not take away the probability of a ſwindling connection between Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds and Hamilton. The way in which the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel and Maria became acquainted reſts on the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle evidence of himſelf. Reynolds does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have dropped to Clingman even a hint of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency. Mrs. Reynolds<note n="†" place="bottom">Documents, No. III.</note> told the three mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of congreſs that ſhe had burned a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of letters from Mr. Hamilton to her huſband. The dread that her depoſition may ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon this fact, appears the only reaſon why the colonel chuſes to keep her out of the way.</p>
               <p>Hence, if the letters from Mrs. Reynolds are in her hand writing, this does not prove that they were the real effuſions of a libidinous correſpondence. If that correſpondence had a being, it does not deſtroy the poſſibility of another, of a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſort, between the colonel and the huſband. Speculation in June may well conſiſt with adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in December. The whole proof in this pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet reſts upon an alluſion. <q>I am a rake, and for that reaſon I cannot be a ſwindler. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that I ſtole a horſe; but, if you ſay that I ſtole a cow, I ſcorn to be confronted with my accuſers.</q> This is an edifying and convenient ſpecies of logic. Both Reynolds and his lady af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:033485_0100_0FF67B9410C54620"/>
that there was a ſpeculation, and until they undergo a thorough examination, before ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per authority, the doubt never can be reſolved. Under ſuch circumſtances, it was proper that Mr. Monroe ſhould ſuſpend his judgment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hamilton ſays<note n="*" place="bottom">Obſervations p. 8.</note>, that, during his diſcuſſion with the three members, he diſcovered no ſymptom different from that of <hi>a proud conſciouſneſs of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</hi> What pride, what conſcious innocence, any man could feel, in the midſt of ſuch an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, the reader is left to judge.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the main points in Mr. Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's piece. A few epiſodes remain to be handled. It now comes out that the improper communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the treaſury office to Reynolds and Cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man were made by <hi>Fraunces,</hi> a clerk therein. This man afterwards preſented a memorial to congreſs arraigning Mr. Hamilton. His charge was rejected as groundleſs. In a note, the ex-ſecretary adds, <q>would it be believed, after all this, that Mr. Jefferſon, vice-preſident of the United States, would write to this Fraunces friendly letters? Yet ſuch is the fact.</q> In the appendix, we find theſe alarming epiſtles. Obſerve now, to what a deſtitution of materials the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Thomas Jefferſon are reduced! The firſt letter, dated June 27th, 1797, muſt have been in anſwer to ſome requeſt for money. <q>I ſhall not have one dollar to ſpare,</q> ſays the vice-preſident. Another, dated next day, refuſes a <hi>certificate of character.</hi> This is the wonderful friendſhip ſo ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nerves of our fiſcal Atlas! The letters are, in themſelves, entirely unimportant. They have no reference to any part of the ex-ſecretary's budget. In what way he got them, or for what reaſon he
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:033485_0101_0FF67B95F72395D8"/>
printed them, is yet to be told. They cannot leſſen, by the value of one cent, the reputation of our vice-preſident. If this correſpondence is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt faults in Mr. Jefferſon which hatred can diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and fury reveal, he enjoys the pureſt character which has adorned hiſtory. But ſince Hamilton ſpeaks of diſreputable correſpondence, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind him of that which he ſupported, for a twelve month, with Mr. Reynolds, and of his crouching under the menaces of this precious agent <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>
                        <q>Mrs. Reynolds, more than once, communicated to me, that Reynolds would occaſionally relapſe into diſcontent at his <hi>ſituation;</hi> would treat her very ill, hint at the aſſaſſination of me, and more openly threaten, by way of revenge, to inform Mrs. Hamilton.</q>
                     </p>
                     <bibl>Obſervations, p. 15.</bibl>
                  </note>. If any thing, within one million of degrees of ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, can be fixed on Mr. Jefferſon, pray let us hear it; for, in that lexicon of lies and calumnies, printed by our Portugueſe ambaſſador, Dr. Smith, hardly one article, granting it to be true, has the veſtige of common ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of inveighing againſt the republican party, as propagators of ſlander, Mr. Hamilton ought to thank them for a degree of forbearance and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of which his friends have very ſeldom ſet an example. During the time of this connection, it was known to many members of congreſs. If any repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican character had been the hero of the ſtory, it would infallibly have been echoed from one end of the continent to the other. Yet that party, with much good nature, obſerved profound ſilence. Mr. Jefferſon had received a copy of theſe documents. He never ſhewed them, nor ever ſpoke of them, to any perſon. In ſummer, 1797, when the vice-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident heard of the intended publication, he adviſed that the papers ſhould be ſuppreſſed. Benevolence could not go farther, but his interpoſition came too
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:033485_0102_0FF71FE89D9A1060"/>
late. Mr. Hamilton well knew that Mr. Jefferſon was maſter of his ſecret, and had kept it; and yet he took the opportunity of this pamphlet to attack his benefactor's reputation. If the papers had been printed four years ſooner, the beſt effects might have enſued to America, for the preſident would undoubtedly have diſmiſſed Camillus.</p>
               <p>Quitting theſe two letters from Jefferſon to Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we come to the offence for which Reynolds was impriſoned, and the cauſes for which he was diſcharged. Mr. Wolcott<note n="*" place="bottom">Appendix No. XXIV.</note> ſays, that Reynolds and Clingman were proſecuted for having <hi>ſuborned a perſon to commit perjury.</hi> After the proſecution commenced, Clingman confeſſed that he and Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds had liſts of the names and ſums due to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain creditors of the United States, and which had been obtained from a clerk in the treaſury, with a view to the forgery of warrants on it, in the name of ſuch creditors. As to the name of this clerk, Hamilton, in No. V, intimated to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that it was Duer. But Wolcott<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> affirms, that Duer had no concern with it. Thus, the two gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen contradict each other, and on a point which muſt have been equally well known to both. Mr. Wolcott explains the reaſon for withdrawing the proſecution, which was, that the offenders gave up the liſts of creditors obtained from the treaſury, and told the name of the unfaithful clerk. This he calls "an important diſcovery." As for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the liſts, theſe were only copies, and not original papers. It was quite eaſy for the parties to keep other copies, and proceed to fabricate warrants; indeed they might withhold and conceal part of the very liſts which they had got from the treaſury.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="unknown:033485_0103_0FF71FEA312C0728"/>Mr. Hamilton, ſpeaking of this diſmiſſion, ſays, <q>it was certainly of more conſequence to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic to detect and expel from the boſom of the treaſury department, an unfaithful clerk, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent future and extenſive miſchief, than to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and puniſh two worthleſs individuals.</q>— OBSERVATIONS, p. 34. But the ex-ſecretary ſhould have proved that the diſmiſſion of the one was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary towards the diſcovery of the other; and this he has not done. <q>The culprits were compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to give <hi>a real and ſubſtantial equivalent</hi> for the relief which they obtained from a department <hi>over which I preſided.</hi>
                  </q> Ibid. The ſubſtantiality is very doubtful. As for <hi>preſiding,</hi> the comptroller is independent. Either Mrs. Reynolds was the real and ultimate cauſe of this diſcharge, or it reſulted from ſome inviſible machinery, which the movers do not chuſe to bring forward. It revolts againſt propriety, and the official judgment of Mr. Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cott, to ſay, that he would diſmiſs two criminals for ſo trifling a reaſon. Clingman, of himſelf, confeſſed to Wolcott, the affair of the ſtolen liſts of names from the treaſury. From the certificate of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note n="*" place="bottom">Appendix, No. XXIV.</note>, it is to be underſtood, that he made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, unſolicited, and even unſuſpected. But adds the comptroller, <q>both Clingman and Reynolds obſtinately refuſed, for ſometime, to deliver up the liſts, or to diſcloſe the name of the perſon through whoſe infidelity they had been obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q> All this muſt clearly be a ſham. The cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prits were under proſecution for another crime, the ſubornation of perjury. Their deſpair is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from the voluntary confeſſion of Clingman. The delivery of the liſts, and the diſcloſure of the name of their aſſociate, were matters of courſe.
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:033485_0104_0FF71FEC13918968"/>
The comptroller had only to proceed with his ſuit, and could, at any period, have enſured the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of every ſecret which they had. When a public officer, like Mr. Wolcott, conjures up an abſurd excuſe for having deſerted his duty, thoſe who pay his ſalary have a right to criticiſe him. Mr. Wolcott diſmiſſed, with impunity, two offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that, as he ſays, he might reach Fraunces, a clerk in the treaſury. Had the comptroller been a boy or a fool, reaſon might have ſmiled at his frivolity of triumph. But ſince he is a man of long experience in buſineſs, and free from the ſallies of a florid imagination, it is juſt to infer that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deeper than vanity lies at the bottom of the pool.</p>
               <p>Other paſſages in this pamphlet might admit of remark, but the above appears to be a ſufficient ſpecimen. The arguments and the teſtimony pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by our ex-ſecretary are alike unſatisfactory. He lays much weight upon the purity and elevation of his perſonal character. His own performance explodes it. He triumphs in an exculpation from the three members of congreſs. Yet, as to Meſſrs. Monroe and Muhlenberg, his auxiliary writers conſtantly repreſent them as traitors to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. According to Mr. Hamilton's own deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of jacobins, they muſt be the vileſt of mankind; and their atteſtation can deſerve no credit what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; but yet it fills him with pride. An impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial byſtander might addreſs him thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If Muhlenberg, and his two friends, are the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands of faction, which you repreſent them to be, then it was unworthy of your innocence to aſk a vindication from them. The oak does not lean upon the bramble; nor ſtrength court the protection of weakneſs. But ſince you have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to theſe gentlemen, in defence of your
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:033485_0105_0FF71FF1A945EB00"/>
character, you betray an evident conſciouſneſs that they have a character to loſe. This earneſt recourſe to their honour diſcovers that you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe your own general portrait of jacobins; and the peculiar reproaches that your ſcribblers have poured on Meſſrs. Muhlenberg and Monroe. A veſtal does not prop her purity by the evidence of a bawd; nor a Sully waſh his hands while Cartouche holds the baſon. You arraign theſe men as calumniators; and, on the ſame page, you refer to their veracity in defence of yours. This is a contradiction. You placed yourſelf in a delicate ſituation. If they had refuſed, as they well might have done, to take notice of your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, your fame was, by your own arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a dangerous way. The confidence that you repoſed in them, and the alacrity which, in ſpite of all provocations, they have manifeſted to ſerve you, refute your clamours againſt them. The firſt ſtep in ſupport of your ſame, fixes you in detected calumny.</q>

                  <q>You give an inſufficient reaſon, for the releaſe of Reynolds from jail. You received a viſit from him before ſunriſe on the enſuing morning. He then diſappeared; and when the three gentlemen waited on you reſpecting his accuſations, you tell a long hiſtory of an intrigue, and produce a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of letters concerning it. That they are the real hand writing of the parties we have no proof but your word, and a depoſition from the miſtreſs of a boarding-houſe. On the contrary, Reynolds never ſpoke to Clingman of any thing but ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. His wife adds her ſuſpicion; and affirms, that the love epiſtles, and receipts for money, are a fabrication by her huſband and you. The whole collection would not have required above an evening to write them. At the diſtance of four

years and an half, and when warned and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged to produce the parties themſelves, you ſtill avoid a perſonal reference. You ſpeak as if it was impoſſible to invent a few letters. Yet, upon this very buſineſs, you wrote in a feigned hand. And what is your molehill appendix, altogether, to the gigantic fabrications of Pſalmanazar and of Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton? Send for the lady, or pay her a viſit. Take her before a magiſtrate, and let us hear what ſhe has to ſay. Your avoiding a public meeting with her, holds out a ſtrong preſumption of her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Try, alſo, to find out Reynolds. Never pretend that you ſcorn to confront accuſers. The world will believe that you dare not.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this addreſs the ex-ſecretary would be puzzled to make a ſound anſwer. Some of his friends are leſs ſore than he is on the ſubject of ſpeculation. In ſpring, 1794, commodore Gillon, replying, in congreſs, to Dr. William Smith, ſaid, <q>what makes the gentleman angry? Did I ſpeak a word of <hi>pilot boats?</hi>
                  </q> The doctor pocketed this hint, which was equally well underſtood by every man in the houſe. Dr. Smith has always been among the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the battles of the ex-ſecretary; and no fact is beter believed, than that many others of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral members did ſpeculate in certificates to the amount of millions. Of this party, Mr. Hamilton was the centre and the ſoul. He not merely plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but dictated their meaſures; a circumſtance eſtabliſhed by the uniform correſpondence between his reports and the ſtatute book of the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond congreſs. Now, if he really did not touch a cent of their earnings, ſtill he muſt own that he kept ſorry company. If Mr. Hamilton ſhook from about his ears the golden ſhower, and trampled under foot the wages of ſpeculation, he can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than a ſecond Abdiel.</p>
               <p>

                  <q>Of all the vile attempts which have been made to injure my character," ſays Mr. Hamilton, that which has been lately revived in No V. and VI. of the Hiſtory of the United States, for 1796, is <hi>the moſt vile.</hi>—A juſt pride, with reluctance ſtoops to a formal vindication againſt ſo deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a contrivance, and is inclined rather to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to it <hi>the uniform evidence of an upright cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This would be my conduct on the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, did not the tale derive ſome ſanction from the names of three men of ſome weight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</q> OBSERVATIONS, p. 9.</p>
               <p>As for the vileneſs of <hi>the attempt,</hi> &amp;c. it is as fair as any thing can be. In committing the documents to preſs, the publiſher exerciſed a right and a duty. It did not appear, from any thing on the face of theſe papers, that the three gentlemen were ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Mr. Hamilton's explanation. And he knew that they were not unanimous in the acquittal. The enquiry was a public concern, and the public were entitled to judge for themſelves.</p>
               <p>With regard to <hi>uniform uprightneſs of character,</hi> there is no man in America, whoſe good name has encountered ſuch violent oppoſition as that of Mr. Hamilton. If he is to anſwer every charge againſt him, that has been made on reſpectable authority, this piece does not complete the taſk. Mr. Findley, in his Hiſtory of the Weſtern Inſurrection, has urged many accuſations, as bad as that of jobbing in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates. The following are two inſtances. Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton has not attempted to deny any part of them.</p>
               <p>The commander of the army lodged for ſome time in the houſe of major Powers, about thirty miles from the town of Waſhington. This man had been active in promoting a ſettlement. <q>His ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices were acknowledged, while head-quarters
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:033485_0108_0FF71FF7AF626AB8"/>
were at his houſe, and he was paid a larger ſum than he demanded, for his trouble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences<note n="*" place="bottom">Findley, Chap. XVIII.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sometime after this payment, Mr. Hamilton ſent for major Powers to Waſhington. He then examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him concerning the conduct of Albert Gallatin, and of ſome other perſons with whom the major was not even acquainted. The anſwers were unſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and an officer was ordered to conduct him into another apartment, where he might, for an hour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh his memory. He was thruſt into a room, among a croud of priſoners, under the point of the bayonet. When called out again, he told Mr. Hamilton that he had nothing further to recollect. The ſecretary reproved him in ſevere terms for concealing truth. He was immediately committed a cloſe priſoner. The beſt bail was offered for his appearance and refuſed. The military conducted him to Pittſburg and kept him in cuſtody till the eighth day. Mr. Hamilton being then gone, "the judge" ſent for major Powers, and politely aſſured him that he had no charge whatever againſt him.</p>
               <p>Thus a meritorious citizen, whoſe ſervices had been gratefully rewarded, was, without warrant, accuſer, or even a pretence of guilt, impriſoned for eight days. The motive to this outrage was yet baſer than the act itſelf. Mr. Hamilton wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Powers to turn evidence againſt people of whom he knew no harm. The crime of Reynolds and Clingman was ſaid to be ſubornation of perjury. The proceedings of the ſecretary came very near it. He had, by the way, no legal authority to commit any body. He held no regular truſt of that nature. As for the judge, who endured ſuch tranſactions before his eyes, it may be hazardous to ſay much about him. The other of the two caſes is as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:033485_0109_0FF71FFCCA0552A8"/>John Hamilton was, at that time, high ſheriff of Waſhington county, and colonel of the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Creek regiment of militia. Mr. Findley enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merates his ſucceſsful exertions to prevent miſchief. This man, hearing that a charge had been lodged againſt him, went thirty miles to preſent himſelf to judge Peters. His honour had not time to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him. He was, however, arreſted, and ſent to the town of Waſhington. He applied again to the judge for examination; but in vain. He was ſent priſoner to Philadelphia, a winter journey of more than three hundred miles. He was paraded, along with others, through the ſtreets, with a badge in his hat, and caſt into the cells. After near TWO MONTHS AND AN HALF, he obtained an examination, and was admitted to bail. In the ſequel, not a ſuſpicious circumſtance could be found aginſt him<note n="*" place="bottom">Findley Chap. XVIII.</note>. The reaſon for this outrage is given by Mr. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. The ſecretary of the treaſury had reſolved on his deſtruction. For actions like theſe, James the ſecond was turned out of England, and George the third expelled from this continent.</p>
               <p>If Mr. Hamilton wanted to drive the weſtern people into the arms of Britain, and to excite a ſecond inſurrection, worſe than the firſt, this beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was judicious and conſiſtent. But while he has thus coolly trampled on law, juſtice, humanity, and every maxim of ſound policy, our ex-ſecreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould not refer to his uniform uprightneſs of character. In paſſing, we cannot withhold a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of admiration to the ſpirited and important part acted by the American bench. It is to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented that ſome patriotic citizens did not raiſe a ſubſcription for ſupporting an action of damages againſt judge Peters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="unknown:033485_0110_0FF71FFE57D45398"/>Thus the ſheriff of a county was illegally taken from the exerciſe of his office, an office as ſacred and important as that of judge Peters himſelf; and, at that time, of high conſequence to the peace of the country. Becauſe the judge had not leiſure to examine him, he was hauled to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and confined, for about ſeventy days, before he could obtain a hearing. Mr. Peters, when at Waſhington, had promiſed to examine him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half an hour. What a fine ſpecimen of juſtice was this to hold out before the people beyond the mountains! John Hamilton had to make a ſecond journey to this city, in June, 1795, to ſtand trial, ſo that, firſt, and laſt, he muſt have travelled fifteen hundred miles. Yet this was one of the very men who prevented David Bradford from ſeizing the arms and ammunition in the garriſon at Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral literati are conſtantly talking about the atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the weſtern riots, which they dignify or degrade with the name of rebellion.

                  <p>Remarks on the weſtern expedition.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <q>IT is a maxim deeply ingrafted in that dark ſyſtem, (the <hi>jacobin</hi>) that no character, however upright, is a match for conſtantly rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated attacks, however falſe.—Every calumny makes ſome proſelites, and even retains ſome; ſince juſtification ſeldom circulates as rapidly and as widely as ſlander.</q> OBSERVATIONS, p. 8.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hamilton himſelf is fond of attacking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal characters. A conſiderable portion of Mr. Findley's book conſiſts of details reſpecting the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnious accuſations which the ſecretary circulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while acting in his incomprehenſible capacity on the weſtern expedition. It is believed that not even a ſyllable of theſe charges has been contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, and far leſs refuted, either by himſelf, or by any body for him. It is impoſſible and uſeleſs to quote in this place a tenth part of theſe details. They were uſhered into the world under a name known and reſpected. They are as explicit as they imaginably could be; and as indefenſible as either truth or calumny, or hiſtory or fable, could make them. A ſample or two ſhall be ſelected from the maſs.</p>
               <p>Two judges of Weſtmoreland county waited on Mr. Hamilton and judge Peters, to enquire in what way they ought to proceed againſt offenders. Inſtead of a ſuitable anſwer, they were urged to accuſe Mr. Gallatin, as having <q>expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a treaſonable manner at the firſt Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

meeting. And when they denied having heard any ſuch expreſſions, the ſecretary aſſerted, that <hi>he had ſufficient proofs of them already.</hi> They however, perſiſted in aſſerting that he uſed no ſuch expreſſions<note n="*" place="bottom">Findley, Chap. XIX.</note>.</q> They further ſubjoined, that his efforts had tended more than perhaps thoſe of any other perſon, to the reſtoration of order. They were ſifted, alſo, regarding Mr. John Smilie, but to no effect. At this inquiſition, Mr. Hamilton ſaid, that he never would forgive Findley, who <q>had told or wrote lies about him<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>One John Baldwin was treated yet worſe. He refuſed to give evidence againſt ſheriff Hamilton. For this he was inſulted, told that he evaded ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth, and that he had forfeited the benefit of the amneſty by not giving the teſtimony demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Somebody Vaughan, a light horſeman from Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, aſſiſted the ſecretary at this ſcene.</p>
               <p>Such behaviour was only ſuitable to an Engliſh ſtar chamber, or a Scots court of juſticiary. If judge Peters had aſſumed the command of a wing of the army, or if general Morgan, or any other military officer, had placed himſelf on the bench with Mr. Peters, the groſſneſs of the fact would have been inſtantly diſcerned, and the continent have reſounded with outcries of indignation. But the ſecretary had no office, either civil or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary. He was, in every ſhape, and in every ſenſe of the word, an intruder and an uſurper, and he exerciſed his authority as might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the way in which he obtained it. Behold him aſcending the bench, aſſiſted by a diſtrict attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, an inſpector of exciſe, and a light-horſeman. This knot of ſelf-created magiſtrates attempt to dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the depoſition of a witneſs; and, as in the caſe of Baldwin, they threaten his life on the event of
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:033485_0113_0FF720074ABE7148"/>
his refuſal. Obſerve, alſo, the tremulous judge, ſhrinking into the back ground of the picture, while the laws and liberties of the people are troden under foot. Mr. Hamilton, <q>by his own authority, wrote a ſevere reprimand to the commander in chief of the right wing of the army, in conſequence of which, he was treated in a manner not becoming his rank<note n="*" place="bottom">Findley, Chap. XVIII.</note>.</q> This was deſtroying diſcipline, the back bone of an army. It was a ſelf-created power, by far more dangerous, than any contemplated by democratic ſocieties. The preſident ſuffered Mr. Hamilton to aſſume it, and forebore calling him to account for it.</p>
               <p>Here is another ſample of Mr. Hamilton's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. He expreſſed much ſurpriſe at the weſtern people for repoſing ſo much confidence in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners. He ſaid, that Gallatin and Findley <q>were both foreigners, and therefore <hi>not to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid, Chap. XIX.</note>.</q> Mr. Findley has been longer, by many years, in the country than our ſecretary himſelf, whoſe father was from Scotland, and his mother from Ireland. Their ſon was born at ſea, or in an iſland of the Weſt-Indies. He had no right to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn foreigners. This is the general cant of his party. Above all, they deteſt Iriſhmen, becauſe the latter, coming from a moſt oppreſſed country, have a natural bias to political inveſtigation. A great part of the people in the four weſtern counties are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of that iſland, ſo that this language held out an inſult upon the community at large. It was one of the many direct meaſures, employed by Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton, for the excitement of deep and durable miſchief. At the houſe of captain Dicky, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the <hi>thirteen letters,</hi> publiſhed ſometime before the inſurrection, by Mr. Findley. He ſwore
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:033485_0114_0FF7200A2293C2C8"/>
that they contained lies againſt him. His landlord replied, that he believed their contents to be true. Such a fooliſh demeanour, of which Mr. Hamilton afforded many examples, would have been ſcarcely pardonable in a boy.</p>
               <p>Another trait in the colonel's conduct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves attentive reflection. The money for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying the expence of this army, was ſupplied by him in direct oppoſition to the conſtitution. That inſtrument, article i. ſection ix. clauſe vi. ſays, that <q>no money ſhall be drawn from the treaſury, but in conſequence of appropriations <hi>made by law.</hi>
                  </q> There exiſted a ſtatute autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing the preſident to call out the militia, in caſe of an inſurrection; but by an overſight in fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law, he had no power to take money from the treaſury to ſupport them. <q>The monies drawn from the treaſury on that occaſion (the weſtern expedition,) were paid out of a fund appropriated for <hi>other and diſtinct purpoſes;</hi> they were not drawn, agreeable to the conſtitution, in conſequence of any appropriation made by law. It might be a defect in the law, authoriſing the expence, not to have provided the means; but that defect ſhould have been remedied by the only competent authority, by convening congreſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Gallatia, p. 82.</note>.</q> This omiſſion in the law ſhews the maſterly ſtile in which our ſtatutes are ſometimes compoſed.</p>
               <p>If the bombardment of a Britiſh fleet, or the diſembarkation of a French army had not left one moment to ſpare, engulphing neceſſity would juſtly have ſuperceded all forms, and vindicated the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular abſtraction of a million of dollars. Yet even in that caſe, the preſident, at the next meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:033485_0115_0FF7200BB532D1F8"/>
of congreſs, ought to have explained and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logized for the meaſure.</p>
               <p>But no ſuch imminent danger had a being. There was ample time to have aſſembled congreſs. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville the inſpector's houſe was burnt on the 17th of July, 1794. The firſt proclamation by the preſident was iſſued on the 7th of Auguſt, and the ſecond on the 25th of September following. It was not till after the latter date, that the militia were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to march. The ſeven weeks intervening between the two proclamations allowed full time for aſſembling the legiſlature. Of this Mr. Adams hath afforded an inſtance, in the firſt ſeſſion of the fifth congreſs. Inſtead of this legal and practicable meaſure, the preſident and Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton walked ſtraight through the conſtitution, through the privileges of the legiſlature, and the duties of their own reſpective offices.</p>
               <p>If congreſs had been previouſly called, the very report of their aſſembling would have ſtruck a mortal damp into this thoughtleſs rabble, who had neither plans, leaders, nor reſources. The ſolemnity of the ſtep was ſure of making a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable impreſſion. Time would have been gained, alſo, for more accurate information; and as the fifteen thouſand militia, who did march over the mountains, never ſaw an enemy, it is to be ſuppoſed that five thouſand could have done the buſineſs equally well.</p>
               <p>But Mr. Hamilton had many good reaſons for not wiſhing to call congreſs. The ſound policy of the exciſe law would have met with a ſevere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion. The expence and danger of a civil war muſt have rendered exciſe completely odious. Every lenient meaſure was ſure to have been tried before a ſingle regiment would be ordered to march, and the ſequel ſhews that they muſt have
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:033485_0116_0FF7200F4258C0F8"/>
been ſucceſsful. The ſober and ſubſtantial maſs of the weſtern citizens, though averſe to exciſe, were yet firm on the ſide of government. In the proſpect of an agreement, Hamilton ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the reprobation of his meaſures, and the fracture of his importance. The parties in congreſs are nicely poiſed; but every legiſlative aſſembly has a number of doubtful members, and the natural averſion to civil bloodſhed, held out an irreſiſtible cauſe, or a ſolid pretence, for univerſally deſerting the ſix per cent. ſtandard. In this caſe, the latter could not, probably, have muſtered one-third of the members, and mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities are always dangerous to a political par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The republicans abhor the ex-ſecretary with a cordiality of hatred equal to his own. They conſider him as a ſecond Pandora's box, from whoſe tranſcendant capacities for miſchief have exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively and collectively ſprung the whole political misfortunes of America. The utmoſt force of the party was certain, therefore, to have been levelled perſonally at him, and his vulnerable ſides offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an ample verge for the quivers of invective. Hence he ſhunned a previous meeting of congreſs, where it was more than an equal chance that he ſhould find not protection and triumph, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and defeat. This ſeems to be the only rational key to his conduct in hazarding a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil war, and a rape upon the treaſury, without conſulting the legiſlature.</p>
               <p>The inſignificance of their conduct when they did meet, ſhewed, that the victory of Mr. Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton was as complete in Philadelphia as at Pittſburg. On the 19th of November, 1794, the preſident ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the two houſes. He began, as uſual, with a reference to divine goodneſs, and to the riches, power, and happineſs, for which America ſeems
<pb facs="unknown:033485_0117_0FF72010CF49AE58"/>
deſtined. A pompous and exaggerated ſketch was then given of the inſurrection. Certain ſelf-created ſocieties were referred to, as having aſſumed the tone of condemnation towards the meaſures of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. But the preſident forgot to mention, and much leſs to apologize, for the ſelf-created power of taking a million of dollars from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic treaſury. When he related the outrages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon officers of government, he overlooked the provocations by which they had been excited, the numerous inſtances of miſmanagement on the part of the ſecretary of the treaſury, by which they had been foſtered, and the thouſand-fold enormities of the federal army, and of that ſecretary, under which they had been overwhelmed. There is a French fable, of a gardener and a hare, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times came through the hedge, and cropt his cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages. He repreſented the caſe to a gentleman, who, next day, with a pack of hounds, entered the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in chace of her. The dogs did more miſchief in five minutes, than the hare could have done in ſeven years, and after all, puſs got away.</p>
               <p>This is a conciſe and impartial picture of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral army, with one ſmall diſtinction, that the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener was a fool, and the ſecretary a knave. Never think that you underſtand the ſtory of this inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, till you read Findley and Brackenridge. Compare their copious and intereſting narratives with the collection of papers publiſhed by govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The temperate and manly ſtile of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hiſtorian is ſometimes clogged with a tireſome length of periods. His reference to dates is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally confuſed<note n="*" place="bottom">Almoſt every one of the ancient hiſtorians has been remarkably negligent on this point. Salluſt, Livy, and Tacitus, for example, are often inextricably imperfect. Try to follow Caeſar through his own account of his firſt campaign in Belgium, or in his two invaſions of Britain. A modern general gives you the date of every tranſaction. To forbear it, would be puſhing out the right eye of his narrative.</note>, and the remarks which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſes,

might improve by concentration. But theſe are trifling ſpecks, and only mentioned here to obviate the hoſtility of fiſcal criticiſm. Mr. Findley was a farmer, and a ſoldier in the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can army, for many years before he became a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed author; and the wonder ought to be that his faults are ſo few. His accuracy has been atteſted by the ſilence of the ſecretary, while the toothleſs ſcurrility of the treaſury newſpapers announces that he has drawn blood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brackenridge writes with more eaſe and vivacity than Mr. Findley. His perſpicuity, his ſimplicity, his pictureſque minuteneſs, conduct his reader into the ſcene of action. You ſee, hear, and feel, juſt as the author actually did; and this itſelf is a talent of high excellence. Amidſt much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, candour will forgive the ſerious or affected vanity that ſometimes peeps through the curtain of his mind. Theſe two writers have been neglected. An eſtimate of the ſales may induce a belief that they have never been peruſed by more than two or three thouſand American citizens, that is to ſay, by perhaps a two-hundredth part of the community at large. Without ſuch a peruſal, however, it is impoſſible to comprehend the nature and effects of the weſtern riots. The declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that fills the federal gazettes and pamphlets cannot afford a juſt or luminous conception of this all-important ſubject; which is, therefore, groſsly and almoſt univerſally miſunderſtood.

               <p>After thus explaining where a proper account of the inſurrection may be found, we go back to the preſident, his congreſs, and his ſpeech. <q>It has been a ſpectacle, ſays he, diſplaying to the
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:033485_0119_0FF720185C597240"/>
higheſt advantage, the value of republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to behold the moſt and the leaſt wealthy of our citizens ſtanding in the ranks as private ſoldiers, pre-eminently diſtinguiſhed by being the army of the conſtitution.</q> He ought to have ſaid, of <hi>monarchical</hi> government, for every part of the buſineſs bore the ſtamp of deſpotiſm. In the firſt place, the four counties were outlawed, on the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle notification of judge Wilſon. That <hi>any</hi> ſingle man ſhould have been entruſted with ſo vaſt a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary power was inconſiſtent with <hi>republican</hi> freedom.</p>
               <p>General Waſhington ſent commiſſioners to treat with the inſurgents, but if Hamilton had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, he would immediately have marched againſt them, and the four counties muſt have been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with blood and aſhes, by the official temerity of one man, and the ferocious impetuoſity of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is but a poor ſpecimen of republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and yet it might take place.</p>
               <p>Again, the army was raiſed on principles purely <hi>monarchical.</hi> The preſident acted ſolely on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a law inveſting him, during the receſs of congreſs, with unlimited power, a law that may one day overturn the conſtitution. Let us explain it by the following ſuppoſition. The preſent congreſs will ceaſe to exiſt, on the 3d of March, 1799. On the 4th, Mr. Adams may get a certificate from ſome confidential judge, that Virginia or Tenneſſee is in a ſtate of rebellion. Whether the ſtory be true or falſe, reſts entirely within his breaſt. He directly calls out the militia, and, as this inſurrection is ten times more dangerous than that of Braddock's field, he requires an hundred and fifty thouſand men. He ſets out at their head, parades four or eight hundred miles, renews the horrors of the weſtern expedition, and, till the firſt Monday of December thereafter, he
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:033485_0120_0FF67B8E82DC77B8"/>
and his militia are abſolute maſters of America. They proceed, at an expence of two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dollars per day, to be drawn from a treaſury which has not one ſpare ſhilling. No part of the conſtitution can, practically, ſtop Mr. Adams in his progreſs. The legiſlature does not aſſemble till the firſt Monday of December, unleſs the mere accident of a law, by their predeceſſors, may have ordained a more early date. Even this remedy could eaſily be prevented. On a preconcerted plan, the majority in the ſenate would be ſure to reject any bill for the more early meeting of congreſs. Thus nine months of a royal <hi>interregnum</hi> might readily put an end to the government. The precedent ſet by general Waſhington, for emptying the treaſury, would greatly facilitate ſuch a conſpiracy. The above explanation clearly proves, that, <hi>according to law,</hi> our lives and properties may ſoon be at the mercy of ſome chief magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>The federal army did not, then, diſplay the ſpectacle of a <hi>republic,</hi> but the embryo of royalty hatched in the dregs of legiſlative ignorance. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs gave the preſident authority as good as unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, for raiſing an army; but they forgot to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him in what way that army was to be paid. This was, as if a merchant ſhould ſend a ſhip to the Weſt-Indies, and forget to furniſh her with biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit or water. What imbecility, what unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the firſt principles of legiſlation, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded in this congreſſional performance! Its worſt parts might be amended by a clauſe like the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The preſident ſhall not be permitted to call out the militia, till he has held a council with the vice-preſident, the three ſecretaries, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney-general, and the governors of at leaſt four of the ſtates neareſt to the ſeat of the fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:033485_0121_0FF7201F4DBC72F0"/>
government. Of theſe nine, ſix with himſelf may form a quorum; and a majority of at leaſt five members, ſhall decide. Every opinion ſhall be given in writing, and each of the council ſhall be anſwerable and impeachable for his vote. The proclamation for the actual calling out of the militia ſhould be directed to contain a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons for the meeting of congreſs, it being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe high treaſon to obey the call. Leave ſhould alſo be granted to take the requiſite ſums from the treaſury; or if not there, a caſe very likely, the council might be authorized to open a loan.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Till ſome amendment of this kind ſhall be made, the liberty of the United States muſt be in ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hazard. General Waſhington went to the treaſury. Some future preſident may go to the bank. The one ſtep will not be a jot worſe than the other. The act, when amended, ſhould be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the conſtitution, leſt ſome future congreſs might dare to repeal it. The proſpect of miſchief is not diſtant. Its approach may ſoon be expected. Deriving, like Venus, his birth from the deep, the United States have already been harraſſed with their Machiavel. If Waſhington did not act that of Cromwell, it may be aſcribed to the ſoundneſs of his judgment, and the conſciouſneſs that a party who baſked under the ſplendour of his name, left him almoſt nothing to be deſired.</p>
               <p>We return to the preſident's ſpeech. He advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the citizens of the America to cheriſh their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, not merely for their own ſakes, but <q>for the ſake of thoſe, who, from every clime, are daily ſeeking a dwelling in our land.</q> This ſounds very well; and, if Mr. Jay's treaty had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained one line for the protection of emigrants from the Britiſh dominions to America, it might have
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:033485_0122_0FF72020E26607C0"/>
been believed that, in the above expreſſion, Mr. Waſhington was ſincere. The preſſing of men from Iriſh paſſenger ſhips, on the coaſt of America, is not only, in itſelf, an act of ſhocking cruelty, but an egregious inſult on this country. In Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1794, when this ſpeech was delivered, Mr. Waſhington had profeſſedly put himſelf at the head of that party who revile emigrants in the maſs, who want to exclude them from voting at elections, and who, in ſummer 1797, wanted to paſs a ſtamp duty of an hundred dollars, on their admiſſion as citizens.</p>
               <p>In a ſubſequent paragraph, the preſident ſpeaks of having extended his <hi>protection to the Creeks.</hi> This paſſage has already been criticiſed<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtory of the United States for 1796, Chap. VII.</note>; but I ſubjoin a circumſtance that has not yet reached the newſpapers. On the 8th of November, 1794, only eleven days before the delivery of this ſpeech, the ſecretary at war received a letter from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of Georgia. It incloſed a depoſition concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two murders by the Creeks. On the 30th of September, preceeding, they had, near fort Fidius, ſhot down and ſcalped Catharine Ceſſna, a young lady. Five of them had, alſo, ſhot and ſcalped a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro woman. Governor Matthews further mentions, ſome thefts of negroes and horſes, committed by Indians, in Liberty county; and that the Talliſee king, and Broken Arrow, were both for war. With this letter before him, the preſident came forward, and, without one word about avenging the blood of Catharine Ceſſna, and of a multitude of ſimilar victims, harangued on his ſucceſs in the protection of her aſſaſſins. This caſe is only a ſample of, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, a thouſand, equally horrid, and equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avenged. The honour of America, if one may ſpeak
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:033485_0123_0FF720227130F4E0"/>
of non-entities, hath been as baſely proſtrated by land as by ſea.</p>
               <p>How little reaſon thoſe ſavages had to complain, appears from the copy of a talk with them, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the governor of Georgia to the ſecretary of war, in a letter dated Auguſta, Auguſt 19th, 1794. The piece is too long to be inſerted here; but the following extracts are made from an atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manuſcript of it. After ſtating the treaty of New-York, he ſays, <q>ſome goods were promiſed to you, which you received, and you were to make a plain line between our people and yours. This you <hi>failed to do.</hi>
                  </q> He then relates, that when they and their families were in want of corn, the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſent them a gratuitous ſupply. He alſo opened a ſtore at St. Mary's to furniſh them with goods. They murdered the men who kept it, and carried off the goods. The murderers were not puniſhed, nor any ſatisfaction given. <q>You have killed many of our citizens, ſays the governor, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away a great number of our horſes, cattle, and negroes. All this your father, general Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, has <hi>borne with,</hi> from a wiſh to be the friend of your nation.—You aſk about forts.— They are on the north ſide of the river, and on the land that was given by your nation at the treaty at New-York, for which you have been paid; and I cannot ſee why you complain of it. By that treaty your nation is to receive twelve hundred dollars a year for the lands, which is ten times as much as all the game you can kill on <hi>it</hi> in one year is worth. I cannot ſee how your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can diſpute the river's being the line, as it was agreed on at <hi>three</hi> treaties in Georgia, and the <hi>one</hi> at New-York.</q> Such were the people to whom the preſident gave his protection. The
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:033485_0124_0FF72024F93AF0A0"/>
ſpeech has not even one hint about the defence of citizens on the Georgian frontier.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>From a deſire, alſo, ſays the preſident, to remove the diſcontents of the Six Nations, a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement meditated at Preſqu' Iſle, on lake Erie, has been ſuſpended; and an agent is now endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to rectify any <hi>miſconception,</hi> into which they may have fallen.</q> The matter was ſhortly this. No miſconception exiſted on the part of the Indians, excepting from Engliſh bribery. A letter from general Wilkins to Clement Biddle, quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter general of Pennſylvania, explains the ſtory. It is dated April 25th, 1794, and mentions, that Cornplanter and other Indians had been invited to an Engliſh council at Buffaloe creek. <q>On the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of that council, ſays the general, ſeems to hang war or peace between us and the Six Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>There have been a great deal of pains uſed lately by the Engliſh to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>our their minds, and they ſeem, in ſome meaſure, to have effected it.</hi>
                  </q> A let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from general Gibſon to governor Mifflin, dated Pittſburg, June 11th, 1794, incloſes a depoſition by David Ranſom, informing, that Cornplanter had been bought by the Britiſh, and that there had been a plot to cut off the ſettlers at Preſqu' Iſle. Captain Denny, in a letter to general Gibſon, dated 14th and 16th of June, 1794, confirms this intelligence. The correſpondence contains many other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, proving the hoſtile deſigns of the Britiſh. It was not, therefore, an Indian miſconception, but an Engliſh conſpiracy; and if the preſident did not chuſe to tell the ſtory candidly, he ſhould have been ſilent. Even without defending Genet, one cannot ſay that he came within an hundred degrees of the guilt of governor Simcoe. Genet wanted the United States to attack the enemies of France; but Simcoe wanted the Indians to attack the United States. We
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:033485_0125_0FF7202902646188"/>
had not done the ſmalleſt injury either to the Six Nations or to England. The perfidy of the latter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, therefore, admit of aggravation. The French had aſſiſted this country in obtaining her liberty, and now ſolicited her to aſſiſt in the ſecuring of theirs. It might be improper in America to grant the requeſt, but it was extremely natural in the French to make it.</p>
               <p>Paſſing over the reſt of this ſpeech, we come next to the anſwer of the ſenate. It ran as uſual, in a fulſome echo. As if this triſle had been worth notice, the preſident replied with much ſatisfaction on finding that his conduct was approved by <q>the enlightened repreſentatives of a free nation.</q> In the laſt ſentence, he alluded to <q>thoſe <hi>judicious</hi> and <hi>ſpirited</hi> exertions, which have brought VIC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORY to our weſtern army.</q> He was at the head of an army for ſeven years and an half. He was ſeveral times beaten. His fame, as a conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, reſts on the capture of nine hundred Heſſians<note n="*" place="bottom">What a figure would our American campaigns make beſide the hiſtory of the war of ſeven years! In two lines, Frederic relates that Winterfeldt overtook three thouſand Pandours, cut them to pieces, or drove them into a marſh. This is all we hear of the ſtory.</note>. Hence, general Waſhington may have miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the meaning of the word <hi>victory.</hi> But in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon language a battle muſt always go before a victory. Now, the weſtern army never ſaw a perſon in arms againſt them. They ſtabbed a man who was in liquor or mad. They ſhot a boy, who was ſick<note n="†" place="bottom">Findley Chap.

The troops did not ſo much as meet with any ſhare of that fugitive oppoſition, exerted by a gang of Engliſh ſmugglers on the coaſt of Suſſex.
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:033485_0126_0FF7202C3311E9E0"/>
From what hath ſince tranſpired, a ſingle Britiſh regiment of foot, another of horſe, and two field pieces would, at a twentieth part of the expence, have been altogether equal to the performances of our fifteen thouſand militia.</p>
               <p>The anſwer of congratulation from the ſenate paſt immediately. That from the repreſentatives coſt more time. They began to debate on Monday the 24th of November, 1794; and this firſt day was ſpent on a notable diſpute. One part of the propoſed addreſs had theſe words: <q>we cannot otherwiſe than warmly approve of <hi>a</hi> policy in our foreign affairs.</q> &amp;c. <hi>Your</hi> policy was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as better. After exactly twenty ſpecches upon it, the clauſe was wholely withdrawn, as the houſe could not agree, and were aſhamed to divide on the reſpective merits of the article and the pronoun. The preſident had caſt an oblique reflection on <hi>ſelf-crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d ſocieties</hi> as fomenting the inſurrection. It was propoſed that the anſwer ſhould echo this cenſure <hi>verbatim.</hi> The debate laſted till Thurſday afternoon; and the preciſe echo was rejected by forty-ſeven votes againſt forty-ſix. Next morning, ſome loquacious members wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to renew the conteſt. On this, Mr. M'Dowell ſaid, that <hi>twenty-five</hi> days of the ſeſſion were now elapſed, and he was as at a loſs to know <hi>what the houſe had been doing.</hi> The words <hi>combinations of men</hi> were put inſtead of <hi>ſelf-created ſocieties</hi> into the repercuſſion of cenſure. Thus the anſwer paſt.</p>
               <p>It is proper to take ſome notice of theſe traits, as a warning to future legiſlatures. After all this wrangling, the paper in queſtion proved but a poor production. If truth or reaſon, or the public ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, had been at all conſulted, the houſe would have begun by aſking the executive why he took from the treaſury eleven hundred thouſand dollars,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:033485_0127_0FF7202F639AF5B0"/>
without their leave, and in contempt of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution? Why he did not take meaſures, as he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well might have done, for checking this riot in the bud? Why he raiſed an army of ſuch enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous numbers, when a fifth part of them, at the utmoſt, could have done the buſineſs? Why he permitted Alexander Hamilton to engroſs ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant authority? Why the whole country was inſulted, the priſoners, and even witneſſes ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly treated? And why he was awed by ſuch diminutive enemies as the Taliſſee king, Broken Arrow, and the Cornplanter?</p>
               <p>It was not from want of good will, in forty-ſeven members, that theſe queſtions were avoided. But, ſuch was the popularity of the preſident, and the univerſal rage excited againſt the rioters, that the ſmalleſt reſiſtance to adulation of the executive, would have been held as bad as treaſon. In allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the aſſembling of the militia, the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, amidſt other encomiums, have the following words: <q>the ſpectacle, therefore, when viewed in its true light, may well be affirmed to diſplay, in equal luſtre, the virtues of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican character, and the value of republican government.</q> Such a racket has been made about the raiſing of this weſtern army, and the ſublime patriotiſm by which it was inſpired, that ſomething more ſhall be ſaid upon it.</p>
               <p>If the weſtern people had been able or willing to ſtand an attack, not one half of the militia were fit for fighting. The ranks were crouded by young men, altogether unacquainted with the uſe of arms<note n="*" place="bottom">A journeyman printer, from the office of the Philadelphia Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette, went out upon his firſt eſſay, as a private.

                  </note>. On the 9th of January, 1795, general
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:033485_0128_0FF72030F682D198"/>
Smith told the houſe of repreſentatives that <q>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the militia did not know how to ſet up a tent. The Virginian militia who went out, were neither trained nor diſciplined. As for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rylanders, when he drew part of them out, and ordered them to load, he found that fifty of them had put down the ball before the <hi>charge of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> Some of them did not even know how to lay a gun over their ſhoulders.</q> A merchant would not entruſt, as his book-keeper, a clerk, who put the wrong end of his pen into an ink-ſtandiſh; or who was ignorant of the difference between addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſubtraction. Yet ſuch a novice would be juſt as fit for the deſk, as theſe militia were for the camp. When you take up the ſubject in this point of view, when you reflect on the folly of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting troops like theſe into actual ſervice, your mind muſt feel a ſudden oppreſſion under the burſt of aſtoniſhment. There could be no uſe in ſending ſuch people to reduce an inſurrection. It was the moſt unmilitary management conceivable. If fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was wanted, theſe raw recruits were uſeleſs. If the country beyond the mountains was peceable, their multitude would only make them inſolent and miſchievous. A ſmall part of their own number of French or Britiſh veterans would have cruſhed them like an apple in the cyder preſs. In his hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the war of ſeven years, the king of Pruſſia gives a leſſon on this head. He ſays that when his armies had been ordered into winter quarters, the recruits for the next campaign were collected as early as poſſible, becauſe it required three or four months to teach them the exerciſe. Between the two proclamations of the preſident, the one for being in readineſs, and the ſecond for marching, only ſeven weeks intervened, and within that time not all the drill ſergeants of Potzdam could have
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:033485_0129_0FF7203293ACC9F8"/>
taught them the uſe of arms. But if Frederic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired three or four months to form a ſoldier, the beſt officer in the United States would need longer time. Whatever then congreſs, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, might think of ſuch a <hi>ſpectacle,</hi> no reader of ſober and impartial underſtanding will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that kind of generalſhip which aſſembled ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral thouſands of raw lads from the plough and the workſhop, and diſpatched them three hundred miles in queſt of an enemy.</p>
               <p>Put the caſe that out of theſe troops one third were real ſoldiers, who had ſeen ſervice, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired military feelings. The other ten thouſand who put in the ball before the charge, or who committed acts of equivalent ignorance, were a mere burden on the profeſſional men. The latter would have been more formidable without them. Theſe matters are ſo very clear that it is almoſt a ſhame to repeat them. Yet, if the government of a country chuſes to commit its character by ſuch proceedings, the public have a right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view them.</p>
               <p>We ſhall be ſafe in computing that the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeraries of the exciſe army, coſt ſix hundred thouſand dollars of extra and uſeleſs expence. Five thouſand good ſoldiers, if the camp contained as many, would have been quite equal to the buſineſs. Suppoſe that the remaining ten thouſand were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from their common employments for ninety working days. At the common and moderate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a dollar per day, the loſs of labour, by the enliſtment of theſe ten thouſand hands, comes to nine hundred thouſand dollars.

               <p>For the laſt three years, or thereabouts, two and an half per cent. per month has been a common rate of intereſt among many of our merchants. It has often been at five per cent. The above eſtimate of thirty per cent. a year falls by far ſhort of the loweſt of theſe two rates, as the monthly compound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is kept out of ſight. Here we ſee that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection was ſuppreſſed at an enormouſly greater expence than was neceſſary. A general alarm was raiſed in behalf of the conſtitution, an alarm very laudable, if it had been exactly founded on facts. This, along with the ultimate ſucceſs of the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the intereſted encomiums of Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton's regiment, have ſhed a luſtre over the whole tranſaction, that no part of it deſerves. Before the citizens of the United States ruſh upon the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſecond inſurrection, they will do well to be ſure of its exiſtence.</p>
               <p>A caſe has been imagined, in a former page, of a preſident, during the receſs of congreſs, haſting the country into a civil war. It is poſſible that his conduct might merit impeachment; and for this, or other offences, the conſtitution has reſerved a remedy. He is to be tried by the ſenate, and the chief juſtice ſhall preſide. He cannot be convicted unleſs by the concurrence of two-thirds of the members preſent. The latter clauſe is equitable; for candour will preſume that a preſident acts for the beſt; and it would be iniquitous to condemn him by the caſting vote of a ſenator, who, in the eye of law, and moſt likely of reaſon, is not a better
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:033485_0131_0FF72039D9C15E58"/>
man than himſelf. But a ſerious objection lies againſt the tribunal before which he is to be tried. One of the moſt likely caſes of an impeachment would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard foreign treaties, becauſe, in theſe there would be the greateſt riſk of corruption, and of conſequent treachery. Here the conſtitution leaves us, like a whale on the ſtrand, for the preſident cannot act without the advice and conſent of the ſenate<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Waſhington, at the nomination of John Jay, did, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, make a partial breach of this part of the conſtitution. See Hiſtory of the Untied States for 1796, Chap. V.</note>, and if he and two-thirds of them ſhould think fit to ſell America, ſhe has only to ſubmit to the purchaſer. Even in the event of domeſtic miſmanagement, as little can be hoped from the vigilance or virtue of the <hi>upper</hi> houſe. They have already broached a doctrine the wildeſt and moſt criminal, that has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably been ever heard of in a legiſlative aſſembly<note n="†" place="bottom">American Annual Regiſter, Chap. V.</note>; and general Maſon did only one-half of his duty to the country, when he forbore to publiſh that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulphing tenet. There is no aſſurance, nor, indeed, much probability, that any future ſenate will poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs more information, or integrity, or indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, than the members now in office. A preſident has always in his gift a variety of appointments, ſufficient to ſecure a majority of two-thirds. This tribunal, then, for the purpoſe of his impeachment, is entirely uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>The proſpect of juſtice would not be much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by a transference to the houſe of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives. Perhaps the ſafeſt and faireſt way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the chief magiſtrate might be to name de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates from each of the ſtates, in the numbers and proportions that ſhould be found adviſeable. Such perſons only ought to be eligible as have never held an office of profit under the general government,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:033485_0132_0FF7203B9A9EAAB0"/>
and who ſhall, by acceptance of this truſt, be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered incapable to exerciſe any ſuch office for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain term of years to come. Theſe remarks apply <hi>to no particular ſect of politicians.</hi> They point at an evident and immenſe gap in the conſtitution; for, under the preſent form, it is plain that the trial of a preſident could be nothing but a farce.</p>

               <p>WHOEVER is converſant in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the federal party, muſt have obſerved, that, amidſt mountains of declamation, they labour under a diſtreſſing famine even of alledged facts. The bribery of Randolph by Fauchet; the inſtitution of democratic ſocieties; their conſpiracy with Genet; the encouragement which they gave to the weſtern mob; and, finally, the grand rebellion itſelf, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe almoſt the only intelligible charges of all thoſe on which the ſix per cent. cymbals are eternally tinkling. As to Randolph, the party contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with railing.

their aid<note n="*" place="bottom">American Annual Regiſter, Chap. VII. &amp; VIII.</note>. In defence of democratic ſocieties, ſomething has been already advanced<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. Chap.

II.</note>. Nay, it is remarkable, and to candid minds it muſt be deciſive, that the favourite of all theſe ſocieties was then, and is now, Thomas Jefferſon, the very man who freed this country from Genet. It muſt, at the ſame time, be allowed, that, in many reſpects, Genet was hardly and uncandidly dealt with; but of him, his inſtructions, and his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, more will be ſaid hereafter.</p>
               <p>Seven letters, under the ſignature of Manlius, appeared, ſometime ago, in the Columbian Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. The firſt of them is dated the 3d, and the laſt, on the 17th of September, 1794. They conſiſt of furious invective againſt the republican party. In No. III. the writer complains, that <q>Mr. Dexter, noted for ſolidity of judgment, ſtrength and perſpicuity of reaſoning, elegance and accuracy of ſtile, in an anarchical gazette of Philadelphia, is made to talk <hi>like a ſchool boy.</hi>
                  </q> If Manlius want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mock Mr. Dexter, his attempt is ſucceſsful. If he wanted the public to believe his panegyric, he betrays his own want of judgment or veracity. No perſon has, for the laſt four years, ever ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably tired the patience of congreſs, as Mr. Dexter, if we except Robert Harper, and even the latter is greatly ſuperior to the former. He has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, information, and an eaſy delivery, if he could only know when to ſtop. In the ſeſſion of November, 1796, he made two very intereſting ſpeeches; the one for the widow of John de Neuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:033485_0134_0FF72041F7FAAC58"/>
and the other, for the inhabitants of Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah.</p>
               <p>Of democratic ſocieties, Manlius, No. I. ſpeaks thus. <q>They have oppoſed their <hi>veto</hi> to the doings of the preſident, to the laws of the union, and to the will of the whole people.</q> [<hi>Veto</hi> is a word borrowed from the tribunes of ancient Rome. By pronouncing it, they prevented the enacting of a law. The ſocieties never made even a motion in any legiſlature whatever, nor have they endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obſtruct the execution of any law. If they had done ſo, they would have been apprehended, and the diſpute would have been decided in a court of juſtice. They did nothing more than publiſh their opinions. They were warranted to do ſo, by the conſtitution, which declares, that <q>congreſs ſhall make no law abridging <hi>the freedom of ſpeech,</hi> or of <hi>the preſs</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Additional Articles, No. III.</note>.</q> If they went too far the attorney general could ſtop them.] "They have arraigned," ſays Manlius, <q>the conduct of the moſt wiſe and virtuous citizen now on earth; they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that this beloved firſt magiſtrate hath trampled on the conſtitution.</q> [There never was a chief magiſtrate in the world, who eſcaped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arraignment. We might as well attempt to keep mankind from coughing, or ſneezing, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that any government can give univerſal ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. The democratic ſocieties only did what occurs in every aſſembly of the human race. They cenſured their government, and ſo do the ſlaves of Dahomey and Morocco.] <q>They have excited oppoſition to the laws; and, an <hi>armed</hi> rebellion, probably, in conſequence of their falſe ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is actually raiſed in the very centre of the United States. MANY of our fellow citizens have
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:033485_0135_0FF7204485AD9918"/>
been <hi>murdered,</hi> and their dwellings burnt to the ground. They have endeavoured to involve the country in all the diſtreſſes of war; while they have oppoſed the adoption of every meaſure to prepare for this dreadful calamity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This extract preſents a fair ſample of the ſtile of Manlius. His letters have been reprinted in a pamphlet, and enjoy ſome ſort of reputation. The preceding paſſage is one of thoſe few, wherein we can diſrobe him of the miſt of declamation, and graſp him on the ground of facts. <q>Many of our fellow citizens have been murdered.</q> The papers publiſhed by government ſpeak of no ſuch mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. But previous to the burning of Neville's houſe, and in a ſeries of three years, about eight perſons had been maltreated. On the 6th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, 1791, Robert Johnſton, an exciſe officer, was tarred and feathered at Pigeon-creek, in Waſhington county, by a party in diſguiſe. Four other caſes of the ſame nature occurred ſoon after. One of the ſufferers was a lunatic, and another a private perſon, who had innocently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that, when people did not obey govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they could not look for its protection. It does not appear that any puniſhment was inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on theſe offenders, and hence the executive muſt have expected a continuation of outrages. An office of inſpection for Waſhington county was opened in Auguſt, 1792, at the houſe of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain William Faulkner. This man was ſoon after threatened with deſtruction, unleſs he turned away the inſpector. He did ſo and no perſonal violence was committed. Diſorderly meetings went on, and ſtill the executive forbore to cruſh them.</p>
               <p>In April, 1793, a party in diſguiſe, broke, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the night, into the houſe of an exciſe officer in Fayette county. He was from home, but they
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:033485_0136_0FF7204707E18848"/>
abuſed his family. Warrants for apprehending them were delivered to the ſheriff at Fayette. He did not, and probably durſt not, execute them. Still government perſiſted in its want of energy. If re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion had been the object of the cabinet of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, this was the very way to nurſe it. Such apparent lenity was the height of real barbarity. Every new act of blackguardiſm ſanctioned that which was to come next; and every day muſt have increaſed the diſreſpect for ſocial order. It was in a high degree culpable for government thus tamely to ſtand by, and permit the flames of bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and ſedition to extend unreſiſted from one year to another.</p>
               <p>On the 22d of November, 1793, a party again viſited the houſe of the collector of exciſe in Fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ette county, for whom they had ſearched in April. He gave up his books and commiſſion. Yet it is own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that about the end of 1793, the law appeared to be gaining ground. The ſmalleſt exertion of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power muſt have enſured its ultimate ſucceſs. Some of the principal recuſant diſtillers began to comply, and others diſcovered a diſpoſition to do ſo. One of the former had his barn burnt. The ſtill-houſe of a ſecond was deſtroyed; that of a third narrowly eſcaped the ſame fate; and his griſt and ſaw mills were damaged. The blame muſt fall entirely on the timidity or negligence of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. <q>The moſt <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>virtuous</hi> citizen now on earth,</q> can gain no more honour by this ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing inattention to his duty than he formerly did by ſhooting the French officer who advanced with a flag of truce<note n="*" place="bottom">See Smollet's Hiſtory of the War of 1756. The court of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles made all Europe ring with complaints on this ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</note>. On the 6th of June, 1794, an act of violence occurred in Waſhington county. The
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:033485_0137_0FF72048B6EC4D80"/>
office of exciſe was kept in the houſe of John Lynn, who was tarred, feathered, and tied to a tree. Some days after, part of his houſe was pulled down. From the firſt violence committed on Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Johnſton to the laſt date, two years and nine months had elapſed. During this long interval, the executive looked on, like the mariner, who ſees his veſſel ſpringing a leak, but who lets the hold be half filled with water before he tries to ſtop it. If a thouſand well affected militia had been quartered in the vicinage of the rioters who aſſaulted Mr. Johnſton, if they had been driven out of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or ſent to the workhouſe, we ſhould have heard nothing of a weſtern inſurrection; or of a waſte of public money, of property, and of time, to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of ſome millions of dollars. It is well known that a rabble, when unreſiſted, always proceed from bad to worſe, till the violence of the diſorder pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a remedy, which is often more dangerous than the diſeaſe. The ſmalleſt political foreſight might have diſcovered that, firſt or laſt, it would be needful to extend the arm of power, and that the ſooner this was done ſo much the better.</p>
               <p>This detail of circumſtances muſt, in every can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did mind, alleviate the blame of the weſtern riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Their ignorance was as much to be pitied, as their barbarity was to be deteſted. They were permitted to advance by gradual and even by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſteps to the brink of deſtruction. They were then pitched over the precipice, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence and ferocity of vengeance that ſink the judge to a level with the criminal. As for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, and his <hi>numerous murders,</hi> they are the offspring of his own calumnious fancy. The inſurgents do not ſeem ever to have ſhed ſo much as a ſingle drop of blood, excepting at Neville's
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:033485_0138_0FF7204E59E17148"/>
houſe, where three of the defenders were wounded. From the publications of the times, Manlius muſt have known that his aſſertion was an untruth. With his eyes open, he circulated this falſehood to promote incendiary and infamous purpoſes. Such is the patriot, who rails at democratic ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.</p>
               <p>Of this weſtern inſurrection it has become the mark of a party to ſpeak in ſtrong terms. On April 12th, 1796, judge Iredell, of the ſupreme court of the United States, referring chiefly to this rupture, delivered a charge to the grand jury of Pennſylvania. Some parts of it are open to objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Deſcribing the ſuperior excellence of the American conſtitution, he ſays, that, in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, <q>ſuſpicion has ſupplied the place of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.—The higheſt inſtances of public virtue have been doomed to the puniſhment of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt public offences. Happily for the United States, ſuch ſcenes have been known to them <hi>only by the hiſtory of other nations.</hi>
                  </q> This is wrong. In the caſes of Randolph, and of ſheriff Hamilton, the moſt direct evidence was ſet aſide by ſuſpicion. The numerous inſtances of oppreſſion committed in the weſt, under the eye, though not by the deſire of judge Peters, prove, that here, as in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, government may oppreſs with impunity. The judge then alludes to the ſuppreſſion of the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <q>a period which will form as bright a page, as any in the American annals.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This brightneſs muſt be produced by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of luſtre flowing from <q>the army of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</q> Carliſle is only an hundred and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles weſt from Philadelphia. When the troops arrived there, they quarrelled among themſelves. They were on the brink of mutual maſſacre. <q>The ſtreets and avenues of Carliſle were occupied by
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:033485_0139_0FF7204FE6FF6DD0"/>
the army, during the night; and an apprehenſion of the town being burnt excited a general pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic<note n="*" place="bottom">Findley, Chap. XII.</note>.</q> The rational part of the troops could not preſerve order; and, it was believed, that nothing but the arrival of the preſident prevented ſerious miſchief<note n="†" place="bottom">When the army came to Carliſle, the inhabitants ſhut up their ſtores. It was not until after a day or two, and ſome threats, that they could be induced to reſume trade. So ſays Clement Biddle.</note>. Meſſrs. Redick and Findley, deputies from the weſtern country, ran the riſk of being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinated. As for the inſurgents, it was common to ſwear, that <q>there was no need of judges or juries. Let them only ſee the men, and <hi>they would ſkewer them</hi>
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">Findley, Chap. XII.</note>.</q> Thoſe of the troops, who alledged that they were merely come in aid of the law, and that they ought not to uſurp its functions, were branded with the title of <hi>whiſky men;</hi> and, as ſuch, were the objects of menace and indignation. The preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent obliged thoſe who had killed the two perſons above mentioned<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. ſupra Chap. VI.</note>, to give ſecurity for ſtanding their trial. Some perſons, of no mean rank, were morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at this meaſure. Some fooliſh people having, at different times, mixed with the left wing of the army, general Morgan kept his men from killing them, by threatening that he would kill them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He took them out of the way, and diſmiſſed them privately. On the march, it was his rule to keep his troops on the parade, till he had called on the inhabitants reſiding near the encampment. He immediately paid them for what had been taken or deſtroyed<note n="‖" place="bottom">Findley, Chap. XII.</note>. Yet even this officer did ſometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get himſelf. He was guilty of the firſt breach of peace in the weſtern country. James M'Alliſter <q>had charged a quarter of a dollar for a quart of whiſkey to a ſoldier. The general knocked him
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:033485_0140_0FF720517A695E80"/>
down with the butt of his whip, and abuſed him conſiderabl<note n="*" place="bottom">Brackenridge, Vol. III. Chap. VII.</note>.</q> At fort Cumberland, general Smith of Baltimore, diſcharged about fifty diſorderly men in one day; he did his utmoſt, and with conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſucceſs, to enforce diſcipline. In the camp at Carnaghan's, in Weſtmoreland, the moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced officers were afraid, that the diſorders com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the army would ruin the country. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Irwin, at ſome riſk, ſeized two culprits. They were ſeverely puniſhed, and the example had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effect. But it was a ſervice of danger. While the ſentence was executed, fears were entertained, that the regiment to which the offenders belonged, might interpoſe to reſcue them; ſo that general Chambers, with his brigade, was placed in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inſtantly to charge, in caſe of mutiny.</p>
               <p>When judge Iredell, Manlius, and other friends of order, indulge themſelves in praiſes of the weſtern army; in declamations againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgents; and, in arraignments againſt the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic ſocieties, they will do wiſely to reflect on the particulars here ſtated. Such an army was, when taken collectively, as great an object of terror as the inſurrection itſelf. No democratic ſociety has done any act that approaches to the bacchanalian project of burning Carliſle. It is affirmed, that the ſocieties wanted to plunge America into a Britiſh war. This project did poſſibly float in the brains of a ſmall number of madmen. That it could be the deſire of any conſiderable part of the members is untrue. But even a Britiſh war was ſtill leſs dreadful than a civil one; and if it had not been for ſome officers of experience, and, above all, for the reſpect paid to the preſident, this ſanctified weſtern army would have produced a ſecond rebellion, before at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:033485_0141_0FF7205438386CF0"/>
to quell the firſt one. The ſober portion of the troops were on the point of being obliged to attack the rioters within their own ranks.</p>
               <p>How dreadful muſt have been the condition of the United States, if Carliſle had actually been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. It is weakneſs to ſhrink from the retroſpect of this woeful probability, or to hold up <q>the army of the conſtitution</q> as a pattern for future ages. From the hurry with which that corps was huddled together, nothing ſplendid could juſtly be expected. If Alexander Hamilton had adviſed the previous calling of congreſs, or if he had, in 1791, purſued proper meaſures to check the outſet of the riots, he would have rendered an eminent ſervice to the United States. Proceeding with judge Iredell, he tells the grand jury, that the inſurgents were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <q>by the baſeſt artifices, and the groſſeſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations of a few deſigning men; whoſe views, in all probability, were much deeper, and more malignant than they were <hi>avowed to be.</hi>
                  </q> The judge ought to have ſpecified who theſe <hi>few deſigning men</hi> are, otherwiſe he ſinks to the ſame rank with Manlius, Curtius, Camillus, aad the reſt of that tribe, who prattle about conſpiracies alike incomprehenſible to themſelves and every perſon elſe. If he refers to Findley, Smilie, Brackenridge, and Gallatin, Mr. Hamilton ſtrained every nerve, without finding a ſpark of evidence againſt them. The judge cannot ſurely want to trump up another edition of Fauchet's romance; and if that is not his object, he ſhould, in defence of his own reputation, declare what was his meaning.</p>
               <p>Again, we hear that the inſurrection was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in a manner <q>worthy of the government of a free people.</q> He ſhould have added, as in the inſtance of ſheriff Hamilton, of major Powers, of the deputies of ſubmiſſion menaced with murder,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:033485_0142_0FF72059DD32CEC8"/>
of the expected conflagration of Carliſle, or of the man knocked down for aſking the price of a quart of whiſkey. To this paper the grand jury replied, that the inſurrection <q>has, however, been attended with good conſequences.—It has offered another <hi>proof</hi> of the firmneſs, the wiſdom, and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of our much beloved preſident.—It has opened the eyes of a once deluded people.</q> This is the ſum total of advantages named by the jury. They have coſt a waſte of two or three millions of dollars; two or three millions of calumnies in the federal newſpapers; and vexation, oppreſſion, and ruin to a great number of people. Eyes have, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, been opened; but what have they ſeen? the horrors of military deſpotiſm, inflicted by a raw militia; the impoſſibility, in moſt caſes, of obtaining redreſs; the uſurpation of both civil and military powers, by a ſecretary of the treaſury, who had no title to interfere with either.

               <p>To this black narrative, let us ſee what can be compared on the ſide of democratic ſocieties.

in men who have already excited an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rebellion againſt the laws of their country; and ſpread havoc and deſolation over the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dwellings of our fellow citizens; who have already produced treaſon and <hi>murder.</hi>
                  </q> And again—"the treaſons and <hi>murders</hi> of Pittſburg." The only blood ſpilt was, as already ſaid, by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and as for havoc and deſolation, that committed by the inſurgents was but like a grain to the buſhel of the exciſe heroes. Manlius, in a long note, condeſcends upon particulars. In May, 1794, the people of Lexington in Kentucky burnt in effigy John Jay. And what then? before the burning they guillotined him. The <hi>defence</hi> of Mr. Adams was ſuſpended about his neck, and in his left hand he held <q>Swift's laſt ſpeech in congreſs on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Britiſh depredation.</q> This childiſh ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry formed a triumphant article in ſome Kentucky newſpaper. Manlius cites it at full length, and adds; <q>theſe are ſamples of the doings and the reſolutions of the anarchiſts. <hi>Theſe people are now in arms.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hiſtorical knowledge muſt be at a very low ebb in Boſton; otherwiſe no writer durſt have forged the notorious fiction juſt quoted. If, in 1794, the people of Kentucky had been in arms, they might have remained ſo. No federal army, or indeed any other, could have reached them. But, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is the firſt and laſt notice which we have received of a rebellion in that quarter The lie was good or bad enough to pleaſe the tradeſmen and farmers of Maſſachuſetts. In their irritation, Manlius reaps the harveſt of his labours. He prints a ſwarm of inflammatory fables, and proceeds to rail at inflammation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="unknown:033485_0146_0FF720645C36D6E0"/>It does not appear that any democratic ſociety had concern in burning of Jay's effigy. Manlius, as the ſecond, and only other <hi>fact,</hi> quotes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of a meeting held at Pittſburgh, on the 29th of April, 1794. They contain warm expreſſions, cenſure the appointment of Jay, the ſyſtem of ſtockholding, and declare that <q>we are almoſt ready to wiſh for a ſtate of revolution.</q> The parties aſſembled were of no conſequence, and Mr. Fenno, and Manlius himſelf, have employed num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs expreſſions quite as inflammatory againſt the republican party, as theſe are againſt the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans of Britain.</p>
               <p>On the 26th of November, 1794, Dr. Ames, in a ſpeech to the repreſentatives, attacked democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſocieties. He repeated the above circumſtances from Manlius. He added others. The ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at Charleſton, in South Carolina, had ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the jacobin club of Paris to adopt it. This was in October, 1793. The plan, it ſeems, had come to nothing. <q>The club of Pinckney diſtrict, in Carolina," ys Dr. Ames, "had voted in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of war, and againſt paying taxes.</q> He ſhould have recited a copy of the vote, but this, alſo, ended in ſmoke. <q>Are the reſolves of the clubs of this place and New-York forgotten?</q> ſubjoined he. <q>Could outrage and audacity be expected to venture further? One condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the exciſe as odious and tyrannical; the other, inforcing that ſentiment, publiſhed its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of Mr. Jay's miſſion of peace.</q> Some notice hath already been taken of this ſpeech<note n="*" place="bottom">American Annual Regiſter, Chap. VII.</note>. As to exciſe, a committee of the Britiſh houſe of commons, in one of their reports, declared it to be a ſyſtem <q>pernicious to the manners of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:033485_0147_0FF720664133F3F0"/>
                     <hi>repugnant to all good government;</hi> and which threatens the deſtruction of that very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, which <hi>it is its object to ſecure</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>a Short Hiſtory of Exciſe p.</hi> 27; a work wherein the reader will find many intereſting particulars, relative to this ſubject.</note>.</q> This is the ſtile of a Britiſh parliament; an authority quite in point.</p>
               <p>There was another fact omitted both by Dr. Ames and Manlius. The former and his friend, Dr. Smith, were burnt in effigy at Charleſton, (S. C.) for oppoſing Madiſon's reſolutions. Perhaps this, alſo, may be aſcribed to democratic ſocieties. But all theſe indecencies put together, do not balance even half a page of Findley or Brackenridge. It ſignifies nothing to burn one judge in effigy, compared with the dragging of another to the diſtance of three hundred and fifty miles from his diſtrict, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examination, confining him for ſeventy days in the cells of Philadelphia jail. But let us go back to the federal army. It would have been happy for the four weſtern counties, if the troops had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined themſelves to burning of an effigy. When they departed, a ſelect body remained behind. <q>They were noiſy in taverns, late in their patroles through the ſtreets (of Pittſburg). The cow of one man, that had but one, was ſtabbed; the horſe of another run through the body<note n="†" place="bottom">Brackenridge, Vol. III. Chap. VII.</note>.</q> Some officers quarrelled with a waggoner. <q>Two or three ſlices were taken from his ſcull, and a finger was cut off<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</q> An hundred and fifty dollars were paid as a compoſition to the ſufferer. M'Dermot, who gave the wounds, was at the head of a ſecond outrage. After forcing a man, whoſe wife was ſick, to give them entertainment, the company confined him to his chamber, made ſtrokes at him with their ſwords, threw his bedding on the floor, danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:033485_0148_0FF7206A06B36888"/>
upon it, broke his tables, chairs, and other fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture. The bill of damages was paid, with many imprecations<note n="*" place="bottom">Brackenridge, Vol. III. Chap. VII.</note>. Mr. Brackenridge relates other caſes of this ſort, and makes a general reference to many more. Theſe anecdotes ſhould be read and ſtudied by every man who values the lives and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of American citizens. Dr. Ames would not ſell one of his fingers for an hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dollars. Mr. Jay would rather be burnt in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figy, daily, for an hundred years together, than part with the leaſt ſlice of his ſcull. To celebrate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcrimination, the exploits of ſuch an army, is inſulting the truth of hiſtory. Deſperadoes, like M'Dermot, ought to have been turned out of this <hi>ſelect</hi> corps, with every mark of diſgrace. No ſuch ſtep has been heard of; and hence we may look for ſimilar treatment from the next <hi>conſtitutional</hi> army.</p>
               <p>Among the priſoners, Mr. Findley enumerates colonel Crawford and ſon, Mr. Sedgwick, a juſtice of the peace, Mr. Corbly, a baptiſt miniſter, and others. He never could learn that Mr. Sedgwick had done any thing to lay a foundation even for ſuſpicion. Theſe people aſſert, that they had not the opportunity of ſigning the terms of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, until the appointed day was paſt. After an impriſonment of <hi>ſeveral months,</hi> they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to bail. On their trial, no bill was found againſt any of them<note n="†" place="bottom">Findley, Chap. XVI.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the American Annual Regiſter, Chap. X. ſome obſervations are made on the correſpondent caſe of George Lucas, another pretended inſurgent, ſuch as Mr. Sedgwick and Co. Compare this with what follows. The preſident, in his ſpeech to congreſs, on the 19th of November, 1794, ſtrongly recommends
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:033485_0149_0FF7206B9A224EC0"/>
an indemnification to perſons in office, who had ſuffered in <hi>defence</hi> of government; ſuch as Neville, the inſpector, whoſe houſe was burnt. <q>The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, ſays he, and policy of indemnifying them, are ſtrong and obvious. It may alſo merit attention, whether policy will not enlarge this proviſion to the retribution of other citizens, who, though not under the ties of office, may have ſuffered damage by their generous exertions for upholding the conſtitution and the laws. The amount, even if all the injured were includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would not be great; and, on future emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, the government would be amply repaid by the influence of an example, that he who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs a loſs in its defence, ſhall find a recompence in its liberality.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This reads very well. Send your ſervant on a meſſage, and order him to mount an unruly horſe. He is, in ſpite of his efforts, thrown off and bruiſed. You cannot chuſe but to pay the ſurgeon's bill. Thus far we go with the preſident; for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a country proceeds on the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with that of a family, only that it covers a more extended ſcale. Put the caſe then, that your courier ſhall, with or without deſign, ride over a dozen paſſengers on the road. The ſurgeon brings in a ſecond account. This alſo will fall to be paid either by him or you. Equity requires that ultimate compenſation ſhould be made by the owner of this horſe, who put him into the way of doing the harm.</p>
               <p>It demands no depth to ſee the fairneſs of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and the propriety of its application to juſtice Sedgwick, to colonel Crawford, ſerjeant Lucas, and Mr. Corbly. In conſequence of the preſident's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, a bill paſt to indemnify thoſe who ſuffered loſſes in the ſervice of government by the inſurgents. The ſame bill ſhould have contained
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:033485_0150_0FF7206E5878ADD0"/>
a clauſe for indemnifying thoſe who had been groſsly abuſed by the weſtern army, or who had endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unjuſt impriſonment by the miſtake of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Humanity, juſtice, and ſound policy, pled as warmly in the latter inſtance as in the former. The caſe was even ſtronger than that of paſſengers rode down by a horſe. The federal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that inſtrument which executed ſuch a miſappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of puniſhment, was, in part, raiſed at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of its victims. It was only, by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, granted ſeven years before, that, as it regarded them, the preſident held his office; for if they had, in 1787, ſet up an independent government, it would have been difficult or impoſſible to hinder them; nor ſhould it be forgotten that the conſtitution was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to their choice by conſiderable manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſolicitation, and artifice. The officers of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, who loſt property, or were abuſed perſonally, had reaped perſonal emoluments from the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Lucas and Sedgwick had not. They drew only blanks in this lottery; while they were juſt as well entitled to protection, and retribution, as officers of exciſe, or any other claſs of citizens. Nay ſome of them, ſheriff Hamilton, and major Powers, for example, had been active inſtruments in ſuppreſſing the riots. Their claim to compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was of the moſt forcible nature. They got none.</p>
               <p>The policy of ſuch a meaſure is no leſs evident than its juſtice. By paying only the ſufferers on one ſide, congreſs were placing themſelves at the head of a party, and what is yet worſe, of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who were moſt in the wrong; for, after the explanation already made, candour will admit, that the outrages perpetrated by the whiſkymen, vaniſh in a compariſon with the barbarities and villainies committed by part of the army, and of its conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:033485_0151_0FF72072B7EAC220"/>
Now, the government of a party is, in itſelf, illegal, and but for the ſake of expediency, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no attachment. The people to the weſtward could not help ſeeing, and reprobating ſuch groſs partiality againſt their magiſtrates, and other fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens, and in favour of exciſe officers. Their reſentment may, at this time, be held of ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. But they are a growing ſociety. In the cenſus of 1791, the four counties were eſtimated to contain about ſeventy thouſand people. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they can hardly have fewer than an hundred thouſand, and, as the country is in a rapid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, twelve years more will double their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. In new ſettlements, the proportion of able bodied men to the general population is very great<note n="*" place="bottom">See Hiſtory of Vermont; a ſtate wherein more than a fifth part of the people are enrolled in the militia.</note>. The two hundred thouſand inhabitants of the year 1810, will probably be able to muſter forty thouſand armed citizens. The mountains that ſeperate their territory from the Atlantic coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are equivalent to a ſecond army. The maſters of Louiſiana and Canada will be ready to furniſh them with arms; an aſſiſtance equally to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from Spain, France, and England. In caſe of ſerious provocation, and actual inſurrection, the memory of ancient injuries will make the people deſperate. Sheriff Hamilton, will hardly give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up, a ſecond time to a tribunal, that he knows, by experience, to be prejudiced and deſpotic. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſtriving to cruſh miſchief, he may poſſibly, at the head of his Mingo creek regiment, ſeize a poſt on the Alleghany, and bid defiance to congreſs and exciſe. Major Powers will not likely become a ſecond time, an embaſſador of obedience, that he may be impriſoned, for eight days, at the point of the bayonet. A revolt like this, would far better
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:033485_0152_0FF720761B5200D8"/>
promote the views of Britiſh ambition than an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with the Miamis, or Simcoe's pitiful conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with the Six Nations. On this ſubject the remark of general Smith was very fair. <q>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ſay that they hope there will be no more inſurrections. I hope ſo too. But does that <hi>inſure the thing?</hi> I believe not ſir. Nothing was farther from the thoughts of the houſe, at laſt ſeſſion, than an inſurrection<note n="*" place="bottom">Debates of congreſs, January 9th, 1795.</note>.</q> This ſhort view explains the impolicy of railing at weſtern people in the maſs; a practice ſo carefully followed by the federal party. They ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reflect upon its injuſtice. <q>Though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages had been committed on exciſe officers, yet no ſheriff nor conſtable, had been oppoſed in arreſting the offenders. They had been brought in upon proceſs, and proſecuted at the court. There was no reaſon in the diſtinction; but <hi>it was made</hi>

I.</note>.</q> If the ſix per cent. orators, want a ſecond inſurrection, their conſtant yelping is the moſt certain way to raiſe it. The ſhorteſt method for making a raſcal of any man, is by aſſuring him that you know him to be one.</p>
               <p>The ſixth article of the amendments to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſays, that <q>no warrants ſhall iſſue, but upon probable cauſe, ſupported by oath or affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</q> In many of the caſes already quoted, the ſpirit of this amendment was plainly violated, and, in that of Powers, even the letter; for, after being kept ſo long a priſoner, the judge diſcharged him without even examination.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh amendment enjoins, that no perſon ſhall <q>be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without <hi>due proceſs of law.</hi>
                  </q> The ſtipulation is illuſive, by the generality of the ſtile; for, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:033485_0153_0FF72077AB0419A8"/>
ſhould either have defined what is meant by <hi>due proceſs,</hi> or it iſſues in mere words.</p>
               <p>The eighth amendment declares, that, <q>in all criminal proſecutions, the accuſed ſhall enjoy the right to a ſpeedy and public trial, by an impartial jury, of the ſtate and diſtrict wherein the crime ſhall have been committed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This amendment is, likewiſe, unſatisfactory; for a <hi>ſpeedy</hi> trial is an indefinite phraſe, that may be ſtretched to intolerable delay. Thus, in the caſes of the weſtern people, about ſix months, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, intervened between arreſtment and trial. This was any thing, ſurely, but ſpeed. The word <hi>diſtrict</hi> lies, alſo, open to objection. The ſtate of Pennſylvania is a diſtrict four hundred miles broad. A perſon dragged to that diſtance, a whiſkey rioter, for example, is completely ſeparated from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, and loſes every benefit of trial by jury from the vicinage. The very length of the journey is, in itſelf, a ſevere puniſhment to any man, who has buſineſs to mind. Suppoſe that he gets bail, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns home, comes back to Philadelphia, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, or, perhaps the grand jury throws out the bill, ſo that he does not even ſtand a trial. His three journies amount to twelve hundred miles, which, at twenty miles per day, employ ſixty days. His expences, in travelling, cannot be leſs than a dollar per day, and his loſs of time about as much more. Here is a fine of more than an hundred dollars, and, perhaps, he has not one dollar of his own. This calculation does not include his waſte of time in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending tho court, and three prefatory months in priſon, before he could find bail for his appearance, or, perhaps, before judge Peters found leiſure to examine him. To the pooreſt man brought from the weſtern country, the arreſtment muſt, in itſelf, have been equal to an exaction of three or four hundred
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:033485_0154_0FF7207B95488838"/>
dollars. The above three amendments to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution point out no explicit principle to protect him. As for compenſation, I ſuſpect that no writer on law, has ever ſo much as ſuggeſted a hint of it. The extreme iniquity of this omiſſion has already been explained<note n="*" place="bottom">American Annual Regiſter, Chap. X.</note>. Amidſt the numerous projects for political reformation, I have never met with an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual remedy propoſed for <hi>arbritrary impriſonment, before trial, on the part of government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have ſeen a few of the abuſes in this way, which occurred during the weſtern inſurrection. While they can be repeated with impunity, it is raſh to ſay much about the rights and liberties of an American citizen. While your government can apprehend you, make you walk four hundred miles on foot, and thereafter lie three months in jail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examination, it is childiſh, it is even imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, to raiſe a racket about the ſuperior public vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of American citizens, or the ſuperior purity of the federal conſtitution. If the former had ſhone with peculiar ſplendour, it is likely, that a certain judge would, long ſince, have been impeached, fined, and diſmiſſed. If the latter had been as excellent, as it is ſaid to be, it would have held out a warning ſufficient to deter him. As for the ſecretary of the treaſury, his non-impeachment by the houſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, was an eminent neglect of duty. It is true that two-fifths of them, or, perhaps, a majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, would have oppoſed any motion of that ſort. The ſenate, alſo, were ſure to have acquitted the criminal. Yet difficulties, like theſe, ought not to hinder an honeſt member of congreſs from obeying the dictates of his conſcience. Some elder repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives affect to ſmile at the blunt but reſpectable ſincerity of colonel Lyon, of Vermont. It would

be well for the country if every member durſt ſpeak his ſentiments with as much honeſty.</p>
               <p>To the amendments above cited, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing addition might be an improvement. <q>Every man, apprehended for any crime, ſhall be entitled to an examination as early as poſſible; to bail, if the offence be bailable, and to a ſpeedy trial. But as it is impoſſible, in ſuch matters, to ſix a preciſe rule, the following proviſions will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the circumſpection of government in iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warrants to apprehend the accuſed, and its diſpatch in deciding their fate. From the day of his arreſt, till that of trial, he ſhall receive wholeſome and plentiful diet, and be lodged in an apartment dry, and as well aired as may be<note n="*" place="bottom">In the criminal apartment of the jail of Philadelphia, a priſoner is reſtricted to the diet of the houſe, that is, to ſemi-ſtarvation. He is not even allowed to buy food for himſelf, out of his own pocket. Thus, even <hi>before trial,</hi> he is ſeverely puniſhed by famine. Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans ought not to ſpeak of Algerine ſavageneſs, while ſuch enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities exiſt at home. After trial, there may be good cauſes for ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting diet.</note>. In the event of an acquittal he ſhall be entitled to treble the ordinary wages of a labourer, in that part of the country where he reſides; or, if he is a tradeſman, to treble the wages that a journeyman of his profeſſion can, upon a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, earn. The quantum is to be determined by a jury of his own vicinage, as early as poſſible, after his diſcharge. Over and above this ſum, it ſhall bear a weekly compound intereſt of one per cent. from the day of the priſoner being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, until the day that he ſhall be ultimately paid the balance found due to him by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of the jury. In caſe of his death before trial, one half of the ſums ſo due, on his being acquitted, ſhall be awarded to his neareſt heir
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:033485_0156_0FF72081A38D5568"/>
at law; the amount being fixed as aforeſaid, and the proportional compound intereſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing to accumulate till the day of payment. If ſtrong ſuſpicions remain of the priſoner's guilt, or, if the accidental death or abſence of a witneſs hath mutilated the evidence of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic proſecutor, the jury of the vicinage are to have a diſcretionary power of reducing the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſum to one half, and the compound intereſt to one per cent. per week of the remaining moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tey. If the priſoner ſhall be compelled to travel on foot for more than fifty miles to the place of confinement, or of trial, he ſhall receive at the rate of one day's wages for every thirty miles ſuch of diſtance. In court, he is to be allowed able counſel, and any reaſonable number of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, whom he may wiſh for, ſhall be paid at public expence. His damages, on acquittal, are to be defrayed by the county, diſtrict, or government, at whoſe inſtance he has been tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If his health ſuffers materially from bad diet, or an unwholeſome apartment, addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional damages may be aſſigned at the diſcretion of the jury. For the time of <hi>his enlargement upon bail,</hi> the priſoner, if finally acquitted, ſhall only be entitled to the expence of travelling to and from the place where he reſides.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The reader may ſmile at this effuſion of fancy, but until a ſimilar regulation ſhall be adopted, the conſtitution muſt labour under an important defect. The point of juſtice is not worth an argument, ſince every candid heart muſt echo approbation. This practice of arbitrary impriſonment, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after trial, has, in the old countries, been an inſtrument of general and enormous tyranny. In Scotland, when a culprit had been condemned to tranſportation for a number of years, it was, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:033485_0157_0FF7208331AD6458"/>
two or three years before government ſent him off. In equity, this interval ſhould have been deducted from the ſpace of baniſhment; but that was not the practice. The following anecdote refers to this cuſtom. It is publiſhed here by way of conſolation, as ſhewing that public juſtice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more ſtupid or brutal in America, than ſhe often is in Europe. Not many years ago, two brothers were capitally convicted at Edinburgh for houſe breaking. One of them was to be reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but, by a blunder in drawing out the paper, the wrong chriſtian name crept in, and on this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take he was hung. The ſurvivor, whom it had ſaved, underwent a long and painful impriſonment, till, ſeeing no termination of miſery, he attempted an eſcape. He was detected, and the blood-thirſty bench inſtantly obtained from the king an order for his execution. One of their lordſhips, leſs bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous than the reſt, obſerved that the impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which this man had endured was too dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for human patience, and hinted that he was a much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ter object of pity than of a halter. The remark was in vain, for pity very ſeldom touches the breaſt of a judge, or at leaſt of a Scots one.</p>
               <p>From this excurſion, we go back to the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amendment. As government is erected for an univerſal diſpenſation of juſtice, it is completely monſtrous that government itſelf ſhould be placed beyond the reach of juſtice. With regard to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted priſoners, nobody can deny the fact. When a man is apprehended either here, or in Europe, for a capital offence, he is often half ſtarved to death, of cold and hunger, before his trial comes on. If, in the ſequel, he muſt die, that alone is enough; and if he is diſcharged, the court can make no atonement equal to his previous ſufferings. Thus is Juriſprudence transformed into a proſtitute,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:033485_0158_0FF72087BA7170E8"/>
a daemon, ſuch as ſhe diſplayed herſelf on the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern expedition.</p>
               <p>To an acquitted priſoner the retribution propoſed cannot be thought extravagant. Even with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious aſſurance of ſafety, if that were poſſible, a labourer, or a journeyman mechanic, would much rather continue at the axe or the anvil, than undergo a ſcene that, like a ſnail on the wall, is ſure of leaving ſlime behind it. The treble wages offer no temptation. To a perſon in extenſive buſineſs, they offer much worſe than none. They hold out the proſpect of certain loſs, which, however, he is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to ſupport than a poorer man. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound intereſt would enſure expedition, as thoſe in hazard of paying it, would effectually ſpur the judge to an early diſcharge of his duty. The tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling expences might tend to moderate the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient diſtance to which a perſon accuſed may ſometimes be dragged. The probability of retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution could hold out no encouragement to real guilt; beſides, that the jury of the vicinage could cut compenſation through the middle. The chance of paying ſmartly for miſtakes would render a court cautious in granting warrants. The ſame proſpect would retard the acquittal of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, when he is known to be guilty. On the 3d of March, 1795, the day on which the third congreſs diſſolved, Mr. Dexter laid before the houſe of repreſentatives a reſolution for mitigating, in ſome inſtances, the ſeverity of penal laws. He ſaid, that he had known a priſoner come to the bar laughing, becauſe, though guilty, he knew before hand that the jury would acquit him. Condemning the ſeverity of the law, they refuſed to condemn the priſoner. Juſtice, or cruelty overſhot its mark; and he was diſcharged in contempt of evidence. But if the jury knew that ſuch an act of perjury,
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:033485_0159_0FF7208ACE5C9ED8"/>
on their part, was to produce a heavy fine on the county or diſtrict, we ſhould hear no more of this corrupted mercy. It would reflect ſingular dignity on the juriſprudence of America, to ſet the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to the world of ſuch a magnanimous regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It might blunt the deriſion that poſterity muſt feel, at thoſe torrents of ſelf-applauſe which the preſent age hath ſo bountifully poured upon itſelf. Such an article in the conſtitution would augment the ſafety, and promote the indemnification of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, while, at the ſame time, it multiplied the dangers of guilt. Of ſuch an article every party may, in turn, feel the benefit, or ſuffer by the want. The unavenged exceſſes of the fall of 1794, prove, that, till ſomething of this nature ſhall be adopted, the vaunted liberties of America are but the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a ſyſtem. If the ſixth year of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath reached ſuch Mamaluke maturity of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, what prodigies may be expected in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation of a century!</p>
               <p>Here it may be uſeful to notice another defect in the federal conſtitution. The king of England can, at pleaſure, diſſolve his parliament. Whenever they become unmanageable, he has a right of directing them to diſperſe. If they neglect his orders, there is nothing to hinder his guards from ſhooting them, under the riot act. This royal privilege has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and dreadful conſequences to the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of parliament. A member in oppoſition, has, perhaps, expended one-half of his eſtate in canvaſſing for his borough. By a ſingle meſſage from the crown, the labour of years, and the waſte of ten thouſand guineas are rendered abortive; and he muſt, a ſecond time, contend with the profuſion of miniſterial bribery. Charles the firſt conſented to ſuſpend this prerogative; and that overſight paved the way to the foundation of the commonwealth
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:033485_0160_0FF7208D598FD6A8"/>
of England. It was by a bold exertion of the right of diſſolution, that William Pitt, in 1784, broke up the coalition parliament. The expedient has been often adopted. It is a ſure card in the hand of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive miniſter, and one of the ſtrongeſt links in the chain of corrupted influence.</p>
               <p>With ſuch an example before them, the framers of the conſtitution of 1787, have granted, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the very ſame prerogative to the preſident. They could not have betrayed a ſtronger mark of incapacity. In article ii. ſection iii. are theſe words: <q>He may, on extraordinary occaſions, convene both houſes, or either of them; and, in caſe of diſagreement between them, with reſpect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to ſuch time as HE <hi>ſhall think proper.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In article i. ſection ii. it is provided, that <q>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſhall aſſemble at leaſt once in every year.</q> The preſidential privilege reduces this rule to a nullity. Before they have been a week in ſeſſion, <hi>his</hi> ſenate may propoſe an adjournment. The two houſes diſagree, and the preſident determines that they ſhall riſe. With a view to this emergency, the appropriation bill may be poſted through both houſes within a few days after they ſit down. If the repreſentatives become reſtive, he can diſmiſs them, without an appropriation act. He has only to quote the precedent of Mr. Waſhington, and march to the bank or the treaſury.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ON April 28th, 1796, Dr. Ames deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, in congreſs, a ſpeech in defence of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh treaty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <q>If a treaty, ſays he, left king George his iſland, it would not anſwer; not if he ſtipulated to pay rent for it. [This is wild exaggeration.] It has been ſaid, [And pray, by whom has it been ſaid? for no ſuch language ever addreſſed the ears of congreſs.] the world ought to rejoice if Britain was ſunk in the ſea; if, where there are now men, and wealth, and laws, and liberty, there was no more than a ſand-bank for the ſea monſters to fatten on; a ſpace for the ſtorms of the ocean to mingle in conflict <note n="*" place="bottom">Bache's Debates, Vol. II. p. 319.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="unknown:033485_0162_0FF720932AC1FBE0"/>Dr. Ames has not ſpecified where, or by whom this object of rejoicing was propoſed. If any demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical member of congreſs had uttered that wiſh, Mr. Fenno would have refreſhed the public with an hundred editions of it. To aſcribe to a party opinions which they do not hold is uncandid, and ſerves only to embitter political animoſity. This citation helps to aſcertain the credit due to ſome other aſſertions in that ſpeech <note n="*" place="bottom">Something like this hath been quoted, by an eminent federal writer, as from <hi>The Political Progreſs of Britain,</hi> where no ſuch ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be found,</note>.</p>
               <p>In a note ſubjoined to this ſpeech, Dr. Ames adds, that the preſent war <q>has done more injury to the <hi>morals</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> of nations than all the wars of the laſt century.</q> As to the quantity of blood ſhed in the revolution, the party have already been told, and they dare not deny the fact, that, in Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal only, the Engliſh have deſtroyed about as many people as the late kingdom of France contained. Stale objections deſerve ſtale anſwers. The guillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine is tender mercy compared with the rack and the wheel, both of which have been aboliſhed by the revolution. It has likewiſe put an end to the French ſlave trade, which England continues to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate. Robeſpierre, and his chief accomplices, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated their crimes on the ſcaffold; and even they were not worſe than Turrene, ravaging the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate, than Cromwell, extirpating the Iriſh nation, than the New-England ſaints, of the laſt century, burning witches, or, than the Connecticut tories, with Brandt and Butler at their head, breaking up the ſettlement of Wioming. Smith's Wealth of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Arthur Young's Travels through France, will inform Dr. Ames, that, as to <hi>morals</hi> and <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> a very large majority of the French nation could fear no change for the worſe. They have freed
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:033485_0163_0FF72095B17B9E28"/>
themſelves from an oppreſſive monarchy and nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and from a clergy of enormous expence. The government, as in the United States, is repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and religion left at liberty. The French were juſt as well entitled to freedom as the Americans. Their revolution has been attended with much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and iniquity; but ſo was ours. In the affair of September, 1797, the ſimple exile of the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leaders, diſplays unexampled lenity. The French have not merely freed themſelves. They have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe delivered other nations from ſlavery. The perfidious ſtadtholder is expelled from his office. The biſhop of Liege no longer uplifts a revenue from the gaming tables of Aix-la-Chapelle. Flanders, Nice, and Savoy, are admitted to ſhare in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the republic. The Auſtrian uſurpers are driven from Italy; and, in a few years, the whole peninſula will enjoy a repreſentative govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The corporation of German tyrants hath been ſhaken to the root, and lopped of numerous branches. Every campaign has been pregnant with horrors, but not more ſo than thoſe of former wars. The progreſs of republican principles hath been gradual, but irreſiſtible. Mankind begin to ſee that they are capable of legiſlating for themſelves, and to laugh at their previous veneration for emperors and kings.</p>
               <p>This proſpect ought to gladden the heart of a true republican; but the American revolution ſeems to have gone too far for the feelings of many people in this country. No ſooner had the New-Englanders got rid of their Britiſh monarch, than a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of them began to look out for ſomething very like another. It was chiefly through them that the new conſtitution conferred ſuch immenſe power and influence on the office of preſident. And, ever ſince, moſt of the New-England members of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:033485_0164_0FF7209758138F18"/>
have been diſpoſed to ſtrain his prerogatives. Obſerve what follows.</p>
               <p>The conſtitution, article i. ſection ix. clauſe vii. ſays that <q>no title of <hi>nobility</hi> ſhall be granted by the United States.</q> On April 24th, 1789, the repreſentatives received a meſſage from the ſenate. It ſtated, that they had appointed a committee to conſider <q>what <hi>ſtile</hi> or <hi>titles</hi> it will be proper to annex to the office of preſident and vice-preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if any other than thoſe given in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</q> The repreſentatives refuſed their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, and the affair was dropt. Nothing could in itſelf, be more deſpicable, nothing could be more oppoſite even to the letter of the conſtitution, or betray a ſtronger taſte for monarchy than this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. The conſtitution prohibits titles of nobility. The ſenate recommend <hi>titles,</hi> and certainly not of degradation. Of courſe they muſt have been adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, like the ſimilies of Mr. Bayes, to elevate and ſurpriſe. Moſt ſerene, moſt potent, moſt illuſtrious, or any luggage of that kind, would have excited ridicule inſtead of reſpect. But in ſmiling at the childiſhneſs of the ſcheme, we ſhould not overlook its ultimate tendency. The next propoſal was, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, to have been by what title ſhall members addreſs each other; and the continent might ſoon have reſounded with babbling appellations.—<q>This day his grace the moſt ſerene John Adams, vice-preſident, &amp;c. ſet out for his ſeat at Braintree.— Laſt night arrived, in this city from Mount Vernon, his high mightineſs, the moſt potent and illuſtrious George Waſhington, &amp;c.—To-morrow his excellency, the right honourable Alexander Hamilton, with his lady, and their ſuite proceed to New-York, on a viſit to his excellency the moſt illuſtrious colonel Duer.—Their ſerene highneſſes, the moſt puiſſant the ſenate of the

United States, have reſolved that in future it ſhall not be lawful for any ſenator to pick his teeth, to yawn, or emit the like ſymptoms of intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual vacancy, till half an hour after prayers have been finiſhed.</q> It was from the ſame ſpirit, that Meſſrs. Dexter and Sedgwick wanted, on the 1ſt of January, 1795, to engraft, on our government, a foreign nobility<note n="*" place="bottom">See American Annual Regiſter, Chap. V.</note>. In both inſtances, the innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have raiſed infinite diſcontent, and it was to produce no good effect of any kind. It breathed the pure ſpirit of <hi>diſorganization;</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite term of reproach with the federal party.</p>
               <p>On titles, Thomas Paine has written with great ſucceſs; and this is one reaſon why the friends of order hate him. Abuſe of this author is now as naturally expected in a federal newſpaper as tea and chocolate in a grocer's ſtore. To ſuch things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare two reſolutions of congreſs of the 26th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, and 3d of October 1785. In conſequence of his <q>early, unſolicited, and continued labours in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining and enforcing the principles of the late revolution, by ingenious and timely publications, upon the nature of liberty, and civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</q> they direct the board of treaſury to pay him three thouſand dollars. This atteſtation out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighs the clamour of the ſix per cent. orators. They dread, they revile, and if able, they would perſecute Thomas Paine, becauſe he poſſeſſes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents and courage ſufficient to rend aſunder the mantle of ſpeculation, and to delineate the ricketty growth of our public debt.</p>
               <p>In his ſpeech to congreſs, on May 16th, 1797, Mr. Adams complains heavily of France, as wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to promote civil diſcord in America. The paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that has almoſt produced a French war, claims
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:033485_0166_0FF7209FB11932D8"/>
particular notice, and is in theſe words. France <q>will not abaſe herſelf by calculating the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the condeſcenſion of the American government in liſtening to the ſuggeſtions of her former tyrants. Moreover, the French repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic hopes that the ſucceſſors of Columbus, Raleigh, and Penn, always proud of their liberty, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forget that <hi>they owe it to France.</hi> They will weigh in their wiſdom the magnanimous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of the French people with the crafty careſſes of certain perſons who meditate bringing them back to their former ſlavery.</q> Theſe were the words of Barras, preſident of the directory, on the 30th December, 1796, in his farewell reply to Mr. Monroe. The ſtile betrays oſtentation that might have been ſpared; and contempt which has been deſerved; but not a ſpirit of animoſity. It is certain that, humanly ſpeaking, America could not have compelled Cornwallis to ſurrender, but for the interference of France; and even the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a ſelfiſh benefactor ſhould be endured with reſpect. It would have been wiſe in the preſident to take no notice whatever of this ſatiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal flight. He opened the door to ſuch harangues as had not before been heard in congreſs. Among other polite repartees, Mr. Thatcher obſerved that Barras muſt have been either <hi>mad</hi> or <hi>drunk.</hi> Thus, in half a minute, we turned the balance of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility to the ſide of France.</p>
               <p>But there is the beſt reaſon for affirming that the indignation of Mr. Adams was affected; that he wanted to find a pretence for quarrelling with the republic; and that, if expreſſions far ſtronger than thoſe of Barras had been employed by lord Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, not a murmur would have been heard about them. We ſhall examine each of theſe two points.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the preſident deſired, and ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:033485_0167_0FF720A1625FF128"/>
a French rupture, is evident from his patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Gazette of the United States. Its edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Mr. Fenno, is printer to the ſenate, and as much at the nod of Mr. Adams, and of them, as their clerk or door keeper. He vindicates all the meaſures of the federal party; and, ſince the beginning of the French revolution, he has railed at that people in the moſt violent tone. The following paragraphs are copied from his newſpaper, ſo late as the 20th of September, 1797. Read them; and then aſk yourſelf whether Mr. Adams and his ſenate can be ſincere in wiſhing for a reconcilement with France? While they countenance the publiſher of ſuch invectives, they cannot be ſuppoſed either to expect or deſire French amity. It is of the utmoſt importance to aſcertain whether our executive is ſerious in its efforts for pacification. Judge if the following language is of that ſort.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>By the advices this day publiſhed, it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered probable that the conſtitution-makers of ſans-cullotte land, that great nurſery of pirates, aſſaſſins, and robbers, are, ere this, once more <hi>blown up.</hi>
                  </q> [This is abundantly brutal, but the writer goes from bad to worſe.]</p>
               <p>
                  <q>A new, long, and violent conteſt will ſucceed; but the iſſue will be favourable to France, and mankind.</q> THE KING <hi>ſhall have</hi> HIS OWN <hi>again;</hi> [This is charming doctrine for a republic.

               <p>But while the preſidential gazette ejects ſuch filth, we cannot, in reaſon, hope for a favourable concluſion from the triumvirate embaſſy. Indeed, if our envoys poſſeſs common ſenſibility, they muſt look ſomewhat fooliſh, if they are admitted into the preſence of Barras. Put the caſe that he has on the table before him a volume of Mr. Fenno's newſpaper, and that he ſhall aſk them who are the patrons and prompters of that editor? Their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, if they ſpeak truth, muſt be, that it is the funnel of government.

               <p>The reſtive and ſullen demeanour of Charles Coteſworth Pinckney, at Paris, was both uſeleſs and
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:033485_0169_0FF720A851752D60"/>
impertinent. It deſerved no part of that praiſe conferred on it by Mr. Giles, and other members, in the late ſeſſion of congreſs. France, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her repreſentative, had endured a thouſand affronts from the preſſes of Philadelphia. She had finally, and with intimation of her diſguſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called citizen Adct. She did not, however, enjoin Mr. Monroe to quit Paris, but a ſucceſſor having been appointed in his room, this removal preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a decent opportunity for getting entirely quit of American ambaſſadors. If Monroe had not been recalled, it is likely that he might ſtill have been permitted to remain at Paris. America would then have eſcaped from eighty thouſand dollars of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, on account of the late extra ſeſſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, beſides about thirty or forty thouſand, as the extra charges of the preſent triple deputation<note n="*" place="bottom">The exact amount of this expence cannot yet be ſtated. Mr. Wolcott, in his report and eſtimates for 1797, p. 16. reckons nine thouſand dollars, as the outfit of an ambaſſador to France. We have at preſent two ſuch outfits, beſides that of Pinckney. This comes in all to twenty-ſeven thouſand dollars, that might have been ſaved by letting Monroe keep his place. As for ſalary, Mr. Wolcott ſtates four foreign miniſters, at nine thouſand dollars each, and one at four thouſand five hundred. At the loweſt rate, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of three miniſters to France will come to thirteen thouſand five hundred dollars, per annum, inſtead of paying only one ſalary.</note>. What was yet more important, ſhe would have eſcaped from the ſpeech of the 16th of May, 1797; from all the improper harangues of which it was the fountain head; and from all the bad effects which are to be expected by the farther irritation of France.</p>

<pb n="171" facs="unknown:033485_0170_0FF720A9E35A75F8"/>
directory well knew why Monroe was recalled. His crime conſiſted in a cordial attachment to the French revolution. They were, therefore, to look with a jealous eye on the perſon appointed to ſucceed him. This alone would have enſured to Mr. Pinckney a cold reception; even if the recall of Adet had not afforded a plauſible reaſon for refuſing to receive him. He was wrong for not leaving France, on the firſt injunction of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. He improved his delay into a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the French miniſter. Hence it was highly injudicious in Mr. Adams to ſend him back, as he has done, a ſecond time. This, in itſelf, is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of diſreſpect to the French government. If peace with the republic was the point in view, the ſureſt way would have been to ſend back Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon or Monroe. The directory would recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize them, not merely as ambaſſadors, but as friends. From ſuch a deputation there would at leaſt be a chance for the return of mutual confidence.

               <p>That it was improper to ſend Mr. Pinckney back to France, appears from his own printed correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. It contains various expreſſions highly diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful to the directory. The remarks may be very juſt, but the good policy of Mr. Adams, in expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the world, admits of doubt. Mr. Pinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney gave his letters of credence to the French mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, De la Croix, on December 9th, 1796. On the 11th, the latter informed Mr. Monroe, that no envoy could be received, till America had granted the redreſs of grievances demanded by France.
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:033485_0171_0FF720AB7901FE80"/>
De la Croix, by addreſſing Monroe, gave a broad enough hint that he wanted to have no buſineſs with Pinckney. Yet, next morning, our envoy ſent him a long letter, enquiring, whether he ſhould quit the republic. On the 15th, the French miniſter ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his opinion, that this was the deſire of the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; but that he would conſult them again. Mr. Pinckney ſtood on the ground of diplomatic privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, though he adds, that the directory had recent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent off thirteen foreign miniſters. On the 26th, he again ſent to enquire of De la Croix, whether he might reſide in the republic. He received a ſharp anſwer, which his ſecretary wanted the French miniſter to put into writing. This was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, with ſome bad humour. De la Croix wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Mr. Pinckney, for having ſtaid ſo long, after he had been informed that it was impoſſible to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. Still he lingered in Paris, till the 5th of the enſuing February, having teaſed the directory, till they gave him a written order to quit the French territories. His letter, conveying this laſt news, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with an ardent wiſh for a <hi>return</hi> of the good ſenſe and good humour of the republic.</p>
               <p>This bickering would not be worth an analyſis; but as the federal party make a prodigious clamour about it, the particulars riſe above their natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of intereſt. Inſtead of haraſſing De la Croix, and the directory, and ſtanding upon the tiptoe of diplomatic privilege, Pinckney would have ſerved the United States better, by quitting France on the firſt intimation, that he could not be received in an official character. The previous diſmiſſal of thirteen miniſters, might have convinced him, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory would remain inflexible, and that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity could only ſerve to widen the breach. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that the French were in the wrong, and that is extremely doubtful, a wiſe envoy would
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:033485_0172_0FF720AEB1018C28"/>
have made ſome allowance for the pride and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of victory. It is the inſeparable tribute of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man infirmity, at the ſhrine of fortune. Both parties were highly chagrined, in the act of Mr. Pinckney's ultimate diſmiſſion. Aſk yourſelf, then, whether it was a prudent ſtep to ſend him a ſecond time to Paris? The quarrel of nations had been exaſperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into that of perſons<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>Ambaſſadors have a juſt natural right to demand that their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals ſhould be delivered.

               <p>Mr. Adams has completed this individual rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

this unhappy ſpeech. If Barras was to ſay any thing in the ſhape of cenſure, he could not have ſaid leſs; and he knew, as well as Mr. Pinckney, that the Britiſh treaty was the work of a party. The federal newſpapers are conſtantly reviling the French na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They deſpiſe all notice of ſuch foolery; though they know, and cannot fail to reſent it.

The one accuſation would be juſt as plauſible as the other.]</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I am happy to find that Mr. Adet's diſorganiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manoeuvres have been treated, by my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as they deſerved, and that his attempts to divide, have tended to unite them<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 62.</note>.</q> The plaiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of adulation is here laid on pretty thick. When Genet behaved with petulance to Mr. Waſhington, he had, at leaſt, the merit of acting above board. Here is a man, who, under covert, ſeems to do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in his power to ſeſter the animoſity of our executive againſt France. It has been thought of importance to enter into this diſſection of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial correſpondence. It was from his rubbiſh of
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:033485_0176_0FF720BA00622118"/>
materials, that Mr. Adams fabricated his military harangue. When the papers were read in the houſe of repreſentatives, the ſpirited behaviour of Pinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney met with loud applauſe. The ſpeech of Barras was condemned by every member who took notice of it.</p>
               <p>Preſident Adams would find it difficult to give a good reaſon for preſenting this correſpondence, in its full extent, to congreſs. He well knew that it would be printed, that copies of it would be ſent to France, that many parts of it were ſure to offend the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and that, from the day of its arrival, they would regard Pinckney as a calumniator and a ſpy. If the preſident wanted the directory to refuſe, for a ſecond time, the admiſſion of his credentials, this was the moſt likely way to ſucceed. Mr. Fenno himſelf would have been as commendable a choice as Mr. Pinckney.</p>
               <p>In an early part of this chapter it was affirmed, that Mr. Adams <q>deſired, and ſtill deſires a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with France.</q> Evidence on this charge has now been examined, and the public will decide as to its juſtice.</p>
               <p>Along with the above, another point was ſtated, that, <q>if expreſſions far ſtronger than thoſe of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras had been employed by lord Grenville, not a murmur would have been heard about them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In proof of this affirmation, there is a letter from Thomas Pinckney, dated London, January 9th, 1794. In a converſation with Pinckney, Grenville made a reference to <q>evil diſpoſed perſons among us, who, according to the intelligence he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, were endeavouring to irritate our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt Great Britain, as well as to oppoſe the meaſures of our own government, and, in ſhort, to reduce us to the preſent ſituation of France; a misfortune which they deprecated, as well for
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:033485_0177_0FF720BCC3634B58"/>
our fakes, as for the common welfare and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of mankind.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>the common welfare of mankind,</hi> it was juſt a month after this converſation that Dorcheſter, by deſire of Grenville, delivered his war-talk to the Indians.</p>
               <p>Genet was accuſed of threatening to appeal from the preſident to the people. But here ſomething in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely worſe has been actually performed. Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville at once appeals from the people to the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. He charges a great part of them with wiſhing to involve the continent in anarchy and bloodſhed, and gives notice, in a ſtile plain enough, that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land would be glad to aſſiſt our executive in ſupport of order. Compared to this inſolence, the glance of Barras fades beneath criticiſm. If one drop of republican blood had warmed the heart of Thomas Pinckney, he never would have become the agent of this communication. The preſident did not like Genet's propoſed appeal to the people, but he was highly ſatisfied with this appeal to himſelf. From that day forward, he drew more cloſely the bonds of union with England. The hint would have ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed queen Elizabeth, or Philip the ſecond; in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing the earl of Murray, or a leader of the French league.</p>
               <p>The reſidence of Phineas Bond in Philadelphia, as Britiſh conſul, preſents an evidence of pitiful tameneſs. <q>No ſtate, ſays Hutcheſon, is bound to admit any exiled criminal or fugitive ſubject of theirs, as an ambaſſador from any neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate. But if ſuch a one is ſent with ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, he cannot juſtly be ſeized or puniſhed, but he may be immediately ordered to quit our country<note n="*" place="bottom">Hutcheſon, Book III. Chap. X.</note>.</q> Bond was ſo much attached to Mr.

Guelph, that he accompanied the Britiſh army from this city. He did not return to America till ſome years after the revolution. No act of indemnity has been extended to him. His Britiſh commiſſion alone ſaves him from the penalties of an outlaw, which his ſubſequent inſolence has highly deſerved. If ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Lee had ſurvived the late war, and been ſent as a conſul or ambaſſador to England, the court of London would have reſented the nomination as an inſult, and he might, perhaps without much impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, have been committed to the tower. But the Britiſh government has a ſenſe of dignity, which America is yet to learn. By the way, our tories clamour greatly at the ſevere fate of French emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants, while their own conduct ſhews how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous indulgence might be. It is needleſs to act a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution by halves. When American priſoners were ſtarved to death at New-York, the republicans ſhould have uſed theirs exactly in the ſame manner. If retaliation had been inſtantly begun, it would have ſaved many thouſands of valuable lives.

But the above is the real and practical ſignification of the clauſe. Ruſſian proviſions are, in no caſe whatever, ſeizable. <hi>Fourth,</hi> The next paragraph of the eighteenth arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is as inferior as all the reſt to the Ruſſian treaty. An American veſſel attempting to enter a place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, is, in the firſt inſtance, to be turned away, and, on a ſecond attempt to get entrance, her cargo,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:033485_0180_0FF720C5414A23A0"/>
though not contraband, ſhall be confiſcated. But a Ruſſian ſhip may enter at any time, and with <q>all kinds of goods, <hi>except ammunition.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, in four points, of the higheſt conſequence, the Ruſſian treaty has the advantage of ours. A ſtranger might wonder that any man in America is capable of defending Jay. Some of his advocates have been impelled by motives diſtinct from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal approbation. Four hundred and thirteen merchants and traders, in Philadelphia, gave an addreſs of thanks to the preſident for paſſing of the treaty. Of this number, it is charitable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that one-half acted under the hope of pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the dread of offending Mr. Thomas Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, preſident of the bank of the United States, and who appears at the head of the liſt. With ſeveral, it was a ſufficient motive to ſee their names in ſuch reputable company. Many dozens of the ſubſcribers have ſince become bankrupt. Morris and Nicholſon were ſo at the time<note n="*" place="bottom">At leaſt they were indebted to the extent of many millions of dollars; none of their creditors could get a cent; and their bills were ſold at a reduced price.</note>; and certainly were not <q>more immediately concerned than any other claſs of men<note n="†" place="bottom">The words of the addreſs.</note>,</q> ſince the real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt lay with thoſe to whom they were indebted. The following enquiry will prove ſome of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations which this country has to Mr. Willing, and to a part of <hi>the gentlemen with whom he had the honour to act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A bank is eſtabliſhed by permiſſion from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a country, for the univerſal conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of its citizens. Hence its directors have no title to make a diſtinction between perſons or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, any farther than reſpecting their <hi>ſolvency.</hi> A bank is, or ought to be, deſigned for the good of
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:033485_0181_0FF720C6CE947BA0"/>
ſociety at large. Individuality of diſcouragement, or of favour, is excluded from the ſcheme. Such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality would transform it into a nuiſance.</p>
               <p>But equality of treatment ſhould more eſpecially be the caſe with the bank of the United States. One fifth part of its paper money capital belongs to the national government. For this reaſon, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry citizen is, at ſecond hand, a partner in it; as he pays a proportion of taxes to the public ſtock, from whence that fifth ſhare was derived. But it is notorious that this bank has been employed as an engine of government, to ſerve the views of Britiſh intereſt. Diſcounts have often been refuſed at this national bank to men of moſt undoubted opulence, merely on account of the republican principles of thoſe who drew or accepted of the bill. The deſpotiſm of paper money pervades every muſcle and vein of Philadelphian ſociety. <hi>The domination of Britiſh cuſtom-houſe officers has been exchanged for that of American ſtockjobbers</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">By the act of incorporation, three-fifths of the funds are paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ſix per cent. public ſtock. Compare ſections 2d and 11th.</note>. As a minute example, ſeveral gentlemen of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable property, declared that they durſt not ſubſcribe for the late Hiſtory of 1796; but that they would be ſure to buy it as ſoon as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They feared federal vengeance; of which a ſtoppage of diſcounts at the bank is the foremoſt and favourite weapon. The effects of ſuch a ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page would infallibly ruin the mercantile character of any man in Mr. Willing's liſt.</p>
               <p>It has been remarked<note n="†" place="bottom">American Annual Regiſter, Chap. V.</note>, that Philadelphia has thirty offices excluſively for printing of books. This was a year ago; but, ſince that time, and owing to the late torrent of bankruptcies, ſome
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:033485_0182_0FF720C8620FAE48"/>
have been ſhut up, and others have become half idle. If the paper money of this country had been confined within one-ſixth part of its preſent limits, theſe bankruptcies would have been reſtricted in at leaſt as great a proportion. Inſtead of thirty printing offices, but indifferently employed, there might have been fifty well employed. In Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh or Glaſgow, a good journeyman printer will earn fifteen ſhillings ſterling or a guinea per week. In Dublin, his wages are, it is true, higher, but in Philadelphia, he makes upon a medium, eight or ten dollars. A difference in the expence of labour attends, alſo, the manufacture of paper. By much the greater part of this ſuperior rate of wages may be traced not to the ſcarcity of hands, but to the exceſs of bank notes, and the conſequent riſe of markets. The dearth of wages, to theſe two claſſes of workmen, renders it difficult to pay them. Hence the employer muſt ſometimes borrow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, at an high intereſt, in order to clear their accounts. The difference of wages, with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium for the advance of money, is laid by the paper-maker on his manufacture. A ſecond upon his own work, is ſuperadded by the printer, and a third by the bookſeller. It is partly by this means, that books are dearer in Philadelphia or New-York than in England, though we have, comparatively, but very few taxes, and the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar advantage ariſing from an unbounded extent of fertile territory. The ſureſt way to augment the circulation of a commodity is to be able to ſell it cheap. An American printer is often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſold, at his own door, by the Scots or Iriſh printer, who has labour at a price one-third lower. In London, wages are higher than probably any where elſe in Britain. A journeyman book-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who exerts himſelf, can clear two guineas per
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:033485_0183_0FF720CDBB80A2B0"/>
week, but even there, by dint of large capitals, and the ſuperiority of an old eſtabliſhment, the printer and bookſeller can afford to deal for leſs profit, and to give longer credit than a printer in America, where the intereſt of money is ſo much higher than in England.</p>
               <p>It will be replied that, before the bank of the United States was opened, a journeyman prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could be had for three, or four dollars, that trade was then very dull, and that Engliſh books were imported as faſt as they are now. In reaſoning, it is common to aſcribe effects to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginary cauſes, merely becauſe the latter occurred at the ſame time with the former. Yeſterday, at noon, the clock ſtruck twelve, but the ſun would have croſſed the zenith, whether the clock had ſtruck or not. It will be ſuppoſed that bank pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per arrived only by degrees at its preſent oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive magnitude; that at firſt it promoted a prudent extent of foreign trade; and that trade in turn ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated internal manufactures. It is not the uſe, but the abuſe of paper money, that is liable to objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Had the quantum of its circulation become ſtationary, five or ſix years ago, it might have done well; but, inſtead of this, it has gone forward to ſet open ſuch ſtoodgates of gambling and of uſury, as hardly ever overwhlemed any country before. If the expence of print and paper had remained ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary ſince 1792, the volume which now coſts a dollar, could have been had for four or five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. This muſt have excluded in whole or nearly ſo, the preſent large importation of paper, and it muſt, at the ſame time, have greatly augmented the preſent manufacture of printing. The like increaſe would have enſued in ſome other bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, more readily than in this one. Both here and in Britain the wages of a printer are higher
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:033485_0184_0FF720CF4E671E58"/>
than thoſe of moſt other tradeſmen, and nearer the ſame level in the two countries. This is, no doubt, one reaſon why book-printing has thriven more rapidly here than ſo many other manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. On the contrary, look at weavers. In the old country their wages are ſo low, and their work can be furniſhed ſo cheap, that, in ſeveral branches, no eſtabliſhment in America can compete them.</p>
               <p>Internal manufactures are a more important, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a more ſafe and durable acquiſition than foreign commerce. They can involve no external quarrel, and they are beyond the reach of external piracy. The tanner, at Lancaſter, has nothing to fear from the corſairs of Barbary; and a potter, or cutler, on the Suſquehanna, may ſmile at the menaces of the Britiſh navy. Twice the preſent number of American tradeſmen, though purchaſed by loſing half the preſent number of American merchants, would produce a very deſirable alteration in the real ſtrength and reſources of the United States.</p>
               <p>The whole force of the banking ſyſtem has been directed entirely towards the promotion of foreign trade. The encouragement which it afforded to domeſtic improvement was but as by proxy, through the medium of that wealth which commerce ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to produce. But naturally ſpeaking, matters, if left more freely to their own operation, and leſs impeded by mountains of paper money, would have taken a ſurer courſe. A multitude of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing villages, planted over the continent, are preferable to an immenſe quantity of ſhipping diſperſed over the ocean. A carpenter, or a black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith, is more likely to be ſober, long-lived, and to leave a family behind him, than that part of our ſeamen employed in diſtant voyages. Dr. Blanc, a Scots phyſician, who ſerved under admiral Rod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:033485_0185_0FF720D59D823EB8"/>
remarks, that ſailors look, for the moſt part, older by ten years than landſmen of the ſame age. Great numbers are annually loſt at ſea or periſh by the hardſhips peculiar to their profeſſion. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not one-half of the aggregate body enjoy the comforts of a dry death. Of thoſe engaged in voyages to foreign countries, only a few are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. The ſailors of New-England have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of being orderly, and attached to their families; but this is not, in moſt parts of the world, the general character of mariners. Of their extreme utility and value to the United States, notice has been formerly taken<note n="*" place="bottom">American Annual Regiſter, Chap. III.</note>. But internal manufacturers are a ſtill more eſſential claſs in the ſcale of national proſperity. If you can find a taylor, or ſhoemaker, at the next plantation, it is ſurely more profitable to employ him than to ſend your wheat three or four thouſand miles by ſea, to be exchanged for cloaths and ſhoes. Beſides the riſk, and the waſte of additional labour in the voyage, the tradeſman whom you employ in France or England is not your fellow citizen. A mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic, reſiding in America, forms a part of the nation. His earnings are expended among us. His family are blended with and augment the general maſs of population; whereas a ſailor is often but ſlightly connected with his native country, in which he is indeed a ſtranger, while the foreign manufacturer, who is to conſume your commodities, has no alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance whatever with it, but the tranſitory proſpect of receiving employment. Mr. Gallatin<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 16.</note> computes the number of American ſeamen at near forty thouſand. Of theſe, it is much to ſay that ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand are married, and raiſe families. Here then we have twenty-four thouſand batchelors, to
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:033485_0186_0FF720D731831068"/>
ſupport whoſe numbers, recruits are much more frequently wanted than by any other body of men If they had been on ſhore, as mechanics, five out of ſix of them would have married, and three children to each, arriving at an adult age, would make an increaſe of ſixty thouſand people. Theſe hints are thrown out not to depreciate the real value of the banking ſyſtem, and much leſs of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign commerce; but merely to ſhew what is now indeed, univerſally granted, that the former has been driven to a ruinous exceſs, and that the latter ought not to be encouraged at the expence of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic manufactures, which, of the two ſyſtems, greatly deſerve the preference.</p>
               <p>A ſhort review will diſcover what an enormous maſs of paper has been iſſued in this city. The bank of North America, the eldeſt on the continent, was firſt incorporated by an act of congreſs, dated April 1ſt, 1782. Its preſent charter, granted by the ſtate of Pennſylvania, bears date the 17th of March, 1787.</p>

               <p>Thus, within the ſpace of only ſeven years, from 1787, to 1793, incluſive, three batteries of
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:033485_0187_0FF720D8D9708ED8"/>
paper money, extending to FIFTEEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, were opened, and ſtill continue to play againſt the antient fortreſs of gold and ſilver. The capitals of other banks on the continent amount to about five millions. Bring twice as many tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies to the market as you can poſſibly ſell; and the price of money will inſtantly riſe, or, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to common ideas, that of turkies will fall. In the ſame way, by thruſting ſo many thouſand reams of artificial money into the market, gold ſoon became of much inferior value. Like Swift's pippin, the honeſt old milled dollar, that never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any body, that makes its viſits always wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and is the only ſtedfaſt friend, found itſelf joſtled out of the market by five or ſix upſtarts. By degrees, as the operations of the banks exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the neceſſaries of life grew dearer, till, in ſome inſtances, they arrived at an intolerable pitch. Three hundred dollars per annum were lately gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a houſe in Water-ſtreet, Philadelphia, that would not turn rain, and that had not a ſingle tolerable room. Even on the ſkirts of the city, an hundred dollars are often paid for an hovel of rotten boards, comprehending two or three apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rather wider than a centry box, and which would not, in the vicinage of London, bring a rent of three guineas. It was well obſerved, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ago, by an old citizen, that, if Philadelphia could get but another bank, we ſhould ſoon pay a dollar for a bunch of aſparagus. Some copies of this book will reach France and England; inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded emigrants are requeſted to compare theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails with that cant of <hi>the peculiar facility with which a family can be raiſed in America;</hi> and, in the name of all that is ſacred, let them not envy the happineſs of reſiding in an American ſea-port.</p>
               <p>If the capitals of the three banks had extended,
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:033485_0188_0FF720DA9936C5E0"/>
collectively, to three or four millions, they might have done ſervice; as fifty drops of laudanum will cure a cholic, when five hundred would kill the patient. But when congreſs, by a law, which they had not the ſmalleſt title to make, abruptly opened an enormous ſluice of ten millions of dollars, they acted with the foreſight of the ſhepherd, who wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Ganges to run through his fields. The bank of Pennſylvania came next, with its three millions, like the ſecond three hundred laſhes on the back of a Britiſh ſoldier, who has ſtolen a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of hens. No ſcarcaſm is intended on the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of this inſtitution. They did not foreſee its conſequences to the public at large. It has been of much pecuniary advantage to the government of this ſtate; and the aſſembly reaſonably ſuppoſed, that, while ſuch great ſums were made by banking, they had an equal right, with others, to the profit of an adventure. Their eſtabliſhment had another effect of ſome value. Its operations tended to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the vortex of influence which ten millions of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital gave to the bank of the United States. After this explanation, it may be ſafely aſſerted, that the bank of Pennſylvania was injurious to the country, not from any peculiarity in the eſtabliſhment itſelf, but becauſe the market was previouſly overſtocked. In one reſpect it is greatly ſuperior to the Hamilton bank. The government of Pennſylvania derives a conſiderable revenue from its bank, and which is ſaid to defray its whole expences. Congreſs gains only forty thouſand dollars, and even that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by a ſecond breach of the conſtitution, as illegal as the act of incorporation itſelf.</p>
               <p>Of the ten millions of paper capital held by the bank of the United States, two millions were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by government, in virtue of a clauſe in the charter. But if it was irregular to found a bank, it
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:033485_0189_0FF720E1B5203070"/>
muſt be ſtill more ſo to ſport in ſhares of it with public money. In the annual reports from the treaſury to congreſs, an hundred and ſixty thouſand dollars are ſtated as the ſhare of government in the dividends. The two millions of dollars were bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, at ſix per cent. from the bank itſelf. Thus, after ſtriking off an hundred and twenty thouſand dollars of intereſt, the clear profit, as above ſtated, is only forty thouſand. It is believed, that either of the banks of North America, or of Pennſylvania, would give a large ſum for the additional conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and repute of handling public money. A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of this nature is intereſting to any banking company. The remittances of revenue from Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to the exchequer at London, paſs, of courſe, through the hands of an Edinburgh banker. The agency is ſaid to be worth ten thouſand pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling per annum, and it ſometimes produces a ſharp competition. William Ramſay, who is underſtood to have a fortune of at leaſt three or four hundred thouſand pounds ſterling, and who was thus far above conteſting for a trifle, miſſed this employment, ſome years ago, in a hard ſtruggle with ſir William Forbes, the foreman of Thomas Mair's jury.</p>
               <p>From theſe obſervations it reſults, that, though banks have promoted the extenſion of commerce, the too great amount of their notes in circulation, and the monſtrous uſury for which paper opened an avenue, have, in the iſſue, filled Philadelphia with inſolvencies. By previouſly ſtretching the price of labour to twice its natural height<note n="*" place="bottom">From the ſcarcity of hands in this country, the price of labour will always be higher, in proportion to that of proviſions, than it is in Europe. But that will not account for its preſent exorbitant riſe.</note>, they have mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially impeded the maturity, or rather infancy, of American manufactures.</p>
               <p>In the preſent, as in other parts of this volume, a

boldneſs of language has been, ſometimes, unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Before the friends of order haſten to condemn it, let them look at Mr. Fenno's gazette of March 4th, 1797. It has one article which begins thus. <q>Died, laſt evening, of a two years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, the <hi>houſe of repreſentatives</hi> of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States.

To the admirers of the ſenatorial gazette, an author may reply in the words of Boileau: <q>Sir, while you can reliſh ſuch verſes as thoſe of your marquis, you will do me a particular pleaſure by deſpiſing mine.</q>

I avowed this opinion, at ſeveral private meetings of members of the houſe, at one of which I was pointedly aſked what I deemed a reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table majority, and whether I deemed fifteen, ſuch as had appeared on the queſtion for obtaining the papers, a reſpectable one? I replied that I did, and that I thought eight reſpectable, but in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance would even be content with five. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed my doubts whether that number would
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:033485_0192_0FF720E6EE6F7768"/>
eventually appear, although the gentlemen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent were of a different opinion. From the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which I had of the ſentiments of the members, which I expreſſed to ſeveral of my friends on the morning of the day on which the deciſion took place, it terminated much in the manner that I expected. To many members of the then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs I can appeal for the truth of the above; and I challenge any one of my acquaintances, either in or out of congreſs, to prove that I ever pledged myſelf, at all events, to vote againſt appropriations. I had an opinion of my own, and was determined to vote as exiſting circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhould direct to be moſt prudent, and for the real benefit of my country. As to a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconſiſtency in my conduct, when the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was before the houſe, I equally deny that. I was for the preamble, which declares the treaty objectionable. By calling the yeas and nays, I knew that this opinion, whether it prevailed or not, would be brought on the journals, where my name appears in the affirmative. This being effected, I cared leſs about the final deciſion, though the imperious circumſtances which preſented themſelves led me to conſent to the meaſure, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reſponſibility with thoſe who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ratified the treaty, and had been ſo indefatigable in raiſing the ſtorm, and bringing the houſe, and this country, into ſo diſgraceful a dilemma. If I have erred, I have experienced the human lot. If I have injured my country, which I cannot yet ſee, it was not done deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly. Suffice it to ſay, I acted according to the beſt of my judgement, without intereſted views, and with a full knowledge that it would injure me with thoſe who deem themſelves excluſive patriots and republicans. But as neither that
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:033485_0193_0FF720EE59170110"/>
conſideration, nor any intereſted views whatever have, ſo I truſt that they never will have, an influence on my own opinion and judgment in public affairs. Whatever improper motives may be aſcribed to me, a conſciouſneſs of having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted uprightly will conſole me, whilſt I am ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that I have the genuine republican intereſt of this country as much at heart, as any one, though I may raiſe leſs clamour about it. So far from having deſerted it, I can with greater truth and propriety aſſert, that many of my quondam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican friends have deſerted me, and treated me ungenerouſly.</p>

               <p>IT is clear, at the firſt glance, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt be unnatural in the preſent condition of the United States. Except in ſome parts of New-England, they are free from the expenſive uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an eſtabliſhed church. Induſtry is not cramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by corporation laws. Excellent land may be had

for a trifle. The people, in proportion to their numbers, are taxed, upon an average, above ſeven times leſs than thoſe of Britain<note n="*" place="bottom">If this country contains five millions of inhabitants, the net amount of taxes for the year ending on September 30th, 1796, came to a dollar and one-third per head. Britain has a population of ten millions. They now (January 1798) are ſaid to pay twenty-two mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and an half ſterling of annual taxes, which make ten dollars per head. The ſupplies for the current year are not here included.</note>. Yet with all theſe circumſtances, ſo prodigiouſly favourable to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, government ſtaggers under a heavy debt, of which the intereſt is paid by an effort. Congreſs want to borrow farther ſums, and it is hard to ſee where the ſmalleſt loan can be had. Their inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity has been racked in deviſing taxes, of which ſome were unproductive, like that upon ſnuff, and others, like the ſugar exciſe, were oppreſſive. Both impoſt and internal taxes are carried as far as they can go; and the laſt and preſent houſe of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives have, by a large majority, rejected a land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax.</p>
               <p>Within leſs than nine years from the birth of her new conſtitution<note n="†" place="bottom">Congreſs met, for the firſt time, at New-York, on April 1ſt, 1789.</note>, America ſeems to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted the career of her funding ſyſtem, and to be as firmly wedged in all its evils, as the monarchy of France was, juſt before it expired. By ſea, an attempt was made to build ſix frigates. After dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling for ſome years, without being able to finiſh them, the propoſed number was reduced to three. By land, it has been found burdenſome to ſupport an eſtabliſhment of three thouſand regulars. At ſea, our commerce has been plundered with impunity, by every nation that choſe to do ſo; while the whole weſtern frontier has been violated by a few ſolitary tribes of ſavages, who make treaties only to break them, and whoſe ſuſpenſion of hoſtility is
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:033485_0195_0FF720F17576CC50"/>
always courted by government with freſh preſents. It is hard to conceive a more conſummate picture of political debility. With excellent ſailors, and the beſt ſhip timber in the world, America cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a fleet. With a militia of immenſe numbers, the Indians are yet permitted to murder families by the dozen.</p>
               <p>In the ſea-port towns of this country proviſions were, for ſome years paſt, at a higher price than, in common ſeaſons, they coſt in any part of Europe. Yet, in 1795, the exports compriſed an hundred and forty one thouſand buſhels of wheat; two mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions one hundred and eighty-ſeven thouſand buſhels of other grain and pulſe; ſix hundred and eighty-ſeven thouſand barrels of flour; an hundred and ſeventy-nine thouſand barrels of meal and bread; an hundred and thirty-eight thouſand tierces of rice; two hundred and one thouſand barrels of beef, pork, and lard; four hundred thouſand quintals, and fifty-ſix thouſand barrels of fiſh; twenty-three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hundred weight of cheeſe; twenty-eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand firkins of butter; and ſix hundred and ninety-five thouſand buſhels of potatoes and onions. Nor is this year ſelected for any peculiar magnitude of exports. In 1790, there were ſhipped ſeven hundred and twenty-four thouſand barrels of flour; in 1791, ſix hundred and nineteen thouſand; in 1792, eight hundred and twenty-four thouſand; in 1793, one million and ſeventy-four thouſand; and, in 1794, eight hundred and twenty-eight thouſand. During 1796, an hundred and ninety-ſeven thouſand bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of flour were ſhipped at the port of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia only. In the marſh-market of Baltimore, five hundred turkies have been ſometimes ſold in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle day. New-York is famous for the peculiar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence and variety of its fiſh; and Philadelphia is amply ſupplied with every article of ſubſiſtence.

How then did it happen, that theſe markets were, for ſo long a period, exorbitantly dear? How did it come to paſs that, while America kept other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from ſtarving, the manufacturers, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring poor, in the ſea-ports, and through ſome parts of the country, were condemned to extortion?</p>
               <p>At fifteen dollars per barrel, a pound of flour comes to four-pence, and one-ſeventh ſterling. Add one-third for the profit of the baker. It then coſts ſix-pence ſterling, or ten-pence currency. At this price, a labouring man, with a dollar per working day, a wiſe and four children, could only buy, out of his dollar, nine or ten pounds of bread; and on Sunday he muſt have faſted. For ſix perſons this pittance was juſt able to keep ſoul and body toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But what was he to do for a reliſh to his bread? Himſelf and family could not go naked. A ſwarm of incidents were to ruſh upon his pocket<note n="*" place="bottom">In 1780, in the midſt of a bloody war, in a country compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively barren, and over-loaded with innumerable taxes, fourteen ounces of the fineſt wheaten bread were ſold at Edinburgh, for one penny ſterling.</note>.</p>

               <p>Houſe rent, alſo, was an important item.

It is amazing to think of the patience with which poor people do, in this country, endure ſuch treatment; and of the profound ſilence, regarding their wrongs, that is obſerved by our admirable newſpapers. When a tradeſman cannot, with his utmoſt induſtry, keep his children from ſtarving; when not a ſingle ſtatute interpoſes for his relief, what ought he to
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:033485_0197_0FF720FA4519B5B8"/>
care who ſhall be preſident, or what becomes of the legiſlature of the ſtate wherein he lives, or of the repreſentatives of the union? The man to whom government does not extend ſuitable protection, has no obligation to feel towards it either gratitude, attachment, or reſpect. The wages of labour did not riſe in any thing like an equal proportion to the price of proviſions, and the general expence of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus the poor were placed, like Tantalus, juſt within reach of plenty, which they were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to taſte. The beſt economiſt in Philadelphia would be puzzled to ſupport a family of ſix per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, though he had ten dollars per week, when flour was at fifteen, or even twelve dollars, per bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. But it is certain that great numbers of tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and labourers protracted the exiſtence of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their families, upon a weekly income of ſix or eight dollars, while flour ſtood at fifteen dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and while ſome of Mr. Thomas Willing's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgators <note n="*" place="bottom">See the laſt chapter.</note> were borrowing and lending wind-bills and paper dollars to each other, at five per cent. a month, to facilitate the exportation of ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand barrels of flour. Both ſides of this picture explain why the priſon of Philadelphia has long been as populous as a bee-hive, and why, in the yellow fever of Auguſt, 1797, numbers of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens were compelled to remain and periſh, becauſe they could dot muſter the expences requiſite for a removal. The poor form the pedeſtal on which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety does ultimately reſt; and this is the degree of attention which they and their hardſhips meet with, from the government and police of this wiſeſt of nations.</p>

and thouſands were ſure to have died of hunger, though adminiſtration would undoubtedly have done every thing poſſible to prevent it. A London newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper of December, 1795, ſays, that two millions ſterling had, in that year, been paid for bounties on the importation of corn. This bounty proved a trap-door to American merchants. Flour was bought here at fourteen dollars per barrel, and ſold in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpool for eight dollars. The bounty might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, cover the expence of freight. Members of parliament, and others, entered into reſolutions for eating coarſe bread, and the homelineſs of that ſerved up at the royal table was deſcribed, in a miniſterial print, with minuteneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultation. But in America, miſery, like that then felt in England, can hardly take place; becauſe the cheapneſs of land outweighs many legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive imperfections. Nine-tenths of people are farmers, and of conſequence take care, in the firſt place, to feed themſelves. Of the reſt, a large majority poſſeſs property of ſome kind, and do not live, as the phraſe is, from hand to mouth. Hence the poſſitive ſufferers formed a much leſſer propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the community than they would have done in France, or England. Now, it always happens that a poor man, reſiding in the midſt of ten others richer than himſelf, contrives to joſtle on with more eaſe than if all his neighbours were, like him, neceſſitous. This is one main reaſon why the more dependent claſs in the ſea-ports did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that awful extremity of diſtreſs which, in 1795; almoſt overwhelmed Britain. Beſides, if a poor man has a numerous family, he can find ſome perſon who will take healthy children on an indenture, as ſervants or apprentices<note n="*" place="bottom">This is the caſe in Pennſylvania, but New-England differs from it. A perſon there will, it is ſaid, be glad to ſupport his ſon during an apprenticeſhip, for the ſake of his learning the trade.</note>.</p>

                  <pb n="200" facs="unknown:033485_0199_0FF721210EB01DD8"/>But, for theſe alleviating circumſtances, no thanks are due to the rulers of America; and though people did not abſolutely die of hunger, yet there exiſted between that and competency many modes of ſubſtantial hard fortune. It was culpable in our legiſlators to ſtand tamely by, while part of its citizens laboured under ſuch peculiar penury.</p>
               <p>Yet it is more eaſy to point out misfortunes than to provide an effectual remedy. In Europe, five different methods have been practiſed to prevent or to remove the diſtreſſes of famine. One of theſe is to proſſer a bounty on the inſtant importation of foreign grain. The ſecond gives premiums for the improvement of agriculture. As for Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſcarcity, both of theſe plans are out of the queſtion. Proviſions always abound, but the poor cannot ſometimes get at them. A third expedient is to prohibit by law the exporting of victuals, when they have riſen in the market beyond a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain price. The maritime parts of Britain are, with this view, divided into diſtricts<note n="*" place="bottom">See particulars in <hi>The Political Progreſs of Britain,</hi> Part 1ſt, 3d edition, Chap. 4th.</note>, and the ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff of each county, has under ſome reſtrictions, a diſcretionary power of opening or ſhutting the ports. But the Britiſh corn laws do not invite imitation. They propagate ſo much confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and miſchief as to diſcourage regulations of that nature. A fourth ſource of relief has been by the diſtribution of money, or proviſions, at the public expence. In the caſe of the fire at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah, the houſe of repreſentatives determined that the conſtitution did not allow them to beſtow charity. The aſſembly of Penſylvania, however, gave, on the ſame occaſion, fifteen thouſand dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. But this practice of donations, beſides being
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:033485_0200_0FF720FD8B604310"/>
altogether a direct and heavy expence, becomes very liable to abuſe.</p>
               <p>A fifth ſcheme, practiſed in Geneva, and Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland, is to have large granaries conſtantly ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with flour. By a peculiar proceſs of beating it into a hard ſubſtance, flour is preſerved, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injury, for ſeveral years, as lord Gardenſtone was aſſured on the ſpot, by people concerned in the buſineſs. Now, although congreſs cannot give money, they can lend it. Fifty thouſand dollars were, in 1795, appropriated for trading with the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and, in 1796, an hundred and fifty thouſand dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars<note n="*" place="bottom">Folwell's edition of Acts of Congreſs, vol. iii. p. 232 and 259.</note>. Congreſs have alſo wandered to the depth of two millions of dollars in banking. It would ſeem as agreeable both to ſound policy, and to the conſtitution, to eſtabliſh granaries in a few of the principal towns on the ſea-coaſt that are moſt lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a riſe of markets. Individual pride, and ſome rules of reſtriction, would hinder the rich, or thoſe in eaſy circumſtances, from battening upon this inſtitution. Let a number of poor families be enrolled, and ſupplied from this ſource with flour, at all ſeaſons of the year, for ſix dollars per barrel. This would place the lower claſſes more at their eaſe, and tend greatly to cheapneſs of labour, increaſe of emigration, and the facility of eſtabliſhing manufactures.</p>
               <p>Beſides the good policy of ſuch a plan, of which the above hints are a faint outline, juſtice requires retribution to the inhabitants of ſea-ports, who bear, beyond all proportion, the greateſt weight of public taxes. In 1796, the duties on merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize and tonnage amounted to twelve times more than the whole produce of internal taxes. But it is evident that the inhabitants of the ſea-port
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:033485_0201_0FF7210019FF9FD8"/>
towns conſume a greater quantity of the imports than an equal number of people in the country, eſpecially at a diſtance from the ſea-coaſt. For inſtance, take the article of clothing. In towns, a weaver is generally a rare phaenomenon. It is believed that Philadelphia does not contain even a ſingle weaver. But in the country, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally remote from the ſea, the people make their own cloth. In the debates on Mr. Madiſon's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, general Scott, of Waſhington county, in this ſtate, obſerved, that the union contained about four millions and five hundred thouſand peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that their bedding and cloathing could not come to leſs than ten dollars annually per head, being, in the whole, forty-five millions of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. <q>Where ſaid he, do all theſe manufactures come from? Suppoſe that Britiſh imports were two millions ſterling, and one half of them in clothing. The amount is only about four mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and five hundred thouſand dollars, or one-tenth part of the annual conſumption.</q> None of theſe calculations can be rigidly exact<note n="*" place="bottom">The duty on articles of wearing does not, probably, exceed one-fourth part of the whole impoſt. Conſult Mr. Gallatin p. 18.</note>. Yet they clearly ſhew that one great branch of impoſt falls by far the moſt heavily on people in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, who, at leaſt to the ſouth of New-England, wear, in general, Britiſh or Iriſh manufactures, while inland inhabitants are ſpinning and weaving for themſelves. Other articles, ſuch as wine, tea, ſugar, and coffee, are uſed much more commonly in towns than in the country. It has always been a favourite maxim in congreſs to throw the ſtreſs of taxation upon impoſt, and recently on exciſe. Hence, it is likely, that the fifty or ſixty thouſand inhabitants of Philadelphia pay thrice as much
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:033485_0202_0FF721041041ED20"/>
money to government as the four weſtern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Pennſylvania, the ſtates of Vermont, Tenneſſee, and Kentucky collectively. While the legiſlature give ſix hundred and twenty dollars for the fare of Doublehead's horſes<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>The landed intereſt enjoys, indeed, entire aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendany, in the federal government. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, article i. ſection ix. ſays, that <q>no tax or duty ſhall be laid on articles <hi>exported</hi> from any ſtate.</q> Section x. apparently reverſes this article by declaring, that <q>no ſtate ſhall, <hi>without the conſent of congreſs,</hi> lay any impoſts or duties on imports, or <hi>exports,</hi> except what may be abſolutely neceſſary for executing its inſpection laws.</q> By the firſt clauſe, defining the power of congreſs, they are diſabled from lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any duty on <hi>exports.</hi> By the ſecond, they can expreſsly grant a power to individual ſtates of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duties on exports, beyond what is needful for the purpoſe of inſpection. They are authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to give a right, which they dare not exerciſe in their own capacity. But paſſing over this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconſiſtency, the received doctrine is that no duty can be levied on exports. By this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption, the farmers gain an immenſe, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently an unfair advantage. A barrel of flour, or a hogſhead of tobacco, when exported, brings as
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:033485_0203_0FF72106CEE8DD30"/>
clear profit to its owner as a loaf of refined ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; nor is it obvious that there ſhould be a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the right of taxing them. When ſeven or eight hundred thouſand barrels of flour are expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a ſingle year, at the exorbitant price of twelve or fifteen dollars, one ſhould imagine that the farmer might well afford to pay a duty of one dollar per barrel. This claſs reap undiſturbed the profit of an immenſe exportation, while they caſt the burden of public expence almoſt entirely on the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, and conſumers of exports. A land tax has been oppoſed as impracticable to be levied. A du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on exports might be collected without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many revenue officers, and perhaps without the ſmalleſt increaſe of their preſent number.</p>
               <p>From the prodigious advance in the amount of exports, a queſtion has been ſtarted as to the ſcarcity of money, for the two laſt years. Mr. Harper, in his firſt letter to his conſtituents, ſays, p. 21, that <q>it would be very much for our intereſt for Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to remain at war with all Europe, becauſe ſhe and her enemies are obliged to purchaſe our proviſions at <hi>an enormous price,</hi> and our neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity gives us immenſe advantages in <hi>the carrying trade.</hi>
                  </q> If foreign nations could be prevented from ſea-robbery, the United States might certainly derive benefit, though it would be purchaſed on ſhocking conditions. There is a greater advantage to be hoped from it. The contending powers, by the weakening of each other, may, for ſome years, be diſabled from tyrannizing ſo much as they would, perhaps, be otherwiſe diſpoſed to do, over the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs navigation of America. The captures which they have made afford one great reaſon for the decline of credit. This loſs falls chiefly on the mercantile intereſt, and the ſcarcity of caſh is moſt felt in that quarter. With augmented profits, the
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:033485_0204_0FF7210952E33480"/>
farmers have, undoubtedly, much augmented their expence of houſe-keeping. Their demands for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures increaſed conſiderably, at leaſt in ſome parts of the union, during 1796. But beſides, the country holds out an immenſe field for improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it is improving rapidly in ſpite of the alledged ſcarcity of caſh. A man dealing to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of ten thouſand dollars, makes often larger gains, than from turning over only two thouſand; but as his projects frequently augment much faſter than his capital, he very often finds himſelf more ſtraitened than when his expected profits were much ſmaller. The ſpirit of exceſſive land-jobbing on one ſide may turn out as diſtreſſing as that of over-trading on the other. Each diſtemper will, in due time, partly cure itſelf. If matters could be reduced to a proper level, it will be found that there has been rather a diſtortion, and partial miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application, than a diminution of general wealth, which, when matters can be duly tempered and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced, has undoubtedly, within the laſt three years, received ſome increaſe. In every part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the area of cultivated land is hourly augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Every newſpaper announces the formation of additional ſettlements, the planning of roads and bridges, and ſometimes of canals, and though our numbers are daily augmenting, yet every man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with agriculture, finds employment and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. Within the laſt twelve months, land has, indeed, fallen much in its value, and eſpecially in the back countries; but that is becauſe it had been racked beyond its real worth by the dreams of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. That fever is now ſubſiding, and the pulſe of prices, by returning to its former and more ſteady height, promiſes, not a decline of vigour, but the reſtoration of political health. One of our inſolvent land-jobbers, whoſe bills are advertiſed for auction,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:033485_0205_0FF7210AE7099378"/>
and knocked down at a ſhilling or ſix-pence per pound, will, perhaps, tell a creditor, that he is one of the richeſt men in the country; but that the bankruptcies in Europe cauſed the return of his bills under proteſt, and he cannot ſubmit to ſell his lands, at this juncture, when they would not bring one-half of their real value. He, therefore, locks himſelf up, and till the return of better days, bids defiance to juſtice. In this explanation, however, that he gives, there occurs no actual deſtruction of real property, but of that which was imaginary. He obtained immenſe ſums in paper money, which he never could have procured in gold and ſilver. He became entangled with the brokers, at thirty or ſixty per cent. and, in his exploſion, ruined an immenſe number of creditors. Still, however, the land re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. The graſs will grow; the corn will ripen; and the ſoil will, in due time, bring its natural price, juſt as if he and his projects never had exiſted. The ruin of ſo many individuals is a conſiderable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune; but ſtill it is one of that kind from which the country at large, though not the immediate ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, will ſoon recover. The bank of Ayr, in North Britain, which broke near thirty years ago, is a caſe in point. After a ſhort, but rapid progreſs, it ſtopt payment, having granted credit almoſt indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, to every adventurer. To have ſeen the liſts of bankruptcies, and the notices of the ſale of lands, one might have ſuppoſed that the nation was irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemably ruined. Beſides every other ſort of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, land was, within a few years, ſold, to pay the company's debts, to the value of ſeven hundred thouſand pounds ſterling. But amidſt all this alarm, it was not an extinction but only a transference of property. Agriculture continued to extend its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, with more than uſual rapidity; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the wreck of ſo much private credit, the
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:033485_0206_0FF7210C772F5D78"/>
effects were not viſible in the general maſs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. This fact, however unaccountable, was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally remarked at the time; and as the natural reſources of America are infinitely greater than thoſe of North-Britain, ſhe will overcome this embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with ſtill greater facility.</p>
               <p>To haſten this amendment, a check ſhould be given to the enormous extent of paper currency. No expedient appears leſs diſtreſſing to individuals, or more ſimple and expeditions in its operation than to aboliſh all notes under fifty dollars. An inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of time would, no doubt, be granted to prevent too ſudden a jerk in the ſtate of circulation. Some effectual ſteps ought likewiſe to be taken for the ſuppreſſion of uſury. Till that bramble ſhall be grubbed from the roots, all other regulations will be found incomplete, for the recovery of mercan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſoundneſs. This truth is ſo trite as to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in this place with reluctance. But the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of exacting enormous intereſt, has become ſo frequent, and its profeſſors are now ſo numerous, that to give, or to receive thirty per cent. is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as diſgraceful.</p>
               <p>It cannot be too often repeated that till the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant quantity of paper money ſhall be reduced, and till the practice of uſury ſhall alſo be checked, all hopes of being able to manufacture entirely for ourſelves muſt end with diſappointment. The importance of that object has been ſtated in an advertiſement of a late edition of Shakeſpeare, and the following extract merits preſervation. <q>The independence of the United States cannot be ſecure, till we ſhall be much farther removed than at preſent, from the neceſſity of importing the manufactures of Europe. It is ridiculous and humiliating, that we ſhould ſo frequently ſend four thouſand miles for a pair of blankets,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:033485_0207_0FF72112B2AE3E40"/>
a pen-knife, a pſalm-book, and a quire of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. This ſituation, ſo unnatural and abſurd, cannot laſt long, and, the ſooner that we put an end to it, the better. It was the conſtant policy of Britain, to rivet the ſhackles of this country, by ſtrangling in their cradle, her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant manufactures. Chatham, whoſe ſtatue has been erected and demoliſhed in this country, declared, in parliament, that he would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the colonies to manufacture a hob-nail for a horſeſhoe. If this antagoniſt of America, could expreſs himſelf in ſuch language, we know upon what quarter public intereſt calls for exertion. We no longer ſend for hob-nails, becauſe, by a late ingenious invention, we make nails better, quicker, and cheaper than any other people; and we may ſoon expect other diſcoveries of utility.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Of manufactures few deſerve encouragement better than that of paper. But it can never reach maturity, while we continue to import annually from Europe, ſuch immenſe quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of printed books. As paper itſelf is made out of rags, and as this is the only uſe to which they can be put, the price of paper manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in America, is, in a great meaſure, clear gain to the country. This is one reaſon why the erection of paper mills claims patronage from every friend to the United States.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But that is not all. By extending the ſcale of making paper, we may expect to lower its price, and by lowering the price of paper, we encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage another great and moſt uſeful trade, that of printing. The latter, within the laſt ten years, has ariſen in this city from almoſt nothing, to a conſiderable extent. Typography augments the ſtock of public knowledge, and knowledge improves the morals, and ſtimulates the diligence
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:033485_0208_0FF7211469557F48"/>
of the people. So attentive is Britain to her intereſt, in this reſpect, that no book which has ever been printed in that iſland, is allowed to be imported into it. If ſuch a book falls out of print, the nation muſt remain without it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a Britiſh bookſeller ſhall republiſh it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Theſe conſiderations ſhew the propriety of encouraging a publication like ours. It is time that American manufactures ſhould begin to take root, for, in twenty years, we ſhall equal the population of Britain. To promote all kinds of domeſtic induſtry, is the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual method to explode the ſchemes of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign monopoly, and the conſpiracies of Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean deſpotiſm, to invigorate THE POLITICAL PROGRESS of the United States, to extend the baſis of their proſperity, and enſure their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the outſet of this chapter, notice was taken of the attempt to commence an American navy. Such an eſtabliſhment never can ſucceed in this country, to any real purpoſe, till wages are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. The ſame reaſon that retards other manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures will obſtruct that of ſhips, whenever they are to be built at the expence of <hi>government;</hi> or at leaſt of <hi>ſuch</hi> a government as that which we now enjoy. The Treaſurer's Accounts, for 1796<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 6.</note>, mention ſix hundred and ſeventy dollars and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cents to <hi>John Barry, for his pay and ſubſiſtence, as captain of one of the frigates.</hi> This was the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that banditti, who treated members of the legiſlature of Pennſylvania in the manner already deſcribed<note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſtory of 1796, Chap. VII.</note>. To entruſt this man with a public commiſſion was, in itſelf, a mark of diſreſpect to public order. But the riot was perpetrated on the
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:033485_0209_0FF72116024AE230"/>
                  <hi>federal</hi> ſide, and that would have been accepted as an ample excuſe, by his preſent employers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his rabble had burnt the ſtate-houſe. No mortal, excepting a Philadelphian board of admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ever dreamed of paying the captain of a ſhip for three or four years before ſhe was built. This is an undiſguiſed theft of public money; yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>theft</hi> is its only proper name, not one of our repreſentatives has dared to challenge it. The ſalary is nine hundred dollars per annum; and ſuppoſing it held for three years before the launch, then each of our three captains has coſt two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſeven hundred dollars before he had any veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to command. Our executive might as well have caſt theſe eight thouſand one hundred dollars, into the Delaware. The duke of Richmond's tax upon coals is a larger but not a plainer job; nor has the ſalary of Dr. James Meaſe, at Mud Iſland, been more woefully thrown away. From ſuch a ſample the inference is that prodigality has engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted itſelf upon every other part of the expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the eleven hundred thouſand dollars; and that it is imprudent to truſt our exiſting ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers with any money that can be kept out of their hands. Theſe penſions to captains are like an Engliſh county-mark on a ſharper's cheek, which at once unfolds the receſſes of his character. This would have been a powerful anſwer from Mr. Chriſtie, to Meſſrs. Parker and Swanwick's defence of the ſix frigates.</p>
               <p>On June 24th, 1797, Mr. Gallatin ſaid, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, that the building of the frigates would coſt double, and the payment of their ſeamen, almoſt treble of what they would have done in Britain. This is one of the conſequences of an exceſs of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per money. A million of dollars, in 1796, were not, in reality, worth more than ſeven hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:033485_0210_0FF7211887AC3BC0"/>
or thereby, three years before. The altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in value has been ſeverely felt by government. From October 1ſt, 1795, to September 30th, 1796, the charges of the military department amounted to twelve hundred and ſixty-three thouſand dollars. Of this ſum, it is likely that one-third or fourth part would have been ſaved, if flour had not riſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond eight dollars per barrel. If congreſs had been able to lay a duty upon exports, this inconvenience muſt have found a remedy. A duty of three dollars per barrel on exportation was ſure of making flour as much cheaper at home. But at preſent, the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable influence of the landed intereſt overbears every other part of the community. Commerce cannot be protected without a fleet, and yet the farmers, who reap the largeſt ſhare of the benefits of commerce, refuſe even a penny to build one. "You ſhall not tax our exports," ſays the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. "You ſhall not tax our lands," exclaim the farming majority in congreſs. <q>Buy our flour, at double the former price. Enſure and ſhip it. You and the underwriters muſt look to that. If we are paid, it is a matter of indifference in our eyes, whether your veſſels are captured or not. We ſhall not pay for mounting a ſingle tier of guns to protect them.</q> The farmers have treated the merchants with as much ungeneroſity, as the latter have exhibited towards their ſeamen<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtory of 1796, Chap. III.</note>.</p>
               <p>The original object of the frigates was to ſail to the coaſt of Africa, and attack the Algerines. The abſurdity of that plan has already been proved<note n="†" place="bottom">American Annual Regiſter, Chap. III. &amp; IX.</note>; but the inference does not follow, that American commerce can ever be ſecure without a navy. Four material objections occur againſt proceeding, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in the buſineſs. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Government has no
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:033485_0211_0FF7211F807128C0"/>
money, and could not borrow a ſum equal to any ſerious equipment. <hi>Second,</hi> Unleſs there is either a land-tax, or an amendment of the conſtitution, as to taxing of exports, the treaſury muſt always be in a mendicant condition, and incapable to ſupport a navy, though it were built for nothing. <hi>Third,</hi> It is admitted, that the frigates have coſt much more than they ſhould have done, after allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the riſe of wages. Hence, it is diſagreeable to vote money for ſuch bad managers. <hi>Fourth,</hi> If Mr. Adams poſſeſſed a fleet of any tolerable force, he would never be quiet, until he got into ſome quarrel with the French navy. An American ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron is highly needful, but till the ſyſtem of finance has been improved, the plan of building one cannot be ſucceſsful. At the ſame time, till public money ſhall be under more frugal management, it could hardly be adviſeable.</p>
               <p>The following is a ſhort hiſtory of the progreſs and expence of the federal navy. On March 27th, 1794, an act paſt for building four frigates of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four guns, and two of thirty-ſix. A ſecond act of June 9th, 1794, appropriated ſix hundred and eighty-eight thouſand, eight hundred and eighty eight dollars, and eighty two cents <q>to defray the expences which ſhall be incurred, purſuant to</q> that act. This expreſſion is not correct. The former law had likewiſe appointed the number of the crews, their wages and rations; but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation of money, of June 9th, did not extend to theſe articles. It regarded only the charge of building the ſix frigates<note n="*" place="bottom">In the Aurora, of January 18th, 1798, a writer ſays that this ſum comprehended <hi>ſix months proviſions.</hi> I find nothing in the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute book to ſupport ſuch an aſſertion.</note>. The eſtimates of this expence bore an appearance of great exactneſs,
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:033485_0212_0FF67B906D13B028"/>
when they extended to eighty-two odd cents. But notice the ſequel. Early in June, 1794, an act paſt for the equipment of gallies, and that of June 9th, the laſt day of the ſeſſion, appropriated eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand dollars for this uſe. The law for the gallies was ſince repealed, and, on April 20th, 1796, congreſs added the ſum appointed for them to the fund for the frigates. At the ſame time, the latter were reduced from ſix to three, viz. to two of forty-four guns and one of thirty-ſix.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this reduction, an act of March 3d, 1797, granted an hundred and ſeventy-two thouſand additional dollars <q>for finiſhing the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates <hi>United States, Conſtitution,</hi> and <hi>Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
                  </q> beſides five thouſand for the pay and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of three <hi>captains,</hi> and of labourers employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in taking care of the three frigates. An act of July 10th, 1797, aſſigned two hundred thouſand dollars more for completing of theſe frigates.</p>
               <p>The whole ſums appropriated ſtood thus.</p>

               <p>By the firſt eſtimate, ſix frigates were to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted for ſix hundred and eighty-eight thouſand dollars; and, yet with four hundred and fifty-two thouſand as a ſupplement, three were not finiſhed. In the preſent ſeſſion, of November 1797, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thouſand dollars were again aſked.
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:033485_0213_0FF72122A8969C18"/>
Surpriſed by this new demand, Mr. Livingſton brought into the houſe of repreſentatives a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for appointing a committee of enquiry into the expenditure of money, which had been appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated for the naval ſervice.</p>
               <p>The reſolution was taken up on the 15th of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, 1798. Mr. Harper objected to it, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a cenſure on public officers, which was improper; ſince there had not been ſpecified any ground of ſuſpicion againſt them. He ſaid that ſtatements from the public offices were, within a few days, to be laid before the houſe, agreeably to a previous order, and recommended that no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee ſhould be appointed, till theſe papers had been examined. If they did not prove ſatisfactory, he ſhould vote for enquiry.</p>
               <p>Mr. Livingſton replied that the patience of the houſe had been worn out by theſe repeated appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for money. The expence had exceeded all belief. The moſt extenſive imagination could not have conceived an amount like that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs had, from time to time, been blindly led to appropriate. The ſtatements expected, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to by Mr. Harper, came down only to Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 1ſt, 1797. They could not, therefore, even if the houſe had them, give adequate ſatisfaction. The three hundred and ſeventy-two thouſand dollars granted ſince January 1ſt, 1797, and the demand now made, did not come within the period of theſe papers. This was the main ſcope of Mr. Livingſton's obſervations. The reſolution paſt, and a committee were appointed.</p>
               <p>Next day, January 16th, 1798, ſome documents from the war-office were laid before the houſe. Inſtead of an hundred and fifty thouſand dollars, the ſum formerly applied for, only an hundred and fifteen thouſand, eight hundred and thirty-three
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:033485_0214_0FF72125DE65C8B8"/>

               <p>By the computation of March, 1794, each of the ſix frigates was to coſt a fraction leſs than one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifteen thouſand dollars. By the actual iſſue, in January, 1798, each of theſe three ſhips that were to be completed, will coſt, as above ſpecified, an overplus of an hundred and eighty-nine thouſand dollars. This makes, upon a medium for each frigate, three hundred and four thouſand dollars, inſtead of the original eſtimate of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifteen thouſand.</p>
               <p>Three ſhips are not to be finiſhed. The materials muſt either be ſold or laid up. It is natural to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that a conſiderable part of them would be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the completion of the other three veſſels. Hence the real coſt of the latter will exceed three hundred and four thouſand dollars each, as trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on more than their proportion of the materials, bought with the original ſix hundred and eighty-eight thouſand dollars. In a word, it may ſafely be affirmed, that the <hi>United States,</hi> and her two ſiſters, have required thrice as much money as they were expected to coſt; and double the ſum for which an architect on the river Thames would have built them. Almoſt four years have been occupied, and this American armada is not yet completed.</p>
               <p>In 1794, when the plan was firſt adopted, Dr.
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:033485_0215_0FF7212A5D4EEE00"/>
Smith, and his friends, affirmed, that the frigates might be built, manned, and blockading the ſtreights of Gibraltar, within a year. At the end of <hi>two</hi> years, the preſident informed congreſs, that ſome of their keels were laid, and ſome of their ſtern-poſts raiſed, all <hi>in the beſt manner.</hi> So ſkilful were the calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Dr. Smith, and ſo rapid the progreſs of our admiralty! The above documents, of January 16th, eſtimate the pay and ſubſiſtence of the officers and crews for a year, at two hundred and eighty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, three hundred and ſeventy-nine dollars. Thus, the total ſum wanted immediately, amounts to three hundred and ninety-ſix thouſand, two hundred and twelve dollars.</p>
               <p>This money can only be raiſed by loan; and, in the fullneſs of time, the intereſt of that loan muſt alſo be borrowed. On July 6th, 1797, an act paſt for a ſtamp duty on vellum, parchment, and paper. But ſuch an uproar has been excited againſt it, that, in the preſent ſeſſion, the operation of the law has been ſuſpended until the firſt of July next. On July 8th, when a number of repreſentatives had gone to the country, an act paſt for an additional duty on ſalt. It originated in the diligence of Dr. Smith. A reſolution is, at preſent, before congreſs for the repeal both of theſe ſalt <note n="*" place="bottom">In the ſeſſion of December, 1796, Mr. Findley told the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives that, before leaving the weſtern country, he had paid fix guineas for ſix buſhels of ſalt. In that part of Pennſylvania, it is ſaid to have ſometimes coſt eight dollars per buſhel.</note> and ſtamp duties. They were the only taxes laid in the firſt ſeſſion of the fifth congreſs, and they are moſt likely to be repealed <note n="†" place="bottom">The exciſe on refined ſugar ought to ſhare the ſame fate.</note>. In the preceeding ſeſſion, although the want of money was ſtrongly urged, no more than two ſtatutes of taxation were paſt. The one laid an additional duty on certain imported articles. The
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:033485_0216_0FF7212BEBCD5548"/>
other altered the mode of exciſing ſtills. If they produce any augmentation whatever, of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, it can be but trifling. In the interim, the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of trade enſures an immenſe mutilation of impoſt duties, for 1797. We ſhall ſoon ſee the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in a report from the treaſury.</p>
               <p>The expences of government are in a ſtate of conſtant augmentation. The abortive efforts of the two laſt ſeſſions prove, that its practical ſources of new revenue are almoſt exhauſted. When expence uniformly exceeds income, the reſult is known. In the event of a French war, the ruin of commerce would enſure an annual <hi>deficit,</hi> at the treaſury, of ſeveral millions of dollars. The intereſt of the national debt could no longer be paid; and bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy muſt, of courſe, enſue. Yet, in ſummer laſt, penſioner Harper told congreſs that, <q>if we threw our ſword into the Britiſh ſcale, the French would <hi>kick the beam!</hi>
                  </q> America can be but a cracker at the tail of England's exploſion. Mr. Allen, in the ſame ſeſſion, declared, that, <q>if France obtained Louiſiana from Spain, we ought to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare war</hi> againſt the republic.</q> He did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the houſe on what right he reſted their claim to direct Spain in the diſpoſal of her colonies. On the ſame ground, if congreſs were to aſſign Rhode-Iſland, or Nantucket, to the Dutch, England, or Sweden, would be warranted in commencing hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities againſt this country. We need not ſtartle at jacobin rapacity, or the partition of Poland, or the Britiſh in the Old Jerſey, or the Dutch at Amboyna, or Titus at Jeruſalem, when one of <hi>our own</hi> ineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timable repreſentatives recommends a project the hermaphrodite offspring of Newgate and of bedlam. It is time to ſpeak diſtinctly, when a few lunatics or traitors have brought this continent to the brink of a French war, that is, to the brink of perdition.

In three months after it ſhall begin, the value of ground property, in Philadelphia, will ſink to fifty per cent. of its preſent value.</p>
               <p>Another ſure conſequence muſt be the breaking up of the union. Kentucky and Tenneſſee have been long and juſtly exaſperated at the Hamiltonian ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of defending the frontiers. The approaching cloſe of this volume does not leave room for inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an inveſtigation of that amazing buſineſs<note n="*" place="bottom">A paper on this head is ready for the preſs, and will appear at an early opportunity.</note>. Many tyrants have want only murdered their ſubjects; but the Waſhington cabinet exhibits the firſt example in hiſtory, of a government, that will neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend its people, nor ſuffer them to defend themſelves. On the Atlantic ſide of the continent, this ſubject is as groſsly miſapprehended, as the weſtern expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hitherto has been. Kentucky and Tenneſſee are in a rapid progreſs of population<note n="†" place="bottom">In 1796, twenty-two thouſand white people, and eleven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand blacks, emigrated into the weſtern part of Tenneſſee. They had to croſs Cumberland river by two ferries, at which an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was kept of their numbers. I had this from Mr. Andrew Jackſon, one of the ſenators from that ſtate, in the preſent congreſs. He computes the total amount of emigrants, in 1796, at between forty and fifty thouſand.</note>. They know the real cauſe which retards the execution of the Spaniſh treaty, and the ſetting open of the weſtern waters. France is enraged at the compact with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. She ſways, with irreſiſtable weight, in the court of Madrid; and the treaty with Spain will never be fulfilled, till that with England has been modified or diſſolved. The ſouth-weſtern citizens regard a free navigation as the chief object of their wiſhes. The republic, by the medium of Spain, has only to hold out this temptation, as the ſignal of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt. The Philadelphians would not conſent to ſhut up the Delaware, for the ſake of protracting their
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:033485_0218_0FF7212F2E3BA5C8"/>
union with Kentucky. They cannot require that ſelf-denial which they would not exert.</p>
               <p>By the calculation, above inſerted, of three times the original eſtimate of the three frigates, the final outfit of each of them comes to three hundred and forty-five thouſand dollars, or in whole to one million and thirty-five thouſand dollars. They carry an hundred and twenty-four guns, which thus coſt, within a minute fraction, eight thouſand three hundred and forty-ſix dollars, and three fourths, per gun. In ſterling money this amounts to eighteen hundred and ſeventy-eight pounds, eight ſhillings and four-pence halfpenny. In Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the common computation for every gun, is a thouſand pounds, including ſtores for ſix months. Theſe do not come within the above American eſtimate; ſo that England can ſend a ſhip to ſea, at half our charge. Yet, from the decline of ſhip-building, in conſequence of Jay's treaty, wages are, at this time, comparatively low. The current wages of American ſeamen are thirty dollars per month; a rate unheard of in the French or Engliſh ſervice. With ſuch an odds of expence againſt the United States, it is needleſs to think of a navy.</p>
               <p>Indians have been ſpoke of in this chapter. On January 18th, 1798, an eſtimate was laid before the repreſentatives of the charges of a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed treaty with the Cherokees. The whole ſum amounts to twenty-five thouſand, eight hundred and eighty dollars. This includes fifteen thouſand dollars for rations to <hi>two thouſand</hi> Indians; and five thouſand dollars for preſents. It muſt be obſerved that theſe Indians, as well as the Creeks, have never kept a ſingle agreement made with them. Their perfidy is equal to their cruelty. If a new treaty is to be framed, there can be no uſe for the preſence of two thouſand ſavages. Two
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:033485_0219_0FF7213582CC08B0"/>
hundred are ſufficient; and this would ſave thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand five hundred dollars. The ſums an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually waſted on theſe people are very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It is time to try another way of <hi>treating.</hi> Offer an hundred dollars per ſcalp for the firſt three hundred Cherokee warriors, who ſhall be cut, or ſhot down. The ſouth-weſtern riflemen will ſoon earn the money. This may be called inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But if one of theſe Indians had ſtabbed your father, and ſtuck the hearts of your children, on the point of his ſcalping knife, perhaps you might endure the propoſal. Government is afraid of a frontier militia. Were the rampart of ſavages removed, thouſands of families would inſtantly wander beyond the reach of cuſtoms and exciſe. The preſident and ſenate, ſupported by a party of repreſentatives, chuſe rather to give the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans every poſſible meaſure of countenance and protection, to expend very large ſums of money in the purchaſe of treaties that are ſure to be broken, and to connive at ſome hundreds of annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al murders.</p>
               <p>Our preſent political aſpect does not promiſe much. It combines the helpleſsneſs of infancy with the decrepitude of age; the feebleneſs of a young government without its alledged purity, and the corruption of an old one, without its readineſs of reſources. The world never ſaw a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated ſcene of weakneſs, ignorance, and folly, than that now diſplayed in the United States. The preſident, on May 16th, 1797, delivers a ſpeech againſt France, that is only juſt leſs than a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of war. In the ſame moment, he pretends to deſire a peace with the French. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he ſends back to Paris Pinckney, the very man who had juſt quarrelled with the directory, and who, by his obſtinacy and impertinence, had
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:033485_0220_0FF721370FB0FF90"/>
forced them to thruſt him out of their territories. To cut up all chance of future confidence between the two governments, Mr. Adams ſuffers, or invites congreſs to print Pinckney's confidential correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The repreſentatives deſire a liſt of French and Britiſh depredations. Meſſrs.

               <p>In Mr. Fenno's paper, of January 10th, 1798, a writer ſpeaks of <q>nine hundred and fifty millions

The conſtitution begins in theſe words: "We the people of the United States, do ordain," &amp;c. ſo that the deſign was evidently democratical.

               <p>If the French have become our enemies, this ariſes from the mean, pedlar-like ſpirit of our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. Their <hi>actual ſtate</hi> is certainly different from ours. France is the terror, and the United States are the contempt of Europe. Their friendſhip is univerſally courted, and ours univerſally deſpiſed. In confidence that the republic would be overtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, America haſted to deſert her benefactreſs. By an eventual and offenſive treaty, ſhe guaranteed the French dominions, at a period when, but for the ſake of form, her guarantee was not worth acceptance. In 1794, ſhe could not fulfil the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations of 1778; but, to prove that her ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude was equal to her weakneſs, ſhe inverted them. Jay's treaty compriſes a multitude of conditions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the republic. The plan of this agreement was made by Mr. Waſhington, in April, 1794. At
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:033485_0222_0FF7213CD19FDF10"/>
that time France, like Caeſar at Munda, contended not for empire, but exiſtence. Admit that this compact, if it had been faithfully fulfilled, was beneficial to the mercantile intereſt of America.

I have liſtened to, and repeated, thoſe fairy tales myſelf. It is a <hi>dream!</hi>
                  </q> Theſe are the manly ſentiments propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by our executive. They imply an expreſs cenſure of the American revolution, which attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to overturn tyranny, but only half completed its deſign. The party who at preſent hold the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, found means to ſaddle America with a debt which daily grows larger; and they have now taken the ground and the doctrines of George the third.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fenno pronounces, that, to attempt the improvement of ſociety, by deſtroying tyranny and ſuperſtition, is a fairy tale and a dream. The mind cannot conceive, nor can language ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, a more hateful maxim. Candour will place no confidence in a party capable of inculcating ſuch opinions. As for the attack on France, it chimes in uniſon with the two ſpeeches of preſident Adams.

A few extracts from the firſt of theſe productions will prove this to be true. In that of May 16th, 1797, he ſpeaks thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The refuſal, on the part of France, to receive our miniſter, is, then, the denial of a right; but the refuſal to receive him until we have acceded to their demands, without diſcuſſion, is to treat us neither as allies nor as friends, nor as a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign people.</q>—As for the matter of <hi>right,</hi> Vat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel contradicts Mr. Adams<note n="*" place="bottom">See the ſpeech of Mr. Freeman, in the ſequel of this chapter.</note>. General Waſhington refuſed to open a letter from lord Howe; and the old congreſs would not treat with Carliſle, and the reſt of North's commiſſioners. Citizen Adet had attempted to negociate at Philadelphia. He was treated with neglect, and Mr. Adams and his friends encouraged a Britiſh agent to lampoon him. As for <hi>allies</hi> or <hi>friends,</hi> the United States had no claim to either title. Jay's treaty put an end to it.</p>
               <p>Again.—<q>There is reaſon to believe, that the executive directory paſt a decree, on the 2d of March laſt, contravening, in part, the treaty of amity and commerce of 1778, injurious to our lawful commerce, and endangering the lives of our citizens.</q> They acted only in ſelf-defence. This decree is fully explained in the next chapter. The Britiſh were then, and are ſtill ſeizing Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſhips, and preſſing their ſeamen; but Mr. Adams paſſes over that.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Endeavours have been employed to eſtabliſh and foſter a diviſion between the government and people of the United States.

               <p>But Mr. Adams refers not to theſe gentry, for they are his intimate friends. He alludes to the ſpeech of Barras, as alarming; though this trifle could make no more impreſſion on the public mind of America, than a piſtol-ball on the baſtions of Luxembourg. The ſuppoſition, that it was to have a dangerous effect here, betrays groſs affectation, hypocriſy, and impoſture. The people of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try care very little about two or three ſentences of a ſpeech delivered in Paris. But, if Barras was able to do ſo much miſchief, the preſident ought to have ſuppreſſed the ſarcaſm. <hi>Mortui non mordent.</hi> It could do no harm, if we heard nothing about it. If a previous tranſlation had eſcaped into the Aurora, a fortnight muſt have ſunk it in forgetfulneſs. But the point with Mr. Adams was to make a buſtle, in order to make a quarrel. This is the plain truth. Mr. Adams may yet hear of a ſpeech from Barras, that ſhall make both him and congreſs tremble.</p>
               <p>"It muſt not be permitted to be doubted," ſays he, <q>whether the people of the United States will ſupport the government, eſtabliſhed by their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary conſent, and appointed by their free choice.</q> True. But if they ſee that government evidently driving them into a ruinous war, without taking any one rational ſtep to ſhun it, they will not be tardy in making their importance felt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams then pledges himſelf to ſupport the Britiſh treaty. <q>Convinced that the conduct of the government has been juſt and impartial to foreign nations,—nothing will ever be done by me to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the national engagements; to innovate upon principles, which have been ſo deliberately and
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:033485_0226_0FF7214673D93950"/>
uprightly eſtabliſhed; or to ſurrender, in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the rights of the government.</q> As the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact was made for fear of an Engliſh war, it may ſuitably be repealed for fear of a French one. The purport of this bouncing paſſage is to aſſure the French, that they have no chance for conceſſions from the United States, if Mr. Adams can diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them.</p>
               <p>In one of his letters, publiſhed by congreſs, Charles Pinckney, when ſpeaking of his diſmiſſion by the directory, puts this queſtion. <q>You will judge whether <hi>the anſwer of the Senate and the houſe of repreſentatives to the preſident's ſpeech</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">On the 7th of December, 1796.</note>, and the late ſucceſſes in Italy, have not concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to occaſion it<note n="†" place="bottom">Documents p. 62.</note>?</q> The anſwers were only an echo to the ſpeech itſelf, which was quite as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory as them. But the envoy, in a letter to the ſecretary, could not with politeneſs, include that ſacred performance<note n="‡" place="bottom">The infallibility of general Waſhington is a doctrine ſtarted ſince the war. At one period of the revolution, he was on the point of being ſuperceded, as commander in chief, by the talents and popularity of governor Mifflin.</note> among the cauſes of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritation. This notice of the tendency of ſuch addreſſes and ſpeeches, on the minds of the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, might have made Mr. Adams cautious in what way he conveyed his ſentiments to congreſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fenno's gazette of January 18th, 1798, has this paſſage. <q>Like the Romans, whom they (the French) imitate, war and rapine are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to their exiſtence.—If England is not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by internal faction, ſhe will be able to keep the MONSTERS <hi>in their den,</hi> until they devour each other.</q> This writer has forgot the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked conſpiracy of Pilnitz, by which the <hi>crowned heads</hi> were to revive in France the tragedy of
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:033485_0227_0FF7214C0542D8F8"/>
Poland. He has forgot that the duke of Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick menaced Paris, and its eight hundred thouſand inhabitants, with military execution.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams affects to deſire a peace with France. The perſon who believes him is completely diveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of common ſenſe. Look at the ſtile of his own newſpaper. No farther evidence can be wanted. Pitch a barrel of tar into a bonfire, and ſay that you intend to extinguiſh it. Such is the picture of ſomebody. This old man cannot deſcend to the grave in peace, till he has entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled his conſtituents in a war that muſt put an end to the government of the country, and replunge her into the horrors of 1780. Theſe are our thanks for twenty-five thouſand dollars a year, for eminence, adulation, and immeaſurable patronage. For the complete model of depravity, why ſhould we refer to another world? Can a fallen angel be as baſe as man?</p>
               <p>In Mr. Pickering's letter to Pinckney, p 91, he ſpeaks thus of citizen Adet. <q>After an exhibition of complaints in a ſtile ſo exceptionable, he could add but one more <hi>improper act,</hi> that of publiſhing his notes in the newſpapers: he had ſcarcely tranſmitted them to the executive before he <hi>forwarded them to the printer for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication.</hi>
                  </q> Mr. Pickering here complains of Adet for his precipitate appeal to the preſs. Granting, what is untrue, that the envoy acted wrong, Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering did an offence againſt the directory of the ſame kind. This letter to Pinckney at Paris bears date the 16th of January, 1796. A copy of it was, on the 19th, ſent by the preſident to congreſs, by them inſtantly to the preſs, and of courſe to the newſpapers. It was fit that congreſs ſhould be acquainted with the letter, but its publication was a ſtill greater affront upon the directory than the
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:033485_0228_0FF7214D935FD6C0"/>
printing of Adet's notes was upon Pickering. The Frenchman did not ſend his pieces to the preſs till they had reached their place of deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This was a degree of politeneſs neglected by Mr. Pickering.</p>
               <p>It will be anſwered, that when the preſident ſent the papers to congreſs, he did not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the repreſentatives would print them, and that they had a right of doing ſo. When a fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate is to be built, or a ſhip to be freighted with ammunition, for the dey of Algiers, a preſident knows in what way to communicate with the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, and yet to prevent his papers from being expoſed to the public eye. The federal repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives ſupport a due underſtanding with the executive; and unleſs they had known that the publication would be acceptable to him, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Mr. Pickering's letter would have been kept ſecret.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pinckney obſerves, that the French <q>wiſh to deſtroy the trade of Great Britain, and they look upon us as one of her beſt cuſtomers, and, to obtain their object, <hi>they care not what we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Documents, p. 63.</note>.</q> This may be very true, but it comes to a plain declaration that the French are intereſted and faithleſs, while the publication permitted by the preſident implies that the remark enjoys his approbation. There is particular reaſon to believe that Rufus King hath tranſmitted to our executive moſt unfavourable accounts of England. But not a word of them tranſpires from the cabinet. The truth of Pinckney's obſervation would not juſtify its publication. If every man were to tell exactly what he thinks of each of his acquaintances, ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety would be transformed into a bear-garden, and
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:033485_0229_0FF67B921A05B670"/>
the field of diplomacy into a field of battle. On the plain ſcore of diſcretion and civility, it will be difficult to defend the meaſures of Meſſrs. Adams and Pickering towards the French nation. Theſe remarks explain the degree of merit in our execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Let us now, in a ſlight ſketch, examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther congreſs itſelf acted better.</p>
               <p>The two houſes met on May 15th, 1797. The ſpeech was made on the 16th. The ſenate did not preſent their anſwer till the 24th. Thus, upon this trifle, they ſpent eight days, and twelve or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred dollars worth of their time. They might have made a proper anſwer in fifteen minutes. <q>We learn, ſay they, with ſincere concern, that attempts are in operation to alienate the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our fellow citizens from their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Attempt, ſo wicked, wherever they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, cannot fail to excite our <hi>utmoſt abhorrence.</hi>
                  </q> They muſt ſurely then have abhorred their own printer, Mr. John Fenno, for calling the preceding houſe of repreſentatives a many-headed <hi>monſter.</hi> The ſpeech of Barras was made at a diſtance; and, before they went ſo far in queſt of affronts offered to this government, the ſenate ſhould have ſilenced this organ of diſcontent, for it was ten thouſand times louder than the French directory. The anſwer of the ſenate was dull and toad-eating, but much leſs faulty than the one reported on May 22d, from the ſelect committee; and which, with a few ſlight alterations, was ultimately preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This committee conſiſted of five members. The majority, Mr. Kittera, Mr. Rutledge, and Mr. Griſwold, were truly federal.</p>
               <p>Their report was as complaiſant to the ſpeech as Mr. Adams could deſire it to be.—<q>While we view with ſatisfaction the wiſdom, dignity, and moderation, which have marked the meaſures of
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:033485_0230_0FF7214F89B70B98"/>
the ſupreme executive of our country, in its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to remove, by candid explanations, the complaints and jealouſies of France, we feel the full force of that indignity which has been offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our country, in <hi>the rejection of its miniſter.</hi>
                  </q> The law of nations, as laid down by Dr. Hutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, gave the French a right of ſending Pinckney out of their territories; and his own letters ſhew, that, while he remained in Paris, he proved an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory and dangerous reſident. The ſelect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee will not certainly pretend, that the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory were obliged to read and anſwer any papers that Mr. Pinckney might wiſh to preſent. They were to be maſters of their own time. They had already, by citizen Adet, explained, as far as they thought neceſſary, their demands upon America. If Mr. Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera becomes tired of a correſpondent, he will think himſelf at liberty to return his letters unopened.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the rejection of our miniſter; but put the caſe that he had been actually received. A hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in the pay of an Engliſh agent, is next ordered to write pamphlets againſt him; and, among other epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets, to call him <hi>an unprincipled bully; a gaſconading impudent bluff;</hi> and <hi>a dog</hi>

               <p>Mr. Pinckney would be worſe uſed, by permiſſion to reſide in Paris, under ſuch circumſtances, than by a direct diſmiſſal. A man of ſpirit would prefer the latter. The above was preciſely the ſituation of Adet. in Philadelphia. Hence, our complaint, as to the rejection of Pinckney, betrayed the utmoſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs or ſtupidity. The report next promiſes to convince the world <q>that we are not a <hi>degraded</hi> people.</q> In reſpect to foreign envoys, we have degraded ourſelves.

               <p>
                  <q>Knowing, as we do, adds the report, the confidence repoſed by the United States in their government, we cannot heſitate in expreſſing our indignation,</q> &amp;c. This relates to Barras, a topic-already worn to tatters. As for <hi>confidence,</hi> it is now, on the part of the republicans, at an end. On the acceſſion of Mr. Adams, they were very well diſpoſed to live on good terms with him. Moſt of them were ignorant of his correſpondence with ſir John Scott. Several of his late oppoſers declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their belief of his being an honeſt man, and that he had too much ſpirit to be led by any party. With great candour and propriety, Mr. Bache refuſed to admit remarks unfavourable to Mr Adams. <q>Let us give him a fair trial,</q> ſaid this editor, to one of his correſpondents, <q>and then, if he actually does wrong, our cenſures will fall with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weight.</q> The Aurora was, accordingly, crammed, for ſome time, with encomiums on Mr.

Adams, deduced from the profeſſions of republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caniſm that he made in ſome ſpeeches. For conduct ſo full of juſtice and of good nature, Mr. Bache has been ſince upbraided in the ſix per cent. newſpapers. From the 16th of May, 1797, downwards, Mr. Bache firmly believed, that Mr. Adams was only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>They proceed to ſay, that <q>fully impreſſed with the uncertainty of the reſult, we ſhall prepare to meet, with fortitude, any unfavourable events which may occur, with all the ſkill we poſſeſs, and all the efforts in our power.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On this report, Mr. Nicholas, in ſtrong terms, recommended a conciliating ſtile. Upon the anſwer, about to be given, the peace of the United States might, in a great meaſure, depend. He propoſed an amendment, which was, upon the whole, proper. Yet it had this expreſſion. <q>The rejecting of our miniſter, and the manner of diſmiſſing him from the territories of France, have excited our <hi>warmeſt ſenſibility.</hi>
                  </q> This complaint might have been ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Mr. Nicholas, in his ſpeech, alſo ſaid, that <q>he hoped, on this occaſion, they ſhould get rid of that irritation, which <hi>injury</hi> naturally produced in the mind. He declared, that he felt for the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult</hi> which had been offered to Mr. Pinckney; and he felt more for him, from the <hi>dignity</hi> with which he had borne it, and which had proved him to be <hi>a proper character for the embaſſy.</hi>
                  </q> A rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſuſpicion may be entertained that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable member expreſſed more ſtrongly than he
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:033485_0233_0FF721588DD42940"/>
felt. He ſaw that the Britiſh party were very ſtrong in the houſe, and that direct oppoſition to the main principle of the addreſs would be hopeleſs. But ſuch half-way declarations, although ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient within doors, have a tendency to miſlead the public at large. Mr. Nicholas, indeed, after far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compliments on Mr. Pinckney, and his <hi>good temper,</hi> 
                  <q>confeſſed, that the buſineſs did not ſtrike him with <hi>all</hi> the force with which it ſeemed to have impreſſed the mind of that reſpectable character.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Nicholas added, that <q>he conſidered the anſwer, reported to them, as going to decide the queſtion of <hi>peace</hi> or <hi>war</hi> for this country. He thought it a thing of that ſort, which might have the worſt poſſible effect, and could have no good effect. It might tend to irritate, to prevent any ſort of enquiry or ſettlement taking place, but it could not tend towards an adjuſtment of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.—We are condemning the French govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe they aſk for redreſs, without liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to negociation; yet we ſay to them, <hi>we</hi> are right; you have no cauſe to complain.</q> Mr. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas ſhewed the inconſiſtency of this prejudging tone. He ſtated, by the way, that the houſe had the ſtrongeſt proofs, even the declaration of an Engliſh governor, that, in caſe of ſucceſs againſt France, England had deſigned to declare war againſt Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. The ſpeech, with a ſmall exception, was commendable.</p>
               <p>Dr. William Smith roſe next. He entered into the feelings of Mr. Pinckney, and the <hi>injurious</hi> treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he had received from De la Croix and the directory. He then took a ſurvey of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Britiſh treaty. "The gentlemen," ſaid he, <q>tell us we are feeble. They know that we are <hi>not</hi> feeble; and that, if occaſion calls us forth,
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:033485_0234_0FF7215B32A4B8C0"/>
we ſhall be found able to defend ourſelves.</q> The United States have the greateſt natural reſources for defence by land, and for attack by ſea. But as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment neither has money, nor can tell where to get any important ſum, a war would run the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt riſk of overturning it. This diſablity of raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſh ariſes from the half-crown certificates, the bungling aſſumption act, and the deluge of bank notes. The doctor had, no doubt, by this time, a preſcience of his embaſſy to Portugal. Yet he might have reflected that ſix months of a French war would ſink the ſtocks to thirty per cent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Freeman read a long paſſage from Vatel. The ſubſtance of it was, that nations were not obliged to receive a perpetual ſucceſſion of foreign miniſters, when there was nothing particular to be negociated. They might be allowed to meet ſuch envoys upon the frontiers, to receive their meſſage, and diſmiſs them, without once permitting them to enter upon the territory of the nation to which they were ſent. Vatel added, that republics, in particular, might have very good reaſons for not chooſing to permit an ambaſſador to reſide among them; becauſe, ſuch a character was frequently employed to excite diſcontent among the citizens. Thus he agrees exactly with the law of nations, as already cited from Hutcheſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Supra Chapter VIII.</note>. Mr. Freeman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the recent diſmiſſion, by the directory, of thirteen other miniſters. This ſhewed that no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular indignity had been offered to the United States.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles moved that the committee of the whole houſe ſhould riſe, in order to refer the report, and amendment by Mr. Nicholas, back to the ſelect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="unknown:033485_0235_0FF7215CC87E7FE0"/>This propoſal was objected to, with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. At that part of the debate, Mr. Otis made his maiden ſpeech. A few extracts ſhall be given from a copy of it written by himſelf.—<q>His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents, and himſelf, were diſpoſed to regard the inhabitants of the ſouthern ſtates as <hi>brothers.</hi>
                  </q> [The party who ſent Mr. Otis to congreſs, take every opening to calumniate the ſouthern ſtates. To ſpeak plainly, the reaſons are as follows. <hi>Firſt,</hi> At the time of funding the national debt, moſt of the ſouthern repreſentatives, reſiſted the ſtock-jobbing views of eaſtern members. <hi>Second,</hi> If the Virginians could obtain an aſcendency in the two houſes, it is likely that they would proceed to tax the public ſtocks, and to lay an impreſſive ſtamp duty on bank notes. If their plan of paying the national debt had been adopted, Dr. Smith, and Mr. Hillhouſe, would have only got the ten-pence or half-crown per pound, which they actually paid for certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates. Thus twenty or thirty millions of dollars might have been ſaved. Seven years ago, four mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of dollars were ſufficient for building ten ſhips of the line, and twenty frigates<note n="*" place="bottom">In 1794, the ſix frigates were expected to be built for ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninety thouſand dollars; and in 1790, they could probably have been built for that ſum. Allow then, an hundred thouſand dollars each, for twenty frigates, and two hundred thouſand dollars each, for ten ſhips of the line. This makes up the four millions.</note>. This force, ready to be ſupported by three hundred privateers, would have compelled either France or England to look, like Pompey, both before and behind them, previous to their moleſting an American merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But inſtead of a commanding navy, and a commerce invulnerable in every corner of the globe<note n="†" place="bottom">Still it muſt be obſerved, that nothing but an Algerine treaty could enſure our trade in the Mediterranean.</note>, the United States have a regiment of credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, with doctor William Smith at their head,
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:033485_0236_0FF721605A378C40"/>
feaſting on the public revenue, and receiving ſixty, eighty, or an hundred per cent. for the real ſums that they advanced. While this is the caſe, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walk five miles in any inhabited diſtrict of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, without meeting ſome one who will tell that he was formerly half beggared by the exploſion of congreſs paper money. His claim on government is eight or ten times juſter than that of Sedgwick or William Smith, yet he gets not a ſingle cent. They receive twenty ſhillings per pound, while he, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly with a wooden leg, or a palſy, earned in the ſervice, muſt pay taxes to defray the demands of theſe creditors, who ſat in congreſs, and voted themſelves into opulence, at the expence of their fellow citizens. This is the ſort of people under whoſe banner Mr. Otis hath enliſted. His ſpeech proceeds thus:]</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The injuries ſuſtained by us were of a high and atrocious nature, conſiſting in the capture of our veſſels, depredations upon the property and perſons of our citizens, the indignity offered to our miniſter; but what was more aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating than the reſt, was, the profeſſed deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination not to receive our miniſter until the complaints of the French ſhould be redreſſed, without explanation and without exception; until we ſhould violate treaties, repeal laws, and do what the conſtitution would not authoriſe, vacate ſolemn judgments of our courts of law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This extract ſhall have a full anſwer. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the Britiſh treaty, it was an injury of a high and atrocious nature towards France. It contravened our previous treaty with her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides an hundred other writers, Mr. Dallas, in his <hi>Features,</hi> has clearly proved this point. With a general reference to that pamphlet, Part V. one or two inſtances are here inſerted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="unknown:033485_0237_0FF72162E9BBB740"/>By the eleventh<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Dallas, by miſtake, cites it as the ninth.</note> article of the treaty of alliance between Louis XVI. and the United States, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter guarantee to the former <q>the preſent poſſeſſions of the crown of France in America, as well as thoſe which it may acquire by the future treaty of peace.</q> The king, on his part, guarantees the territories of the United States. The federal party have ſpent thouſands of pages to prove that America owes nothing to France, on the ſcore of gratitude, which was excluſively due to the king himſelf. Nay ſome of them have alledged that the treaties between the two countries were voided by the diſſolution of the monarchy. If the latter poſition is true, France cannot be blamed <hi>for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obligations that ceaſe to exiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alexander Hamilton, in his long-winded letters of <hi>Pacificus,</hi> argues that the guarantee became void, becauſe the treaty was entitled not <hi>offenſive</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, but only <hi>eventual</hi> and defenſive; and as the French were the firſt to declare war againſt Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, hence they were the <hi>offenſive</hi> party, and the guarantee expired, at leaſt for this time. Such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be his inference.</p>
               <p>If this was the view of the treaty, it ſhould have been ſo expreſſed. But the twelfth article, though explanatory, makes no diſtinction, and the concluſion ought to be that the two powers never once thought of it. The guarantee is in <hi>general terms.</hi> If we forbear to guarantee the French Weſt-Indies, we ſhould certainly not aſſiſt England in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking them. If the treaty had any ſignification whatever, this was implied in it, for its whole avowed object was <hi>to reſiſt Britain.</hi> Without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions from the United States, the Engliſh could not have attacked Martinique, or Guadaloupe.
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:033485_0238_0FF72166496B31A0"/>
Every barrel of pork or flour ſhipped from this continent to the Britiſh Weſt-Indies, was as clearly aſſiſting England againſt France, as if we had ſent our three frigates. A ſuſpenſion of ſhipping provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions would have entirely prevented Engliſh military operations, and have ſtarved the Engliſh iſlands. This was to render to France a very important ſervice; and, being merely of the negative kind, it furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to England no pretence for hoſtilities.</p>
               <p>It will be ſaid that ſuch a prohibition was to <hi>ſacrifice commerce.</hi> Every guarantee implies a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. If a man is never to fulfil a treaty, when it croſſes his perſonal intereſt, it is entirely uſeleſs to make treaties. By ſtepping forward in this way, America could have ſhewed that ſhe was not, what ſhe now is, the mere anvil of the belligerent world. To ſave her Weſt-Indies, England could not have helped acceding to a peace; while, placed upon an iſthmus, between the oppoſite tides of hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, America might, in ſome meaſure, have dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the terms of an agreement. By doing nothing, by a mere act of negation, ſhe was to have done every thing. By an embargo againſt England, for only four months, America could not have loſt more than five or ſix millions of dollars, and very probably not half that ſum. The whole exports of 1793, came only to twenty-ſix millions of dollars; and, on a medium, thoſe of four months, came to leſs than nine millions. Of theſe nine millions a great part did not conſiſt of proviſions. Such were cotton, indigo, and fifty-nine thouſand nine hundred and forty-ſeven hogſheads of tobacco. Of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions various kinds, as pork and beef, were in no danger of ſpoiling. Much of the flour would have been exported, with other vivres, to the Weſt-Indies, in French bottoms. Much of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der could have been kept without ſuffering damage.
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:033485_0239_0FF72167E05ABED0"/>
Putting theſe matters together, it will be ſeen that, by four months of patience and fidelity, and at the loſs, comparatively ſmall, of one, two, or three millions of dollars, America might have preſerved her character, along with French amity. She had only to prohibit every American or foreign veſſel from exporting proviſions, with the ſingle exception of France. At preſent, the republic may, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar language, explain herſelf thus. You pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to help me in defending my houſe. I did not aſk your aid, but you have lent the robber a hatchet to break up my door. This volume is addreſſed only to men, who reſpect the <hi>ſpirit</hi> as well as the <hi>letter</hi> of a bargain. To them enough has been ſaid in demonſtration of American ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs, ignorance, and duplicity. French depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations are a bitter doſe, for which America may thank herſelf.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ALONG with the treaty of alliance eventual and defenſive, there was ſubſcribed at Paris another of amity and commerce. The latter inſtrument, in a ſpirit of liberality very different
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:033485_0240_0FF7216C8521F318"/>
from Jay's, had fixed the rule that <hi>free bottoms make free goods.</hi> The twenty-third article ſays, that it ſhall be lawful <q>to ſail with the ſhips and merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes aforementioned, and to trade with the ſame liberty and ſecurity from the places, ports, and havens of thoſe who are <hi>enemies of both or either party,</hi> without any oppoſition, or diſturbance whatſoever, not only directly from the places of the enemy aforementioned to neutral places; but alſo from <hi>one place belonging to an enemy,</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place belonging to an enemy.—And it is hereby ſtipulated, that free ſhips ſhall alſo give a freedom to goods.</q> The article has much more to this effect. The twenty-fourth enumerates all ſorts of <hi>proviſions</hi> as coming within the definition of free goods. This treaty is dated at Paris, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary 6th, 1778.</p>
               <p>The eighteenth article of the Britiſh treaty has been above cited, and beſides aboliſhing the privilege of free bottoms, it warrants the ſeizure of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, on paying the price of them.</p>
               <p>The twenty-fifth article does, indeed, ſay, that, <q>nothing in this treaty contained ſhall, however, be conſtrued or operate contrary to former and exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing public treaties with <hi>other ſovereigns or ſtates.</hi>
                  </q> If this ſtipulation had been obſerved, it ſeems that the republic would have had no cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of that eighteenth article. But the meaſures of England have been a ſyſtematic violation of it. In ſpite of the treaty of Paris, America has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſuffered French goods to be taken out of her bottoms. Vaſt quantities of proviſions have been ſeized from American ſhipping bound for France, at the very time, when the Engliſh were boaſting that they would ſtarve her<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The plan of ſtarving the French nation was the moſt diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal that ever entered into the heart even of an emperor, or a king. It could nor ſerve to diſband French armies, but muſt have had an oppoſite effect.</p>
                     <p>In 1709, France was ravaged by a terrible famine; and the ranks of their armies were overwhelmed with volunteers; for hunger is an admirable recruiting officer. The very ſame circumſtance has happened both before and ſince. A ſcarcity of proviſions alone would be ſufficient to fill the battalions.</p>
                     <p>The military part of a nation, are always, in the laſt reſort, its maſters. Hence, in a general famine, they are the laſt claſs of citizens who feel the extremity of hunger. The firſt part of the French nation which die of it muſt be their old men, women, and children.</p>
                     <p>The Engliſh are fond of repreſenting their neighbours <hi>as in a ſtate of ſtarving.</hi> When they wiſh to revile the Welch, the Scotch, the Iriſh, or the French, goat-milk cheeſe, oatmeal, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoes, and frogs are favourite topics. <hi>Time about is fair play,</hi> ſays the proverb. Many thouſands of people in England have, ſince that ſcheme of ſtarving France, died of hunger.</p>
                  </note>. In the face
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:033485_0241_0FF7216F1C672228"/>
of ſuch matters, it is not wonderful that the French are angry.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jay's friends reply, that France, by the ſecond article of the treaty of Paris, was enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to <q>any particular favour in reſpect of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and navigation</q> that ſhould be granted by the United States to another nation. Of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, when Jay gave up the right of <hi>free</hi> bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and of proviſion veſſels, to England, the French came to have the ſame privilege of ſtopping them. But the twenty-fifth article, above quoted, ſhews that Jay had really ſaved the republic, in this point. Yet the exception of the French, as to proviſions, and free bottoms, ought, at ſo criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal a time, to have been fully and fairly named. The deſertion of neutral rights, even in the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way, opened a pretence for abuſe.</p>
               <p>The caſe between France and America appears to be ſhortly this. Jay, in his treaty, gave up the principle of free bottoms, with the exception of treaties already made by the United States. This was wrong; yet the twenty-fifth article ought to
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:033485_0242_0FF72170B0BD5F08"/>
have ſaved France. The Engliſh, in reading their copy of the treaty, overleaped this excepting arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and, juſt as if it never had been written, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to ſeize French property on board of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can veſſels, as likewiſe American proviſions freight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for any part of the republic. When this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was publiſhed in America, the directory were buſy in arranging affairs of intricate complication, and ſtupendous importance. The recent conqueſt of Flanders and Holland called for their whole attention. Compared with ſuch objects, the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of five hundred veſſels, either <hi>by</hi> their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies or <hi>from</hi> them, was a trifle. Beſides, oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Jay's treaty became ſo violent in America that there was the greateſt chance for congreſs overſetting it, as indeed it eſcaped in the end on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a ſingle vote<note n="*" place="bottom">That of Mr. Muhlenberg, in a committee of the whole houſe of repreſentatives.</note> out of ninety-ſeven.</p>
               <p>In ſummer, 1796, a ſplendid prize was to be contended for in Italy, and till that diſpute had been partly decided, the directory did not wiſh to entangle themſelves in American negociation. Buonaparte, whoſe name hath ſince become ſynoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to victory, ſoon convinced the world what was to be the fate of Lombardy. When the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory perceived the republic to be proſperous on that ſide, they of courſe turned their attention to this country. Obſerve the following dates.</p>
               <p>Jay's treaty had been ſigned on the 19th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, 1794. It was ratified by the ſenate, on June 24th, 1795, and by Mr. Randolph, as ſecretary of ſtate, on Auguſt 14th, 1795. The appropriations for effecting the Britiſh treaty were not ageeed to, by the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, till April 30th, 1796. During this whole
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:033485_0243_0FF721725CA53C98"/>
time, the French did not plunder American veſſels, unleſs in two or three rare inſtances, while the Britiſh were ſeizing them by hundreds. That this was the caſe has been aſcertained in the Hiſtory of 1796, which contains a copious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all captures made by French, or Engliſh privateers up to about the end of April. The detail was then ſuſpended from want of room.</p>
               <p>This forbearance, on the part of France, from the time that the treaty had been approved by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, till appropriations were made for it by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, was the reſult of honourable and ſound poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. By commencing the capture of American ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, while the fate of Jay's treaty was yet unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, they would have been ſure to exaſperate the people of this country, and run the chance of driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into a ſtill cloſer connection with England. They did not furniſh America with any pretence or provocation to quarrel with them, while, at the ſame time, they left her to the free operation of her own mind. The republic, during this interval, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſeverely by the treaty; for they reſpected that of Paris, while the United States permitted Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to break it. The French, agreeably to its ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations, allowed Britiſh property to go free, if protected by an American bottom; while the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, in expreſs violation of the twenty-fifth and ſaving article of Jay's treaty, ſeized French pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in American ſhipping.</p>
               <p>Theſe are facts inconteſtably true; and they place France in the moſt favourable light, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Britain. Under very great diſadvantage, the republic adhered to her treaty of 1778, while England was inceſſantly violating the one, dictated by herſelf, that ſhe had juſt made with Jay. The republic thus acted with ſtrict honour, while Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land diſplayed treachery. Yet even this perfidy and
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:033485_0244_0FF7217858BF7300"/>
effrontery had no effect in rouſing America to manly feelings. On the contrary, in ſpring, 1796, while the treaty was before congreſs, and while Britiſh captures and impreſſments filled every newſpaper, Meſſrs. Harper and Tracy ſtood up in the houſe to deny their exiſtence. An artificial caterwauling was, in the meanwhile, excited all over the country, that unleſs the United States agreed to Jay's treaty, England would declare war. In vain did Mr. Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin, and others, urge, that, before the appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for effecting it, England ſhould be compelled to ſuſpend her piracies. For urging a propoſition ſo juſt in itſelf, and ſo important to America, they were, in the brutal, paper-jobbing dialect, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as penſioners of France.</p>
               <p>The republic, in the unavoidable exerciſe of her judgment, could not help deſpiſing a people ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely enfeebled by puſillanimity, by ſelfiſhneſs, and by faction. Almoſt one half of congreſs were ſo far from wanting to redreſs the Britiſh injuries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on their allies, and even on their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents, that they cenſured every member who wiſhed to complain. When the directory ſaw that the federal faction were entirely victorious; that England continued to ſeize French property in American bottoms; and that our executive took no effective ſteps to prevent it; having waited as long as juſtice to their fellow citizens could permit them to wait; they, on July 2d, 1796, paſſed a decree, of which Mr. Pickering gives this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. <q>It announces, that the conduct of France towards neutrals, will be regulated by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which they ſhould ſuffer the Engliſh to treat them<note n="*" place="bottom">Meſſage from the Preſident, of 22d June, 1797, p. 6.</note>.</q> If they were to be ruled by that precedent, they could never be at a loſs to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:033485_0245_0FF72179EB0E5AA8"/>
all ſorts of crimes. Though the decree was dated July 2d, 1796, it was not, as Mr. Pickering obſerves, <q>in general operation, until October.</q> From this account it clearly follows, that French depredations are the conſequence of congreſs having appropriated for Jay's treaty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making even an attempt to enforce that of Paris, for the protection of French property under the American flag.</p>
               <p>The principle laid down in the decree is, in itſelf, equitable. It has been followed, on the 2d of March, 1797, by one ſtill more explicit, and which forms No. II. of the documents, already cited, laid before congreſs, by Mr. Adams, on June 22d, 1797. An abridgement of the chief articles in the latter edict, will explain the greater part of the preſent grounds of complaint, which France has againſt America, and which are fairly deducible from Jay's unhappy deſertion of the doctrine, that free bottoms make free goods; that a French cargo is ſafe under the American flag.</p>
               <p>The directory begin by quoting a law of May 9th, 1793, of which, the preſent decree is little more than a ſecond edition. This law, which had either been long ſuſpended, or, indeed, never exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, ſets out with complaining that the enemies of France violate the flag of neutral powers to her prejudice, and therefore, ſays, that ſhe can no longer fulfil, towards thoſe neutral powers in general, the wiſh that ſhe has conſtantly manifeſted for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire freedom of commerce and navigation.</p>
               <p>The law of 1793, then enjoins, that neutral veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels may be ſtopt, when the property of an enemy is found on board of them. Thus, if a merchant in London, comes over to Norfolk, in Virginia, buys a quantity of tobacco, and ſhips it for England, in an American bottom, the cargo will be ſeizable.
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:033485_0246_0FF7217B7AB334D8"/>
The veſſel, however, is to be diſcharged, as ſoon as unloaded, and what American property ſhe may contain is alſo free. She is to be paid the freight for which ſhe was hired, with a juſt indemnification for the time of her being detained. French tribunals are appointed to determine thoſe matters. The law, with equity, adds, that its operations againſt neutral bottoms are to ceaſe, whenever the enemy ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they will no longer moleſt French pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in the like ſituation. All this, with the long forbearance of France, till ſo late as October, 1796, evidently proves, that the republic was driven into the preſent attack upon neutral bottoms, by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of creating a counterbalance to the previous and ſtill continued piracies of Britain.</p>
               <p>Having cited this law, the decree next refers to Jay's treaty, and that of Paris. It explains wherein they differ, and in what way they muſt be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, in order to ſecure an equal advantage to France as to England. The directory quote, in their defence, the ſecond article of the treaty of Paris, which begins in theſe terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The moſt chriſtian king, and the United States, engage, mutually, not to grant any particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to other nations, in reſpect of commerce and navigation, which ſhall not immediately be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the other party, who ſhall enjoy the ſame favour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After explaining the neceſſity for taking advantage of this ſtipulation, the decree quotes the ſeventeenth article of Jay's treaty, and, grounding preciſely on the ſame footing, declares, that <hi>free ſhips are</hi> NOT <hi>to make free cargoes.</hi> It next refers to the eighteenth article, and in like manner extends the liſt of contraband goods beyond what was ſettled by the treaty of Paris. Jay had admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſhip-timber, pitch, tar, hemp, and ſome other
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:033485_0247_0FF7218085984040"/>
articles to be ſeizable, even though American pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. The decree follows up this blow, and juſtice cannot blame it.</p>
               <p>Jay, by the twenty-firſt article, conſented, that an American ſailor, fighting on board of a French veſſel, and taken priſoner by England, ſhall be treated as a <hi>pirate.</hi> The French decree copies this clauſe, and then makes the ſame declaration. It farther adds, that an American ſhall not be permitted to plead <hi>impreſſment.</hi> This is hard upon individuals, but as to the United States at large, they never made any ſerious efforts to hinder Engliſh kidnapping. Their negligence cauſed great numbers of Americans to be impreſſed, and whether as volunteers, or by compulſion, they are equally effective againſt France. Hence the republic is warranted, in her own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to uſe every method for compelling the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States to do juſtice to themſelves, and to her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pinckney<note n="*" place="bottom">Documents, &amp;c. p. 33.</note> ſays, that American ſailors are at preſent detained in Breſt, as priſoners of war, and <q>ſuffer much by cloſe confinement and bad proviſions.</q> They may thank the miſerable clauſe which declared them liable to be conſidered as pirates, if they enliſted on board of French ſhips of war. But for that clauſe, the French would have been glad to ſet them free, and take them into their own ſervice. At preſent, many Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans are, in ſpite of the treaty, in the French navy, and theſe priſoners in Breſt will be kept moſt likely, as a pledge, in caſe that Barney, or ſome other Americans, in the French ſervice, ſhall be captured by the Engliſh. Jay has authoriſed Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville to hang Barney, and the directory keep ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſet of Americans for the halter of retaliation. To ſuch a climax of independence, reſpect, and
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:033485_0248_0FF7218213CF9FF0"/>
dignity, has this country been elevated by the maſterly politics of the federal party. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that we ſhould eſcape the univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Europe. The ſix per cent. cabinet have converted the national character into a ſort of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical common ſewer for the reception of every indignity from every government on earth.</p>
               <p>The two decrees of the French directory, of July 2d, 1796, and March 2d, 1797, are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently engrafted on the principles of the Britiſh treaty, and muſt be aſcribed excluſively to it.

In executing theſe French de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, many ſeizures have taken place, which they did not apparently contemplate. Many horrid out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages have been committed on the property and perſons of Americans; for the crew of a French privateer are compoſed of as coarſe materials as thoſe of an Engliſh one. But the conduct of our government led exactly to ſuch a ſituation. For ſome years paſt it has beat up for external indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It has ſent out riders to take in commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for inſult. Such were thoſe factors of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation, Thomas Pinckney and John Jay. <q>If the treaty is ratified,</q> ſaid preſident Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <q>the partiſans of the French, or rather of war and confuſion, will excite them to hoſtile meaſures; or at leaſt to unfriendly ſentiments<note n="*" place="bottom">Randolph p. 37.</note>.</q> In every word he was miſtaken. The treaty was oppoſed by friends of peace and order. Since it paſt, they have never excited the French to hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But war and confuſion were juſtly foreſeen,
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:033485_0249_0FF72183D07C3700"/>
as the obvious conſequence of the treaty itſelf. It was framed under the auſpices of a party in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enmity to France. <q>The ſucceſs of the duke of Brunſwick was moſt earneſtly wiſhed for by the principal agents of this ariſtocratic and fiſcal party, who had not even the decency to conceal their ſentiments upon the ſubject.— The pulſe of the whole party beat in uniſon with him, as he advanced towards Paris, and with him they were covered with ſhame and mortification as he retreated<note n="*" place="bottom">An Examination of the late Proceedings in Congreſs, &amp;c. p. 23.</note>.</q> Yet, with their uſual ſincerity, they affect to date their dread of France from the arrival of Genet, about eight months after.</p>
               <p>This explanation has been ſomewhat long, but it accounts for the preſent conduct of the French. It ſhews that they have received atrocious provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; that they bore it for a conſiderable time, with patience, till they ſaw that no redreſs was to be expected. They are now acting, from honeſt reſentment, what England did from wanton inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. This is the real diſtinction between the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies of the two nations. When a man becomes both judge and avenger in his own cauſe, he is apt not only to get juſtice, but ſomething more than juſtice. This is, no doubt, the way with the French; but for the original miſchief, we are to blame ſuch legiſlators as Harriſon Otis, to whoſe harangue we are now to return.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Where, ſaid Mr. Otis, are your ſailors? Liſten to the paſſing gale of the ocean, and you will hear their groans iſſuing from French priſon ſhips.</q> If they were taken in Engliſh ſhips of war, the French are well entitled to confine them. While the Britiſh impreſſed Americans by thouſands,
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:033485_0250_0FF721872019D988"/>
the federal party were troubled with an invincible deafneſs. But whenever the French begin to offend in the ſame way, they become quick of hearing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Otis <q>
                     <hi>defied</hi> the ingenuity of any gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to draw a compariſon between the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory and the Britiſh parliament, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the former; and <hi>inſiſted</hi> that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Charles de la Croix were upon a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel with thoſe of lord North.</q> If the orator means to compare the parliament of 1775, with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent directory, or to ſay that the diſmiſſion of Pinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney amounts to another Boſton port bill, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a groſs violation of truth. Incendiaries, like Mr. Otis, have hurried this country into a ſeries of meaſures offenſive to France, and previouſly deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſo. America muſt now retrace her ſteps. If La Croix had ſent forty thouſand men to invade this continent, there would be ſome meaning in the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Mr. Otis. But now, it is the challenge of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, debility, and impoſture.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>There was a time when he (Mr. Otis) was ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with enthuſiaſm in favour of the French revolution, and he cheriſhed it, while civil liberty appeared to be the object; but he now conſidered that revolution as completely atchieved, and that the war was continued, not for liberty, but for conqueſt and aggrandizement, to which he did not believe it was <hi>the intereſt of this country to contribute.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The power of France may become dangerous to the United States, becauſe they have treated her as an alien. This cannot be helped. They are but in the griſtle of political ſtrength, and muſt ſail with the ſtream. As for the revolution being <hi>completely atchieved,</hi> Mr. Fenno hath ſince affirmed, that it is on the eve of being <hi>blown up</hi>

between the directory and the council of five hundred, induced Malmeſbury, as the French affirm, to retard, for ſome time, his ſecond nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation. This we learn by a meſſage from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer body to the latter. Such a delay, at this late period of the war, ſhews the good will and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed hope of the combined powers. Civil li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is as much the object of the revolution as it ever was. Mr. Otis and his party pretend to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans. Hence, inſtead of regretting, they ſhould have been glad at the eſtabliſhment of an Italian republic. They ought to wiſh for a ſimilar refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the German empire; that mankind might have a choice of their own, and be no longer driven into military ſervice, like an ox to the ſlaughter. A true republican will rejoice as much at the ſucceſs of his principles, as a true chriſtian at the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the goſpel.

                     <p>A London newſpaper of September 25, 1796, gives a report from a committee of the whig club of Ireland. They ſay, that, in many parts of that country, a labourer, during the preceding win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſpring, had only ſix-pence per day, while oatmeal was at eighteen-pence, and potatoes at three-pence farthing per ſtone.</p>
                     <p>At ſix-pence per day, the labour of a week amounts to three ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. With this, the man could buy two ſtones, or thirty-two pounds of meal, for himſelf, his wife, and three children. This came to fourteen ounces and an half of oatmeal per day, for each, on the ſuppoſition that the family could live without fire, clothes, or lodging. The report adds, that the price of oatmeal and potatoes, during the above period, had been, not leſs, but often conſiderably dearer than theſe rates; and that, for <hi>the laſt three years,</hi> the general ſtate of the poor had been but in a ſmall degree better.</p>

He remarked, that while we were ſo loudly denying ourſelves to be a divided people, the very debate proved us to be ſo. This inconteſtable obſervation, ſtrikes at the root of the preſident's ſpeech. Barras had only ſaid what all mankind know to be true.</p>
               <p>Mr. Swanwick ſpoke in defence of the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mr. Nicholas. He <q>thought, that a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of gentlemen had already <hi>fixed their opinions for</hi> A FRENCH w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.—It was ſaid, that it would be dictating to the executive to expreſs our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of what meaſures ought to be taken. Mr. Swanwick did not underſtand this language. The executive had called us together to tell us the preſent ſtate of affairs. And are we to ſit with our arms folded? Are we to go into the merits of the ſpeech; its arguments; and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attending it; and not to ſay a ſingle word of what ought to be done, becauſe it is not our department? What! <hi>Is not the peace of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try within our department? Are we called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only to vote for taxes?</hi> Are we ſo muzzled by the conſtitution, that we muſt be ſilent about the great concerns of the nation? We are not now interfering with the treaty-making power, but merely giving a general opinion. Could ſuch ſilence have been in the view of the framers of the conſtitution? We may not give an advice before hand! After the treaty is made it is the law, and the houſe have no right of doing any thing but to give their money.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This argument was unanſwerable.</p>
               <p>If the federal patriots could obtain their apparent object, the legiſlature would ſink into a mere office for the regiſtration of taxes. No Britiſh miniſter durſt forbid a member of parliament from diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the preference of peace or war.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="unknown:033485_0253_0FF7218F2E87F8D8"/>Mr. Livingſton was for the amendment. <q>If we adhere," ſaid he, "to the ſtile of the addreſs as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, go to war we muſt. WAR is the idea of the <hi>ſpeech.</hi>—Mr. Livingſton aſked, if we were to fight the French becauſe they expreſſed good wiſhes for the people of America." (This referred to the ſpeech of Barras.) "Mr. Livingſton thought, that the Dutch had fully as much reaſon to be offended with Quincy Adams, as we had to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of Barras.</q> Here he read the paſſage in Mr. Adams's letter, which deſcribes the dependent ſtate of the patriotic party in Holland.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coit propoſed ſeveral additions and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his own. He was ſorry that the houſe had ever got into the habit of anſwering preſidential ſpeeches. He recommended the omiſſion of all which related to Barras, and the inſertion of ſomething in a ſofter tone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Livingſton had ſpoke of the impreſſment of thouſands of American ſeamen. Mr. Harper, in contradiction to this, declared that he could produce very good authority; being that of the gentleman himſelf. He was appointed chairman of a committee to report on the ſubject; and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an enquiry of ſeveral months, the reſult ſtood thus:

This he thought a ſufficient reply.</p>
               <p>Mr. Livingſton ſaid, that, with regard to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſment, returns had only been made by five or ſix collectors; ſo that the accounts contained
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:033485_0254_0FF72191D580DA30"/>
nothing like a ſtatement of the real amount of impreſſments.—Among others, the great port of New-York had ſent no return. Even thoſe that were made out referred only to a few months, from the beginning of January, 1796; and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſeamen might have been impreſſed before that account began. Mr. Livingſton had never heard that any of the above people were releaſed.</p>
               <p>To this explanation Harper made no anſwer. He ſtood plainly convicted of an attempt to deceive the houſe. He wanted, as Henry Fielding expreſſes it, <hi>to convey</hi> A LIE <hi>in the words of truth.</hi> The report contained, indeed, only ninety ſeven names; but then, as Harper well knew, it was confined to a mere handful of the impreſſments.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles made a long ſpeech in favour of the amendment of Mr. Nicholas. He <q>gave Mr. Pinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <hi>great</hi> credit for his behaviour. He had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as much reputation, as, in ſuch an exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it was poſſible to acquire. But Mr. Giles could not ſay that the diſmiſſion was entirely groundleſs.</q> It was very well grounded, as hath already been proved. Mr. Pinckney deſeved no part of this encomium. Mr. Giles ſaid, that <q>the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the ſpeech and report was to declare war.—France would think it equal to a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a war, if this amendment was rejected.— It was no ſecret that the United States <hi>had not done juſtice</hi> to France.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Gallatin adverted to the ſingular doctrine of the houſe not being at liberty to give their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on the preference of peace or war, becauſe it interfered with the power of <hi>making treaties.</hi> Mr. Gallatin ſaid, that <q>he could cover the table with parliamentary precedents for giving ſuch opinions, even in a country where the king is entruſted with the ſole power of making war.</q>

                  <pb n="256" facs="unknown:033485_0255_0FF721963A9102F0"/>In a ſubſequent ſpeech, on May 27th, Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſaid that Buonaparte was fit only for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration of atrocities; that he was a man who had eſtabliſhed a reputation upon crimes; that he could be compared to none but the leaders of Goths and Vandals; with other phraſes, foreign to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, yet well fitted for inflaming his audience againſt France, and the latter againſt them. The attempts of Harper to involve the continent in a French and Spaniſh war, caſt Nero and his confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration into the ſhade. In preſence of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ambaſſador, he laſt ſummer named his catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic majeſty to congreſs as the <hi>vaſſal</hi> king of Spain. Mr. Harper has not received the education, nor does he poſſeſs the feelings of a gentleman; otherwiſe this burſt of vulgarity could not have eſcaped from his lips. Behold the being that hiſſes at the Corſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can hero!</p>
               <p>After ſuch doings, Mr. Harper and his party pretend to be angry at the diſmiſſion of Pinckney. Put the caſe that Barras had granted him an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and had ſpoke as follows. <q>Your preſident is an old doating fool. His head is turned with his elevation. He ſuffers himſelf to be led by the noſe by a circle of aſſociates in the pay of Britain. But unleſs he and his congreſs chuſe to correct their ſtile, the republican navy ſhall lay New-York and Philadelphia as flat as the floor that you <hi>ſtand</hi> on.</q> Such a harrangue would not be more brutal or inſolent than the menace which Harper has thrown out of conquering the Spaniſh colonies. Pluck out the <hi>beam</hi> before you ſeek for the <hi>mote.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words of this legiſlative luminary were taken down, and publiſhed a few days after, in the Merchant's Advertiſer, as a part of his ſpeech. By this time he had begun to be aſhamed of it. He
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:033485_0256_0FF721996CA7E280"/>
went to Mr. Bradford's office, made a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble noiſe, and obtained admiſſion for a <hi>corrected</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of his harangue. It appeared, for the ſecond time, on the 10th of June. Mr. Harper therein only ſays, that Buonaparte was <q>a great man, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified to be the inſtrument of ſuch oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</q> He afterwards printed a third edition of it, in three ſucceſſive numbers of another newſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, wherein it ſwelled to the incredible bulk of ſeven folio pages. It is hard to believe that one half of this matter was ever pronounced in the houſe, for they ſit only four or five hours.</p>
               <p>We ſhall here conclude this imperfect glance at the debates on the preſident's ſpeech. The repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives did not get their addreſs ready, till the ſecond of June. They had met on the 15th of May, heard the oration on the 16th, and had tugged for ſixteen days incluſive, from the 17th, to the 2d of June following. The amendment of Mr. Nicholas was rejected. All the paſſages, quoted in the outſet of this ſketch, were retained. The yeas and nays were called over ſeven times. The addreſs finally paſt, by ſixty-two votes againſt thirty-ſix; and, with admirable conſiſtency, cenſured the directory, for gently hinting to Monroe, that we are a divided people. This paper affirmed, alſo, that <q>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the government has been <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> to foreign nations.</q> The affirmation is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally known to be falſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Among other glaring inſtances of partiality, obſerve the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. France and England are at war. Government permits the latter, unmoleſted, to preſs our ſeamen. At the ſame time we agree to a treaty forbidding them to enter into French ſervice. Beſides that the French are greatly in want of able ſailors, an American, by ſpeaking the Engliſh language, and being acquainted with the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of that people, would be of peculiar uſe in a French privateer.</note>; and as ſuch, had been conſtantly contradicted by the republican ſide of the houſe.

The whole charge of the ſeſſion, by an account given in, was about eighty thouſand dollars, or fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty eight dollars, and a fraction, per day. Thus the addreſs required twenty-four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred dollars worth of time, and amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in the judgment of the minority, to a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of war againſt France. The journal of the whole ſeſſion forms but an hundred and forty pages. The reply of Mr. Adams to this addreſs, ends on the forty-fourth.</p>
               <p>So much buſtle about a preſident's ſpeech, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhews that we are ambitious of poſting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards monarchy. Speaking of the late birth day of general Waſhington, a federal newſpaper has theſe words.—<q>Two public companies, and many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate parties, obſerved this POLITICAL CHRIST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS, and HALLOWED it<note n="*" place="bottom">Aurora, 7th March, 1797.</note>!</q> It is believed that no Engliſh print was ever polluted with ſuch abject profanation. Mr. Adams was not contented with ſcolding at France. He hath ſince been inveighing againſt thoſe who diſapprove his conduct. He was angry at Barras for attempting, as he alledged, to ſeparate the people from their government. He now declares, that ſuch a project has actually been fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the United States; and that it has <hi>a high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of ſucceſs!</hi> The particulars are thus.</p>
               <p>On Auguſt 7th, 1797, Mr. Adams dined at Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueil Hall, in Boſton, with two hundred and fifty of his fellow citizens. An addreſs was preſented to him, which has this paſſage. <q>When domeſtic <hi>fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> appears to have conſpired with foreign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, to deſtroy the peace of our country; when our conſtituted authorities are reviled and inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note n="*" place="bottom">The greateſt inſult was that on the repreſentatives, of their not being at liberty to give an opinion to the preſident for or againſt a rupture with France.</note>;
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:033485_0258_0FF7219E1871FAF8"/>
and the moſt <hi>daring</hi> attempts to ſeparate the people from their government are openly made and avowed; at ſuch a criſis we are excited, no leſs by our inclination than our duty, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,</q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this yell of malice and ſtupidity, the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent made a moſt gracious reply. The addreſs had <hi>fourteen</hi> lines upon faction. Mr. Adams rung the changes through forty-eight. <q>I cannot," ſays he, but be of the opinion, that the profligate ſpirit of falſehood and malignity, which has appeared in ſome, and the unguarded diſpoſition in others to encourage it, are ſerious evils, and bear a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening aſpect upon the union of the ſtates, their conſtitution of government, and the moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the nation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus hath our preſident proclaimed his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment becauſe a minority of congreſs were unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to embark in his French war. He ſeems to juſtify an obſervation made by Mr. Paine. <q>I have always," ſays he, "been oppoſed to the mode of refining government up to an individual, or what is called a ſingle executive. Such a man will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be <hi>the chief of a party.</hi> A plurality is far better. It combines the maſs of a nation better together; and, beſides this, it is neceſſary to the manly mind of a republic, that it loſes the debaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing idea of obeying an individual<note n="†" place="bottom">Paine to Waſhington, p. 5.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The houſe of repreſentatives have always poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed a number of men, equal to Mr. Adams. Nothing but the ſpirit of ſervility would excite ſuch a noiſe about his ſpeech. The debate on mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an anſwer to it produced a dozen ſpeeches equal
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:033485_0259_0FF721A0A10074B0"/>
to his. But then Mr. Adams has the right of appointment to many ſnug places, with an annual ſinecure to himſelf of twenty-five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dollars. Theſe be thy gods O Iſrael! But for his high ſalary, and his unbounded patronage, an anſwer to a preſident's ſpeech would be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and the debates upon it very cool.</p>
               <p>If the change to a quintuple directory can be accompliſhed, without intermediate miſchief, it may be as well for America if Mr. Adams ſhall be her laſt preſident. This remark is not levelled at the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, but the office. Matters have come to ſuch a height that Mr. Jefferſon, if choſen at the next election, will, perhaps, be forced to take refuge in his party. They can hardly commit as much harm as their predeceſſors have done. The certificates are funded. The bank government is eſtabliſhed. Yet, after all, democratical aſcendency will ſtill be, moſt likely, but the domination of a party. A native citizen of the county of Philadelphia, of the firſt claſs, both in point of information and of fortune, was aſked, during the late preſidential canvaſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he preferred Adams or Jefferſon. <q>I wiſh for the latter, he replied, as, by far, moſt likely to keep us out of a French war. But I would rather ſee a ſtick of wood in the chair than either of the candidates. The very buſtle that you make about this election proves that your conſtitution is a monarchy. A pure republic will reſt nothing upon the choice of a ſingle man.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The anſwer to the ſpeech ſhould be circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to a verbal meſſage: and congreſs ought to give up the cuſtom of viſiting a preſident at his levees, and on his birth day. A gradual extinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be promoted of that fulſome ſtile with which, for theſe nine years, our preſidents have been addreſſed.</p>

                  <pb n="261" facs="unknown:033485_0260_0FF721A460C26210"/>In his anſwer to the Boſton addreſs, Mr. Adams ſpeaks of <q>a threatening aſpect upon <hi>the union</hi> of the ſtates.</q> The ſtrongeſt aſpect of that kind appears in Connecticut. On December 23d, 1796, there was diſtributed to the aſſembly of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, a pamphlet, entitled, <hi>Papers Reſpecting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſions by Connecticut Claimants.</hi> It begins with a circular letter of April 16th, 1796, from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of this ſtate to thoſe of New-Jerſey, New-York, Rhode-Iſland, Connecticut, and Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts. This incloſed the copy of a proclamation, iſſued by him, at the inſtance of the aſſembly, for preventing intruſions. A requeſt was ſubjoined that it might be publiſhed in their reſpective ſtates; and, that if any attempts were made to emigrate into Pennſylvania, they might be oppoſed.</p>
               <p>Obſerve the various reception that this letter met with from theſe five governors. As New-York has a ſimilar quarrel with Connecticut, Mr. Jay not only publiſhed the Pennſylvanian manifeſto, but ſuperadded another of his own. New-Jerſey and Maſſachuſetts have no ſuch intereſt in the cauſe, and in theſe two ſtates it was ſent to the newſpapers, without ſuch an appendage. Rhode-Iſland, influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by its Connecticut neighbours, appears to have done nothing at all. The governor of Connecticut declined perſonal agency in printing the proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but, with an obliging anſwer, laid it before the two branches of the legiſlature.</p>
               <p>From the other papers we learn, that, early in May, 1796, a land ſurveyor, from Connecticut, and four aſſiſtants, were on the Pennſylvania line, near the one hundred and twenty-nine mile ſtone. They deſigned to run off ſix townſhips within this ſtate. A letter from Lycoming county, of June 18th, 1796, informed, that there were five ſetts of ſurveyors on the ſame buſineſs. On June 22d, a committee of
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:033485_0261_0FF721A6EA48D440"/>
that county was held to counteract the invaders. In a letter of July 6th, to the governor, the committee write thus. <q>We have further been informed, that, ſome few days ſince, a party, of fifteen or twenty men, were ſeen, <hi>well armed with rifles,</hi> and equipped, proceeding on into the country up the Cawaneſque, in the neighbourhood of the ſtate line; and that a party of fifteen ſurveyors, with their hands, were to ſet out from about the mouth of Tioga river, to ſurvey in the ſame coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. General report ſays, that this proceeding has taken place, ſince a council was reſolved upon and holden at Tioga point, <hi>in conſequence of your excellency's proclamation being ſent into that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> We are aſſured, that they are in numerous parties, throughout the northern parts of this country, and we apprehend that they expect reſiſtance to their intruſions. We are decidedly of opinion, that a civil magiſtrate, unprotected by an armed force, would be in imminent danger in attempting to arreſt any of the intruders.</q> Meaſures were taken to repel them, and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was, for that time, ſuſpended.</p>
               <p>Here we ſee, that a party of armed men entered Pennſylvania, with a purpoſe to reſiſt the governor's proclamation. Granting their claim to be well founded, it ought not to be ſupported by rifles. A ſimilar conduct in other diſputes about land, would fill the continent with carnage. A purchaſer, joſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of his farm, has only to charge his gun, and level at his enemy. This precedent is the moſt alarming, the moſt antifederal, that can well be imagined. It came from a body of people firmly devoted to Mr. Adams. If any other ſtate had inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Connecticut with a detachment of men in arms the whole union would have rung with reproaches, from Trumball, Webſter, and the reſt of her lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rati.
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:033485_0262_0FF721A8D6611488"/>
The deſign was dropt from dread of a ſuperior force, but will, it is likely, be renewed with the firſt opportunity. Our preſident may point out, if he can, what other ſtate entertains any plans which are half ſo dangerous to the general peace. If go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Miſſlin had refuſed to publiſh a proclamation againſt the weſtern inſurgents, he would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved preciſely as the governor of Connecticut did, in the affair of the Suſquehanna company.</p>
