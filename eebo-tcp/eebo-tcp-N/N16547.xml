            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

this ſufficient to preſerve a union of thirteen States, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a national government? It had no authority, its powers expired at the peace, became a dead letter, for the fear of common danger was gone. Peace, which to other nations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, and which under other circumſtances would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to us, the greateſt bleſſings, was pregnant with the greateſt evil; diſunion, the certain parent of internal quarrels, diſorder, and blood-ſhed. In this ſituation of America, ſome of the beſt and wiſeſt of her citizens, lamenting that the term of her glory was ſo ſhort, and dreading the fatal conſequences which would neceſſarily follow from diſunion, propoſed that a Convention of the States ſhould be called for the purpoſes of amending the Confederation. The wiſdom of the meaſure was inſtantly ſeen: It was approved by Congreſs, recommended to, and adopted by the States.</p>
            <p>IT is on all hands agreed, that an abler or more upright Aſſembly never met in America, than the late Convention held at Philadelphia. The original deſign of their meeting was to amend the preſent Articles of Confederation: But upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting together; upon accurately inveſtigating the Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and informing each other of the real ſituation of their reſpective States, they ſaw ſo many radical defects in the one, and ſo many alarming appearances in the other, as induced them readily and unanimouſly to modify the Federal Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: And after four months ſpent in painful inquiries, and diligent labour, produced the frame of government now offered to the conſideration of the citizens of America. A form of government, which the Preſident of the Convention, with the modeſty peculiar to him, acknowledges to be in ſome reſpects defective; but which he likewiſe tells us, <q>was the reſult of a ſpirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and conceſſion which the peculiarity of our political ſituation rendered in diſpenſible.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:021264_0004_0FB2B7DF0951BE00"/>WHEN we take a view of the reſpectable names who met upon this occaſion, and compoſed this plan of government, we ought to approach it with deference and reſpect. Though not in ſuch a manner as to deprive us of the power of diſcovering its faults; yet with ſuch liberality as will lead us to conſider it as the reſult of the deliberations of good and able men, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by juſt motives, and governed by pure principles. Men not ſwayed by ſelfiſh proſpects, but urged to action by general philanthropy, and the deſire of handing to poſterity the beſt form of Federal Government, that America is capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, or perhaps that was ever offered to the conſideration of mankind.</p>
            <p>IF we read the propoſed plan under theſe ideas, and think we diſcover imperfections, and faults; ought we not rather to diſtruſt our own perceptions, than the underſtandings of its makers? Becauſe it is much more probable, that a ſingle reader, even of great capacity, ſhould be miſtaken, than that ſo reſpectable a body as the Convention, with minds equally enlightened, and more unbiaſed, ſhould, after the freeſt and fulleſt inveſtigation of this important ſubject, be wrong.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I am not one of thoſe who would adopt without conſideration, or blindly purſue a plan produced by any body of men, however eminent their characters for wiſdom and virtue. "Not to pin my faith upon the ſleeve of any man," was one of my earlieſt leſſons. However, I am perſuaded that the work before us, requires no blind followers: but ſtanding upon the baſis of its intrinſic merit, poſſeſſes ſtrength ſufficient to withſtand the ſhocks of its moſt powerful enemies. Often have I read this work; and ſometimes diſcovered, as I thought, important defects; yet upon doubting my own judgment, and reading it again, have generally found the fault in myſelf, not in the Conſtitution. Yet I will not pretend to ſay that it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Did perfection ever come from the hands of man? If
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021264_0005_0FB2B7E04DD601E8"/>

               </gap> were perfect, it would be illy ſuited to our imperfect capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Government in itſelf is not a poſitive good; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing introduced by ſocieties to prevent poſitive evil. The beſt frame of government is that which is moſt likely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the greateſt ſum of evil. Such I apprehend is the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment now under conſideration. Had the deſign of the Convention been to frame a Conſtitution for any individual State, they might perhaps have produced one, in the abſtract, ſtill nearer perfection. But far different was the purpoſe of their meeting! and I feel myſelf happy in concurring with that auguſt body in thinking, that it is the beſt government which could be obtained for the thirteen States of America. Under this impreſſion I ſhall attempt to explain thoſe parts of it which are, or have been ſuppoſed to be difficult; and to anſwer ſome of the principal objections which have been made to it.</p>
            <p>BEFORE we enter into a diſcuſſion of the different articles which compoſe the Conſtitution, it may not be improper to take into conſideration the queſtion reſpecting a Bill of Rights; which many, from habit and prejudices, rather than from reaſon, and truth, have thought neceſſary; and upon the want of it have founded one of their principal objections.</p>
            <p>FEW people know the origin of the term; ſtill fewer have conſidered, without prejudice, the neceſſity of the thing. What is a Bill of Rights? A declaration inſiſted on by a free people, and recognized by their rulers, that certain principles ſhall be the invariable rules of their adminiſtration; becauſe the preſervation of theſe principles are neceſſary for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of liberty. If this diſtinction be juſt; can there be a difference, whether theſe principles are eſtabliſhed in a ſeparate declaration, or are interwoven and made a part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution itſelf? Is an infringement of a Bill of Rights by the Governing powers, of more ſerious conſequence, than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021264_0006_0FB2B7E36BD69860"/>
of the frame of government? The queſtion carries the anſwer along with it. That there is no diſtinction between them is a truth, an attempt to prove which would be an offence againſt common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>OF all the European governments a Bill of Rights is known I believe, to that of England alone. The cauſe of this is obvious. The liberty of that country has been procured and eſtabliſhed by gradual encroachments upon the regal powers ſeized by, if not yielded to, the firſt Prince of the Norman fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The firſt declaration of this ſort found in the hiſtory of that government, is the Charter of Hen. the 1ſt, obtained in conſequence of that Monarch's feeble title to the Throne. The frequent infractions of that Charter by Henry himſelf, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> well as by ſubſequent Monarchs, produced the famous Magna Charta of John, which is generally conſidered as the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Engliſh freedom. But in thoſe ages of darkneſs, when ſcarcely a rule of deſcent was fixed, much leſs principles in politics eſtabliſhed, Charters, or Declarations of Rights, were ſoon loſt ſight of, whenever intereſt induced, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances offered opportunities to the Engliſh Princes, to infringe them.</p>
            <p>Theſe violations gave riſe to the Charter of Hen. 3d, which was of much more importance than any of the preceding; and the diſcontents and confuſions which led to it, in the end gave birth to the Houſe of Commons. From this period ſome ideas of liberty began to prevail in the nation, but which for a long courſe of years were obſcured by turbulent Barons, long and deſtructive civil wars, and the arbitrary government of an able line of Princes. The art of printing, the reformation, and the reſtoration of letters, at length enlightened the minds of men: Juſt ideas of liberty now prevailed, and the Commons ſaw, that if the powers exerciſed by the Tudors were to continue
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021264_0007_0FB2B7E5B8D6FEB0"/>
in their new Sovereigns, all hope of liberty was at an end. Their reſtleſs ſpirit frequently ſhewed itſelf during the reign of Elizabeth; but that prudent Princeſs had the addreſs to allay their fears, and the vigour to repreſs their ſpirit. A new and foreign race of Princes now aſcend the Throne. The oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity was not to be loſt: Political poſitions were laid down in, and eſtabliſhed by the Houſe of Commons, which were conſidered by many as extraordinary, as they were true.</p>
            <p>JAMES, without the tallents, affected to reign with as high an hand as the Tudors. Charles unfortunately for himſelf, had been educated in the prejudices of his father. His ill-adviſed and arbitrary meaſures, involved him in difficulties which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Petition of Right in 1628. In this was ſet forth the unalienable rights of Engliſh-men. New infractions produced new quarrels; which terminated in a total change of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At the reſtoration all was joy and feſtivity. The tide of royalty ran too high, to think of Bills of Rights, or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of Engliſh-men. The conduct of James the 2d, the laſt King of that ill-fated family, involved the nation in freſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents: The Prince of Orange is called to its aſſiſtance: The King quits the Kingdom: The Throne is declared va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; and William afcended it upon terms ſtipulated in a Bill of Rights. It may be aſked, why did the Engliſh conſider a Bill of Rights neceſſary for the ſecurity of their liberty? The anſwer is, becauſe they had no written Conſtitution, or form of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <p>FORMER Princes had pretended to a divine right of govern<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing: William acknowledged his to flow from the people, and previouſly to his aſcending the Throne, entered into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with them, which recognized that juſt and ſalutary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. Had the Engliſh at this time limited the regal power in definite terms, inſtead of ſatisfying themſelves with a Bill of Rights, there would have been an end of prerogative: but they from habit were contented with a Bill of Rights, leaving the prerogative ſtill inaccurately defined, to claim by implifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the exerciſe of all the powers not denied it by tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

conſidered their Conſtitutions as the evidence of the ſocial compact between the governors and the governed, and the only proof of the rights yielded to the former.

them, and that they enfeeble the State which poſſeſſes them, they equitably conſidered five ſlaves only of equal conſequence with three free perſons. What rule of federal taxation ſo equal, and at the ſame time ſo little unfavourable to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern States, could the Convention have eſtabliſhed, as that of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſo arranged? Suppoſe the value of the lands in the reſpective States had been adopted as the meaſure: Let us ſee what then would have been the conſequence. The northern States are comparatively ſmall to the ſouthern, and are very populous; whilſt to the ſouthward, the inhabitants are ſcattered over a great extent of territory. Any given number of men in the latter States poſſeſs much greater quantities of land, than the like number in the former. It is true the lands to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſell for a greater price than thoſe to the ſouthward, but the difference in price is by no means adequate to the difference in quantity; conſequently an equal number of men to the ſouthward would have to pay a much greater federal tax than the like number to the northward.</p>
               <p>BY the 8th article of Confederation, the value of lands is made the meaſure of the federal quotas. Virginia in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is rated ſomething above Maſſachuſetts, whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of white inhabitants is nearly double.</p>
               <p>AFTER all, this point is perhaps of no great conſequence The Congreſs probably will rarely, if ever, meddle with direct taxation, as the impoſt duties will in all likelihood anſwer al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the United Provinces each of the ſeven States has but one vote in their Congreſs, and in that Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the diſproportion between the States is much greater, than in ours; for the Province of Holland pays rather more than one half of the whole federal quota.

The different States will be well acquainted with the characters of thoſe whom they elect to the Senate; their time of duration when elected is too ſhort to enable them to form dangerous intrigues, or bring about important revolutions. It is a well eſtabliſhed principle in rhetorick, that it is not fair to argue againſt a thing, from the abuſe of it. Would you ſay there ſhould be no Phyſicians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are unſkilful adminiſters of medicine: No Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers becauſe ſome are diſhoneſt: No Courts becauſe Judges are ſometimes ignorant; nor government becauſe power may be abuſed? In ſhort, it is impoſſible to guard entirely againſt the abuſe of power. Annual elections will not do it.

of the people. It is a generally received maxim among writers on government, that the Judiciary and Legiſlative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments ſhould be kept diſtinct. The poſition is true to a certain extent; but this like moſt other general rules, is liable to exceptions. In the Engliſh government, which is certainly the freeſt in Europe, the Houſe of Lords not only try impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but is the higheſt civil court in the kingdom. In that Conſtitution the Houſe of Commons are the impeachers, the Houſe of Lords the triers: But no members either of the Houſe of Commons or Houſe of Lords, was ever impeached as ſuch: But whenever members of either Houſe have been impeached, it was as great officers of State. Under the fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral government this is impoſſible, becauſe the members of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſe can hold any office of State.</p>
               <p>IF this reaſoning be not concluſive, the fourth ſection of the ſecond article puts it out of doubt, viz. "The Preſident, Vice Preſident, and all civil officers of the United States, ſhall be removed from office on impeachment, &amp;c." The Senators are repreſentatives of the people; and by no conſtruction can be conſidered as civil officers of the State. If this be the caſe, in whoſe hands can this power be lodged with greater propriety, or with greater ſafety, than in thoſe of the Senate? Or how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>SAY the objectors,—Why are not the ſalaries of the members of Congreſs aſcertained by the Conſtitution? I will anſwer them by another queſtion,—Why are not the ſalaries of every officer of the United States aſcetained by it? Or rather, why ſhould the Convention have deſcended into ſuch minutia? Can it be ſuppoſed, for a moment, that in the preſent ſituation of America, when there are ſtill left many men of talents and virtue, from amongſt whom the Congreſs will doubtleſs be choſen, that they will paſs a law to give themſelves immoderate ſallaries? But even ſhould they, what would be the mighty evil to this extenſive continent, from eighty or ninety perſons having ſalaries larger than perhaps their ſervices might merit?</p>
               <p>IT is proper that Congreſs ſhould have the regulation of this matter for another reaſon. It is a fact well known in the commercial world, that, from one certain cauſe, the quantity of ſpecie is inſenſibly increaſing: This of conſequence leſſens its value: Therefore a ſalary which now would be ſufficient forty years hence, would be wholly inadequate.</p>

               <p>THIS power in the Preſident is derived from the State go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Maſſachuſetts and New-York, though in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Chancellor and Chief Judges are added to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. This power goes only to a reconſideration of the public meaſures; and the Preſident's diſapprobation, or negative, is nugatory, when two-thirds of each Houſe concur in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure after it has undergone his inſpection. The Convention wiſely judged that the Preſident would in all probability be a man of great experience, and abilities, and as far as his powers extend, ought to be conſidered as repreſenting the Union; and conſequently would be well acquainted with the intereſts of the whole. Great utility is therefore likely to ariſe to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs from his knowledge, and his reaſoning upon their acts of Legiſlation.

               <p>Sect. 8. <hi>The Congreſs ſhall have power</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts and exciſes, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States; but all duties, impoſts, and exciſes, ſhall be uniform throughout the United States;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is here to be obſerved, that all taxes, impoſts, &amp;c. are to be applied only for the common defence and general wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, of the United States. By no poſſibility will the words admit of any other conſtruction. Yet ſeveral popular<note n="*" place="bottom">See in particular the addreſs and reaſons, &amp;c. of the Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania Minority.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimers have attempted to ſound the alarm by their illeberal and ill-founded ſuggeſtions of peculation, bribery, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and of the probability of the public Treaſury being converted to the uſe of the Preſident and Congreſs. But how will this be poſſible? They will have all fixed ſalaries, and perquiſites. The public accounts of receipts and expenditures will be regularly kept and regularly publiſhed, for the public inſpection: Beſides which, the public offices will always be open for the ſearch and inquiries of every individual. I doubt if human wiſdom could deviſe any better mode of ſecuring a juſt application of the public money.</p>
               <p>AS ſcarcely any article of the propoſed plan has eſcaped cenſure, there are objections made to the grant of the impoſts to Congreſs. But when we conſider that the purpoſes for which the impoſts are to be applied are merely national, and falls di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly within the deſign of the Union, that of making all Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica one State for great political purpoſes, the objection falls; for in this view America compoſes but one great republic, all the ſubjects of which ſtand preciſely upon the ſame ground,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:021264_0023_0FB2B80ACD2C0E18"/>
and pay only in proportion to their conſumption of foreign articles. To this we may add, that thoſe States which export the chief of the produce of their labour, and in conſequenec of that circumſtance, import more than thoſe which manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, receive a compenſation for the increaſed import, by the exported produce being free from duties. And beſides, we may fairly conclude, that the conſumption of foreign articles throughout America, is nearly in proportion to the enumeration, which is the meaſure of the reſpective quotas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To borrow money on the credit of the United States;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS power is lodged with the preſent Congreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the ſeveral States, and with the Indian tribes;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE power of regulating commerce gives great alarm to the enemies of the Conſtitution. In this, as in moſt other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they forget that this is a government for thirteen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and think only of the immediate intereſts of Virginia; as if ſhe had a right to dictate to the other twelve, and as if her intereſts alone were to be conſulted. Be not deceived my countrymen. However important we may be in the ſcale of Union, there are other States which are equally ſo. The conſequence of this power, ſay they, will be, that the eaſtern and northern States will combine together, and not only oblige the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern to export their produce in their bottoms, by prohibiting foreign bottoms; but will alſo lay ſuch duties upon foreign manufactures as will amount to a prohibition, in order to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply us themſelves.</p>
               <p>UPON accurately inveſtigating this point, we ſhall find the reaſoning to be as falſe, as the ſuppoſition is illiberal. It is true the eaſtern States can build and equip ſhips, upon better
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021264_0024_0FB2B80C4DC85200"/>
terms than the ſouthern: Nay, I believe I may go farther, and ſay, that they can upon better terms than any nation in Europe. This ariſes from their having all the materials for ſhip-building within themſelves, except canvas and cordage, whilſt moſt of the maritime powers of Europe, depend upon foreign countries, not only for theſe articles, but alſo for tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and maſts. A great extent of ſea coaſt, a cold climate, a barren ſoil, and above all, the fiſheries, furniſh an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſeamen, who from neceſſity are willing to navigate for very moderate wages. If this be the caſe, is their any reaſon to ſuppoſe that the eaſtern States will not carry our produce upon as reaſonable terms as any of the European powers? I believe it is a fact, that before the war, they were the principal carriers to the Britiſh Weſt-Indies; ſo low were the terms upon which their veſſels could be chartered. And the ſame cauſes ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, why they ſhould take freight upon terms equally moderate. But this is not all. The eaſtern States are not ignorant that the ſouthern poſſeſs even better materials for ſhip-building, than they do; and therefore will take care not to excite their jealouſy, nor ſtimulate them to build ſhips and become their own carries, by exacting unreaſonable freightage. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that the eaſtern Delegates ſhould be ſo diſhoneſt as well as unwiſe, to combine againſt thoſe of the ſouth—I will venture to aſſert, that not a man in America, who is acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the middle States, can ſuppoſe that they would join in ſuch a combination. New-York is rather a country of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers than of ſailors: It poſſeſſes large tracts of fertile ſoil, but no fiſheries, and before the war, for one ſhip built in that State, either for freightage or ſale, there were thirty in New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. All that ſhe will aim at, therefore, will be ſhips of her own, ſufficient to carry her own produce. Her intereſts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will not induce her to enter into this formidable combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:021264_0025_0FB2B80E0B979720"/>JERSEY, from her local ſituation, and a variety of peculiar circumſtances, has fewer ſhips and ſeamen than even any of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE ſame reaſoning applies to Pennſylvania that does to New-York; and ſtill more emphatically; becauſe this State is ſtill more employed in huſbandry. And as to the State of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware, it does not own ſix ſhips.</p>
               <p>LET us then ſee how this queſtion will ſtand in point of numbers. The four eaſtern States will have ſeventeen voices, which will be oppoſed by the nineteen voices of the middle States and the twenty-nine of the ſouthern.</p>
               <p>I WILL not endeavour to anſwer the other objection.—The fear of a northern combination to furniſh the ſouthern States with manufactures. This I conceive, has ariſen either from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gnorance of the ſubject, or an abſolute enmity to all confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. The only manufactures which the northern States poſſeſs and with which they can furniſh others, are ſhoes, cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton cards, nails, hats, carriages, and perhaps paper and refined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ugars may be added; and ſhould the whale-fiſhery be ever revived, train oil and ſpermacaeti candels. The two firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles may be in a great meaſure confined to Maſſachuſetts. Their ſhoes are as good and as cheap as thoſe imported from Great-Britain, at leaſt as the ſale ſhoes. And as to the ſecond article, the exportation of them from thence is prohibited by act of Parliament. Both New-York and Pennſylvania manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture leather in all its branches, and hats; but not more than ſufficient for their own conſumption. Connecticut has no manufactures to export; nor has New-York, unleſs perhaps ſome refined ſugar. Jerſey has only domeſtic manufactures. Pennſylvania manufactures nails, refined ſugar, cotton cards, carriages, and, of late, paper for exportation. The Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware State has only domeſtic manufactures.</p>

                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:021264_0026_0FB2B8126A744D28"/>IF Maſſachuſetts can furniſh us with ſhoes, cards, train oil and ſpermacaeti candles; Pennſylvania with nails, white ſugar carriages, and paper, as cheap as we can procure them from beyond the Atlantic, why ſhould not ſuch European article be probibited? There is no probability that either the nor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thern or ſouthern States, will in many years become extenſive manufacturers. The price of labour and cheapneſs of land will prevent it; and the daily migrations from all the States to the weſtern parts of America, will keep up the one, and keep down the other. I have been informed, and I believe rightly informed, that the amount of the imports from Europe, is a great or greater in the eaſtern or middle States, as in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ern, in proportion to their numbers.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is a generally received opinion in this country, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THESE clauſes have been extremely miſunderſtood, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely miſconſtrued, by the enemies to the Conſtitution. Some have ſaid, <q>the abſolute unqualified command that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs

               <p>IS this the reſult of reaſon, or is it the dictate of reſentment? How can the command of Congreſs over the militia be either abſolute or unqualified, when its officers are appointed by the States, and conſequently can by no poſſibility become its crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
               <p>THEY will generally be men of property and probity: And can any one for a moment ſuppoſe that ſuch men will ever be ſo loſt to a ſenſe of liberty, the rights of their country, and their own dignity, as to become the inſtruments of arbitrary meaſures? Whenever that ſhall be the caſe, we may in vain contend for forms of government; the ſpirit of liberty will have taken its flight from America, and nothing but an arbitrary go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will be fit for ſuch a people, however accurately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined the powers of her Conſtitution may be. But ſo long as there ſhall be a militia ſo officered, or the majority of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple landholders, America will have little to fear for liberty. Congreſs have the power of organizing the militia; and can it be put into better hands? They can have no intereſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the perſonal liberty of any man, or raiſing his fortune in the mode of organization: They can make no law upon this, or any other ſubject, which will not affect themſelves, their children, or their connexions.</p>
               <p>CAN any one ſeriouſly ſuppoſe, that Congreſs will ever think of drawing the militia of one State out, in order to deſtroy the liberties of another? Of Virginia, for inſtance, to deſtroy the liberties of Pennſylvania? Or ſhould they be ſo wicked,

If the firſt, there will be few or no inhabitants; they will therefore induce people to ſettle it, by eſtabliſhing a mild government. If the ſecond, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of any particular diſtrict certainly have a right to ſubmit to whatever form of government they may think agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, provided the State within which the diſtrict lies, conſents; without giving offence to Virginia, or any other of the States.

                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:021264_0033_0FB2B81DD822D158"/>ALL writers upon finance hold taxes upon exports to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic. Yet there are doubtleſs ſome articles which will with propriety bear an export duty; ſuch as tobacco and perhaps indigo. But then theſe articles are of the growth of only five of the States; and it would be a manifeſt injuſtice that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of ſome States ſhould be taxed for the benefit of others. The latter part of the clauſe provides that all Naval Officers fees and port charges ſhall be the ſame throughout the United States; and that a veſſel bound to one State from another, and calling at any intermediate State, ſhall not be obliged to enter, clear, or pay duty, in ſuch State. This tends to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate the intercourſe among the States, and may produce many commercial conveniencies.</p>

               </p>
               <p>AS all appropriations of money are to be made by law, and regular ſtatements thereof publiſhed, no money can be applied but to the uſe of the United States.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THE firſt part of this clauſe proves the Convention had no ariſtocratical views, nor any idea of eſtabliſhing an order in the State, with rights independent of the people. The latter part of it is introduced to prevent the officers of the Federal Government being warped from their duty.</p>

               <p>THE States, in their individual capacities, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from the exerciſe of the powers enumerated in this clauſe, for a variety of reaſons. If any State ſhould have a right of making treaties, granting letters of marque, and the like, America might be perpetually involved in foreign wars. By exerciſing the right of coinage and of emitting bills of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, a State might, by the former, debaſe the currency of the United States, by mixing great quantities of alloy, and by that means defraud the Federal Treaſury; and by the latter it might defraud not only its own citizens, but the citizens of other States. But this is not all. An exerciſe of theſe rights would materially interfere with the exerciſe of the like by the Congreſs; and therefore the particular, ſhould give way to the general intereſt. The making any thing but gold and ſilver a tender in payment of debts, and the impairing the obligation of contracts, is ſo great a political injuſtice, that the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here requires of the States, that they will forever relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the exerciſe of a power ſo odious. This part of the clauſe would probably never have been introduced, had not ſome of the States afforded too frequent inſtances of unjuſt laws upon theſe ſubjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No State ſhall, without the conſent of the Congreſs, lay any impoſts or duties on imports and exports, except what may be obſolutely neceſſary for executing its inſpection laws; and the nett produce of all duties and impoſts, laid by any State on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports or exports, ſhall be for the uſe of the Treaſury of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States; and all ſuch laws ſhall be ſubject to the reviſion and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:021264_0035_0FB2B8227233AB58"/>
controul of the Congreſs. No State ſhall, without the conſent of Congreſs, lay any duty of tonnage, keep troops, or ſhips of war in time of peace, enter into any agreement or compact with another State, or with a foreign power, or engage in war; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs actually invaded, or in ſuch imminent danger, as will not admit of delay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF the individual States might lay duties upon the imports, it would be counteracting the ſame right in Congreſs, and ruin the great fund out of which the preſent federal debts are to be paid, as well as the future federal expences defrayed. And with regard to exports, it was highly reaſonable that one State ſhould be prohibited from laying an export duty on the articles of a ſiſter State, which may be ſhipped through that State.</p>
               <p>THE exigencies of the Union may however require direct taxes. By this clauſe, a door is open to the States, to raiſe their reſpective quotas, in lieu of direct taxes; by laying a duty upon exports; or even duties upon imports. But as the amount of theſe duties are to be paid into the public Treaſury, no inconvenience can, on the one hand, ariſe to the general welfare from them; and, on the other, the power of reviſion in the Congreſs will be the means of ſecuring a due attention to the intereſts of all the States, in the mode of laying the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as well as in the application of it. The latter part of the clauſe is no more than a confirmation of principles antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed, and of powers before veſted in the Congreſs; but ſuch as are abſolutely neceſſary for the good order, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and harmony of the whole; and are ſuch as the States have already yielded to the preſent Congreſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Article the 6th of the Confederation.</note>

                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:021264_0038_0FB2B828095626E8"/>IT is pretty certain that the Preſident can never become the ſovereign of America, but with the voluntary conſent of the people: He is re-elected by them; not by any body of men over whom he may have gained an undue influence. No citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of America has a fortune ſufficiently large, to enable him to raiſe and ſupport a ſingle regiment. The Preſident's ſalary will be greatly inadequate either to the purpoſe of gaining adherents, or of ſupporting a military force: He will poſſeſs no princely revenues, and his perſonal influence will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to his native State. Beſides, the Conſtitution has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that no perſon ſhall be eligible to the office, who is not thirty-five years old; and in the courſe of nature very few fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers leave a ſon who has arrived to that age. The powers of the Preſident are not kingly, any more than the enſigns of his office. He has no guards, no regalia, none of thoſe royal trappings which would ſet him apart from the reſt of his fellow citizens. Suppoſe the firſt Preſident ſhould be continued for life: What expectations can any man in the Union have to ſucceed him, except ſuch as are grounded upon the popularity of his character?</p>
               <p>NONE of its citizens poſſeſs diſtinct principalities, from whence money may be drawn to purchaſe, or armies raiſed to intimidate the votes. Fortunately for America, ſhe has no neighbouring Princeſs to interfere in her elections, or her councils: No Empreſs of Ruſſia to place the Crown upon the head of her favorite Powniotowſky.<note n="*" place="bottom">The preſent King of Poland was Staniſlaus Leginſki, Count Powniotowſky.</note>
               </p>
               <p>IT has alſo been objected, that a Council of State ought to have been aſſigned the Preſident. The want of it, is, in my apprehenſion, a perfection rather than a blemiſh. What pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe would ſuch a Council anſwer, but that of diminiſhing, or
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:021264_0039_0FB2B82AF84EEAC0"/>
annihilating the reſponſibility annexed to the character of the Preſident. From the ſuperiority of his talents, or the ſuperior dignity of his place, he would probably acquire an undue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over, and might induce a majority of them to adviſe meaſures injurious to the welfare of the States, at the ſame time that he would have the means of ſheltering himſelf from impeachment, under that majority. I will here once for all obſerve, that deſcended as we are from the Engliſh, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant as we are in the political hiſtory of that country, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible not to derive both political opinions, and prejudices, from that ſource. The objectors probably conſidered, that as in the Engliſh government, the firſt Magiſtrate has a Council of State; there ſhould be one alſo in the American. But they ſhould at the ſame time have recollected, that the King of England is not perſonnally reſponſible for his conduct; but that her Conſtitution looks up to his Miniſters, that is, to his Council, to anſwer for the meaſures of the Sovereign. But in the American Conſtitution, the firſt Magiſtrate is the efficient Miniſter of the people, and as ſuch, ought to be alone reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for his conduct. Let him act purſuant to the dictates of his own judgment; let him adviſe with his friends; let him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>THE firſt of theſe clauſes is intended to prevent intrigue and tumult in chuſing the Electors: And the reaſons already of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, why Congreſs ſhould have the right of altering "the times and manner of holding the elections for Senators," ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply why they ſhould have the power of determining the time of chuſing Electors. The fifth is an additional check upon the Preſident.</p>
               <p>Sect. 2. <hi>The Preſident ſhall be Commander in Chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the ſeveral States, when called into the actual ſervice of the United States: He may require the opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in each of the Executive departments, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſubject relating to the duties of their reſpective offices,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:021264_0041_0FB2B82D9D037D80"/>
and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt the United States, except in caſes of impeachment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE powers veſted in the Preſident by this and the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent clauſe, belong, from the nature of them, to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive branch of government; and could be placed in no other hands with propriety.</p>
               <p>SO long as laws can not provide for every caſe that may happen: So long as puniſhments ſhall continue diſproportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to crimes, the power of pardoning ſhould ſome where exiſt. With whom could this power, ſo precious to huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, be better entruſted, than with the Preſident? An offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer who, from his age and experience, will ſeldom be miſled in the exerciſe of it; and who leſs liable to the influence of prejudice and paſſion than a popular aſſembly, will moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be guided by diſcretion in the uſe of it.</p>
               <p>WHY Governor Randolph ſhould wiſh to take from him this power, at leaſt in caſes of treaſon; and why he ſhould have made a diſtinction between the power of pardoning before, and after conviction; I am at a loſs to conceive; and ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore attempt no further anſwer to an objection which appears to me, unſupported by reaſon.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Governor Randolph's letter. He has enforced none of his objections with reaſons.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſhall have power, by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors preſent concur; and he ſhall nominate, and by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, ſhall appoint Ambaſſadors, other public Miniſters and Conſuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whoſe appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not herein otherwiſe provided for, and which ſhall be

eſtabliſhed by law. But the Congreſs may, by law, veſt the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of ſuch inferior officers, as they think proper, in the Preſident alone, in the Courts of law, or in the heads of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Conſtitution has here leſſened the authority of the Preſident, by making the aſſent of two-thirds of the Senate neceſſary in the important caſes of making treaties, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing Ambaſſadors, the Judges of the Supreme Court, and the great officers of State.</p>
               <p>WRITERS upon government have eſtabliſhed it as a maxim, that the Executive and Legiſlative authority ſhould be kept ſeparate. But the poſition ſhould be taken with conſiderable latitude. The Executive authority here given to a branch of the Legiſlature, is no novelty, in free governments. In Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the Executive, or Cabinet Council, is taken indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from either Houſe of Parliament. In the States of New York and Jerſey, the Senate not only act as an Executive Council, but alſo form a part of the Court of Appeals.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is to be obſerved, that this is the only inſtance where the Senate have the ſhadow of Executive power.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THE following reaſons ſuggeſt themſelves in ſupport of the propriety of veſting the Preſident and Senate with the power of making treaties.</p>
               <p>THE Preſident is the Repreſentative of the Union: The Senate the Repreſentatives of the reſpective States. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of treaties muſt always be either of great national import, or ſuch as concern the States in their individual capacities; but never can concern the individual members of the State. Secrecy and diſpatch are neceſſary in making them: For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſecrecy and diſpatch, they are ſeldom made to purpoſe. Hence ariſes the impropriety of conſulting either the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:021264_0043_0FB2B835900D7B58"/>
of the people, or the different States. If the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were conſulted, the intereſts of the ſmall States might be ſacrificed; if the latter, almoſt inſurmountable obſtacles would be thrown in the way of every negotiation.</p>
               <p>IN the Dutch Republic the States-General are obliged to conſult their conſtituents, upon this, as upon every important occaſion, however urgent may be the neceſſity. This vice in their Federal Conſtitution has more than once brought them to the brink of ruin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Preſident ſhall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the receſs of the Senate, by granting commiſſions which ſhall expire at the end of their next ſeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS inoffenſive clauſe is made a ground of objection by Governor Randolph! I wiſh he had informed us wherefore.</p>
               <p>Sect. 3. <hi>He ſhall from time to time give to the Congreſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the ſtate of the Union, and recommend to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſuch meaſures as he ſhall judge neceſſary and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: He may on extraordinary occaſions, convene both Houſes, or either of them, and in caſe of diſagreement between them, with reſpect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to ſuch time as he ſhall think proper: He ſhall receive Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors and other public Miniſters: He ſhall take care that the laws be faithfully executed; and ſhall commiſſion all the officers of the United States.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE powers given by this ſection are ſuch as in all govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, have always been, and muſt neceſſarily be, veſted in the firſt magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>Sect. 4. <hi>The Preſident, Vice-Preſident, and all civil officers of the United States, ſhall be removed from office on impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for, and conviction of, treaſon, bribery, or other high crimes and miſdemeanors.</hi>

They have told them the Federal Court, like Aron's rod, would ſwallow up all the judiciary authority of the reſpective States. That a citizen of Virginia may be forced to Philadelphia for a debt of 5<abbr>l.</abbr> although it was contracted with a fellow citizen: And, above all, that the trial by jury is not preſerved.

               </p>
               <p>THE Convention ſenſible of this defect, has wiſely aſſigned the cognizance of theſe and other controverſies to a proper tribunal, a Court of Law.</p>
               <p>AMONG theſe controverſies, there is but one poſſible caſe where a diſpute between two citizens of the ſame State can be carried, even by appeal, to the Federal Court; and that is, when they claim the ſame land under grants from different States. As their title is derived through States, this caſe is preciſely within the reaſon which applies to controverſies wherein two States are parties.</p>
               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING this, we are told that in the moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary caſes, a citizen of Virginia may be dragged within the appellate juriſdiction of the Federal Court, although the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action which gave riſe to the controverſy originated between fellow citizens. This, it is ſaid, may be effected, by aſſigning a bond, for inſtance, given by one fellow citizen to another, either to a foreigner or a citizen of another State. To this I anſwer, that ſuch aſſignment would not be attended with any ſuch conſequence; becauſe it is a principle in law, that the aſſignee ſtands in the place of the aſſignor; and is neither in a better nor a worſe condition. It is likewiſe aſſerted, that if two citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the ſame State claim lands lying in a different State,

               <p>AND I repeat it again, becauſe it cannot be too often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that but one poſſible caſe exiſts, where a controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween citizens of the ſame State can be carried into the Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Court. How then is it poſſible that the Federal Court can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ver ſwallow up the State juriſdictions, or be converted to the purpoſes of oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>SEVERAL reaſons occur why the Federal Court ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs an appellate juriſdiction in controverſies between foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and citizens, and between the citizens of different States. A foreigner ſhould have the privilege of carrying his ſuit to the Federal Court, as well for the ſake of juſtice, as from po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical motives. Were he confined to ſeek redreſs in the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of that State, wherein he received the injury, he might not obtain it, from the influence of his adverſary; and by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him this additional and certain means of obtaining juſtice, foreigners will be encouraged to trade with us, to give us cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and to employ their capitals in our country. Then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies muſt for the moſt part ariſe from commercial tranſactions, by which the bulk of the people can be ſeldom effected. The firſt part of this reaſoning equally applies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies between citizens of different States. Beſides, were the juriſdiction of the Federal Court not coextenſive with the government itſelf, as far as foreigners are concerned, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy between individuals might produce a national quarrel, which commencing in repriſals, would probably terminate in war. Suppoſe a ſubject of France or Great Britain ſhould complain to the Miniſter reſiding at the ſeat of Congreſs, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>I WILL take leave to inform them, that by our laws a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of important cauſes are daily determined without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of a jury, not only in the Court of Chancery, but in thoſe of common law; and that by ſeveral of our acts of Aſſembly, the General Court has a power of aſſeſſing fines as high as 500<abbr>l.</abbr> for inconſiderable delinquencies, without the intervention of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>AS I have before obſerved, theſe cauſes will be from the nature of things, generally mercantile diſputes; muſt be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of account, which will be referred to commiſſioners, as is the practice of all common law Courts in ſimilar caſes. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be neceſſary that the facts ſhould be ſtated, no doubt they will be found by a jury of the State, from whence the cauſe is carried; and will be made a part of the record.</p>
               <p>IN criminal caſes, the trial by jury is moſt important. In criminal caſes the Conſtitution has eſtabliſhed it unequivocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>TO this it may be anſwered, that the out-lines of the piece are traced with ſufficient accuracy: That to have entered mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely into this ſubject, to have filled it with all its parts would have employed almoſt as much time as framing the Conſtitution itſelf, and would have ſpun out the work to a tedious length.

               <p>I CONFESS myſelf at a loſs to conceive what better mode could have been adopted. If the ſyſtem be reduced to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and experience ſhall diſcover important defects, there can be no doubt but that two-thirds of Congreſs will be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, and will point them out to the different Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. On the other hand, it is equally certain, that if the defects be flagrant, they will be readily ſeen by two thirds of the Legiſlatures, and a Convention will neceſſarily be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: Nor is there any cauſe to apprehend, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of ſuch Convention, will be rejected by one-fourth of the States: Since all the States muſt feel the inconvenience of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant defects.</p>
               <p>BUT, ſay the friends to previous amendments, friends, as many of them pretend even to an energetic Federal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Gerry's, Mr. Maſon's, and Governor Randolph's, objections.</note> why not amend the Conſtitution before it is adopted? To this it may be anſwered, that they ſhould firſt demonſtrate their objections to be well founded; and that their propoſed amendments, if they can be ſaid to have offered any, would make it better. I am inclined to think, that neither Mr. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's, Mr. Maſon's, nor Governor Randolph's, would. Upon this occaſion I hope I ſhall be excuſed for recommending to thoſe gentlemen, as well as to other objectors, Dr. Franklin's laſt ſpeech in the Convention, which is replete with good ſenſe,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:021264_0055_0FB2B84F00E5CC20"/>
as well as a marked deference for the opinions of others. If the objections of theſe gentlemen be groundleſs, the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion needs no amendment; if they be not, it cannot be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the manner they propoſe. Mr. Maſon, Mr. Randolph, the State of Virginia, raiſe objections: Mr. Gerry, and the State of Maſſachuſetts, do the ſame: Every other citizen, every other State, has an equal right. A new Convention is formed, the propoſed plan is amended, or a new one produced. It is again preſented to the public eye. New blemiſhes appear new amendments are thought neceſſary. That which Mr. Maſon may think a perfection, another may think a fault: What would be agreeable to Maſſachuſetts, might diſpleaſe Virginia. In a word, there would be no end to objections, amendments, and Conventions. All federal government falls to the ground. Anarchy enſues, and produces convulſions, which inevitably end in deſpotiſm.</p>

Mr. Gerry's and Mr. Maſon's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections take up but a ſmall compaſs: But neither of theſe gentlemen has deigned to give us any thing like argument in ſupport of his objections. Mr. Randolph has ſaid much to point out the neceſſity of an energetic federal government; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to prove that his propoſed amendments are founded in reaſon. And Mr. Lee would have the government wholly new modelled to pleaſe himſelf. I ſuſpect ſome of theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have upon this occaſion too much reſembled Dr. Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin's French lady. I would aſk Mr. Lee what advantage would reſult from a numerous repreſentation in a federal Congreſs? If the numbers in America are not greatly exage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, one member for every 30,000 will make the Houſe of Repreſentatives to conſiſt of an 100; which number will be increaſed every ten years. Has not Mr. Lee's experience in public affairs taught him that even that is a number too large to tranſact buſineſs with facility? But let the number of that Houſe be relatively great or ſmall, it can in no ſenſe be a rag or part of a repreſentation. That Houſe ſtands, as to fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral purpoſes, in the place of the citizens of the thirteen States, and poſſeſſes all the powers conceded to it by the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of thoſe States, conſequently ten perſons would be as much a repreſentation as an hundred. Had Mr. Lee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this government as intended for thirteen different States; had he conſidered that the powers veſted in the Congreſs are merely national, that is ſuch as reſpect America in its relative ſituation with foreign nations, or ſuch as reſpect the relative ſituation of the States in their individual capacities; and that the States ſtill retain the moſt important part of their rights, in as much as the right of Legiſlation in domeſtic caſes, is of much greater conſequence than in foreign, I think he never would have made the obſervation.</p>

            <p>THE foregoing little piece was intended to counteract the miſrepreſentations of the propoſed Federal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the antifederaliſts have moſt induſtriouſly diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in the ſouthern counties. The writer had no idea of publiſhing any thing upon the ſubject of the Conſtitution, till a viſit he made to one of thoſe counties, where at the deſire of his friend, he was induced to write in haſte the pamphlet now offered to the public. It was to have been publiſhed time enough to be diſperſed before the elections, but the Printer found it impoſſible to deliver it in time. The primary inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being thus defeated, it would not have been publiſhed at all, had it not been put into the preſs at the time ſtipulated. The writer had neither Mr. Maſon's, Mr. Gerry's, nor Mr. Lee's objections by him: This it is hoped will be a ſufficient apology for its inaccuracies, as far as their objections have been taken notice of. He takes this opportunity of obſerving, that perhaps he, and not Governor Randolph, is miſtaken as to the <hi>impeachability</hi> of the Senate: He acknowledges that he has never converſed with any member of the late Convention upon the ſubject, though he ſtill thinks that the arguments be

He does not pretend to have gone fully into the objections which have been raiſed to the government: His deſign was to obviate only the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, and in a manner as popular as he was able.</p>
