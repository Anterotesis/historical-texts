            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Congreſs met according to Adjournment, and Reſumed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Yeſterday. And upon mature Deliberation, agreed to the following Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Rights and Grievances of the Coloniſts, in <hi>America,</hi> which were Ordered to be inſerted.</p>
               <p>The Members of this Congreſs, ſincerely devoted, with the warmeſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of Affection and Duty to his Majeſty's Perſon and Government, inviolably attached to the preſent happy Eſtabliſhment of the Proteſtant Succeſſion, and with Minds deeply impreſſed by a Senſe of the preſent and impending Misfortunes of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies on this Continent; having conſidered as maturely as Time will permit, the Circumſtances of the ſaid Colonies, eſteem it our indiſpenſable Duty, to make the following Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of our humble Opinion, reſpecting the moſt Eſſential Rights and Liberties of the Coloniſts, and of the Grievances under which they labour, by Reaſon of ſeveral late Acts of Parliament.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That his Majeſty's Subjects in theſe Colonies, owe the ſame Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that is owing from his Subjects born within the Realm, and all due Subordination to that Auguſt Body the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. That his Majeſty's Liege Subjects in theſe Colonies, are entitled to all the inherent Rights and Liberties of his Natural born Subjects, within the Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. That it is inſeparably eſſential to the Freedom of a People, and the undoubted Right of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> that no Taxes be impoſed on them, but with their own Conſent, given perſonally, or by their Repreſentatives.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That the People of theſe Colonies are not, and from their local Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances cannot be, Repreſented in the Houſe of Commons in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. That the only Repreſentatives of the People of theſe Colonies, are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons choſen therein by themſelves, and that no Taxes ever have been, or can be Conſtitutionally impoſed on them, but by their reſpective Legiſlature.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. That all Supplies to the Crown, being free Gifts of the People, it is unreaſonable and inconſiſtent with the Principles and Spirit of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Conſtitution, for the People of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> to grant to his Majeſty the Property of the Coloniſts.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. That Trial by Jury, is the inherent and invaluable Right of every <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subject in theſe Colonies.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:010424_0016_0FFE630F39B9DCD0"/>VIII. That the late Act of Parliament, entitled, <hi>An Act for granting and applying certain Stamp Duties, and other Duties, in the</hi> Britiſh <hi>Colonies and Plantations in</hi> America, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by impoſing Taxes on the Inhabitants of theſe Colonies, and the ſaid Act, and ſeveral other Acts, by extending the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Courts of Admiralty beyond its ancient Limits, have a manifeſt Tendency to ſubvert the Rights and Liberties of the Coloniſts.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. That the Duties impoſed by ſeveral late Acts of Parliament, from the peculiar Circumſtances of theſe Colonies, will be extremely Burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and Grievous; and from the ſcarcity of Specie, the Payment of them abſolutely impracticable.</p>
               <p n="10">X. That as the Profits of the Trade of theſe Colonies ultimately center in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> to pay for the Manufactures which they are obliged to take from thence, they eventually contribute very largely to all Supplies granted there to the Crown.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. That the Reſtrictions impoſed by ſeveral late Acts of Parliament, on the Trade of theſe Colonies, will render them unable to purchaſe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">XII. That the Increaſe, Proſperity, and Happineſs of theſe Colonies, depend on the full and free Enjoyment of their Rights and Liberties, and an Intercourſe with <hi>Great-Britain</hi> mutually Affectionate and Advantageous.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. That it is the Right of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects in theſe Colonies, to Petition the King, or either Houſe of Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That it is the indiſpenſable Duty of theſe Colonies, to the beſt of Sovereigns, to the Mother Country, and to themſelves, to endeavour by a loyal and dutiful Addreſs to his Majeſty, and humble Applications to both Houſes of Parliament, to procure the Repeal of the Act for granting and applying certain Stamp Duties, of all Clauſes of any other Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty is extended as aforeſaid, and of the other late Acts for the Reſtriction of <hi>American</hi> Commerce.</p>
               <p>Upon Motion, Voted, That <hi>Robert R. Livingston, William Samuel Johnſon,</hi> and <hi>William Murdock,</hi> Eſquires, be a Committee to prepare an Addreſs to his Majeſty, and lay the ſame before the Congreſs on Monday next.</p>
               <p>Voted alſo, That <hi>John Rutledge, Edward Tilghman,</hi> and <hi>Philip Livingston,</hi> Eſquires, be a Committee to prepare a Memorial and Petition to the Lords in Parliament, and lay the ſame before the Congreſs on Monday next.</p>
               <p>Voted alſo, That <hi>Thomas Lynch, James Otis,</hi> and <hi>Thomas M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Kean,</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, be a Committee to prepare a Petition to the Houſe of Commons of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and lay the ſame before the Congreſs on Monday next.</p>

                  <p>THAT the Inhabitants of theſe Colonies, Unanimouſly devoted with the warmeſt Sentiments of Duty and Affection to your Majeſty's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Perſon and Government, Inviolably attached to the preſent Happy Eſtabliſhment of the Proteſtant Succeſſion in your Illuſtrious Houſe, and deeply ſenſible of your Royal Attention to their Proſperity and Happineſs,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010424_0018_0FFE62A0C6781120"/>
humbly beg Leave to approach the Throne, by repreſenting to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, That theſe Colonies were Originally Planted by Subjects of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown, who, animated with the Spirit of Liberty, encouraged by your Majeſty's Royal Predeceſſors, and confiding in the Public Faith for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all the Rights and Liberties eſſential to Freedom, emigrated from their Native Country to this Continent, and by their ſucceſsful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in the midſt of innumerable Dangers and Difficulties, together with a Profuſion of their Blood and Treaſure, have happily added theſe vaſt and valuable Dominions to the Empire of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> That for the Enjoyment of theſe Rights and Liberties, ſeveral Governments were early formed in the ſaid Colonies, with full Power of Legiſlation, agreeable to the Principles of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>That under thoſe Governments, theſe Liberties, thus veſted in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and tranſmitted to their Poſterity, have been exerciſed and enjoyed, and by the ineſtimable Bleſſings thereof (under the Favour of Almighty GOD), the inhoſpitable Deſarts of <hi>America</hi> have been converted into Flouriſhing Countries; Science, Humanity, and the Knowledge of Divine Truths, diffuſed through Remote Regions of Ignorance, Infidelity, and Barbariſm; the Number of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects wonderfully Increaſed, and the Wealth and Power of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> proportionably Augmented.</p>
                  <p>That by Means of theſe Settlements, and the unparallelled Succeſs of your Majeſty's Arms, a Foundation is now laid for rendering the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire the moſt Extenſive and Powerful of any Recorded in Hiſtory. Our Connection with this Empire, we eſteem our greateſt Happineſs and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and humbly conceive it may now be ſo eſtabliſhed by your Royal Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as to endure to the lateſt Period of Time; This, with moſt humble Submiſſion to your Majeſty, we apprehend will be moſt effectually Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, by fixing the Pillars thereof on Liberty and Juſtice, and ſecuring the inherent Rights and Liberties of your Subjects here, upon the Principles of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution. To this Conſtitution theſe Two Principles are eſſential, the Right of your faithful Subjects, freely to grant to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, ſuch Aids as are required for the Support of your Government over them, and other Public Exigencies, and Trials by their Peers: By the One they are ſecured from unreaſonable Impoſitions; and by the Other from Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Deciſions of the executive Power.</p>
                  <p>The Continuation of theſe Liberties to the Inhabitants of <hi>America</hi> we ardently Implore, as abſolutely neceſſary to Unite the ſeveral Parts of your wide extended Dominions, in that Harmony ſo Eſſential to the Preſervation and Happineſs of the Whole. Protected in theſe Liberties, the Emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Great-Britain</hi> receives from us, however great at preſent, are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, compared with thoſe ſhe has the faireſt Proſpect of acquiring. By this Protection ſhe will for ever ſecure to herſelf the Advantage of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying to all <hi>Europe,</hi> the Merchandises which <hi>America</hi> furniſhes, and of Supplying through the ſame Channel, whatever is wanted from thence. Here opens a boundleſs Source of Wealth and Naval Strength; yet theſe immenſe Advantages, by the Abridgment of thoſe invaluable Rights and Liberties, by which our Growth has been Nouriſhed, are in Danger of

being for ever Loſt; and our ſubordinate Legiſlatures, in Effect, rendered uſeleſs, by the late Acts of Parliament impoſing Duties and Taxes on theſe Colonies, and extending the Juriſdiction of the Courts of Admiralty here, beyond its antient Limits: Statutes by which your Majeſty's Commons in <hi>Britain</hi> undertake, abſolutely to diſpoſe of the Property of their Fellow Subjects in <hi>America,</hi> without their Conſent, and for the enforcing whereof, they are ſubjected to the Determination of a ſingle Judge in a Court un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrained by the wiſe Rules of the Common Law, the Birthright of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen,</hi> and the Safeguard of their Perſons and Properties.</p>
                  <p>The invaluable Rights of Taxing ourſelves, and Trial by our Peers, of which we implore your Majeſty's Protection, are not, we moſt humbly conceive Unconſtitutional; but confirmed by the Great CHARTER of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberty. On the Firſt of theſe Rights the Honourable the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Found their Practice of Originating Money Bills, a Right enjoyed by the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> until relinquiſhed by themſelves, a Right, in fine, which all other your Majeſty's <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, both within, and without the Realm, have hitherto enjoyed.</p>
                  <p>With Hearts therefore impreſſed with the moſt indelible Characters of Gratitude to your Majeſty, and to the Memory of the Kings of your Illuſtrious Houſe, whoſe Reigns have been Signally diſtinguiſhed by their Auſpicious Influence on the Proſperity of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions, and convinced by the moſt affecting Proofs of your Majeſty's Paternal Love to all your People, however diſtant, and your unceaſing and benevolent Deſires to promote their Happineſs, We moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſty, that you will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to take into your Royal Conſideration, the Diſtreſſes of your faithful Subjects on this Continent, and to lay the ſame before your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Parliament, and to afford them ſuch Relief, as in your Royal Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom their unhappy Circumſtances ſhall be judged to require.</p>

                  <p>That your Memorialiſts humbly conceive one of the moſt eſſential Rights of theſe Colonies, which they have ever, till lately, uninterruptedly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, to be Trial by Jury.</p>

                  <p>But your Memorialiſts humbly beg Leave to repreſent to your Lordſhips, That the Act for granting certain Stamp Duties in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> &amp;c. fills his Majeſty's <hi>American</hi> Subjects with the deepeſt Concern, as it tends to deprive them of the Two fundamental and invaluable Rights and Liberties above mentioned, and that ſeveral other late Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which extend the Juriſdiction and Powers of Courts of Admiralty in the Plantations, beyond their Limits in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> thereby make an unneceſſary and unhappy Diſtinction as to the Modes of Trial, between us and our Fellow Subjects there, by whom we never have been excelled in Duty and Loyalty to our Sovereign.</p>
                  <p>That from the natural Connection between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> the perpetual Continuance of which your Memorialiſts moſt ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, they conceive that nothing can Conduce more to the Intereſt of both, than the Coloniſts free Enjoyment of their Rights and Liberties, and an affectionate Intercourſe between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and them.

               <p>Your Petitioners therefore moſt ardently implore the Attention of the Honourable Houſe, to the united and dutiful Repreſentation of their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and to their earneſt Supplications for Relief, from thoſe Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which have already involv'd this Continent in Anxiety, Confuſion, and Diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>We moſt ſincerely recognize our Allegiance to the Crown, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all due Subordination to the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and ſhall always retain the moſt grateful Senſe of their Aſſiſtance and Protection. It is from and under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution, we derive all our Civil and Religious Rights and Liberties: We Glory in being Subjects of the beſt of Kings, and having been Born under the moſt perfect Form of Government; but it is with moſt ineffable and humiliating Sorrow, that we find ourſelves, of late, deprived of the Right of Granting our own Property for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010424_0022_0FFE752FD4F66CB0"/>
Service, to which our Lives and Fortunes are entirely devoted, and to which, on his Royal Requiſitions, we leave ever been ready to contribute to the utmoſt of our Abilities.</p>
               <p>We have alſo the Misfortune to find, that all the Penalties and Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures mentioned in the Stamp Act, and in divers late Acts of Trade extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Plantations, are, at the Election of the Informer, Recoverable in any Court of Admiralty in <hi>America.</hi> This, as the newly erected Court of Admiralty has a general Juriſdiction over all <hi>Britiſh America,</hi> renders his Majeſty's Subjects in theſe Colonies, liable to be carried, at an immense Expence, from one End of the Continent, to the other.</p>
               <p>It gives us alſo great Pain, to ſee a manifeſt Diſtinction made therein, between the Subjects of our Mother Country, and thoſe in the Colonies, in that the like Penalties and Forfeitures recoverable there only in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Courts of Record, are made cognizable here by a Court of Admiralty: By theſe Means we ſeem to be, in Effect, unhappily deprived of Two Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges eſſential to Freedom, and which all <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> have ever conſidered as their beſt Birthrights, that of being free from all Taxes but ſuch as they have conſented to in Perſon, or by their Repreſentatives, and of Trial by their Peers.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioners further ſhew, That the remote Situation, and other Circumſtances of the Colonies, render it impracticable that they ſhould be Repreſented, but in their reſpective ſubordinate Legiſlature; and they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, that the Parliament, adhering ſtrictly to the Principles of the Conſtitution, have never hitherto Tax'd any, but thoſe who were actually therein Repreſented; for this Reaſon, we humbly apprehend, they never have Tax'd <hi>Ireland,</hi> or any other of the Subjects without the Realm.</p>
               <p>But were it ever ſo clear, that the Colonies might in Law, be reaſonably deem'd to be Repreſented in the Honourable Houſe of Commons, yet we conceive, that very good Reaſons, from Inconvenience, from the Principles of true Policy, and from the Spirit of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Conſtitution, may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſhew, that it would be for the real Intereſt of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as well as her Colonies, that the late Regulations ſhould be reſcinded, and the ſeveral Acts of Parliament impoſing Duties and Taxes on the Colonies, and extending the Juriſdiction of the Courts of Admiralty here, beyond their ancient Limits, ſhould be Repeal'd.</p>
               <p>We ſhall not Attempt a minute Detail of all the Reaſons which the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Honourable Houſe may ſuggeſt, on this Occaſion, but would humbly ſubmit the following Particulars to their Conſideration.</p>
               <p>That Money is already become very ſcarce in theſe Colonies, and is still decreaſing by the neceſſary Exportation of Specie from the Continent, for the Diſcharge of our Debts to <hi>Britiſh</hi> Merchants.</p>
               <p>That immensely heavy Debt is yet due from the Colonies for British Manufactures, and that they are still heavily burthen'd with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Arrearages due for Aide granted by them in the late War.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:010424_0023_0FFE75388E520BD0"/>That the Balance of Trade will ever be much againſt the Colonies, and in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> whilſt we conſume her Manufactures, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for which muſt ever Increaſe in Proportion to the Number of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants ſettled here, with the Means of Purchaſing them. We therefore humbly conceive it to be the Intereſt of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> to increaſe, rather that diminiſh, thoſe Means, as the Profits of all the Trade of the Colonies ultimately center there to pay for her Manufactures, as we are not allowed to purchaſe elſewhere; and by the Conſumption of which, at the advanced Prices the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Taxes oblige the Makers and Venders to ſet on them, we eventually contribute very largely to the Revenue of the Crown.</p>
               <p>That from the Nature of <hi>American</hi> Buſineſs, the Multiplicity of Suits and Papers uſed in Matters of ſmall Value, in a Country where Freeholds are ſo minutely divided, and Property ſo frequently tranſferr'd, a Stamp Duty muſt ever be very Burthenſome and Unequal.</p>
               <p>That it is extremely improbable that the Honourable Houſe of Commons, ſhou'd at all Times, be thoroughly acquainted with our Condition, and all Facts requiſite to a juſt and equal Taxation of the Colonies.</p>
               <p>It is alſo humbly ſubmitted, Whether there be not a material Diſtinction in Reaſon and ſound Policy, at leaſt, between the neceſſary Exerciſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Juriſdiction in general Acts, for the Amendment of the Common Law, and the Regulation of Trade and Commerce through the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the Exerciſe of that Juriſdiction, by impoſing Taxes on the Colonies.</p>
               <p>That the ſeveral ſubordinate Provincial Legiſlatures have been moulded into Forms, as nearly reſembling that of their Mother Country, as by his Majeſty's Royal Predeceſſors was thought convenient; and their Legiſlatures ſeem to have been wiſely and graciouſly eſtabliſhed, that the Subjects in the Colonies might, under the due Adminiſtration thereof, enjoy the happy Fruits of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Government, which in their preſent Circumſtances, they cannot be ſo fully and clearly availed of, any other Way under theſe Forms of Government we and our Anceſtors have been Born or Settled, and have had our Lives, Liberties, and Properties, protected. The People here, as every where elſe, retain a great Fondneſs for their old Cuſtoms and Uſages, and we truſt that his Majeſty's Service, and the Intereſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo far from being obſtructed, have been vaſtly promoted by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Legiſlatures.</p>
               <p>That we eſteem our Connections with, and Dependance on <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as one of our greateſt Bleſſings, and apprehend the latter will appear to be ſufficiently ſecure, when it is conſidered, that the Inhabitants in the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have the moſt unbounded Affection for his Majeſty's Perſon, Family, and Government, as well as for the Mother Country, and that their Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the Parliament, is univerſally acknowledged.</p>
               <p>We therefore moſt humbly entreat, That the Honourable Houſe would be pleaſed to hear our Counſel in Support of this Petition, and take our diſtreſſed and deplorable Caſe into their ſerious Conſideration, and that the

Acts and Clauſes of Acts, ſo grievouſly reſtraining our Trade and Commerce, impoſing Duties and Taxes on our Property, and extending the Juriſdiction of the Court of Admiralty beyond its ancient Limits, may be repeal'd; or that the Honourable Houſe would otherwiſe relieve your Petitioners, as in your great Wiſdom and Goodneſs ſhall ſeem meet.</p>

               <p>(COPY.) YOUR Letter dated in <hi>June</hi> laſt, acquainting me, that the Houſe of Repreſentatives of your Province, had Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agreed to propoſe a Meeting at the City of <hi>New-York,</hi> of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, from the Houſes of Repreſentatives of the ſeveral <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies on this Continent, on the Firſt Tueſday in <hi>October</hi> next, to conſult together on the preſent Circumſtances of the Colonies, and the Difficulties to which they are, and muſt be reduced, by the Operation of the Acts of Parliament for laying Duties and Taxes on the Colonies, and to conſider of an humble Repreſentation of their Condition to his Majeſty and the Parliament, and to implore Relief, came to Hand at an unlucky Seaſon, it being in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the General Aſſembly of this Province; nevertheleſs, immediately upon the Receipt of your Letter, I diſpatch'd Expreſſes to the ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of this Province, acquainting them with the Purport thereof, and requeſting them to meet at this Place without delay, and accordingly they met here on Monday laſt, to the Number of Sixteen, being a large Majority of the Repreſentatives of this Province, the Whole conſiſting of Twenty-five Perſons; but his Excellency our Governor being applied to, did not think it expedient to call them together on the Occaſion, which is the Reaſon of their not ſending a Committee, as propoſed by your Houſe,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010424_0025_0FFE7547C7C47AC8"/>
for you may be aſſured, <hi>Sir,</hi> that no Repreſentatives on this Continent, can more ſincerely concur in the Meaſures propoſed, than do the Repreſentatives of this Province now met together, neither can any People, as Individuals, more warmly Eſpouſe the Common Cauſe of the Colonies, than do the People of this Province.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemen now preſent, requeſt it as a Favour, you'll be pleaſed to ſend me a Copy of ſuch Repreſentation as may be agreed upon by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Committees at <hi>New-York,</hi> and acquaint me how, and in what Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the ſame is to be lain before the King and Parliament, whether by any Perſon particularly authorized for that Purpoſe, or by the Colony Agents. The General Aſſembly of this Province ſtands Prorogued to the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Day of <hi>October</hi> next, which is the Time it generally meets for the Diſpatch of the Ordinary Buſineſs of the Province; and I doubt not, the Repreſentatives of this Province, will then, in their Legiſlative Capacity, take under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, the Grievances ſo juſtly complain'd of, and tranſmit their Senſe of the ſame to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in ſuch Way, as may ſeem beſt calculated to obtain Redreſs, and ſo as to convince the Siſter Colonies of their inviolable Attachment to the Common Cauſe.

               <p>WE had the Honour to be appointed by the Houſe of Repreſentatives of the Province of <hi>Maryland,</hi> a Committee, to meet Committees of the Members of Aſſembly of the other Colonies, on this Continent, at <hi>New-York,</hi> the Firſt of this Inſtant, to join in a general, and united, duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, loyal, and humble Repreſentation of the Condition of thoſe Colonies, to his Majeſty and the Parliament, and to implore Relief from the grievous Burthens lately laid upon our Trade, and the Taxes and Duties lately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on us, eſpecially by the STAMP-ACT.</p>
               <p>Accordingly Members from Nine Colonies met, <hi>to wit,</hi> from the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts-Bay, Connecticut, Rhode-Iſland</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> Plantations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>New-York, New-Jerſey, Pennſylvania,</hi> the Government of the Counties of <hi>New-Caſtle, Kent,</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> upon <hi>Delaware, Maryland,</hi> and <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> but
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010424_0027_0FFE7557F41FEEE0"/>
as you'll find the Addreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Signed only by Members from Six of thoſe Colonies, it may be proper to acquaint you with the Reaſons why they did not all Sign, tho' they all concurr'd with the Proceedings.</p>
               <p>The Lieutenant Governor of <hi>New-York</hi> Prorogued their Aſſembly from Time to Time, ſo that their Houſe had not an Opportunity of appointing Members with full Powers to join, and Sign the Addreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet the Aſſembly of <hi>New-York,</hi> having at their laſt Meeting, appointed Five of their Members as a Committee, not only to Correſpond with their Agent at Home, but alſo during the Receſs of the Houſe, to write to, and correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with, the ſeveral Aſſemblies, or Committees of Aſſemblies on this Continent, on the ſubject Matter of the ſeveral late Acts of Parliament, ſo Grievous and Dangerous to their Colonies, it was thought proper to admit this Committee to join in the Conferences, and they agreed to what was done, and promiſed to uſe their Endeavours with their Aſſembly to concur alſo whenever they ſhould be permitted to meet.</p>
               <p>The <hi>South-Carolina</hi> Aſſembly, not rightly viewing the Propoſal (which Originally came from the Aſſembly of the Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi>) as it was intended that the ſeveral Committees, when met, ſhould Frame and Sign an Addreſs to his Majeſty, and Memorial and Petition to the Parliament, to be immediately Diſpatch'd by the Congreſs, Inſtructed their Members (Messrs. <hi>Lynch, Rutledge,</hi> and <hi>Gadsden,</hi>) to return their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to them, for Approbation. The <hi>Connecticut</hi> Aſſembly made the ſame Reſtrictions in their Inſtructions. The Aſſembly alſo of <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> wrote, that they had Reſolved, That notwithſtanding they were Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuch a Repreſentation ought to be made, and approved of the propoſed Method for obtaining thereof, yet the preſent Situation of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Affairs, wou'd not permit them to appoint a Committee to attend ſuch Meeting, but ſhou'd be ready to join in any Addreſs to his Majeſty and the Parliament they might be honoured with the Knowledge of, probable to anſwer the propoſed End: And the Speaker of the Aſſembly of <hi>Georgia</hi> wrote, that a Majority of their Members had applied to the Governor to call their Aſſembly, and he did not think it Expedient, which was the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they did not ſend a Committee as propoſed, but requeſted us to tranſmit a Copy of our Proceedings to them (which will be done) and that their Aſſembly wou'd meet about this Time, and he did not doubt but they ſhou'd Act ſo as to convince the Siſter Colonies of their inviolable Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Common Cauſe: We alſo underſtood the <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> and we know the <hi>Virginia</hi> Aſſembly, was Prorogued, whereby they cou'd not have the Opportunity of joining us; ſo that we doubt not but the Colonies who have not Signed, will very ſpeedily tranſmit ſimilar Addreſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if their Aſſemblies ſhould not be hindered from Meeting: And to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we hope you'll ſoon hear from the Aſſembly of <hi>South-Carolina.</hi> By the Gentlemen of that Colony we were favoured with a Sight of your late Letters, and inform'd of your careful and ſpirited Conduct with Regard to the Intereſts of that Colony, and that, together with your Declaration, which we find in thoſe Letters, that you enjoy an independant Seat in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, induced us (as we have no eſtabliſhed Agent at preſent. for this Province, nor have yet been able to obtain a Law to Tax ourſelves

for that Purpoſe) to trouble you with our Requeſt, that you will Preſent the incloſed Addreſs to his Majeſty, and Memorial and Petition to the Houſes of Parliament, and exert your utmoſt Intereſt and Abilities in behalf of this poor diſtreſs'd Country, and of this Province in particular.</p>
               <p>We hope as there is a Change in the Miniſtry, and as the Gentlemen in the Houſe of Commons, may at their next Meeting, take a more enlarged View of the true Intereſt of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and her Colonies, they will find it to be in ſupporting the Rights and encouraging the Trade of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that the Happineſs of the Mother Country and her Colonies muſt be inſeparable, and that we ſhall obtain Relief.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral Committees agreed to recommend it to their reſpective Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to appoint Special Agents on this Occaſion, and to inſtruct them to unite their utmoſt Intereſt and Endeavours for that Purpoſe. One Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was tranſmitted by the Gentlemen of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, immediately to their Agent (Mr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> we underſtood) and we expect the other Colonies will have Duplicates ſent to their Agents, and we hope will all unite in Expence and Inſtructions, to have able Counſel before both the Lords and Commons, as our Petitions pray.</p>
               <p>We were intruſted with the Diſpoſition of ſome Money upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and incloſe you a Bill of Exchange, on Meſſrs. <hi>Capel</hi> and <hi>Oſgood Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> for One Hundred and Fifty Pounds Sterling, as a Compenſation for your Trouble and Expence in this Affair. We doubt not our Aſſembly will approve of what we do in this Matter; and as they are to meet the laſt of this Month, we ſhall lay our Proceedings before them, and 'tis probable they will write you more fully, and furniſh you with ſuch further Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Arguments, as may appear to them to be proper to be given and urged on this Occaſion, in Behalf of the Colonies.</p>
