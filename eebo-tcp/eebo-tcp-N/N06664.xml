            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>FOR <hi>Mordecai</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> was next unto King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> and great among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and accepted among the multitude of his brethren, ſeeking the wealth of all his people, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace to all his ſeed.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſacred ſcriptures, always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the ſanctification of ſinful men, exhibit characters of various kinds; that there may be found in them, diſſuaſives from vice and motives to godlineſs, not only rational and forceable, but of peculiar influence upon every turn of mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:008452_0005_102F3209A897D880"/>THE principal perſons in this book are <hi>Ahaſuerus, Haman, Eſther</hi> and <hi>Mordecai.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> king of <hi>Perſia,</hi> whoſe dominion extended even from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Ethiophia,</hi> over an hundred and twenty-ſeven provinces, was a monarch veſted with ſuch unlimited power, as no wiſe man would be willing any one ſhould be poſſeſſed of, below the character of a confirmed angel; at leſt any of the ſinful race of fallen man; a power by edict to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thouſands of innocents in a day to gratify a favourite's paſſions; and a power able to perplex and diſtreſs the affairs of peaceable ſtates round about, contented with their own poſſeſſions, and coveting no other.</p>
            <p>AMBITION, pride and cruelty are the moſt conſpicuous marks in the character of <hi>Haman;</hi> who had crept into the monarch's favour above all others, and was likely to make a diſtreſſing uſe of the abſolute power which he could command.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſther</hi> the queen, an orphan, without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or mother, but brought up by her near kinſman <hi>Mordecai,</hi> by the gift of nature, and her kinſman's pious paternal care, poſſeſt every lovely quality of the ſex, made more illuſtrious by grace, which illuſtrates virtue it ſelf; and had merit enough with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch to be advanced to his bed upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce of <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> the former queen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:008452_0006_102F320C0CB090D0"/>Laſtly, THE character of <hi>Mordecai</hi> the Jew was truly excellent and great: from which, if I miſtake not, ſomething may be inferred ſutable to that part, which, thro' the ill health of my dearly beloved brother in Chriſt, is ſo ſuddenly and unexpectedly fallen to my lot upon this retured anniverſary.</p>
            <p>AND his character ſeems to be that of a pious, juſt, wiſe man, and ſtrictly tenacious of his purpoſe; a character in ſome danger of moroſeneſs: (ſhould I be much miſtaken if I reſembled him to the roman <hi>Cato?</hi>) but yet, when ſanctified by the divine ſpirit, and influenced by the fear of God, a temper fitted for arduous undertakings, and to act ſedately in ſhocking diſaſters.</p>
            <p>HIS piety towards God is ſeen in his prayers, and in the prayers of his people by his direction under the queen, and their devout humiliations before God; a pious practice, always uſed in dangerous times, in the church of God; which it becomes the religious rulers and leaders of his people to recommend and urge as a becoming acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his care and government of the world, due for his glory, and the way to his mercy. It is alſo ſeen in his firm reliance upon God, the protector of his church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in that meſſage to the queen: <hi>If thou altogether hold thy peace at this time,</hi> from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008452_0007_102F320DA0CD4EF0"/>
ſupplication to the king, <hi>then ſhall enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and deliverance ariſe to the Jews from another place — and who knoweth whither thou art come to the kingdom for ſuch a time as this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HIS juſtice is vindicated and declared, as the ſlaughter of a great number of the enemies of the <hi>Jews</hi> was neceſſary ſelf-defence, and ſtanding for their own lives; and in that when his enemies were in his power, and the law of retaliation might ſeem to juſtify the taking not only their lives, but their ſpoils, it is ſaid more than once, <hi>on the prey they laid not their hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HIS wiſdom appears in all his method to deliver his people from the maſſacre intended by <hi>that wicked Haman:</hi> and his inflexibility in continuing in ſackcloth, which kept him from the queen's preſence, tho' called, and which the circumſtances of things ſeemed greatly to require.</p>
            <p>OUR text is the laſt verſe in the book; and, for the encouragement of virtue in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God and his people, deſcribes the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s condition after the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and dangers he had paſſed thro'. <hi>He was next to the king;</hi> and the ambition of a ſubject can look no higher, nor the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent mind wiſh for a better proſpect of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive uſefulneſs. He was <hi>great among the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008452_0008_102F320F30D0AC70"/>
Jews:</hi> in true greatneſs diſtinguiſhed, and univerſally honoured among them. <hi>And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted among the multitude of his brethren:</hi> his perſon reſpected, and his ſervices well recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: and no wonder, conſidering what he had done, and was ſtill diſpoſed and able to do for them: <hi>ſeeking the wealth of all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſpeaking peace to all his ſeed:</hi> the peace and welfare of his people was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued concern, which he promoted by his wiſe counſels and powerful influence with the king.</p>
            <p>IN diſcourſing upon this text, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſpeak to the following obſervations; which, I think, naturally ariſe from it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the ſtory.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> WHEN God is pleaſed to advance men of integrity and ability into the frequent <hi>preſence</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> of their ſovereign, they have an happy advantage to ſerve with him the intereſts of their people.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> TRUE <hi>greatneſs</hi> may commendably be ſought; and when poſſeſſed ſhould be conſidered, and thankfully acknowledged as the <hi>gift of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> THE <hi>acceptance</hi> of an obliged people is a juſt ſatisfaction to the minds of men of great uſefulneſs in exalted ſtations.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV. Good Men</hi> advanced will hold themſelves obliged to improve their power and fame for the <hi>proſperity</hi> of their people.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:008452_0009_102F3211A5AB4F80"/>
               <hi>I.</hi> WHEN God is pleaſed to advance men of ability and integrity into the frequent preſence and favour of their ſovereign, they have an happy advantage to ſerve with him the intereſts of their people.</p>
            <p>THEIR great abilities and many faithful ſervices rendred to the king, engage his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and confidence. And hence he becomes perſuaded, no petitions will be preferred but ſuch as righteouſneſs ſhall demand, or mercy requeſt; and ſuch only as ſhall promote, or at leaſt be conſiſtent with, the publick good. The king muſt ſee with eyes not his own: and able, faithful men about him can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be too highly prized, as right action is univerſal good, errors dangerous, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs extenſive deſtruction. Therefore ſaid a great and politic king, <hi>him that privily ſlandereth his neighbour will I cut off; him that hath an high look and a proud heart will I not ſuffer. Mine eyes ſhall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect way he ſhall ſerve me. He that worketh deceit ſhall not dwell within my houſe; he that telleth lies ſhall not ſtand in my ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> had not entertained an high opinion of <hi>Haman</hi>'s ability and faithfulneſs, hardly would he have been able, tho' with the perſuaſive argument of <hi>ten thouſand talents</hi> (which the king generouſly returned) to have prevailed for the bloody murder of ſo

great a multitude; who had hitherto been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged their peculiar cuſtoms without detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the king's affairs; and who while they lived peaceably in the land, content with their liberty of conſcience, muſt be a great ſtrengthening to the kingdom. Eſpecially is <hi>fidelity,</hi> or approved <hi>loyalty,</hi> a very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of a ſubject, ſtrengthening his intereſt with his ſovereign to ſerve his people. <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> was concern'd that <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai</hi>'s loyal ſervices in detecting the conſpiracy of <hi>Bigthan</hi> and <hi>Tereſh</hi> had never been rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Greatneſs is often ſuſpected, but fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty creates confidence.</p>
            <p>THE ſtory of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and the happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to the people of God of his intereſt with the king and frequent opportunities of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching into his preſence, will afford much uſeful inſtruction, and quickening ſpirit to a great man who delights to form himſelf by the divine leſſons of holy ſcripture: and of ſuch, I hope our number is very great.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> TRUE greatneſs may commendably be ſought; and when poſſeſſed ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and thankfully acknowledged as the gift of God.</p>
            <p>IN this light, I conceive, I may conſider the advancement of the great man in my text, and his happy condition as the reward of a national ſpirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:008452_0011_102F3217DB4FA360"/>TRUE greatneſs ſometimes intends thoſe excelling accompliſhments which merit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and ſometimes the honour which is given for them: I here conſider it complexly, as comprehending both.</p>
            <p>THE intrinſic greatneſs of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> his wiſdom, juſtice and firmneſs of ſpirit, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fear of God to the public good of his own church and people, was the ſolid foundation of his <hi>eſtimated</hi> greatneſs, or the univerſal honour that was paid him, and will always be paid him, in the church of God: and upon ſuch a foundation only can true honour ariſe. Let us here a little conſider the difference between <hi>true</hi> and <hi>falſe</hi> greatneſs as a compariſon between <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Haman</hi> may ſhew it. Both theſe great men were alike high in the king's favour, both were fear'd for their power, and might alike be ſupplicated by abject dependants, avaricious or ambitious aſpirers after employments they were unfit for. Their glare of glory upon they eye of the world was much the ſame, or <hi>Haman</hi>'s the brighter: Yet the greatneſs of the one was true, of the other falſe: and the <hi>fear of God</hi> and a religious <hi>love of virtue</hi> made the difference. Pride, a glittering appearance, a temper never to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, but to revenge the ſlighteſt affronts of one man with the blood of a nation, and a rapacious diſpoſition to ſeize the prey; ſuch was the foundation of <hi>Haman</hi>'s eſtimated
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008452_0012_102F321A64D0C248"/>
greatneſs. But <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s aroſe upon the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid foundation of many conſpicuous virtues peculiarly uſeful to the public, and a manifeſt indifferency to the trappings of ſtate which the childiſh pride of <hi>Haman</hi> dictated for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as a fitting reward for the man whom the king ſhould delight to honour.</p>
            <p>THIS true greatneſs is what may innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and worthily be purſued: and the <hi>deſire of glory</hi> is not criminal but virtuous: Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends it by his own example in that prayer, <hi>Father glorify thy Son.</hi> Fame, or a <hi>good name</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>better than precious ointment.</hi> Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting inconceivable glory is the great allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the goſpel to the <hi>obedience of faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT this, like other virtuous propenſities, is capable of being turned into the worſt of vices. Piety, may proceed to ſuperſtition, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in hypocriſy; a prudent care, to anxious ſollicitude, and to that love of the world which is inconſiſtent with the love of God; and a juſt reſentment of evil may degenerate into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge: and ſo may the love of glory into pride, deteſtible in the ſight of God, and never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by men, how much ſoever each one hath of it in himſelf. Yet is there a thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>true greatneſs,</hi> as it is virtue improved into great abilities for public uſefulneſs, which muſt therefore be virtuous; and after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected <hi>glory,</hi> and a joy in it with moderation
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008452_0013_102F321CCDF60150"/>
when acquired, which muſt be innocent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe made a motive in the word of God to ſerve the intereſts of religion: <hi>they that honour God he will honour, but they that deſpiſe him ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND therefore it muſt be conſiſtent with humility, a ſhade neceſſary to add the true luſtre to every ſhining public virtue; a grace of the ſpirit of God, eſſential to the character of a true chriſtian; for he that <hi>comes</hi> to Chriſt muſt <hi>take his yoke upon him, and learn of him who was meek and lowly in heart,</hi> or <hi>he will</hi> not <hi>find reſt to his ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND ſo we ſee it was in Chriſt; for at the time he was fulleſt in his expectations of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory, and doubtleſs contemplating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a ſupport, under his approaching ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and bloody ſweat, and all the cruelties of the croſs, he ſet his diſciples the moſt lowly example of humility in all his life. <hi>Jeſus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, that he was come from God, and went to God, he aroſe from ſupper and took a towel, and girded himſelf,</hi> to waſh his diſciple's feet.</p>
            <p>I know, after all that can be ſaid, proud ambitious men will be apt to flatter themſelves that their love of glory is the virtue: ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural is it for men to put darkneſs for light when a favourite luſt is in queſtion. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008452_0014_102F32205803B098"/>
however that a preacher of the goſpel ſhould lend his aſſiſtance to enable men to diſtinguiſh rightly, or at leſt to revive and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the well known diſtinction in their minds; leſt, as man was once for pride tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of paradiſe, for pride the gates of it ſhould be ſhut againſt one that would return thither.</p>
            <p>I beg leave here to mention two things;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Earthly glory ſhould be always ſought in ſubordination to heavenly. This will be, according to the directions of our goſpel, to <hi>live by faith and not by ſenſe, to ſeek firſt the kingdom of God and the righteouſneſs thereof,</hi> and juſtly to prefer what is infinitely to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. This will evidence our ſincerity, that we believe, what we profeſs, that there is a future everlaſting world, in which all, who <hi>perſevere in ways of well-doing,</hi> ſhall be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with glory, honour and immortality. Therefore, when earthly glory is inconſiſtent with heavenly, the purſuit of the former is entirely to be remitted. For what madneſs would it be to forego, or even hazard, the loſs of heavenly glory for any thing that is earthly? for the whole world?</p>
            <p>THIS is a conſideration which ought always to be preſent to the mind of him, who is in the purſuit of glory: for he is entred into
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008452_0015_102F3221E61A9BB0"/>
temptation which nothing will carry him ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thro' but the faith of the goſpel, which is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not ſeen.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IN like manner earthly glory is to be ſought with a view to future uſefulneſs. The author of our beings hath joyned ſenſible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with our food; yet it is to be under the controul of the <hi>rational</hi> intention of preſerving our health, and ſtrengthning the animal frame; and the <hi>religious</hi> one, of preſenting our bodies living ſacrifices holy and acceptable to the Lord, which is alſo, according to the apoſtle, a reaſonable ſervice. So the delights of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory ſhould be but a ſubordinate end: and the ſuperior ſhould be <hi>uſefulneſs to the public.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Chriſt hath taught us by the before-cited prayer. <hi>Father glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee.</hi> If this were duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, great men would not by retirement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the ſervice of their country, becauſe they had attained to their ſummit of worldly glory, and their employments were become troubleſome and dangerous; by which means the common-wealth is ſometimes deprived of it's moſt uſeful members, when the greateſt abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with all the advantages of long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are moſt neceſſary. If the increaſe of worldly honour be not ſufficient to diſſuade
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008452_0016_102F322381844670"/>
from what is really an ignominious forfeiture of honour obtained, let it be conſidered what an increaſe of heavenly glory will be made by ſo great ſelf-denyal for the public good, as the continuing in a troubleſome dangerous poſt is ſuppoſed to be.</p>
            <p>BEFORE I conclude this general head, let me obſerve, what indulgence ſoever may be given to men to value themſelves upon their ſervices according to their true worth, and benefit to their fellow-men, and to expect me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited honourable acknowledgments for them, there is no place for ſuch a temper in reſpect of the infinite God. For, can a man be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to God? His we are, and from him we received all our talents, and opportunities of improving them: and when we have done all in our power, and with the greateſt ſucceſs in ſerving him, we muſt confeſs ourſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervants, and that we have done but our duty. This confeſſion becomes the mouth of the moſt <hi>exalted angel</hi> about the throne of God; how much more <hi>man who is a worm,</hi> and who drinketh in iniquity like water; and in the moſt glorious of whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be found, ſuch ignoble, impure mixtures as to be a juſt occaſion of penitent reflections and deep humiliation. If man hath whereof to glory, it cannot be <hi>before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:008452_0017_102F322616E83E18"/>
               <hi>III.</hi> THE acceptance of an obliged people is a juſt ſatisfaction to men of great uſefulneſs in exalted ſtations.</p>
            <p>IN the minds of generous men there is a natural paſſion for their people, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by no other, but is ſtronger than even the fear of death. This gives the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern when our country is in danger, pains our hearts in all it's ſufferings, produceth into action the wiſdom and reſolution of the great, and even creates courage in the effeminate where it never exiſted before. When the people were ſmitten and the ark taken, <hi>Eli</hi> could live no longer: And the pſalmiſt thought it criminal not to prefer <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to his chief joy. This ſame paſſion, which produceth the powers of men into ſtrenuous action, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the mind to receive great ſatisfaction from the <hi>good affections</hi> of their country.</p>
            <p>AND they are what the endeavours of great men to ſerve their country juſtly deſerve; and the more for the greatneſs of their good actions which are felt in their good effects throughout the community. By them not one man, not a few men, but multitudes taſte the ſweets of their own plenty in ſecurity; and a whole nation is ſometimes ſaved from imminent ruin.</p>
            <p>HOW ingrateful then will it be to diſappoint the expectations of great and uſeful men ſo
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008452_0018_102F32293AE75C68"/>
juſtly founded? Ingratitude occaſions a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar kind of painful reſentment from anger and love intermixed; perhaps harder to be endured than anger by it ſelf, as the ſoftneſs of love produceth dejection of ſpirit, to which ſimple anger would not be liable. <hi>It was not an enemy that reproached me,</hi> ſaid the Pſalmiſt, <hi>then I could have born it, but it was thou, a man, mine equal, my guide, and my acquaintance: we took ſweet counſel together, and walked to the houſe of God in company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be ſure, very painful reſentments do an unthankful people give to thoſe who have loved them, and denied themſelves greatly for them; enduring ſuch diſquietudes and hardſhips as men at eaſe, and unuſed to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine themſelves in the places of others, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our ſaviour's direction for right thinking,) have little apprehenſion of; and therefore are leſs likely to value the benefits they have received by them.</p>
            <p>Ancient <hi>Greece</hi> may, I preſume, vie with any ſtate for it's number of public-ſpirited great men, and the glory of their actions perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the defence of their country. But how ungenerouſly, how inhumanely were thoſe great men treated! How many from <hi>Miltia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> the great commander of the famous bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Marathon,</hi> thro' <hi>Socrates</hi> down to <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> and <hi>Demoſtthenes,</hi> were impriſoned to death, or died by poiſon or the ſword?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:008452_0019_102F322ACEDBE4E0"/>AND what an ungrateful return was made by <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Gideon,</hi> who fought for them, and adventured his life far, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies, in ſlaying threeſcore and ten of his ſons upon one rock, to put them out of the way of <hi>Abimelech</hi> the uſurper? The ſcripture takes great notice of this ingratitude, coupling it with their ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to heaven. <hi>The children of Iſrael re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred not the Lord their God, who had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them out of the hand of their enemies on every ſide: neither ſhewed they kindneſs to the houſe of Jerubbaal, namely Gideon, according to all the goodneſs he had ſhewed unto Iſrael.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Judg. 8.34, 35.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE acceptance of an obliged people is food that nouriſheth a public ſpirit, which will hardly ſubſiſt long without it. True it is, the noble <hi>Athenians,</hi> I mentioned before, notwithſtanding the ungrateful treatment o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had received, and they had received themſelves, ſurprizingly retained the love of their country, and declared they eſteemed <hi>Athens</hi> and it's priviledges their chief joy, by ſtudying, and ſome times ſerving, it's intereſts and even in baniſhment. But oftentimes, men have been made traitors by far leſs bad treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo corrupt is the ſtate of mankind, and ſo true it is that every great man is not a hero.</p>
            <p>BUT when the faithful endeavours of able men to ſerve their country are conſidered
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008452_0020_102F322DCE7821D0"/>
with pleaſure and gratefully received, it ſecures the benefit of their abilities, and urgeth them forward with renewed vigour. The love of our country is cheriſhed by love.</p>
            <p>IN ſuch a ſtate, how happy is the unity! how delightful the communion! ſimilar to that which is between the great God, after whoſe name rulers are in ſcripture ſometimes called, and his ſanctified ſons: for that divine communion is very much in aſking and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving bleſſings, and in grateful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements in return.</p>
            <p>THIS acceptance of public ſervices was, I ſay, one of the ſatisfactions of <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s happy condition; and what every good man will rejoice in. And the conſideration, that this acceptance of the people is for real good done, makes the great man's ſatisfaction both innocent and ſolid; and not like the praiſes which are given for no reaſon. How much more eligible is the ſober acceptance of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate people than the higheſt applauſe of a flattering multitude?</p>
            <p>Beſides, Such an acceptance is a great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction as it is an happy preſage when pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick virtue is juſtly eſteemed by a people; and when heroic actions, ſuch as a good man doing them can afterwards reflect upon with inward ſatisfaction, are to their acceptance,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008452_0021_102F32303106D3B8"/>
and the only ones they are content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. In that ſtate there muſt be much of that <hi>righteouſneſs which exalteth a nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> GOOD men advanced will hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to improve their greatneſs for the proſperity of their people.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Patrick</hi> paraphraſes the laſt clauſes of our text thus; <q>adviſing and promoting whatſoever was for their advantage; and ſpeaking ſtill to the king for that which might tend to the happineſs and proſperity of his nation, which he advanced to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his power.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THEY by their intereſt in the king's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or with thoſe who ſtand before princes, if they love their country (as all good men do) will have frequent opportunities, and gladly improve them, of pleading it's cauſe when it's character is aſperſed; when crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal matters, of which they are innocent, are invidiouſly laid to their charge, or their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, induſtrious, expenſive ſervices repreſented in a diminiſhing light. They will urge for the royal favour, their country's loyalty and firm attachment to the ſovereign, it's uſefulneſs as a valuable member of the grand body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic, notwithſtanding any peculiar cuſtoms, innocent to the ſtate, which may have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them, and it's deſire to the utmoſt of it's ability to promote the univerſal good
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008452_0022_102F323438A1AE40"/>
of the kingdom thro' all it's numerous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
            <p>THEIR councils, when demanded and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in virtue of the high and important offices they ſuſtain, will be the utmoſt efforts of their wiſdom for the good of their king and country, whoſe intereſts are inſeparable. Eſpecially may this be expected from them in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of legiſlators, as upon good laws the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and peace of a people greatly depend.—They will be concerned that their laws, for their goodneſs and wiſdom, may, be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and revered.</p>
            <p>FOR there is a veneration due to the laws of a country as ſacred and inviolate, and, to which men ought to ſubmit, not only for wrath, but for conſcience ſake. And for this reaſon, it ſeems, the formalities of them are made very ſolemn, to awe the minds of lawleſs men into a fear of tranſgreſſing what their wickedneſs prompts them to tranſgreſs. And this is no more than is neceſſary conſidering how great numbers in the community by liberty under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the doing what is right in their own eyes, as when there was no king in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> how full many are of compaſſion, and how ready to take the part of a villainous tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, and ſtudious to ſcreen him when in danger of being detected, and brought to a well merited puniſhment; and this not only of the meaner and more ſordid part, but of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008452_0023_102F3235D70255C8"/>
better men, who can have no reaſon to fear for themſelves the fate of a villain. Theſe better men ſhould conſider, all men ſhould conſider, the law is the hedge between pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and property, the fence that ſecures to us all that is dear, even our very lives; and that to ſide againſt the law is to ſide againſt our own lives, and to give that fence a blow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bringing it tottering down to the ground.</p>
            <p>TO mention no more, good men for the welfare of their country will be active in the execution of every wiſe purpoſe within their ſphere of action. Their counſels are uſeleſs until put in execution; and particularly, the wiſdom of the legiſlature is expended in vain, if the laws be diſregarded. Magiſtrates do not appear to be good men, or to have the welfare of their people at heart, who behold, but connive at, the tranſgreſſion of the laws in the face of day; inſtead of being guardians and conſervators of the foundation of their ſecurity and proſperity, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of their advancement. And if ſuch an evil prevailing be not obſerved, or being obſerved, is not ſpeedily remedied, well may the laws loſe their juſt veneration and fall into diſrepute, by the frequent unnoticed tranſgreſſions of them.</p>
            <p>THESE and ſuch like things will a good man conſider himſelf as obliged to by advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008452_0024_102F3238BA22D000"/>
For he is one that fears God and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours the king, one that is concerned for the public good, and acted by that univerſal bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence which is the charity, the glory of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>HE will conſider, as the doctrine of divine Providence is an article of his faith, his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement is from God, who ſetteth up one and putteth down another; and that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Lord, who loveth righteouſneſs and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth iniquity, the infinitely good giver of every perfect gift, regards him as <hi>His</hi> magiſtrate, ordained by himſelf to do juſtice and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to exerciſe loving kindneſs in the community for the glory of God, the honour of the redeemer, and the wealth and peace of his people. And often will the pious magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate bring himſelf before God's vicegerent in his own breaſt, his own conſcience; and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine his life in relation to his own office, as knowing that he muſt give an account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day; that judging himſelf now, he may not be condemned with the wicked world.</p>
            <p>AND becauſe he is convinced of the vanity of every thing that is earthly in the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he eſteems heavenly glory, the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of perfect virtue, and the <hi>glory</hi> of the heavenly train about the throne of God as his ſupreme good; after which he aſpires by a conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous endeavour to approve himſelf to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:008452_0025_102F323CF0F6D5F8"/>NEITHER is it an inconſiderable motive, but a very weighty one, with the good and the great, uprightly to ſeek the welfare of their people, that their conſtituents expect it from them, and diſtinguiſhed them with that very intention. Unfaithfulneſs is a very inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent character in a candidate for honour, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, injurious and ungrateful; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inconſiſtent with goodneſs. What a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment will it be to thoſe who diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed and honoured the advanced, and had given them great teſtimonies of their reſpect, if they ſhould be negligent and unfaithful for the ſake of private intereſt? What ſhould we call it among people of lower life, if a man, valuably conſidered and intruſted, ſhould ſerve his own ends by the confidence placed in him? To deceive, to cheat, is ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious among the vulgar, and greatly ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to him that pretends to be good; and a very unthankful return for acceptance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the multitude of our brethren.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, A very influential motive every good man finds the conſideration of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diſpleaſure of God in the everlaſting world, againſt unfaithful men, who had been entruſted with many talents for important ends. By theſe they had in their hands an advantage to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed among the ſaints in heaven, as themſelves had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by their fellow men in this world; but forfeited not only the diſtinction, but even
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008452_0026_102F323E8B759800"/>
heaven it ſelf, by hiding their talent in a nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, or improving it to a bad purpoſe: ſo that what was intended to have been their diſtinguiſhing glory will be the increaſe of their everlaſting miſery and diſgrace.</p>
            <p>IT is not the knowledge of theſe things, <hi>my honoured fathers and brethren,</hi> for every one knows them, but a ſerious influential conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them which produceth the holy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and, dwelling in the minds of good men, continue them fixt in the purſuit of glory by virtue.</p>
            <p>IT remains now to conclude with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes which in decency are to be expected upon this anniverſary.</p>
            <p>AND may I be permitted, in the firſt place, in the moſt humble manner, to addreſs your EXCELLENCY, ſitting in the firſt chair of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, among the rulers of this Province;</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe your Excellency,</p>
            <p>IF I am not miſtaken, the divine author of our natures, in forming us with a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſelf-love and preſervation, hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared us to take a peculiar delight in what is our own; ſo that, by this circumſtance, an additional ſatisfaction is received from
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008452_0027_102F32412388C570"/>
every thing that is excellent. This province, SIR, by the diſpoſition of divine providence, and the favour of the beſt of king's, is yours; it will therefore have your kind diſtinction: it's griefs will more ſenſibly touch, and it's proſperity rejoice your heart, than thoſe of others.</p>
            <p>IN theſe days of perplexity and danger, when much darkneſs is ſcattered in our paths, we need the aſſiſtance and conduct of the moſt diſcerning penetrating powers: and may we not hope, that from affection to your people, as well as duty to God and the king, your great abilities will be employed for our welfare, peace and protection, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when ſuch mighty preparations are made from home, to improve the ſucceſſes, with which a good God was pleaſed to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour our enterprizes of laſt year, into a deliverance from the future fear of an enemy, whoſe tender mercies have been cruelties.</p>
            <p>AND as in this province you, SIR, are <hi>next unto the king,</hi> thro' your intereſt in the great men who ſtand in the king's preſence, and have the privelege of the royal ear, and your ſollicitous applications ſtill continued for us, may we not hope to be always juſtly and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably repreſented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR priviledges, religious and civil, will always have your paternal care, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008452_0028_102F324472755BC0"/>
your people's hearts are ſet on them, but as things of invaluable worth, and great importance to their virtue, happineſs and glory.</p>
            <p>OUR College, SIR, is our glory; many of thoſe you have been pleaſed to employ in exalted ſtations, to your own ſatisfaction, and the acceptance of their people, laid the foundation of their intrinſic greatneſs within it's walls: and others divine providence will preſent you with to be employed as your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in government, as occaſion may call for them. This addreſs for patronage to a great proficient in learning, might be conſidered only as a decent compliance with prevailing cuſtom; but is more, if the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe who cannot, or will not, be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of any advantage in an academic edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for the ſervice of church or ſtate, is greatly increaſed.</p>
            <p>AS it will be equally honorable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to your adminiſtration, as happy for your people, it will be your Excellency's concern, that poſts of profit and honor, at your ſole diſpoſal, or by the advice of his majeſty's council, be filled with men who ſeek worldly glory and advantage in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to that which is everlaſting; who fear God and love their country, and whoſe ablities are equal to the truſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:008452_0029_102F3247D9AB8498"/>WE praiſe God and congratulate your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency upon your ſafe return from the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, where your preſence would be ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the erecting the projected fortreſs to ſtrengthen our frontier, and curb the cruel enemy. May your Excellency's ſervices for the public always find acceptance with the people and favour with the king, and be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God almighty at laſt, and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with joy unſpeakable and full of glory!</p>
            <p>IN the next place, may I be permitted to addreſs your HONOR our Lieutenant-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, in the next ſeat of gevernment, upon the firſt return of this anniverſary, ſince the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of your Honor's commiſſion.</p>
            <p>IT is with great ſatisfaction we behold your abilities, by the good providence of him who gave them, brought forth into the fulleſt light, and advantageouſly ſituated to ſerve your king and country, for which they are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly formed.</p>
            <p>AS your greatneſs among your people, and acceptance among the multitude of your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, took it's riſe from your early and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued concern for their proſperity, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their peace by wiſe and upright counſels, the ſame public ſpirit, we doubt not, will increaſe with your opportunities. For we
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008452_0030_102F324ACC4CDD60"/>
know, from what we have felt in our own breaſts, and what great and virtuous minds minds feel in a proportionable degree, what anxiety perplexed your ſpirit, when our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were critical, what compaſſionate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern when the enemy were moſtly victors, and what joy dilated your heart, when God in mercy to a guilty, but prayerful people, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to us, and by repeated and very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſucceſſes taught us, what he would delight to do for us, would we but anſwer his juſt expectations in our repentance and reformation.</p>
            <p>MAY you, SIR, long continue to deſerve and receive the honors of your king and country; every day adding weight to an heavenly crown, in the purſuit of which there is no danger of a faulty ambition, and when poſſeſſed, ſhall never fade away!</p>
            <p>IN the next place, may I addreſs my ſelf to the honorable his Majeſty's Council, and the honorable Houſe of Repreſentatives, the electors by royal Charter of one of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant branches of the legiſlature.</p>
            <p>Honored Fathers,</p>
            <p>IT is a very ſerious conſideration, and will have great weight in the thoughts of every
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008452_0031_102F324C63257B78"/>
godly man, the omniſcient God obſerves with what ſpirit you are proceeding to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant elections of this day. The glory of God, and the good of this people are greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the exerciſe of that power with which you are intruſted. If unworthy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or unfaithful, men, are the rulers of a people, that people is in a ſtate truly deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and to all appearance haſtening to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The great God, who hath provided, and for ages continued the happy privileges of this people, becauſe he loved their fathers, and hath a kindneſs for themſelves, will be greatly diſpleaſed if you ſhould counteract his kind intention by ſuffering your ſelves to be influenced by any thing in your election, but the good of this people; and do not take all requiſite pains to acquaint your ſelves with the qualifications of thoſe whom you elect.</p>
            <p>OUR mouths are often open, and with a great deal of reaſon, in praiſe of our privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; and they are a frequent ſubject of our thankgivings to heaven: but of what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage will they be, and what can we be the better for them, if thro' avarice, pride and the purſuit of falſe glory, or bribed by friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or taken in, by being taken notice of, and a condeſcending, ſuppliant, court-like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, or from the ſpirit of party — a patriot ſhould be excluded, and an undeſerving per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon advanced. The end of our priviledges
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008452_0032_102F324ECD8096B8"/>
will be intirely loſt; for they intend, that our rulers ſhould be our ſafety, and our glory.</p>
            <p>BUT if on the other hand, being duely affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the conſideration of the account which muſt be given to God of your fidelity in the diſcharge of every truſt, you are prepared to chooſe from a deſire to do the public the beſt good you can, may not the ſubject, I have endeavoured to entertain you with, ſtir up your pure minds by way of remembrance of ſome important qualifications which, the word of God ſuggeſts, are neceſſary to be found in a ruler to be a bleſſing to his country.</p>
            <p>HE who miſtakes the tinſel of glory, for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſeeks to ſhine, rather than to ſerve his country by the exertion of true greatneſs; he who ſeeks not with a becoming concern and induſtry the defence of his people in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous times, and their wealth and peace at all times, and in this way acceptance and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour among them, is not the man: but he is, who fears God, and who, being convinced there is no chriſtian grace which is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, or is more the ſpirit of his ſon and his charitable goſpel, cultivates in himſelf a public ſpirit, and rejoiceth in all occaſions of doing public good; and though dangerous and expenſive, thankfully improves them that it may be remembered to his future heavenly glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:008452_0033_102F3252C3833F08"/>To the ſatisfied conſcience of an elector, all the good done by the choſen muſt increaſe ſatisfaction; and he may, and not wrongfully, aſſume to himſelf a ſhare in the merit of their good deeds: but painful muſt be the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the michiefs which our country ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, thro' the incapacity or unfaithfulneſs of the man whom we voted for.</p>
            <p>BUT then will the joy of a good conſcience be felt to the higheſt degree of ſatisfaction, when an office is to be reſigned; whither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing temporary it is expired, or thro' miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, envy, diſguſt, or a party ſpirit to be taken away with ingratitude, or voluntarily quitted to withdraw from a world by degrees, ſoon to be forſaken for ever, to be wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to a preparation for eternity, in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the admonitions of ill health, and the infirmities of advancing age, or finally ſummon'd by death to appear at the grand tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal. Nothing can then impart ſupport, conſolution, ſtrength and joy, equal to the neceſſity of the occaſion, like a review of a long courſe of conſcientious care, in the fear of God, in all things, and eſpecially in impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant betruſtments, to aquit ourſelves to the acceptance of God, and the benefit of his people.</p>
            <p>TO conclude, let me beſpeak the prayers of this aſſembly that God would bleſs our land with patriots poſſeſſed of ſuch excellent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008452_0034_102F3255E59FD600"/>
as our ſubject hath led us to conſider and admire: and having received them let us acknowledge it in our thankſgivings as a very great favour, and treat them as a gift of heaven, highly eſteemed.</p>
            <p>LET us conſider there is a tribute of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and honour due to thoſe who rule well; that to withold it from them is wrong, and to diſparage their characters a great injury to themſelves, and an hurt to our country, as it weakens their benign influences: ſo on the other hand acceptance, honour, applauſe laviſhed away upon thoſe who deſerve it not is to miſplace one reward of public virtue.</p>
            <p>AND let us conſider, if we would be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in our rulers, if we would be happy in any important reſpect, to our fervent prayers we muſt add ſincere repentance and and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; dreading all hypocritical pretences to the ſpecial favour of God when we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better to found them upon than profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, form and ceremonies; for, for this very reaſon God ſent this threatning meſſage to Iſrael when their judgment lingred not, and nothing would prevent it but repentance and reformation, Iſa. 24.13, 14. <hi>Wherefore the Lord ſaid, forasmuch, as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, the wiſdom of their wiſe ſhall periſh, and the underſtanding of their prudent ſhall be hid.</hi>
