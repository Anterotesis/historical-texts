            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>SOME of the principal debates of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeſſion of Congreſs, with Remarks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, appeared a few weeks ago, under the Title of, "A Proſpect from the Congreſs-Gallery," publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. Thomas Bradford. The favourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of that work led me to undertake that which I now offer to the public. My plan, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, being altered, for reaſons with which I am going to acquaint the reader, it became neceſſary to alter the title alſo.</p>
            <p>No one, who has been an attentive obſerver of the violent and dangerous attempts, which have been made, and are ſtill making, againſt the Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſtitution, and conſequently againſt the peace, proſperity and happineſs of our country, can have failed to perceive, that they had their riſe in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, which has been ſo induſtriouſly circulated through every part of the United-Sates. It is not to be preſumed, indeed, that the leaders in this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile and formidable combination have been deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: they have long been marſhalled and ready for the attack; but, it is the deluſion, which has been quietly ſuffered to ſteal its way among the people, that has called them into the field and encouraged them to aſſault, firſt the out-works, and at laſt the very citadel of our liberties and our lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:030219_0005_0FE5264C763F40B8"/>The ſource of this deluſion it is not difficult to diſcover: we have it continually before our eyes. I mean the <hi>public papers,</hi> and I ſpeak with a very few exceptions.</p>
            <p>The general government adopted the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual meaſures for facilitating the conveyance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to every quarter of the Union, at the leaſt poſſible expence. Hence ſubſcribers to papers were found in abundance, and the editors, ſtriking off numerous impreſſions, were, of courſe, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to furniſh them at a low price. The intention of the government, as expreſſed by the Preſident himſelf, was certainly the moſt beneficent, that of ſpreading <hi>true</hi> information and <hi>uſeful</hi> knowledge among all claſſes of the community. But what has been the conſequence? Exactly the contrary. The French Revolution burſt forth like a vulcano, and its devouring lava reached even us. The editors, perceiving the partiality of the moſt <hi>numerous</hi> claſs of their ſubſcribers for this revolution, and all the novel and wild principles it has given riſe to, have been ſeduced, by the love of gain, to flatter that partiality by extolling thoſe principles, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of every thing, their own private intereſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Their papers, which ſwarm like ſummer flies, are become the vehicles of falſehood in place of truth, of ignorance in place of knowledge. Like the tenebrificous ſtars, mentioned by a celebrated author, they ſhed darkneſs in place of light.</p>
            <p>A veil has been carefully drawn over the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes and horrors reſulting from the anarchical ſyſtem of France; or, when this could not be done, when the editors have feared to be anticipated by their fellow-labourers, they have endeavoured to out-vie each other in apologies for what ought to
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:030219_0006_0FE5264E01286EB8"/>
have been held up to deteſtation, or, at leaſt, as an awful leſſon to ourſelves. Every one, even of the moſt deſtructive and impious acts of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended republic, has been trumpeted forth as the effect of a liberal and enlightened policy; while no inſinuation, no ſubtilty, no audacious falſehood, has been left uneſſayed to thwart all the meaſures of our own mild and wiſe government, to disfigure its principles, and ſever it from the affections of the people.</p>
            <p>To countervail the malignant efforts of theſe retailers has ever been my wiſh; and, I hope, it will not be thought preſumption in me, if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the trifles from my pen, which the public have honoured with their peruſal, have, in ſome ſlight degree, had the deſired effect. But, alas, what can a ſtraggling pamphlet, neceſſarily confined to a ſingle ſubject, do againſt a hundred thouſand volumes of miſcellaneous falſehood in folio! Their ſheets, if extended, would more than cover the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of our country.</p>
            <p>In oppoſing a literary monſter like this, I am aware that a Porcupine, with all his quills, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hope for complete ſucceſs: but, nothing can be accompliſhed without being begun: I hope to call up abler hands to my aid: to me, it will be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient honour to have led the way.</p>
            <p>This I ſhall attempt, in a monthly work, of the ſame bulk and price as the one which is here ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the public. In this work I ſhall take a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the political tranſactions of the paſt month; give an account of every democratic trick, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of native growth or imported from abroad; unravel the windings of the pretended patriots,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:030219_0007_0FE5268C04A1F190"/>
and more particularly thoſe of the <hi>flour-merchants;</hi> and I truſt, I ſhall be enabled to give, monthly, a ſketch of political affairs more ſatisfactory, becauſe more correct, than has ever yet appeared in this country. Theſe will be the leading objects; but I ſhall exclude nothing, not entirely foreign to the nature of the work, that may contribute to the uſe or amuſement of my readers.</p>
            <p>The news-papers are ſupported by ſubſcription, and for that very reaſon the <hi>Cenſor</hi> ſhall not. As long as people read, ſo long ſhall I write; and, when the Bookſeller advertiſes me that the work lies on his ſhelf, it will be a very good hint for me to draw in my quills.</p>
            <p>Here, then, begins a <hi>bellum eternum</hi> between the fabricating <hi>Quid-Nuncs</hi> and me.—There is my glove, gentlemen; take it up as ſoon as you will. You well know that your abuſe will infinitely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to my honour; and therefore, to ſilence me, by rendering my work ſterile and unintereſting, you are reduced to the cruel neceſſity of telling the truth.</p>
            <p>I ſhould think it neceſſary to offer an apology for having prefixed the title of <hi>Cenſor</hi> to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Number; but the reader will at once perceive; that it is now aſſumed for the ſake of uniformity, as applicable to the future contents of the work, and not to the remarks on the debates of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, a <hi>body</hi> to which I ſhould be very ſorry to be wanting in reſpect.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>POLITICAL</hi> CENSOR.</head>
            <p>THE Reader will pleaſe to recollect, that, in the <hi>Proſpect from the Congreſs Gallery,</hi> I brought down the proceedings in the Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to the 5th of January, the memorable day of the exhibition of the French Flag. I ſhould not now have thought of returning to the ſame ſubject, had I not been led to it by an attack on the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, in the anarchical Aurora of Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>One would have thought, that giving this flag a place among the <hi>Archives</hi> of the United States, would have been conferring honour enough on it; but nothing would content the French-Americans, who write in the paper I have juſt mentioned, ſhort of its being hoiſted in the Congreſs Chamber, as a trophy of the victory of French influence. They cite us the example of the Convention. But, let
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030219_0009_0FE526B71C79E2F0"/>
them ſay under what circumſtances, and with what motive our flag was granted a conſpicuous place in their hall. It was diſhonoured by being ſwung up, gibbeted up, by the ſide of the flag of <hi>regenerated</hi> Geneva; a ſtate in which the Convention had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed their ſyſtem of pillage and murder, and which they treated as a conquered country, rather than as an <hi>independent</hi> ally. To add to our humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, a duplicate, as I may call it, of our flag was ſent to Geneva, and there exhibited in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of a poor little degraded nation of thirty thouſand bodies, I will not call them ſouls. This was ſaying to the Geneveſe: See, you are not the only people who have thrown themſelves on our protecting power, and ſent us a pledge of their ſubmiſſion to our principles.</p>
            <p>Thus, by the indiſcretion (to give it the mildeſt term) of our Ambaſſador, have we been degraded in the eyes of even <hi>Italians,</hi> and expoſed to the gibes of the little ſcandalizing circles of the leaſt reſpectable people in Europe: and, in return for this cruel inſult, we are called upon to diſtinguiſh the flag of the Convention with a place in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſittings of our legiſlature, and by this act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ourſelves the ſupple tools of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulters!—This is modern patriotiſm.</p>

               <head>DEBATE ON THE APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE MINT.

                  <hi>Mr. Williams,</hi> agreeably to notice before given, mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>to ſtrike out of the Appropriation Bill all the groſs ſum, appropriated for the officers of the Mint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:030219_0010_0FE526EA95703478"/>Mr. SEDGWICK (from Maſſachuſetts) thought that the courſe which the gentleman is purſuing, has never been adopted before. It is incorrect to diſcuſs the merits of the mint in paſſing this bill. We might as well take up the ſalary of the chief juſtice, or any other article in the bill, as the mint. We never would have done at this rate. We are now only to vote for the bill, as agreeably to the laws already made. Mr. Sedgwick ſaid that if the gentleman from New-York (Mr. Williams) would bring forward any propoſition for the regulation, or even the abolition of the eſtabliſhment of the mint, if it could be proved productive of public benefit, he, with every other gentleman, would give him their aid to effect the object; but that now, he conceived, it could not regularly be brought forward. He thought an appropriation bill ſhould be conformed exactly to the ſtate of the public en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and that where eſtabliſhments had been form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſalaries provided, the amount of them ſhould be the principle of calculating the amount of appropriations; and the Houſe ought not, by witholding appropriations, to break in upon and deſtroy eſtabliſhments formed by the whole legiſlature. That theſe obſervations had hitherto been ſanctioned by the practice on this ſubject. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that if the Houſe was to inveſtigate, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of an appropriation bill, the amount of ſalaries and the legal eſtabliſhments of government, the public ſervice would be dangerouſly deſtroyed. He remarked, that it was to be obſerved, that no appropriation was made for any purpoſe ſince the commencement of the year.</p>
               <p>Mr. GALLATIN (from <hi>Geneva</hi>) roſe to ſtate a general principle which he thought it of importance to lay down on this occaſion; leſt the deciſion on the preſent queſtion grounded on a different principle, ſhould on ſome future occaſion be brought forward. The principle was, <hi>that this Houſe has a right by witholding appropiations when they ſee proper, to ſtop the wheels of Government.</hi> This he ſaid was plainly to be inferred from the practice of the Houſe, in their paſſing annually an appropriation law—He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that in one inſtance the Houſe had departed from that principle. In reſpect to the payment of the intereſt on the public debt, for the ſupport of the public credit,

the Houſe had thought it neceſſary to give up that right. If this principle is not juſt, it would be beſt to make a permanent proviſion at once.</p>
               <p>Mr. SEDGWICK ſaid that he had certainly no intention to have given occaſion to the obſervations which had been made, but as the general principle which he had laid down, had been denied, and as it had ſome relation either intimate or remote to the ſubject before the committee, he would take the liberty to repeat the principle, and to ſay a few words in ſupport of it.</p>
               <p>The principle, then, which he had aſſumed was, that when legal eſtabliſhments were made, it was the duty of the legiſlature to make appropriations conformably to the public engagements; and that neither branch had a right to withhold its aſſent.—He obſerved that the whole legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, and not a part, were competent to form contracts, and to eſtabliſh, and alter compenſations and ſalaries. The legiſlature, and not either branch of it, had the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of expreſſing the public will, and pledging the public faith: that when a ſalary is aſcertained, the public faith is pledged that it ſhall be paid, according to the ſtipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that therefore the public credit is involved in making the neceſſary appropriations, without which it could not be paid. He aſked if in ſuch caſe it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to the Houſe rightfully to withhold the means ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the performance of the public engagements!</p>
               <p>He ſaid he had always ſuppoſed that the power of the Houſe, in the caſe of appropriations, did not give a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to yield or withhold aſſent on ſuch a ſubject. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in every ſuch inſtance the exerciſe of diſcretion was reſtrained; to illuſtrate his ideas, he could mention a ſimilar inſtance. The conſtitution had declared, that the Preſident ſhould receive a ſtated compenſation for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, to be aſcertained by law; which could neither be diminiſhed nor enlarged during the term for which he ſhould have been elected. Here was a duty impoſed on the legiſlature, with the performance of which they could not, they had no power to diſpenſe. Yet after the compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſtated, no payment could be made in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of appropriating. He aſked if in this caſe, when
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030219_0012_0FE5268A7AAC5AF0"/>
the public will was expreſſed, the engagement and the national faith pledged, the legiſlature could of right with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the neceſſary appropriation? The ſame obſervations might he ſaid be applied to every inſtance where public controuls were formed. The public faith was pledged, the neceſſary appropriations muſt be made to prevent a violation of it, and if withheld ſuch violation might juſtly be charged on the legiſlature.</p>
               <p>Here a long converſation took place with reſpect to the expediency of the propoſed meaſure, on the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and diſadvantages of a Mint, &amp;c. After which Mr. <hi>Livingſton,</hi> whom we ſhall by-and-by ſee making a conſiderable figure in the field of oppoſition to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made a motion <hi>for the ſtriking out the whole appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation for the Mint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. MURRAY, (from Maryland) ſaid that had the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman from New-York moved for delay, for the purpoſe of introducing a motion to repeal the law which rendered this appropriation neceſſary, he would not have troubled the Houſe with a ſingle remark; but his motion to ſtrike out an appropriation for the purpoſe of bringing the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the law itſelf into diſcuſſion, contained a principle in his mind ſo repugnant to the great legiſlative duties of the Houſe that he would oppoſe it. The object of the appropriation is not a temporary one, but a part of the machinery of our government, under the expreſs authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the conſtitution by law. The doctrine now contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for by the gentlemen from New-York and Pennſylvania (Mr. Livingſton and Mr. Gallatin) was that this Houſe have a diſcretionary power of appropriating or not—To this doctrine, taken in the extent which he conceived they contended for, he could not give his ſupport. On the contrary, he thought, that in all caſes where an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation flowed from a law to make good a contract, or to erect a permanent organ in the government, and from any law whoſe object was permanent, the true doctrine was, that it was the duty of the Houſe to vote an appropriation. A law is the will of the nation. The ſame powers only, that formed it can repeal it. If it be a conſtitutional act, no power can lawfully obſtruct its operation or its exiſtence. But attending to the doctrine
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030219_0013_0FE526F5D8F505D8"/>
maintained to day it would follow, that though this Houſe had not the power of repealing a law made by all the branches of government, it may obſtruct its operations and render it a dead letter; though it cannot repeal, it may do what ſhall amount to a repeal, which is the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of a power almoſt equal to that of excluſive le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation. He thought he ſaw in this an evil of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and an anarchy of theoretic principles. It appeared to him that though we originate money bills, we had no right to refuſe an appropriation to exiſting laws that either ſecured a debt or any contract, or that related to objects permanent by the law that created or acknowleged them, as long as the law itſelf remained unrepealed. We had but a ſhare of legiſlative power. Where a law relative to ſuch objects as he had alluded to exiſted, from which an appropriation followed, till the law ceaſed by repeal or by other conſtitutional means, it was obligatory upon us as well as upon our conſtituents, and the only powers we could exerciſe of a diſcretionary ſort reſolved themſelves either into the mode of making good the appropriation, or of voting for its repeal. The other branches would then judge of the propriety of our proceeding; but till they who aſſiſted in its enacting, judged with us the neceſſity of doing it away, a duty reſulted that we ſhould give it the energy intended by its enaction.</p>
               <p>The Appropriation for the mint was finally paſſed.</p>

                  <p>Now, would it not have been much the ſhorteſt way for Mr. <hi>Livingſton</hi> to move for ſtriking out theſe three items! This would have been coming to the mark at once. By only three ſtrokes of the

                     <hi>"Calm Obſerver's"</hi> pen, the free, the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, the beneficent government of the United States might have been changed into a National Convention; and in the ſame number of days, we might have ſeen our ſtreets patrolled by revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary ruffians, our property expoſed to requiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and our heads to the guillotine.</p>
                  <p>But, it is not my intention to enter into the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of a motion, at once the height of malevolence and abſurdity; I have introduced this debate mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have an opportunity of introducing the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple laid down by <hi>Mr. Gallatin,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> along with it.</p>
                  <p>This gentleman tells us, that the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives <q>
                        <hi>have a right, by withholding appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations</hi> when they ſee proper, <hi>to</hi> ſtop the wheels of Government.</q>—I ſhould be glad to know were he learnt this: whether from his companions in Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock's Field, or from their correſpondents, the corrupted <hi>flour-merchants</hi> in Philadelphia. They, indeed, were well verſed in ſtopping the wheels of government, by the agency of <hi>appropriations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Mr. Gallatin roſe from his ſeat to broach this clogging principle, there was an old farmer ſitting beſide me, to whom the perſon of the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſeemed familiar. "Ah, ah!" ſays he, <q>what's little Moſes in Congreſs!</q>—I ſharply reprimand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for taking one of our Repreſentatives for a Jew; but, to confeſs a truth, the gentleman from <hi>Geneva</hi> has an accent not unlike that of a wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iſraelite. It is neither Italian German nor French, and, were it not a ſort of leze republican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, I would ſay he clipped the king's Engliſh moſt unmercifully. Such an accent is admirably adapted for extolling the value of leaden buckles,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030219_0015_0FE5271C6259BF38"/>
or for augmenting the diſcordant howlings of a ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue; but it throws a certain air of ridicule over the debates of a legiſlative aſſembly, and forms a ſort of burleſque on the harmonious eloquence of the other members.</p>
                  <p>When I told the good jog-trot to take care what he was ſaying, for that the perſonage then on his legs was no other than the great Gallatin, he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his eyes, and with a look and voice expreſſive of an honeſt indignation, "what!" ſays he, <q>that ſame Gallatin who was one of the leaders in the Weſtern Inſurrection?</q>—I could not help ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſimplicity of my country friend, in not perceiving that ſuch a circumſtance was the higheſt proof of Mr. Gallatin's patriotiſm, and the only one that recommended him to the ſuffrages of his conſtituents.—"No wonder," ſays the farmer, <q>that he wants to ſtop the wheels of government. I wiſh he'd attempt to ſtop the wheels of my waggon, as I am going down hill.</q>—God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, but I believe I ſaid <hi>amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. Gallatin has been accuſed of inconſiſtency, but here I cannot join the enemies of that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Whatever a man may be, I love to do him ample juſtice. This is a principle ſo ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in my breaſt, that it induces me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the defence of Mr. Gallatin's conſiſtency, though I have not the higheſt reſpect for his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conduct or for his character.</p>
                  <p>We might follow this gentleman through his political career from the day of his diſembarkation to the preſent ſeſſion of Congreſs, but it will not, I imagine, be neceſſary to go further back than the Weſtern Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="unknown:030219_0016_0FE526B8CCA70B50"/>So early as the 21ſt of July, 1791, we find him Clerk to a meeting for oppoſing the exciſe law, or, in other words, <q>ſtopping the wheels of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</q>—On the 21ſt of April, 1792, we find this adjourned meeting declaring: <q>That whereas ſome men may be found among us, ſo far loſt to every ſenſe of virtue, and feeling for the diſtreſſes of our country, as to accept the office for the collection of the duty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Reſolved, therefore, that in future we will conſider ſuch perſons as unworthy of our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, have no intercourſe or dealings with them, withdraw from them every aſſiſtance, and <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all the comforts of life,</hi> which depend upon thoſe duties which as men and fellow citizens we owe to each other, and upon all occaſions, treat them with that contempt they deſerve; and that it be, and it is hereby moſt earneſtly <hi>recommended to the people at large,</hi> to follow the ſame line of conduct towards them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, then, I think here is no inconſiſtency; no change of principles. The man that could draw up a reſolution like this, cannot be ſaid to have abandoned his principles, when he declares that the Houſe of Repreſentatives may ſtop the wheels of government, when they ſee proper, by withholding appropriations.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid, indeed, that Mr. Gallatin has ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of his inſurrection conduct, that he called the above quoted reſolution his "political ſin," and we all know that he ſigned a promiſe of ſubmiſſion to the laws; but, let it be remembered, that he never talked about this political ſin, until he came down to Philadelphia, and that his promiſe of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030219_0017_0FE4FE534FDF1470"/>
to the laws was not made, until he ſaw that reſiſtance was in vain, and that it was the only way of availing himſelf of the amneſty, and ſaving his carcaſe from a loathſome dungeon. And, if he did leave his poor deluded adherents in the lurch, and even ſacrifice them to his own ſafety, this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     </gap>. It is by no means a proof of inconſiſtency in the gentleman from Geneva. It is, to uſe the words of a late political writer, <q>varying his means <hi>to preſerve the</hi> unity of his end.</q> When overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a government, or ſtopping its wheels, is the ſole object of a patriot, ſo long as he keeps ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily towards the point, whether by open rebellion, confeſſing his political ſin, pretending ſubmiſſion, lurching his aſſociates, or withholding appropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he can never be juſtly charged with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency.</p>

               <head>DEBATE ON THE APPOINTMENT OF A STENOGRAPHER.
<date>January 29th.</date>
               </head>
               <p>On the 28th a report of the Stenographical committee was given in, ſpecifying that the committee had received propoſals from Mr. <hi>David Robertſon</hi> of Virginia, whoſe demand for one ſeſſions was 4,000 dollars. The report became the order of the day for the twenty ninth, when a reſolution was propoſed in favour of the appointment.</p>
               <p>I ſhall chooſe from this debate what fell from Mr. Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick and Mr. William Smith, as appearing to me to comprize nearly all that was urged on both ſides.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:030219_0018_0FE5269992B1B888"/>Mr. SWANWICK (from Pennſylvania) As to the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who is the ſubject of the reſolution, If I have more ſtrenuouſly than uſual oppoſed the motion, it is from a deſire to keep him from quitting the lucrative ſituation he is ſaid to find himſelf in, to embark on the ſtormy ſea he is contemplating: to be the organ of the members of this Houſe to their conſtituents is indeed a very delicate taſk; one for which, conſidering the danger he might be in of an Orpheus's fate, that of being torn to pieces, the ſalary is but a poor compenſation. He is to do juſtice to the eloquence of ſome members—he is to clothe in an elegant dreſs the uncouth, yet well meaning expreſſions of others, but what will he do with the ſilent members, who never ſpeak at all?—What will their conſtituents think of them; indeed, Sir, if he had the idea I have formed of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he will not undertake at all. Faction and party have been mentioned—happy Stenographer if he can keep clear of theſe. If he fall into their power, inſenſibly he will repreſent one ſide in clouds and darkneſs, the other as ornamented with the brighteſt beams of light. How will he pleaſe both? Miſrepreſentation is complained of alas, Sir, how quick is error, how flow is the progreſs of truth in almoſt all things: our Stenographer muſt indeed be a wonder working man, if he can revert this tide, and make every where light, and correct reaſoning prevail. The beſt mode of informing our conſtituents is by the yeas and nays on our acts; this truly ſhews, as a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from New-Hampſhire has obſerved, our doings, which are much more intereſting to them than our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract reaſonings; theſe our conſtituents will eaſily form to themſelves ideas of when they know our votes.</p>
               <p>Mr. W. LYMAN (Maſſachuſetts) ſaid that, if this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not paſs, <hi>it would be adviſable to ſend all the Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the gallery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. W. SMITH (South Carolina) ſaid it was admitted on all ſides, that it was highly important for the people to receive the moſt accurate information of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the houſe, and that the debates were in general extremely miſrepreſented. Was it not then the duty of the houſe to remedy this evil and to adopt ſuch meaſures as would tranſmit to the people in every part of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States the moſt accurate information of the conduct of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030219_0019_0FE5265BD7C1AE28"/>
their repreſentatives? The houſe had now an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of obtaining the ſervices of a gentleman peculiarly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for the rare talent of reporting with accuracy pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic debates: the compenſation which would be adequate to ſuch uſeful and laborious ſervice was beyond the ability of any printer, the houſe ought therefore to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; the ſum required was a trifle when compared with the advantages; it was no object: the only queſtion then was whether the ſtenographer ought to be an officer of the Houſe; in that capacity he certainly would be more eaſily reſtrained from the commiſſion of any wilful miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation. Mr. Smith did not feel the force of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the report. It had been ſaid that although the members were now miſrepreſented, yet they had it in their power to publiſh corrections; but theſe corrections were often overlooked, while the miſrepreſentation was operating very injuriouſly to the character of the member: this was generally the caſe in places remote from the ſeat of government; the mangled account of a debate was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiſhed in a diſtant paper, and the correction if it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſtant printer, was generally diſregarded. Among the opponents to the report, Mr. Smith ſaid that he was ſurpriſed to find the gentleman who repreſented this city, (Mr. Swanwick) who more than any other member ſhould have withdrawn his oppoſition to the meaſure propoſed; that gentleman's conſtituents had it in their power at any time to hear the debates of Congreſs; they were on the ſpot; ought he not then in candor to aſſiſt in facilitating to the remote citizens the means of obtaining the beſt knowledge of the proceedings, and the moſt correct ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſcuſſions of the houſe; ought they, from their remoteneſs, to be kept in the dark, or to be furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch light as would only miſlead? Had they not a claim on the houſe to adopt ſuch means as would ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the citizens in every ſtate to judge of the propriety of public meaſures? The member from this city had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excluſive advantage; if miſrepreſented he could cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the error, and the correction will be read; that was not the caſe with the members of remoter ſtates, whoſe reputation might be injured by miſrepreſentation without a ſimilar advantage: the member from this city was in the midſt of his conſtituents; he had daily opportunities of ſetting right any miſtatement by perſonal explanation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:030219_0020_0FE526F9871629C8"/>Mr. SMITH ſaid he did not agree with ſome Gentlemen that it was ſufficient for the people to know what laws were paſſed, without knowing the previous diſcuſſions; he thought on the contrary, the favorable or unfavorable impreſſion of a Law on the public mind would depend in a great degree on the reaſons aſſigned for and againſt it in debates, and the people ought to know thoſe reaſons; when a Law paſſes, impoſing a Tax, would not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be reconciled, if they ſaw from the diſcuſſions of the houſe that ſuch Tax was unavoidable, and that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mode of taxation was the beſt which could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed? And ought this information to depend entirely on the caprice or convenience of the reporters, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended when it pleaſed them, and who publiſhed juſt as much of the debates as they found leiſure or patience to accompliſh? Mr. Smith ſaid, he was convinced that the errors which had excited ſo much complaint were not the effect of deſign, but merely of inadequacy to the taſk; very few were competent to ſuch a buſineſs, which requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed peculiar ſkill in ſtenography, very laborious application, and a clear comprehenſion of the ſubject matter of debate. It could not be expected that perſons thus qualified would devote their whole time to this buſineſs without an ample reward. The report was objected to becauſe there was novelty in the plan; it was true the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of England had no ſuch officer, but their practice was not a fit precedent for us on this occaſion, for they admitted no perſon to write down in the houſe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; their debates were taken from memory. This houſe on the contrary had from its firſt inſtitution, facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, by every accommodation, the reporting their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. The thing was not altogether however without precedent; during the exiſtence of the national aſſembly of France there were officers of the houſe who compoſed a daily work called the Logography, which was an exact account of the debates of that body. It had been aſked what controul the houſe were to have over this officer? he anſwered that the Stenographer would be liable to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured or diſplaced, if he ſhould be guilty of wilful miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation; it would be always eaſy to diſcriminate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a caſual inadvertence, and a criminal miſtatement: the officer's character and talents, his reſponſibility to the houſe, and his oath to report with impartiality, would
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030219_0021_0FE4FE54D8CB59E0"/>
be a ſufficient pledge of his accuracy. Mr. Smith ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed, that the character of the houſe had ſuffered from the erroneous ſtatements which had gone abroad; he wiſhed to guard againſt this evil in future; he was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for himſelf, that every ſyllable he uttered within thoſe walls, ſhould be carried to every part of the union, but he deprecated miſrepreſentation. He was anxious that the truth ſhould be known, in relation to every act of the government, for he was as ſatisfied that the affection and confidence of the people in this government would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe with the promulgation of truth, as that whatever it had loſt of that affection and confidence was owing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to the propagation of detraction and calumny. It was under theſe impreſſions that he had originally brought forward the propoſition, and that he now recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the report, and having heard no reaſons to change his ſentiments of the expediency of the meaſure, he ſhould perſiſt in ſupporting it.</p>

                  <p>The Houſe had nearly got upon a rock here, which they would have found it difficult to get off from in ſafety. Perhaps there was never a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion propoſed, at once ſo apparently trifling and ſo pregnant with miſchief. Let any man reflect for a moment on the ſtate of parties in this country, and he will look with affright at the appointment of an officer, inveſted with the power of disfiguring every argument and even every phraſe that a member of the legiſlature may let fall. The gentlemen who ſupported the reſolution, talk of his being ſworn; and, did we live in thoſe good old times, when oaths were ſuperior to the ſpirit of party, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument would be unanſwerable: but, alas! thoſe times are no more. Oaths on the Evangeliſts are, in this <hi>enlightened</hi> age, little more than mockery.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030219_0022_0FE5265DB54511D8"/>
The members of the preſent Congreſs have every man of them ſworn to maintain the Conſtitution of the United States, and yet, how many of them do we ſee at this moment ſtraining every faculty of the mind to render it null and void? what, then could be hoped from a Stenographer.</p>
                  <p>Were a perfect ſtranger to liſten to a debate he would contract a partiality for one ſide or the other, before it was half over. Every man in a popular government has his party; and who can ſuppoſe that the Stenographer would not have his? It was ſaid that the Houſe had a check upon him, in their power to diſmiſs him from his office. But, this muſt be done by a vote of the Houſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could be no defence for a member who had the misfortune to find himſelf in a minority.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, this power of diſmiſſion is one of the worſt parts of the plan; for, as the Stenographer would be loath to quit ſo lucrative an employment, he would of neceſſity be led to preſerve a majority in his favour; and, what would be ſo ſure a way of doing this as miſrepreſenting the ſpeeches of the minority? a member might complain; but the Stenographer, ſecure in his majority, would laugh at him. Thus might a man of talents and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity be officially repreſented as a fool or a knave, without having the poſſibility of redreſs. In vain would he endeavour to juſtify himſelf: the ſworn Stenographer would be believed before him, and the Houſe, by a ſolemn deciſion, would determine that he had ſaid what he never dreamt of.</p>
                  <p>Should an officer like this ever enter the Houſe, it is eaſy to forſee that he will not be long wanted. The very ſight of ſuch a tremendous umpire
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030219_0023_0FE5269C6D288818"/>
would frighten away all freedom of ſpeech. It is true the members of the majority might prattle away, but thoſe of the other ſide would naturally look upon themſelves in the ſituation of a man who is making a depoſition. One party only would dare to open their mouths. Where there is no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition there can be no debate, and, of courſe no need of a Stenographer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Smith's</hi> objection to citing the example of the Britiſh Houſe of Commons on this occaſion did not appear to me well founded. They permit no one to write down their words after them; yet I believe it will be allowed that their debates are very well reported, and this is a pretty good proof that an officer for that purpoſe is by no means neceſſary,</p>
                  <p>This gentleman mentioned the officers of the <hi>Logography</hi> employed by the ſecond National Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly in France. Unfortunate inſtance! the French Conſtitution, that <q>maſter-piece of legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</q> which was to laſt as long as the round world, laſted only ten months and ten days; and, among the engines by which it was deſtroyed, the office of the Logography claims a conſpicuous place. There were ten of theſe reporters. They wrote in the literal character: one took the firſt ſentence, another the ſecond, and ſo on. Ten men were much more difficult to warp and corrupt than one would be, and yet we ever ſee them the decided tools of the ſtrongeſt party. Members complained of miſrepreſentations, and had the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to ſee their complaints ſtill more disfigured than their ſpeeches. The conſequence was, the few real friends of the Conſtitution were obliged to hold their tongues, and ſuffer the inflamatory har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030219_0024_0FE52639D28B6BD8"/>
of their opponents to go forth among the people uncontradicted.</p>
                  <p>I never like to hear the examples of foreign go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments applied to our own, particularly the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of what is called the government of France. I was aſtoniſhed that a gentleman of Mr. Smith's good ſenſe and good intentions ſhould hold up for our imitation, or even mention as an inſtance, one of the moſt inſidious meaſures of an Aſſembly, who were guilty of every crime under heaven; who, after having repeatedly ſworn to defend with their lives the inviolability of their ſovereign, cooly planned an inſurrection to hurl him from his throne, afterwards made this very inſurrection the ſubject of an article of accuſation againſt him, and decreed that their own <hi>perjury was a virtue!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr. Lyman's</hi> hint for driving all the printers out of the houſe, <hi>unleſs the reſolution paſſed,</hi> was a ſtriking inſtance of the domineering ſpirit, which would infallibly have overborn any Stenographer who had been unfortunate enough to accept of the poſt.</p>
                  <p>This hint broke out, ſome days after, in the form of a reſolution, from the lips of <hi>Mr. Heath</hi> of Virginia.—<q>
                        <hi>Reſolved, that, until a Stenogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher be appointed, or further proviſion made for taking the debates of this Houſe,</hi> no printer be permitted to publiſh abſtracts of the ſpeeches of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, unleſs permitted by members making the ſame.</q> This was the ſubſtance of the reſolution, and a curious one it is.</p>
                  <p>Theſe gentlemen ſeem to have been determined to force their harrangues, at full length, down
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030219_0025_0FE526A30B50F130"/>
our throats, or to keep us in a ſort of political ſtarvation. We muſt either ſwallow them by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of yards, as buffoons do ribbons, or we muſt never have a taſte.</p>
                  <p>I wonder where Mr. Lyman learnt a doctrine like this. Such an idea could certainly never be engendered in the free temperate air of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts. As to the gentleman from Virginia I am not ſurprized; for, we know that, when a ſulky negro will not lick up his meſs clean, however inſipid, diſguſting and nauſeous it may be, he is muzzled till his ſtomach comes to. But, are we Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians to be treated thus?—No, no, Mr. Heath; when you get the government on the other ſide of the Potomack, you may, and undoubtedly will, do what you pleaſe with it; but we have four years to live, at any rate; be not in ſuch haſte to muzzle us then.</p>
                  <p>Should this reſolution ever reach the other ſide of the Atlantic, what idea will it give the Engliſh patriots of our liberty of the preſs? If a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Britiſh Houſe of Commons were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch a tyrannical reſolution, I ſhould not wonder to hear of his being ſtoned to death. Not publiſh abſtracts from ſpeeches without particular permiſſion! The idea was certainly imported from the borders of the <hi>Palus Meotis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had theſe two gentlemen reſtricted the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their <hi>own ſpeeches,</hi> I believe that neither the Houſe nor the public would have cared much about the matter; for neither of them is of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceronian ſtamp. It is obſervable, that thoſe who appeared moſt anxious for the appointment of a Stenographer, if we except one or two, are amongſt the few whoſe ſpeeches can do them no ſort of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030219_0026_0FE526A6954557D0"/>
with any party. This is the way of the world. Animals, whether endued with the faculty of ſpeech or not, ſeem to fly in the face of nature. The ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woman is everlaſtingly at her glaſs: the owl thought her frightful brood the prettieſt little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world; and the inſipid orator, while his voice is drowned in the hemmings, coughings and ſnorings of his drowſy audience, thinks he is uttering ſentences that ought to be written in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of gold.</p>
                  <p>It was obſerved in the courſe of the debate, that, if the printers committed errors, gentlemen might write out their ſpeeches and ſend them to the preſs. To this Mr. Nichols replied, that he was above do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſuch thing.—For my part, I muſt confeſs, that, were I capable of making a ſpeech, I ſhould be too lazy to write it out for the News-Papers; but as to its being beneath a law-giver, I ſhall ſay nothing; for we have an example before our eyes of a folio orator in the Houſe of Aſſembly of Pennſylvania, who is ſo far from thinking it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath him to write out his ſpeeches, that he even reads them from his ſeat, like a ſchool-boy from his bench. I allude here to one <hi>Doctor Morpheus,</hi> who, finding his neighbours determined not to die under his hands, is now endeavouring to aſſaſſinate the State. The State, however, ſeems to partake of the obſtinacy of his neighbours, turning a deaf ear to all his preſcriptions. The bolus of ſedition which he had kneaded up for the Aſſembly, did, indeed, at firſt, operate as a provocative on ſome of the members from Whiſkyland; but, luckily, the ſoporific qualities of it ſoon became predominant, and, at laſt, abſolutely irreſiſtible. At the end of the ſecond paragraph the Chairman was perceived to yawn, the third rocked him off, and the fourth laid the whole Aſſembly faſt aſleep. The fifth
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030219_0027_0FE526BA509CDE60"/>
reached the door-keeper, at the further end of the paſſage, and before the ſixth was half finiſhed, an old woman who fells apples at the gate, dropped from her ſtool. The political <hi>Morpheus</hi> continued to ſpread his poppies, till, perceiving the effects of his bolus, he ſlunk off home to his liver nippy and ſour cront.—Should this quack in politicks as well as phyſick be ſuffered to continue his lectures, the Aſſembly of Pennſylvania may write over their doors, as the French do over thoſe of their burying grounds: "This is the place of everlaſting ſleep."</p>
                  <p>After this little trip to the Land of Nod, let us return to our Stenographer.</p>
                  <p>I by no means call in queſtion the virtue of Mr. Robertſon, the officer propoſed: on the contrary, I ſhould ſuppoſe his virtue muſt be very high; for, like that of Fielding's poſt-boy, it is very high priced. If it be equal to his modeſty, it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beyond any thing reaſonably to be expected from a frail mortal. The humble demand of four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dollars for the ſeſſion is not a great deal more than eight times as much as any member of the Houſe receives. The very mention of ſuch a ſum cannot fail to bring forth ſwarms of Stenographers, as a warm night at the play-houſe is ſaid to hatch comedians.</p>
                  <p>I cannot conclude this article without reminding gentlemen of their cruelty to my poor Caledonian friend, Callender. How was he mauled! how was his <hi>Regiſter</hi> torn to pieces! one took him by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030219_0028_0FE5265F3936FCE8"/>
Virginia! how could you ſo belabour this import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed patriot? a man that has not only forſworn his country, but has written, or rather tranſcribed, two whole "Political Progreſſes" purely to curry fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with you! nay, he has even blaſphemed the Preſident, and juſtified the non-payment of debts; and yet, Oh, ingratitude! you could ſmile at his agonies! if this be the way you treat your friends, I hope I ſhall never be numbered amongſt them; at leaſt until your manners and principles change.</p>
                  <p>One gentleman expreſſed a good deal of anxiety, leſt the "Political Regiſter" ſhould deſcend to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; but, let him quiet his fears on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; for, whether the ſpeeches which Callender has collected were <hi>written out</hi> or not, they are a more potent opiate than any drug that was ever pounded in the mortar of <hi>Doctor Morpheus,</hi> and that is ſaying a great deal, I am ſure.</p>
                  <p>I now come to a debate, if a debate it can be called, which I would have the reader paſs over without peruſal, if he has a heart ready to take fire, when he ſees a wanton indignity offered to the greateſt and moſt eſtimable characters.</p>

               <head>DEBATE ON HALF AN HOUR'S ADJOURN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT.
<date>February 22nd.</date>
               </head>
               <p>This was the Birth-Day of <hi>General Waſhington.</hi> The morning was remarkably fair: the firmament decked in its brighteſt robes. May it ever be ſo! Never, never may a cloud darken this auſpicious day!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:030219_0029_0FE526BC347F1A28"/>The city was all alive: joy ſeemed to gliſten in every face; the workman had thrown by his ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and the houſewife her needle, to celebrate this feſtival of valour, wiſdom, and true patriotiſm. I was going, among hundreds of others, to ſee the cannons of the ſtate fired on this joyful occaſion, when, paſſing by the Houſe where the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives meet, I perceived the doors open. I thought I would juſt ſtep in, and ſee what they were about, I entered, found the gallery quite empty, and was ſurprized not to find the houſe empty alſo. This ſurprize ſoon gave way to indignation, as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will readily believe, when he hears what was paſſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Smith</hi> (from South Carolina) moved, that the Houſe adjourn for <hi>half an hour,</hi> in order to give the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers an opportunity of congratulating the Preſident of the United States on the return of his Birth-Day.</p>
               <p>Strange to tell! this motion was oppoſed. The ground of this oppoſition was, that it was the duty of the Houſe firſt to attend to the diſcharge of their legiſlative functions, before they attended to the paying of compliments. It was ſaid, on the other hand, that it had been the practice, ever ſince the eſtabliſhment of the general government, for the Houſe to make a ſhort adjournment, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe mentioned in the motion.</p>
               <p>After ſome converſation in this way, <hi>Mr. Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin</hi> (from <hi>Geneva,</hi> laſt from <hi>Whiſkyland</hi>) moved, that the words, <hi>"half an hour,"</hi> be ſtruck out,</p>
               <p>This amendment was rejected. The motion was then put, and loſt.</p>

                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:030219_0030_0FE5273B14D757A8"/>Thus was it determined, by a majority of twelve, to withhold from the Preſident a ſlight compliment, which he had been accuſtomed to receive from the Houſe, from the firſt year of its exiſtence.</p>
               <p>I was but too right in ſaying, that, at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſeſſion, <q>he ſaw, even among thoſe to whom he addreſſed himſelf, numbers, who, to repay all his labours, all his anxious cares for their welfare, were ready to preſent him the cup of humiliation filled to the brim.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was <hi>Mr. Parker,</hi> the <hi>blooming</hi> and <hi>accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Mr. Parker, the <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>virtuous</hi> Mr. Parker of the <hi>free</hi> State of Virginia, who is as punctual in the diſcharge of his legiſlative functions as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents are in the diſcharge of their debts: it was this celebrated gentleman, who opened the career, by a motion for not waiting on the Preſident with an anſwer to his ſpeech to both Houſes. Mr. Park<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was, without doubt, perſuaded of the truth of Johnſon's maxim:
<q>
                     <l>"Fate never wounds more deep the <hi>gen'rous heart,</hi>
                     </l>

               <p>The excuſe, <q>that it was the duty of the Houſe firſt to attend to the diſcharge of their legiſlative func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</q> was the moſt miſerable ſubterfuge, that ever iſſued from the lips of malevolence. <hi>Half an hour</hi> only was aſked for.

the "diſcharge of their legiſlative functions?" Yet, this was not done, nor, I believe, propoſed; though ſome one of theſe fifty indefatigable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were certainly preſent. How differently do men ſee the ſame object, under different circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances! the Speaker's head-ache adjourns the Houſe for whole days. But, <hi>half an hour,</hi> a poor thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty minutes, was too precious to be waſted in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful compliment to the beſt man, perhaps, this day exiſting in the world!</p>
               <p>The gentleman from <hi>Whiſkyland</hi> was, without doubt, afraid, that the motion would not be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed altogether. He imagined the Houſe had not ſo far got the better of all decency, as to come to an unqualified determination not to wait on the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he therefore propoſed to leave out the words, <hi>"half an hour."</hi> If this amendment had paſſed, the Houſe would have adjourned, not for <hi>half an hour,</hi> but for the whole day; but then it would have ſeemed that they did it for their own pleaſure and recreation, and not for the purpoſe of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting General Waſhington, the only thing that Mr. Gallatin ſeems to have been afraid of.</p>
               <p>This propoſed amendment is an excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the ambiguous excuſe, <q>that it was the duty of the Houſe firſt to attend to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their legiſlative functions.</q> What! would their duty permit them to ſeparate for <hi>the whole day,</hi> and not permit them to ſeparate for <hi>half an hour?</hi> theſe gentlemen ſeem to count time as the French do their aſſignats; a thirtieth part is more valuable than the whole. Mr. Gallatin appears to have ſcorned the ſubterfuge. No matter how much time was ſpent, or in what manner, ſo that it was
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030219_0032_0FE526A9E02F49D0"/>
not for the expreſs purpoſe of waiting on the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident; ſo that the inſult was rendered acute.</p>
               <p>What muſt have been the Preſident's reflections, when he read the ſketch of this debate? an intrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreigner, a mere adventurer, who never ſat his foot in the United States, until long after the revolution, comes here to arraign the conduct of General Waſhington, to alienate the affections of the people from him, while he baſks in the ſunſhine of his government, and reaps the fruits of his val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and his wiſdom. And, what are the ſervices Mr. Gallatin ever rendered America? is this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion neceſſary? where is the man who does not recollect the alarm, the diſtreſs, cauſed by the Weſtern Inſurrection? the million and a half of dollars that it coſt the Union, beſides immenſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſacrifices? fifteen thouſand men forced from their buſineſs and their homes, to undergo one of the moſt fatiguing marches ever performed, and which many of them did not ſurvive, cannot alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be forgotten. Aſk any of theſe men; aſk the families, the widows and orphans, of thoſe who loſt their lives in this expedition, what are the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices Mr. Gallatin has rendered their country. And yet this man now raiſes his head among the legiſlators of the United States, and refuſes thirty minutes of reſpect to the very man, to whoſe leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to whoſe <hi>amneſty</hi> alone he owes, that he is now in a ſituation to inſult him.</p>
               <p>When I compare the determination of the Houſe of Repreſentatives of this day, with their conduct and that of the people, at the time of the Preſident's inſtallation, I bluſh for them.—His journey from his ſeat in Virginia to New York, was almoſt one continued triumphal entry. As he approached the towns, he found the road decked with laurel and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030219_0033_0FE5263CD5C906C0"/>
ſtrewed with flowers. Sometimes he was hailed with the firing of cannon, at others with the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bells, and every where with the ſhouts of the multitude. Proceſſions were formed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him, the magiſtrates, the military, men of all trades, companies of matrons and choirs of white-robed virgins. It were vain to attempt an account of the feſtivals, balls, galas, fireworks, illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, mottos, ſonnets, and odes, in honour of the "Saviour of his Country."—<q>Merit (ſaid one of his panegyriſts on this occaſion)</q> Merit muſt be great indeed, <q>when it can call forth ſuch hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours from a free and enlightened people. Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours due to a man, whoſe life has been one ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of labours, which are upon a ſcale that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven never before aſſigned to mortal. <hi>Future ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations</hi> will ſay of him with the poet:</q>

               <p>Will "future generations" believe, that, in leſs than ſeven years after this unbounded ſtrain of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyric was in vogue, the Repreſentatives of the people came to a formal determination, that <hi>half an hour</hi> was too much to be waſted in congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating this ſame man on the return of his Birth-Day?</p>
               <p>When the Preſident firſt accepted the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble poſt he now fills, what was the ſtate of this country? Suffice it to ſay, that it was ſuch as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited ſhame at home and contempt from abroad. His acceptance of the Preſidency inſpired a kind of national joy; it was the preſage of a proſperity that
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030219_0034_0FE5273C9A47C498"/>
was to heal the wounds of a long and tireſome ſtate of diſcredit and confuſion. The people clung to him as the anchor of their hope: and, have they been deceived? Have not the riches and proſperity of the whole country far outſtripped what could be hoped for by the moſt ſanguine? More has been accompliſhed in the ſhort ſpace of ſeven years, under the Federal government than was accompliſhed in an age, under any other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the world. If, then, the Preſident merited ſuch high eulogiums, at the time of his tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him the adminiſtration of this government, what does he merit now? Certainly he does not merit to be inſulted. Certainly <hi>thirty minutes</hi> of adjournment would not have been too much for a man, who, a few years ago, <q>ſtood upon the boundary line between human and divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Do the gentlemen of the Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives recollect, that not only our eyes but the eyes of the world are on them? What will other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſay to us? What will Europeans, who look on General Waſhington as the firſt of mankind, and who have heard and admired all our praiſes beſtowed on him, what will they think of us and our Repreſentatives, when they are told of this thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty minutes deciſion. We have often boaſted that our Preſident was happier than any monarch upon earth, as reigning in the hearts of a free people. I hope this tone will ceaſe, until we take effectual meaſures to guard him againſt future indignities. When a king is inſulted, we ſee all the worthy part of his ſubjects preſs forward to the throne with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of their love and eſteem, and pledging their lives and fortunes for his ſecurity. Here a certain torpidity ſeems to pervade all this claſs of ſociety: if their wiſhes are kind and ſincere, they
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030219_0035_0FE52669842D9480"/>
are uſeleſs, as long as they do not break out into action.</p>
               <p>But, it would be unjuſt not to ſay, that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, was very far from being ſanctioned by the voice of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. That voice breathed ſentiments very different from thoſe of the oppoſers of Mr. Smith's motion for an adjournment; and of this the Houſe had a ſtriking and humiliating proof.—For my part, the motion was no ſooner loſt than I quitted the Gallery, boiling with indignation, and went to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the jollity of the day; but, the next morning, I had the ſatisfaction of reading the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing extracts from the debates, that took place in my abſence. <q>
                     <hi>Mr. Nichols,</hi> ſays the reporter, offered his obſervations on the bill; but, from the firing of cannon, beating of drums, ringing of bells, and huzzas, <hi>in honour of the Preſident's Birth-Day,</hi> it was impoſſible to hear what he ſaid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing on earth was ever more apropos than this. How muſt the oppoſers of the motion have felt? ſomething like a king of England, when he heard the ſhouts of his ſoldiers for the acquittal of the biſhops, whoſe diſgrace and ruin he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated. If ever malice met its true reward, it was at this moment. As if the people had ſaid: <q>you have aimed a blow at the reputation of our friend and father: you wiſh to perſuade us, that he is no longer worthy of our love and veneration; but you ſhall not ſucceed. He is as dear to us as ever. You may continue your harrangues; but we will drown your voices with our accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations for the return of the happy day, that gave him to the world.</q>

                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:030219_0036_0FE5274B3A92B488"/>It is with triumphant ſatisfaction I obſerve, that the 22nd of February was never ſo honoured as this year. Every State, every town in the Union, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded with feſtivity and joy. The city of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, ever diſtinguiſhed for its attachment to the Preſident, ſeemed truly ſenſible of the treaſure it poſſeſſed. The theatre, the circus, the ball-rooms, even thoſe of private parties, were decorated with emblems of his wiſe and heroic deeds. Every heart overflowed with gladneſs and gratitude. A few ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary breaſts in Congreſs alone, mourned amidſt the joyous ſcene; as the poiſonous plants under the torrid zone are ſaid to flag and droop, while thoſe of ſalubrious qualities raiſe their heads, flouriſh and bloom.</p>

May the day of his nativity be marked in the calendar of time, and conſecrated as a feſtival worthy of the celebration of the lateſt ages; but let blackneſs of darkneſs for ever reſt upon the accurſed hour, that gave ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence to <hi>his unprincipled calumniators.</hi>

                  </gap> two of my opponents, to enable the reader to judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us.</p>
               <p>Mr. SWANWICK (who ſpoke on the ſame ſide that I ſhall do) ſaid, that he objected to the bill generally upon the ſame ground as yeſterday, with reſpect to joining the ſecurities of the lots and the faith of the United States to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. He aſked how the paſſing of this bill could give value to the buildings of the Federal City? Is it not, ſaid he, already enacted that Congreſs ſhall fit there in the year 1801? The value of the lots, he ſaid, was to be increaſed only by the ſelling them to a number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The city muſt owe its proſperity to its peculiar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages as a commercial ſpot, and not from its being the ſeat of government. It was, therefore, the intereſt of the United States to ſell the lots and induce the people to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle there. The higher price the lots bore, the greater would be the obſtacles to ſettlement. If it was the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States to grant money for the completion of the buildings let the Houſe ſay ſo. When it was firſt propoſed to remove the government to the Federal city, it was ſaid that it would be the intereſt of perſons to give lots to encourage the government to come there. The ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity now aſked for was never contemplated. He had, however, no objection to the United States granting money, but he was againſt the making of two loans, one on the credit of the United States, and another on that of the United States, and certain lots.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRENT (from Virginia) ſaid, that it had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that if the lots be a ſufficient ſurety for the loan, why guaranty it? at preſent, he ſaid, the lots were not ſufficient. Mr. Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſerved, <hi>that the bill before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

conſidered as the touchſtone to determine whether the ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will go to the banks of the Potomack, or not.</hi> Motives of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and economy, and objections to increaſing the public debt, will not apply in this caſe; the very act provides funds to guaranty the loan, for though the property, until the propoſed loan be guarantied, would ſell for <hi>a mere trifle,</hi> when it is <hi>guarantied,</hi> it will ſell for a <hi>great price;</hi> ſo great a difference would it make, that he believed property which will then ſell for two millions of dollars, would not otherwiſe be worth 100,000 dollars. If, therefore, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen are againſt the bill from economical views, they are miſtaken; for, it was his opinion, that the property would not only pay off the loan, but eventually <hi>be a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable fund towards the diſcharge of the public debt.</hi> It had been ſuggeſted that the United States were under no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to make this guarantee. He thought differently; he believed the credit of the United States materially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. The public have relied fully upon the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of government in the buſineſs, many perſons, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, have made great ſacrifices to procure lots in this new city, and, if after holding out temptations to people, government ſhould not go there at the propoſed time, all theſe perſons will be ruined, and <hi>a ſtain will be laid on the national character.</hi> He hoped, therefore, no objection would be made to carrying the bill into effect.</p>
               <p>Mr. GILES (from Virginia) wiſhed to remark on what had fallen from a member from Pennſylvania yeſterday, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the law providing for the removal of the ſeat of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. <hi>That law, he ſaid, differed from all others.</hi> The Conſtitution itſelf, he ſaid, preſcribes the rule, the act only fixes the ſpot where it ſhould be carried into effect. <hi>The act is, therefore, not repealable.</hi> The Conſtitution does not give a power to fix upon two ſpots, but upon one ſpot. He thought it neceſſary to make this remark, leſt he might be ſuppoſed to countenance the opinion he comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It had been remarked, that it would be in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree degrading to the United States, to borrow money on the credit of lots; he thought differently, and ſhewed that it was a common thing in governments to borrow money on different funds. It had been wiſhed to diſconnect the government from the buſineſs—whilſt government guarantied the loan, he ſaid, it would make no difference
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030219_0039_0FE526AD58A91858"/>
whether the loan was bottomed on the lots or otherwiſe. The nature of the engagement was the ſame. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was whether the Houſe would agree to guaranty the loan, or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. GILES ſaid, that he had ſeen and was acquainted with the buildings carrying on in the Federal city. He thought <hi>the houſe erecting for the reſidence of the Preſident was much too magnificent,</hi> much more ſo than was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Every one thought ſo who ſaw it; but this was no reaſon for obſtructing the progreſs of the buſineſs. He hoped the bill would be formed in a manner ſo as to meet the general ſenſe of the Houſe. Though he had <hi>objected to the grandeur of the houſe intended for the Preſident,</hi> he would have the buildings <hi>for congreſs erected on a grand ſcale, and fitted for the repreſentatives of a great and free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bill was finally recommitted.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The reader has heard what was ſaid on both ſides of this queſtion, and I have now to beg him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to what I would have ſaid, had I been a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Congreſs.</p>

                     <salute>Mr. CHAIRMAN,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>It is well known, that I am no orator; that I ſpeak right on, making my tongue the true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of my heart. You will not therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from me the wily ſophiſtry of a G—tin, the quibbling of a G—les, the verboſity of a B—win, or the patriotic bombaſt of a Liv—ton.</p>
                  <p>It is ſeldom, Sir, that I trouble the Houſe with my ſentiments on any queſtion whatever. There are ſo many gentlemen among us, who are ſpeechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers by profeſſion, who deck every ſubject, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſterile and trifling, with all the flowers of the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030219_0040_0FE5266B62153070"/>
garden of eloquence, that a plain ſpokeſman like me can have little chance of being heard with any degree of patience. On the preſent occaſion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, theſe gentlemen do not ſeem to be come, like the bee, loaded with ſweets; the few they have brought with them are already ſcattered abroad, and have loſt their fragrance: and, as the day is not yet far enough advanced to countenance an adjournment, permit me to hope for indulgence, while I humbly endeavour to ſpin out the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and dinner; or, as our ploughmen have it, while I take a gentle turn to wind down the ſun.</p>
                  <p>Should gentlemen find themſelves inclined to repoſe, as I have often been in liſtening to them, I beg them not to ſtand upon ceremony, but to loll back at their eaſe, and leave me to jog qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly on.</p>
                  <p>We are called upon, Sir, to <hi>guaranty</hi> a loan, for which the lots of the City of Waſhington are to be a <hi>ſecurity;</hi> and the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Brent, tells us, that, though the lots are at preſent worth but a <hi>mere trifle,</hi> they will, when guarantied, be of <hi>great value.</hi> This is rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, I ſhall therefore endeavour to explain it by compariſon; which, I make no doubt, I ſhall do to the ſatisfaction of the Houſe. Suppoſe I had a lot, not worth a braſs farthing, and was to draw a note payable out of the produce of this ſame lot, ſuch note would be worth but a <hi>"mere trifle;"</hi> but, when endorſed by a man of credit, it would be <hi>"of great value;"</hi> becauſe the holder would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways know where to look for payment.</p>
                  <p>But the friends of the guarantee do not ſtop here. They aſſure us, that it would render the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030219_0041_0FE5271DE5AE1A58"/>
lots ſo very valuable as to <q>create a conſiderable fund towards the diſcharge of the public debt!</q> Much as I wiſh to ſee that debt diſcharged, I by no means approve of its being done by taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of an overſtrained generoſity. The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians have moſt generouſly beſtowed part of the land, and, not content with that, they now offer us an opportunity of paying off the public debt with ſpeculations in the lots. I am one of thoſe who are willing to forego any and every offer of this kind. I am willing that the Virginians themſelves ſhould be permitted to guaranty this loan, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive excluſively all the immenſe advantages accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefrom. Let them undertake the negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon their own bottom, which, from the great credit they enjoy in foreign countries, they cannot fail to effect upon the moſt reaſonable terms.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid, that foreigners will not venture their money on the lots, becauſe they can form no idea of their value; neither can I, and this is another reaſon for my wiſhing to leave the buſineſs in the hands of thoſe who are upon the ſpot, and who ſeem to be the only perſons intereſted in the matter.</p>
                  <p>The gentleman, who made us the bounteous propoſal for paying off the public debt by the means of the guarantee, concluded with an argument, which, I believe, he conceived to carry more weight with it: that is; unleſs the government went to the City of Waſhington at the time ſpecified by the act, it would be <hi>"a ſtain on the national character."</hi>— I participate with Mr. Brent in his anxiety for our national character, and am glad to have it in my power to convince him, that it could be in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the diſappointment he ſeems ſo much afraid of. We ſee a very conſiderable State of the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030219_0042_0FE5272CCD5D0928"/>
Union, Sir, tenaciouſly adhering to a law, made expreſsly to ſkreen its citizens from the obligation of diſcharging their juſt debts; and we have ſeen this very Houſe paſs a reſolution for the ſequeſtration of all debts, due from Americans to their creditors in Great Britain. Neither of theſe has ever been called a ſtain on our national character; and, if theſe are not, if our character is proof againſt theſe, I imagine we have little to fear from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments' remaining at Philadelphia. I will men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion another inſtance, Sir, ſtill ſtronger. If we look back into the journals of Congreſs, we ſhall find the king of France ſtiled, our <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good ally,</hi> our <hi>friend</hi> and <hi>deliverer;</hi> and yet we have applauded his murd................ [there the Chairman would have called me to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, upon which I ſhould have ſaid]—Sir, I ſhould be ſorry to break through the rules of this Houſe; and, I muſt inſiſt that I am perfectly in order. The gentleman from Virginia had laid great ſtreſs on what he preſumed would be a ſtain on our natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal character. I looked upon myſelf as entitled to prove, that he was miſtaken; and I certainly had a right to do this, by bringing forward what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be much better calculated to impreſs a ſtain, and which, however, had not produced that effect. If, therefore, there was any deviation from the queſtion, the gentleman led the way, and I was only following him. Beſides, Sir, look over the debates of this Houſe, and you will ſee to what a nut-ſhell compaſs they will be reduced, if you exclude all the extraneous matter. If members are to be bound down to the ſimple queſtion before them, if no latitude of digreſſion is allowed of, no little rambles to France for eulogium and to Great Britain for invective, how do you imagine, Sir, that <hi>patriotic</hi> members would be able to give proofs
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030219_0043_0FE5266CE4BE6EE0"/>
of their diligence, by eking out the ſeſſion to ſix or ſeven months?—Your aſſent, Sir, to the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe obſervations, encourages me to take up the thread of my argument.</p>
                  <p>If, on the day of our pompous reception of the French Flag, poor murdered Louis had riſen up through the floor, and ſaid: <q>Ungrateful Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans! you who flattered me in the hour of my proſperity and your diſtreſs; you who called me your deliverer; you who made public rejoicings for the day of my nativity, are now joining hands with the very men who led me to the block; are expreſſing "your ſincere and lively ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, your ſympathy and affection" towards them; are giving a pompous reception to the emblems of their triumph over me, at the very moment that my portrait, which was to be the memento of my ſervices and of your gratitude, is hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up within your walls.</q>—If the ſpectre of this injured prince had thus ſpoken, what ſhould we have ſaid? I know a member who would have replied: Avaunt, "ermined monſter!" But, for my part, I ſhould have felt the ſtain: I ſhould have thought myſelf ſpotted as a leopard. And yet, Sir, this has never been mentioned as a ſtain on our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional character. To apprehend, therefore, any danger from our not removing to the banks of the Patomack, is to ſtrain at a gnat, while we ſwallow a giant.</p>
                  <p>Much has been ſaid, Sir, on the manner in which the buildings of the City of Waſhington have been conducted. This is a branch of the ſubject that I ſhould have paſſed over in ſilence, had it not been for an expreſſion or two that fell from another gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Giles. That gentleman
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030219_0044_0FE526FE282FC7E0"/>
obſerved, that <q>the houſe erecting for the reſidence of the Preſident was <hi>much too magnificent;</hi>" but that, though he <hi>objected to the grandeur</hi> of the houſe intended for <hi>the Preſident,</hi> he would have the buildings <hi>for Congreſs</hi> erected upon a <hi>grand ſcale,</hi> and fitted for the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>free people.</hi>
                     </q>—I do not chooſe, Sir, to let this ſally go abroad unnoticed, leſt the world ſhould imagine us all tainted with that ungovernable vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ſeems to have engroſſed the ſoul of our unfortunate colleague.</p>
                  <p>The gentleman is afraid that the houſe of the Preſident may be <hi>too magnificent;</hi> but that which he expects to occupy <hi>himſelf,</hi> he wiſhes to ſee upon a <hi>grand ſcale</hi>—Modeſt man! The Preſident is to be kept within the walls of a plain building, to remind him of the lowlineſs of his eſtate, of his being the <hi>ſervant</hi> of the public; while Mr. Giles is to ſtrut beneath the roof of buildings upon a <hi>grand ſcale,</hi> fitted for the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of a <hi>great people;</hi> or, in other words, for the <hi>great Repreſentatives</hi> of the people.</p>
                  <p>I am thinking, Sir, that the public will do well to keep <hi>us</hi> within a plain building, or I am afraid our heads will ſoon be turned. We are in abſolute need of being dieted, for we are graſping not only at all honour but at all power too. If we once enter the pile propoſed by our colleague; if we once get under tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Much do I fear, Sir, that if we were once got in poſſeſſion of all theſe pretty things, we ſhould be very loath to return to our humble dwellings and our homely fare. In ſhort, I think we ſhould do like the <hi>great Repreſentatives</hi> of the French; that is, declare ourſelves permanent, or, at leaſt, order the people to elect nobody but ourſelves, which amounts to exactly the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But, we are told, that this building upon a <hi>grand ſcale,</hi> is not intended as an honour to us, but to our conſtituents. This is the very gull-trap which the poor ſilly French have fallen into. Every thing that their grovelling low-bred tyrants have aſſumed to themſelves, has been done under the ſpecious pretext of doing honour <q>to a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>free</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</q> They have ſcized on all the palaces in the kingdom, on the royal ſtuds, coaches, and every other article of luxury, for their own excluſive uſe; they wallow in ſumptuouſneſs, while their rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſlaves have but two or three ounces of dirty-coloured bread a day, and, if they murmur, they ſhoot them down by thouſands; and, all this is for the "honour of a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>free</hi> people." A great people, a free people, a ſovereign people, and the like, are very pretty phraſes: they tickle the ears of the multitude; but, ſhould they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how completely the demagogues transfer this grandeur, liberty, and ſovereignty, to themſelves, perhaps they would ceaſe to admire them; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeems better calculated to open their eyes, than ſeeing them in a ſplendid palace, while they, many of them at leaſt, are obliged to put up with log-huts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="unknown:030219_0046_0FE5266E66B4EF80"/>It is become a prevailing faſhion, among the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of our government, to confine the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, "Repreſentatives of the people," to this Houſe only. But, Sir, is not this a very falſe, as well as dangerous notion? Is not the Preſident the Repreſentative of the people as well as Mr. Giles? Yes, and of the whole of the people too, while Mr. Giles repreſents but a very ſmall part of one State. The epithet <hi>immediate</hi> is ſometimes prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but then, Mr. Giles can be the <hi>immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative</hi> of no more than an eighteenth part of the State of Virginia, while the Preſident is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate repreſentative of the whole Union; for the repreſentation muſt ever be immediate, though the election may not. If therefore, a preference is due to any branch of the government, the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſeems to have a better title to it than any of us, and ſeeing the thing in this light, I cannot help looking upon the obſervation of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from Virginia as extremely improper, if not indecent.</p>
                  <p>I thought, Sir, I heard the word <hi>Capitol</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned during the debate. For the love of modeſty, I hope the Congreſs Houſe is not to be called a <hi>Capitol!</hi> If this be the caſe, it will be neceſſary to go a ſtep further, and aſſume the maſquerade dreſs of the French Romans. How pretty we ſhall look in long white robes, deſcending to our toes, a blue girdle about our waiſts, a ſcarlet cloak on our ſhoulders, and a red liberty cap on our heads! Let them all be well embroidered with gold, as thoſe of the French legiſlators <hi>are to be;</hi> and, if they are even ſet with precious ſtones, it will be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional proof of our jealouſy for the honour of "a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>free people.</hi>" We ſhall, indeed, bring on us a ridicule equal to that excited by the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030219_0047_0FE52677A1C31100"/>
upſtart pettifoggers of the National Aſſembly, when they inſiſted on the Folding-Doors of the Louvre to be thrown open at their approach; but, let the world be merry while we are ſwagg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ring about in our conſular robes, we ſhall care but little whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are called ambitious buffoons or not.</p>
                  <p>This idea of a <hi>Capitol</hi> ſeems to be borrowed from the State of Virginia, the Aſſembly-Houſe of which has taken that name. For what reaſon it was there adopted, I know not, unleſs it be, that there are ſuch numbers of Caeſars and Pompeys in the neighbourhood, againſt whoſe ambitious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the grave and virtuous ſenate are ever vigilant to preſerve the liberty of their country. The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol</hi> of Virginia reſembles that of Rome alſo, in that it has a <hi>ſlave mart</hi> in its vicinity,</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now, Sir, return to the propoſed guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, and advert to another of the forcible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Mr. Brent. <q>This gentleman tells us, that the guarantee is the touchſtone to prove whether the ſeat of government is to be removed or not.</q> I am willing to take the gentleman at his word. I am willing to allow, that refuſing the guarantee of the loan, will amount to a declaration of our wiſh to remain where we are; and, with this view, I ſhall give the refuſal my hearty ſupport..... [Here a loud cry of, hear him! hear him!]—I am glad to find, Mr. Chairman, that gentlemen are ſo diſpoſed to hear; for, I can aſſure them, that, what I have to ſay, is not only worth hearing, but attending to alſo.</p>
                  <p>I look forward, Sir, to the day of removing the government to the banks of the Potomack, as the dawn of its deſtruction. Open the page of hiſtory,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030219_0048_0FE52647D99BF820"/>
and you will ſee, that the ſate of every popular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in a great meaſure depends on the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the people immediately in its neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. I could cite you a thouſand examples, from the fall of the Grecian States down to our own times; but I ſhall content myſelf with one of modern date; and, as the gentlemen on the other ſide of the Houſe are ſo fond of flying to France, I truſt I ſhall be excuſed for doing the ſame.</p>
                  <p>When the Conſtituent Aſſembly conceived the deſtructive project of annihilating the government, which their conſtituents had poſitively ordered them to aid and ſtrengthen, what did they do? Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves to Paris, where they knew the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt number of diſaffected perſons were aſſembled. The conſequences are but too well known.</p>
                  <p>We are not ignorant of the general diſpoſition of the State to which this government is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. We have ſeen its legiſlature, during this very ſeſſion, ſoliciting every State in the Union to join them in reducing this government to a mere democracy. Nor can any of us have forgotten the public invitation to the people of other States, to oppoſe the treaty with His Britannic Majeſty by open force, boaſting that there were <q>a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand free and independent Virginians,</q> ready to ſtrike the firſt blow. Can it be ſuppoſed, then, if we were now aſſembled at the City of Waſhington, that theſe hundred thouſand free and independent Virginians, whether black, white or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, would not dictate to us all we ſhould dare to ſay or do? Do you think, Sir, that the cutting truths which have this day fallen from my lips, would ever have been uttered in the City of Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington?
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030219_0049_0FE52691F1F64C68"/>
No; I ſhould have expected to have my throat cut, or my eyes gouged out, by ſome ſlave or ſlave-dealer, before I got home to my dinner. I will never go there, Sir; and, to thoſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who do, I ſincerely recommend the precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſteel collar, if not a ſuit of armour <hi>cap-à-pié.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. GILES has told us, Sir, that the law for the removal of the ſeat of government differs from all others; that <q>the Conſtitution itſelf has mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>rule,</hi> and only left Congreſs to name the ſpot; that the law is therefore not <hi>repealable.</hi>
                     </q> Curious quibble!—The Conſtitution ſays, that the Congreſs ſhall <q>exerciſe excluſive legiſlation over ſuch diſtrict as may become the ſeat of government of the United States.</q>—Now, what is there here, that makes the act unrepealable? What <hi>rule</hi> is here marked out? Is there a word about the law being unalterable? Does the Conſtitution ſay, that when the diſtrict is once fixed on, it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be changed for another? There is ſomething ſo ridiculous in the idea, that one would wonder how it ever found its way into words; and, to hazard thoſe words, the gentleman muſt have a very high opinion of the forbearance of this Houſe. Suppoſe, for inſtance, the banks of the Potomack ſhould be viſited with the plague or yellow fever; are we to remain there, and let our carcaſſes be thrown into the river? Suppoſe a vulcano or earthquake, or, in ſhort, ſuppoſe what you will; are we yet bound to make the City of Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton the ſeat of government? And what, I aſk, are plagues, yellow fevers, vulcanos and earthquakes, compared with the knives of "a hundred thouſand <hi>free</hi> and <hi>independent" ſlaves?</hi>—In a word, Mr. Chairman, ſo fully am I convinced, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030219_0050_0FE527024D158490"/>
of the ſeat of government to the State of Virginia will prove the overthrow of our happy Conſtitution, and eventually plunge our country in anarchy and blood, that I ſhall not only oppoſe every meaſure that may accelerate the fatal epoch, but I pledge myſelf to bring forward a motion for the repeal of the act altogether.—And now, Sir, as I ſee the gentlemen from Virginia are burſting with reply, I ſit down, ſatisfied of having diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my duty, without giving offence to any one, to whoſe ears truth is not diſagreeable.</p>

<date>February 18th.</date>
               </head>
               <p>Mr. LIVINGSTON (N. York) ſaid he would call the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the houſe to the ſituation of a very important and meritorious claſs of men whoſe value ſeemed to have been over looked and whoſe deareſt rights were either ſhamefully neglected or ignominiouſly ſurrendered—He adverted to the ſeamen of the United States. This valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able claſs of men would fall under one of theſe deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Native American Citizens.</item>

               </list>
               <p>It would be no difficult matter to prove that all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals of either of thoſe deſcriptions were equally enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to the protection of government; to the ſame or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er exertions in <hi>their</hi> favor than were made for thoſe citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens whoſe ſituation rendered it eaſier to apply for relief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:030219_0051_0FE526C90DB9D6F8"/>Yet this meritorious body of our conſtituents, he ſaid, thus entitled to our protection and favor, ſailing under the ſanction of our national flag, had been illegally ſeized, violently forced into a ſervice they abhorred, cruelly torn from their relations, their families and their country, and ignominiouſly ſcourged for aſſerting the privileges of their citizenſhip. The country to which they looked for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and relief had regarded their ſufferings with apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and indifference! Three years we had beheld their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and heard their cries; yet for three years we had been ſilent ſpectators of this diſgraceful ſcene. We had begun a compact with their oppreſſors, in which theſe unfortunate men looked in vain for one word of comfort in their miſery, for one little article in the voluminous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the inſtrument, that might offer a hope of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for their paſt ſufferings, or ſecurity againſt future op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. <q>
                     <hi>I bluſh</hi> (ſaid Mr. Livingſton) as an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can to think it was an American Miniſter who could be <hi>guilty</hi> of this <hi>diſgraceful omiſſion.</hi> I ſhould be <hi>covered with ſhame</hi> and confuſion <hi>for my Country</hi> if I could ſuppoſe it capable of giving that omiſſion its ſanction, and I hold it a ſacred duty, in whatever ſtation I may be placed, to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute every exertion, and the little influence I poſſeſs, for their relief.</q>—He concluded with moving the following reſolution:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved,</hi> that a committee be appointed to enquire and report whether any and what legiſlative proviſion is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the relief of ſuch American Seamen as may have been impreſſed into the ſervice of any foreign power—and alſo to report a mode of furniſhing American Seamen with ſuch evidence of their citizenſhip as may protect them from foreign impreſſments in future.</p>
               <p>Refered to a ſelect committee.</p>
               <div type="continuation_of_debate">
                  <head>February 29th.</head>
                  <p>The committee made their report, the ſubſtance of which was; that the impreſſment of American Sea-men by <hi>foreign powers</hi> was too <hi>notorious</hi> to <hi>need proof;</hi> and that the Preſident of the United States ſhall ſend agents to <hi>England</hi> and the Weſt Indies, in order to afford relief to ſuch American <hi>citizens,</hi> as have been illegally ſeized.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="unknown:030219_0052_0FE52697AA558640"/>Mr. HARPER (S. Carolina) hoped when this reſolution was committed to a ſelect committee, ſome ſtatements would have been brought forward, ſome facts produced, upon which to found the propoſed enquiry. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee have reported that they do not think it neceſſary to adduce any particular inſtances in which American Seamen have been impreſſed by foreign nations, the facts, they alledged, are too notorious to require particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larizing. He could not ſuppoſe theſe gentlemen would believe that the Houſe could proceed to legiſlate on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain newſpaper reports. He truſted they would afford ſome proof who, what number, when, and where Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſeamen have been impreſſed. Until this was done, he ſhould doubt the fact.—He was heard, he believed, by Repreſentatives from every port in the United States, and if the fact was ſo notorious as to need no further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he doubted not ſome of theſe gentlemen would be able to give ſome account of the buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>If the facts were eſtabliſhed, Mr. Harper believed there would be but one opinion on the propriety of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relief; but before they proceeded farther, ſome infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was neceſſary reſpecting the exiſtence of this abuſe. He had applied to the office of the Secretary of State, and to other offices likely to afford information on the ſubject; but he found no inſtance of the impreſſment complained of, which redreſs had not been given. But, if any ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances do exiſt, in which relief has been applied for, and not obtained, gentlemen from ſome of the ſea ports will be able to mention them. If not, he hoped the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee would riſe and recommit the report.</p>
                  <p>Mr. LIVINGSTON ſaid, the preſent meaſure was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to afford relief to ſuch of their diſtreſſed fellow citizens as had been illegally ſeized on the high ſeas. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, he ſaid, who brings forward objections to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed enquiry, was in his place when the reſolution upon which the report of the committee is founded, paſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animouſly. Why did he not then come forward; [Mr. Harper ſaid he was not in the Houſe at the time.]—The reſolution does not direct the committee to enquire into facts, they were conſidered as notorious, and nothing
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030219_0053_0FE5270A9C792F40"/>
ſeemed neceſſary but to fix upon the beſt mode of furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relief. The Legiſlature of the United States have formerly had evidence, and they have acted upon it. If the gentleman will look into the proceedings of the laſt ſeſſion of Congreſs, he will find a conſiderable ſum grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Mr. Cutting, for relief of this diſtreſſed body of men. Some he relieved, others he did not. When the dignity of the nation, ſaid he, is inſulted, in the perſons of our fellow-citizens, it is neceſſary at leaſt to make enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>A remark had fallen, Mr. Livingſton ſaid, from the member from South Carolina, which he wiſhed to notice. He ſaid he had applied to the office of the Secretary of State, and found there no complaint which had not been redreſſed. Now, he had waited upon the Secretary of State, as chairman of the committee, in vain for informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this ſubject. The Secretary informed him, that he could not give him the evidence which it appears he has given to the member from South Carolina. How, he wiſhed to know, happened it that a member who oppoſes the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in queſtion, ſhould be furniſhed with that information which was denied to a member who ſupported it?</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid, added Mr. Livingſton, that we are attempting to legiſlate without evidence. Though no facts are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent before the Houſe, it is notorious that numerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have been made known to government, and the preſent meaſure is meant to enquire into the caſes of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers and remedy them as far as poſſible. It is admitted by the member from South Carolina that facts have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted, but that they have been removed. If theſe griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, then, ſaid he, have exiſted, let us prevent them in future. Let us not wait till it is too late to grant relief. The men, ſaid he, who ſuffer by the depradations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, are at a great diſtance from their homes and friends, in foreign ports; dragged on board Tenders, and made to experience every hardſhip which can be conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And now, when a mode is propoſed for the relief of theſe diſtreſſed citizens, evidence is called for! <hi>If one of theſe men is confined in the Eaſt Indies, can evidence of his bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage be expected to be given here?</hi> Such hardſhips have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted, and it was their buſineſs <hi>to prevent them from again
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030219_0054_0FE526830EBFCD78"/>
occurring.</hi> He hoped, therefore, the committee would not riſe, as he truſted there was ſufficient evidence on which to ground the enquiry.</p>
                  <p>Mr. HARPER wiſhed to remark on what had fallen from the member from New-York, on the Secretary of State's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing information to certain members and giving it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. He applied to the office of the Secretary of State, to learn whether there were any documents there to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the propoſed enquiry, and was informed there were only two caſes; in one of which application was made to the Britiſh government; <hi>four perſons</hi> were ſaid to have been impreſſed; but on enquiry, it appeared, <hi>that two of them were Britiſh ſubjects, and the other two had enliſted into the ſervice.</hi> The other complaint came to the office when the Secretary of State was much engaged in other concerns, but he believed relief was granted. This, he ſaid, was verbal information; he had applied for written documents on the ſubject, and doubted not he ſhould receive them as ſoon as other buſineſs would permit.</p>
                  <p>Mr. SWANWICK (Pennſylvania) ſaid the member from S. Carolina had called for information; he conceived no particular information neceſſary. He could mention an inſtance in which he had immediate concern. A veſſel of his going to the Weſt-Indies had all her hands taken out of her, and obliged to work the guns of an Engliſh fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate; and, on their expoſtulating that though they were priſoners they did not wiſh to work the guns they were threatened with whipping, and the captain was told if he interfered, he ſhould be whipped and <hi>ſent home</hi> to England in irons. If he had thought facts were wanting, by a ſingle advertiſement in one of the Philadelphia papers, they would have been overpowered with facts. But if he had done ſo, he ſuppoſed he ſhould have been charged with raiſing diſſatisfaction in the minds of the people, or with encouraging Jacobinical principles. He therefore did not do it. But, without going out of the walls of the Houſe, he ſaid, he found evidence ſufficient. He read an extract from the communication of the Secretary of State, dated March 2, 1794, in which were mentioned the repreſentations made by ſundry merchants of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia (of whom he was one) reſpecting the impreſſment
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030219_0055_0FE526CA91BBFA60"/>
of American ſeamen. This document was thought ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſtrong to make an article of inſtruction to Mr. Jay in his late negociation; but, owing to certain difficulties, no ſpecific agreement was entered into by him for their relief.</p>
                  <p>The plan now before the Houſe, ſaid Mr. Swanwick, is in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ded to remedy the difficulties which have been urged as o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>acles in this buſineſs, by opening regiſters in which to enter every American ſeaman, by which may be known at any time the number of ſeamen belonging to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, and by means of which every ſuch ſeaman would be poſſeſſed of a certificate of his <hi>citizenſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every one knows, ſaid he, what has <hi>been felt</hi> on account of American ſeamen carried into <hi>Algiers. No evidence was required with reſpect to their numbers, or how they were employed.</hi> The united exertions of the whole American people <hi>ſeemed to cry out</hi> for their releaſement, and the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, at length, has been effected. And let us not, ſaid he, attend to our diſtreſſed citizens, in one part only, but in all parts of the world. Let us not, ſaid he, <hi>be too nice about evidence.</hi> Theſe men are generally <hi>ignorant,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give the neceſſary information; he thought, however, they had information ſufficient for legiſlating upon in the preſent caſe. He hoped, therefore, the report would not be recommitted, until the committee had diſcuſſed the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Mr. TRACY (Connecticut) believed that every member in that Houſe felt the propriety of extending the benefit of the laws to every claſs of citizens, and to none more than to American ſeamen. Some members ſeemed to ſuppoſe that the diſtreſſes of American ſeamen have been looked upon with apathy, but if due attention had been paid to the efforts of government, it would have been ſeen that they had always been duly attended to. It is well known that great difficulties ariſe when it is attempted to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between <hi>Engliſh and American ſeamen.</hi> This has been the reaſon why ample regulations have not always taken place. He hoped the government would be popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and that the new members in the Houſe would aſſiſt the old ones to render it more and more ſo; but thought
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030219_0056_0FE52688F7D3BB98"/>
government ought not to be charged with apathy without paying due attention to what government had done.</p>
                  <p>Mr. TRACY proceeded to take notice of the reſolutions propoſed in the report. He enquired what good the agent to be ſent to Great Britain would do. Are there ſeamen, ſaid he, employed but at one place? Had not the United States Conſuls at every port, and can they not do the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs? He wiſhed for information on the ſubject. <hi>A great part of the ſeamen were foreigners,</hi> he ſaid, and it would be very difficult to ſeparate them. If the plan pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, however, could be made to appear to be beneficial, he would heartily join in effecting the deſired relief to the claſs of citizens alluded to.</p>
                  <p>Mr. GOODHUE (Maſſachuſetts) ſaid the member from New York, on bringing forward this buſineſs, had charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed government with looking upon the diſtreſſes of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſeamen with apathy, and <hi>bluſhed</hi> on account of its conduct towards them. He repreſented, he believed, twenty times the number of American ſeamen that that gentleman repreſented; he was himſelf, indeed, formerly a ſeaman; yet he did not believe the evil complained of exiſted to any alarming degree. Mr. Cutting, it had been ſaid, had relieved many ſeamen; that it was in the year 1790. Laſt ſummer the Britiſh took many veſſels bound to France but they did not take the crews. There were ſome inſtances, he ſaid, in which ſeamen had been impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and he ſhould be in favour of every neceſſary ſtep to afford them relief; but no obloquy ſhould be thrown on government. Neither does the evil exiſt to the extent it might have been ſuppoſed, when the buſineſs was brought forward. A member from Pennſylvania had mentioned a particular inſtance: he could mention a particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a French captain who had ſo ill-treated ſome American ſeamen, as to be caſhiered, on a repreſentation being made to the French government.</p>
                  <p>Mr. DAYTON (New Jerſey) ſaid that he had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected an oppoſition to the reſolution under conſideration on the ground of fact, that he could not have ſuppoſed any member would have queſtioned the exiſtence of the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030219_0057_0FE5270D291768C0"/>
evils, which the propoſitions were calculated to remedy. He entertained a belief that the impreſſment of American ſeamen, particularly on board of Britiſh ſhips of war, was a matter of too great notoriety, to need any evidence at this time. But the member from South Carolina, who manifeſted the moſt zealous oppoſition to theſe meaſures, had admitted that there had exiſted inſtances of this ſort, and as it muſt follow that what had once exiſted might again exiſt, it behoved Congreſs to make proviſions tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prevent, or at leaſt moſt ſpeedily and efficaciouſly to remedy them.</p>
                  <p>Mr Dayton declared that he heartily approved the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the reſolution, as originally propoſed by the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from New York, and the general principles of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port founded thereon, as a queſtion of humanity, and of great national policy. It was, however, with pain that he heard the worthy mover draw into unfavourable que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the conduct of the Secretary of State, and indulge himſelf in ſome ſevere reflections and imputations upon that officer. Mr. Dayton aſcribed it to an irritability, and perhaps an honeſt irritability, upon this ſubject ſo affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and intereſting to Americans. He aſcribed it to a warmth of temper in which, in this particular caſe, the cooler judgment of that gentleman, and the knowledge of the real character and conduct of the Secretary of State had no agency or influence. The expreſſions which had been uttered by ſome gentlemen in the courſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion tending to charge our government with a criminal apathy and indifference towards this deſcription of citizens, did by no means, Mr. Dayton ſaid, meet with his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. He believed them to be unfounded, for he was perſuaded that whenever it heard, it did whatever it could to relieve the ſeamen of the United States, and to obtain for thoſe who unfortunately needed it, complete redreſs. Having ſaid thus much in vindication of the conduct of the government he returned to the reſolution itſelf, and declared himſelf its advocate. It contained neither in its words nor ſpirit, any imputation upon the Executive, of the ſort hinted at.</p>
                  <p>In the former caſe, every one muſt perceive it more than poſſible, that owing to diſtance and the time which
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030219_0058_0FE526DA1B056F48"/>
muſt conſequently be expended in the communication to, and remonſtrance from our government, an <hi>American citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> might be impreſſed and compelled to ſerve months, perhaps years in a ſervice which he deteſted, <hi>and poſſibly forced to apply the match to a cannon charged with balls aimed for the deſtruction of his friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. BOURNE (Rhode Iſland) propoſed to amend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, by ſtriking out that part of it which appoints an agent for Great Britain and confines the ſending of an agent to that part of the Engliſh poſſeſſions in the Weſt Indies to which the greateſt number of American veſſels ſail.</p>
                  <p>Mr. LIVINGSTON was pleaſed to ſee gentlemen concur in endeavouring to form a plan for the relief of American ſeamen. It has been aſked why the Conſuls were not entruſted with this buſineſs; the committee conſidered that, as the Conſuls of the United States received no other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for their ſervices, than the dignity and conſequence which, their office gives them, they would not be likely to pay ſufficient attention to a buſineſs of this kind. They conſidered the immenſe labour of Mr. Cutting to deliver the impreſſed American ſeamen. They ſuppoſed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the duty were laid upon the Conſuls, a ſalary ſhould be annexed to their office? but, as there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul in the Weſt Indies, a ſpecial agent ſhould be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—In order to bring a view of the buſineſs before the Houſe, he would aſk, how relief is to be afforded to a ſeaman who has been impreſſed? Suppoſe he is ſeized in London, he is ſent down to Portſmouth. The agent muſt attend immediately, get certificates, pay fees of office, employ council, &amp;c. to releaſe a ſingle ſeaman; a trouble he believed no Conſul would take. The committee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the ſolemnity of commiſſioning an agent eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the buſineſs, would convince <hi>Foreign powers</hi> that they would no longer <hi>ſuffer the Britiſh,</hi> or others, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe that power over American ſeamen which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could not exerciſe. It is to be hoped, alſo, that when the government of Great Britain ſees a ſtep of this ſort taken, it will give up the practice of ſeizing American ſeamen, and let them paſs in quietneſs. If not, the agents employed could tranſmit to this country an account of what ſeamen were ſeized by them, and every particularly
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030219_0059_0FE52720A7E72238"/>
reſpecting the ſame. This conſideration influenced the committee, and he truſted it would influence the Houſe.</p>
                  <p>Mr. S. SMITH (Maryland) ſaid that as the member from South Carolina had called upon gentlemen from ſea ports for evidence, if they were ſilent, it would be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed no information could be given on the ſubject under diſcuſſion. He ſuppoſed he ſhould be prevented from giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this information now, becauſe the amendment of the firſt reſolution was under conſideration. [The Houſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for information.] He ſaid he repreſented a port where the fact of American ſeamen being impreſſed by the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh was <hi>ſo notorious,</hi> that <hi>every</hi> man knew it. But how, ſaid he, is this information to be got and tranſmitted to the Secretary of State, no complaint is likely to reach his office, except brought there by merchants. In his <hi>own trade,</hi> he had frequent inſtances of this ſort, almoſt in every voyage. He could <hi>not ſay the men impreſſed were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Americans, but they were men ſailing under the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the United States.</hi> We have a flag, under that flag men are ſeized, and they have a right to expect, when ſeized, redreſs from government. There is <hi>no difference</hi> between <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Algerines,</hi> for, by the former, they are compelled to fight againſt thoſe whom they <hi>wiſh well,</hi> which <hi>is equal to any ſlavery that can be impoſed.</hi> He ſaid, that from one of his ſhips there were two New-England men impreſſed; one of whom being a ſtout, courageous man, wiſhed to have defended himſelf againſt his aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants; but the ſupercargo ſaid, no, this will riſk the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go of the owner. The advice he gave, ſuppoſing govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would afford theſe men relief.</p>
                  <p>If the member from South Carolina wiſhed for <hi>ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation as would be received before a court of Judicature, it could not be got.</hi> Mr. Smith thought ſufficient attention had not been paid by government <hi>to merchants and ſeamen.</hi> Mr Jay, in his communication to Lord Grenville ſays, an impreſſment of American ſeamen had taken place, who had been forced to fight, &amp;c. If this had not been ſo, it had not been written by Mr. Jay, nor would Lord Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville have promiſed relief. He hoped this information would be thought ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="unknown:030219_0060_0FE5270EC0B4D110"/>It had been ſaid that there were not many inſtances of American ſeamen impreſſed; but, ſuppoſe there were but one man, <hi>and be a negro,</hi> ſuffering under <hi>the galling yoke of impreſſment,</hi> it is the duty of government to provide relief for that man. The ſame member has ſaid that the Quibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron veſſels did not impreſs the crews of the ſhips; he ſaid it was ſufficient to take their flour and pay them nine dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars for what might have been ſold the next day for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or upwards.—Mr. Smith concluded by obſerving, that if we were a feeble nation, we had a right to expect ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; but he hoped we were not to feeble as ſome gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men imagined.</p>
                  <p>Mr. GILES (Virginia) was of opinion, with the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from Rhode Iſland, that American citizens ſhould be attended to in other countries, as well as in Great Britain. He had not heard, of any <hi>impreſſments</hi> but by the Britiſh, but he had heard of <hi>captivities;</hi> and that Houſe had heard of a French officer being caſhiered, for ill-treating Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican citizens; but it had heard no inſtance of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain puniſhing officers for ill-treating American citizens. No, this marked the different character of the two nations towards the Americans.</p>
                  <p>Mr. SWANWICK roſe to inform the houſe that ſince he was in his place yeſterday, he had been called upon with evidence on the ſubject now before the committee, in conſequence of the call made for it in the courſe of the debate. The inſtances he had given to him were, the caſe of Robert Norris a native of Princeton in New-Jerſey, and <hi>five others</hi> who ſailed on board the American brig Matilda, captain Burke, from Philadelphia, which ſailed from this port in May laſt, for Bourdeaux, and were on the 9th of July, brought to by four Britiſh frigates, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly taken into the veſſel, impreſſed and compelled to go and ſerve on board one of the ſaid frigates called the Stag, where they ſerved four months, when the ſaid Robert Norris made his eſcape from the frigate at Sheerneſs, at the riſk of his life, and returned in January laſt to the United States. His companions he believes are yet in bondage. The other inſtance was the brig Sally captain Wilkins, which ſailed from this port in May laſt bound to Madeira, and five days after leaving the Capes was brought
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030219_0061_0FE4FE5035B2EED8"/>
to by the Rattle Snake ſtoop of war, captain York, and the mate (<hi>a native of Scotland,</hi> but who had ſailed for <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years</hi> out of the United States) and one of the beſt ſeamen (an American) taken out. They were carried to Hallifax, from whence the fore-maſt man made his eſcape, and arrived here the beginning of July. Before they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Hallifax, he informs, that fifteen men were taken out of American veſſels.—Mr. Swanwick read alſo an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from an owner of ſeveral other impreſſments.</p>
                  <p>Mr. SEDGWICK (Maſſachuſetts) ſaid, he was yeſterday prevented from attending the Houſe by indiſpoſition. The ſubject ſtruck his mind, he ſaid, in ſeveral points of view which had not been noticed. He was ſurprized why the buſineſs was undertaken in the way it was. No deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, he ſaid, were more entitled to regard than ſeamen; but this did not reconcile the adoption of the ſubject in the manner propoſed. The executive, he was of opinion, would conſider itſelf as charged with this buſineſs. An agent who is neither conſul nor miniſter, is an inſtrument unknown, an undefined character that would not be recognized. It was impoſſible, he ſaid, for any two agents, one in Great Britain and the other in the Weſt-Indies, to gain information of the ſufferings of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in different parts of the two countries, particularly in Great Britain. He called upon gentlemen to ſay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had ever heard of ſuch a character as they were propoſing to create? He ſaid America had conſuls in every part of the world, and if they have not, they ought to have ſalaries for the buſineſs. Why appoint agents? and what authority will they have?</p>
                  <p>Mr. SEDGWICK noticed the different kinds of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can citizens, and of the difficulties ariſing from the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of inalienable right ſupported by the Engliſh, and obſerved that when two countries each claim a right to a man no means but force was left to decide between them.</p>
                  <p>The reſolution was amended, and a ſelect committee ordered to prepare a bill. The ſubſtance of which in the next <hi>Cenſor.</hi>

The country to which they looked for relief has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded their ſufferings with apathy and indifference. Three long, long years we have beheld their whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings and heard their lamentable cries; yet, for three long, long years we have been ſilent ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators of the diſgraceful ſcene!

                                 <p>The gentleman laſt up ſeems to have loſt ſight of the queſtion altogether. One would think he was contemplating protection to Mr. H— ton inſtead of A—can ſeamen. I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring him back to the ſubject before the committee, reminding him, at the ſame time, that ſuch perſonalities as he deals about him are very derogatory of the dignity of this Houſe.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="64" facs="unknown:030219_0065_0FE5267A723DE870"/>I am aſtoniſhed that proofs of impreſſments are called for. When we heard of A—can ſeamen being priſoners <hi>in Algiers,</hi> no evidence was required with reſpect to numbers. The united exertions of the whole A—can people ſeemed <hi>to cry out</hi> for their releaſement. Let us not be <hi>too nice about evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> Theſe men are <hi>ignorant,</hi> and cannot give the neceſſary information.</p>
                              </sp>
                              <sp>
                                 <speaker>Peter Porcupine.</speaker>
                                 <p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman for his hint about perſonalities; but he will allow, that I am as excuſable as Mr L—, who talked about the <hi>ſhameful, guilty,</hi> and <hi>diſgraceful</hi> conduct of a moſt upright public Miniſter. I may not have the mellifluent eloquence of the gentleman laſt up: I know I am a rough-hewn mortal; but, as I am ſpeaking to men, and not to an aſſembly of <hi>little miſſes,</hi> the want of that gentleman's ſilver liſp may not amount to a total diſqualification.</p>
                                 <p>I ſhall now turn to what the gentleman has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced on the ſubject before us.—He begs us <q>not to be <hi>too nice</hi> about evidence.</q> This is going a ſtep beyond the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris. There the <hi>accuſer</hi> is heard, and if the jury are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the guilt of the priſoner, <hi>no evidence is heard in his defence.</hi> This is not being over nice; but we are required to be ſtill leſs nice. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful French hear the witneſſes <hi>againſt</hi> the priſoner at any rate; but we are called upon to give our verdict, without hearing any at all; poor unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Great Britain is to be condemned upon the bare indictment. One comes forward and accuſes her; ſhe holds up her feeble emaciated hand, and pleads, NOT GUILTY, my Lords. Some of us wiſh to hear what can be urged againſt her; but the gentlemen tell us not to be too nice about evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030219_0066_0FE52710432557F8"/>
that ſhe is a notorious offender; that <q>
                                       <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> man <hi>knows</hi> it, though <hi>no one</hi> can give <hi>regular information</hi> of it,</q> and, in ſhort, that ſhe ought to have been annihilated long ago. In vain do we, like Pontius Pilate, aſk, <hi>for what;</hi> ſtill they cry with one voice: Let her be crucified! Let her be crucified!—And, is it thus we treat our poor old mother in the hour of her diſtreſs?</p>
                                 <p>The gentleman produces, as a ſufficient reaſon for our not being <hi>too nice,</hi> the great "<hi>ignorance</hi> of the <hi>citizens</hi> impreſſed." And, do I hear this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage from Mr. S—k? Is it poſſible for the people to be ignorant while under the rays of this focus of ſcience? Do I live, Mr. Chairman, to hear the words <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>citizens</hi> articulated in the ſame breath? How long, Sir, have our ears been dinned with, <hi>an informed people, an enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people;</hi> with the deſtruction of ſuperſtition and prejudice, and the luminous cloſe of the eighteenth century? And, ſhall we now be told, that our <hi>citizens</hi> are <hi>ignorant?</hi> That they are ſuch ſtupid brutes as not to be able to give an account of what has befallen them? not even of their impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments and their ſtripes?</p>
                                 <p>But, Mr. S—k, after two or three days dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch, brings us ſomething like an account of ſome men impreſſed from a veſſel <hi>of his own,</hi> and this, he inſiſts, is evidence enough for any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man. Thus, when a ſailor can be brought to ſay, that he has been impreſſed and ſcourged, he is an <hi>enlighted citizen;</hi> but when he cannot, he is a poor ignorant devil, <q>not capable of giving the neceſſary information.</q>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>The gentleman told us ſomething about <hi>Algiers,</hi> and, though I cannot for my ſoul preceive why
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030219_0067_0FE5267BF4EC9968"/>
Algiers was dragged into the debate, I look upon myſelf as entitled to ſay a word or two in reply. <q>The united exertions, ſays he, of the whole A—can people ſeemed <hi>to cry out</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſement of the priſoners in Algiers,</q> I believe, Sir, that the people in general were much affected with the fate of thoſe unfortunate men, and that, had proper meaſures been taken to call their feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings into action, the priſoners would long ago have been reſtored to their families and country, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the interpoſition of government; but, no one will deny, that theſe meaſures ſhould have originat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>merchants;</hi> that the example ſhould have been given, and, indeed, the greateſt part of the money beſtowed by themſelves. Was this the caſe; They did, indeed, <hi>"cry out;"</hi> they might, for ought I know, make fervent applications to heaven; but the applications to their purſes, which had been filled by the toil and hardſhips of theſe poor fellows, were very faint and ineffectual. A ſubſcription was opened in this city, Mr. S—k was himſelf one of the receivers, and I now call upon him to ſay, how much his brethren ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and how much he ſubſcribed himſelf. I call upon him to ſay, whether a company of <hi>foreign players,</hi> yea, even Engliſh players, did not ſubſcribe more than all the merchants of this great, rich and flouriſhing city!—Here was <q>apathy and indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</q> indeed! Here Mr. L— might have ſeen reaſon to "<hi>bluſh</hi> for a <hi>diſgraceful omiſſion!</hi>"</p>
                                 <p>I am not ſorry that the little gentleman beſtowed a few of his ſilver ſounds on the ſlaves in Algiers, as it furniſhes me with an opportunity of comparing the conduct of the friends of the reſolution towards thoſe men, and that which they now hold towards ſeamen impreſſed by the Engliſh. The ſlaves in Algiers could have been at any time ranſomed, and
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030219_0068_0FE5267EB8B5BB10"/>
we well know, that they were <hi>all</hi> real <hi>A—cans.</hi> The ſeamen impreſſed are indefinite; we know not who or where they are; all we know about them, is, that they are <hi>all,</hi> or nearly ſo, ſubjects of the king of Great Britain. Now, how comes it, that theſe gentlemen ſhow ſuch amazing zeal, and are ſo deeply touched with what they gravely call the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of theſe ſubjects of His Britannic Majeſty, while they ſhow ſuch indifference for our own citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens? This ſeems totally unaccountable, yet, Mr. Chairman, I think I can explain it in a few words. The impreſſment of <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſeamen by the Britiſh forms a ſubject of oppoſition to the treaty; any meaſures taken to reſiſt that impreſſment may lead to a war; the expence attending the agents ſent out will come from the public purſe, and not from the purſe of theſe gentlemen. None of theſe weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reaſons exiſted with reſpect to the ſlaves in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, and therefore, they might have remained there, 'till they had rotted in their chains, had not that government which theſe ſticklers for humanity now accuſe of apathy and indifference, been much more vigilant and humane than they.</p>
                                 <p>I have much more to ſay on this ſubject, Sir; but as the hour of Turkey and Madeira is at hand, I ſit down, in order to give the Houſe an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of adjourning.</p>

                  <hi>NARRATIVE</hi> Of the Suicide of the <hi>Argus</hi> of New York.</head>
               <p>OF All the acts ariſing from folly, wickedneſs, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, that of Suicide is beſt calculated to awaken curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. It is ſo hard to be accounted for from the common evils incident to life, and is ſuch a direct violation of the firſt law of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030219_0069_0FE526ECB2F36560"/>
nature, that a man muſt poſſeſs an extraordinary degree of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iciſm, not to feel ſome inclination to be informed of the cauſe. For my part, I felt this inclination ſo forcibly, upon hearing of the fate of the renowned <hi>Argus,</hi> that I could not reſt, 'till I had obtained a circumſtantial account of the whole affair. I truſt, it is unneceſſary to ſay how my breaſt has been wrung by this melancholy relation; nevertheleſs, I ſhould not think that I diſcharged my duty as <hi>Cenſor,</hi> did I neglect to impart it to my readers.</p>
               <p>By way of preface to this Narrative, it may not be amiſs to give ſome account of the wonderful two-legged creature who is the ſubject of it.</p>
               <p>His name indicates that he has a hundred eyes, which is a real fact. Theſe eyes, like thoſe of the beaſt in the viſion, are divided between his fore and hinder parts; but, in other reſpects, they reſemble thoſe of the Lamper Eel: that is, they emit filth and noxious matter in place of admitting light; or, in other words, they anſwer none of the uſeful purpoſes of this organ in other animals. He is extremely vindictive and fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and, though his ſtupid eyes are too dim to wound in the manner of the baſſiliſk, yet, when he has no other means of vengeance left, he drops tears that ſcald and burn like <hi>aqua fortis</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe qualities could not fail to recommend him to the great Citizen G—t, of ſeditious and inſolent memory. He very ſoon became the Citizen's chief favourite, and is ſuppoſed to have drank deeply at the fountain of his largeſſes. From mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of gratitude, therefore, he was deſperately attached to the cauſe of the French Republic. He has written, ſworn, and lied in that cauſe; and, of all the tools of faction, has, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, been the moſt ſteady to his truſt. He has chanted the Marfeillois Hymn, and celebrated all the ſucceſsful maſſacres of his benefactors, with that kind of ſavage joy that animates the ravages of beaſts of prey.</p>
               <p>But, alas! how tranſitory are all ſublunary things! The diſgraceful defeats, or to uſe their own expreſſion, <q>
                     <hi>the</hi> little ſucceſs,</q> of his maſters, during the laſt campaign, plunged him into a ſtate of dejection, from which he was only raiſed to be ſunk over head and ears in deſpair. Like many other cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable patriots, he was buoyed up by the hope of a rebellion, or, to give it the faſhionable term, of a <hi>revolution,</hi> in Great Britain; and this event was reduced to a certainty by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count concerning the <hi>Sedition Bills,</hi> which our induſtrious and faithful and impartial news-mongers ſpread through the country.</p>
               <p>This, then, was the rock of our <hi>Argus's</hi> hope: ſtill, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he had his doubts and his fears, and theſe were left to fluctuate during the wide chaſm in our foreign intelligence. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030219_0070_0FE526DBDC9F1E30"/>
torments and harraſſes the mind like ſuſpence. The poor <hi>Argus</hi> became penſive and melancholy, was often ſeen to ſtop in the middle of the ſtreet, and heard to mutter incoherent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions about rebellion and <hi>Sedition Bills</hi> and Pitt and King George, or Citizen Guelph, as he called him.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, the fatal 23rd of March, about a quarter after ſix in the morning, he was perceived, with a ſpying-glaſs in his hand, walking on the battery oppoſite the port. He was obſerved to ſtop often and olap the glaſs to one of his eyes, then ſcratch his head, clench his fiſt, and give other evident tokens of anger or madneſs. At laſt, turning himſelf towards the water, he laid the teleſcope to his ſhoulder, as if it were a gun, and, after making a motion to fire, uttered a loud cry and ran down to the beach. Two labourers, who had viewed him all this time, now loſt fight of him. One of them haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſpot, where he found the poor diſtracted wretch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labouring a log which had been thrown up by the tide. His left hand was all over blood, and the teleſcope was reduced to ſplinters, except about four inches of it, which he ſtill gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped faſt in his right. Upon being aſked what was the matter: "Look," ſays he, holding his bloody hand to the man, <q>Look, my lad, that's the heart's blood of Pitt: no pity! no pity! let's to the palace and cut all their throats!</q>
               </p>
               <p>The other workman now came up, and the two together, with the help of a third perſon, made ſhift to get him home, without further miſchief. This was not effected, however, without ſome danger; for, as he conceived himſelf going to Newgate, as a preparative for a voyage to Botany Bay, there is not a mean of annoyance that he did not make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of, or an execration that he did not vomit forth.</p>
               <p>When he was put to bed, he ſwore he was on a rack a million times crueler than that of Damien. <q>Raſcals, ſays he, I have only killed a miniſter. I have only done my duty as a citizen and a patriot.</q> Theſe ravings continued for nearly two hours, after which, having been copiouſly bled, he dropt off to ſleep.</p>
               <p>About four in the afternoon he waked, when to the joy of his friends, and the ſurprize of every body, he ſeemed perfectly reſtored to his ſenſes. He eat a baſon of panada, drank a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wine and water, and appeared quite recovered, except from the bruiſes he had received from the ribs of miniſter Log.</p>
               <p>Juſt as things were taking this happy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030219_0071_0FE527296ECF90F8"/>
ſays he, with a voice and look that ſcared the whole crew, <q>Well, raſcals, you are come at laſt. Tell me this moment; are the <hi>Bills</hi> paſſed.</q>—The Captain anſwered <hi>yes.</hi> "What!" ſays the raving <hi>Argus,</hi> "the Bills paſſed, and no Revolution!" <hi>None,</hi> ſay the captain.—"What! the Engliſh are not cutting one anothers' throats yet!"—<hi>No,</hi> ſays the humane tarpawling, <hi>more is the pity; but let us hope, for the love of God that they will begin ſoon.</hi>—This charitable informant had hardly done ſpeaking, when our poor unfortunate friend made an attempt to throw himſelf over the quarter deck. Being prevented here, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a placid mein, pretended he was only in a joke, though it was evident to every one, he was but too much in earneſt. Soon after this he ſlipped from among the crowd (which was very conſiderable on account of the great news that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected) and got away on the forecaſtle, where he was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hang himſelf. He had even got the cord round his neck, when he was perceived by a man upon the yards. His intentions were now ſo manifeſt, that it would have been down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right inhumanity to neglect him any longer. He was conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home by ſome of the citizens, and put under the care of his own people.</p>
               <p>Arrived once more at his home, he ſeems to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to defer the execution of his deſperate deſign no longer. He diſſembled, however; talked very connectedly; enquired whether the paper was nearly compoſed or not, and even ſat down and took his pen under pretence of writing an article of news. By thoſe means he prevailed on his people to leave him alone; two of them, however, thought it prudent to remain at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d of the ſtairs, in order to be at hand, ſhould he make any attempt on his life. Their ſuſpicious were but too well founded; for, at the end of half an hour's dead ſilence, they heard him utter a moſt dreadful groan, and, preſently after, fall on the floor. They attempted to force the door, but it was too ſecurely faſtened. They then applied to the wainſcot, and, at laſt, made an opening, when, ſhocking to relate! they found their dear maſter weltering in his blood, his throat being cut nearly acroſs. A ſurgeon was inſtantly called, and every aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance given; but, I am ſorry to add, that, when this morning's poſt came away, there was little hope of recovery.</p>
               <p>The interval between his entering his appartment and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the horrid deed, was, it ſeems, employed in writing a farewell letter to his Siſter and only relation, the <hi>Aurora</hi> of Philadelphia.
