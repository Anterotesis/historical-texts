            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For it was the very Day of the laſt Election; and there were two vacances for Parliament. But I think one of them was given up without bringing it to a Pole, and the other was contended for, by <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Vougban,</hi> now my <hi>Lord</hi> and Gentlemen of the Jury, you muſt know, that there was a tincture of Popery on one ſide, and conſequently Knaviſh Policy.

            </p>
            <p>CLERK, My Lord, we have but very few Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in this City, but may it pleaſe your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when any of them are brought before me to give Evidence, they always bring affadavit Men enough with them to confirm their Evidence.</p>

               <hi>Priſoner,</hi> No my <hi>Lord,</hi> But Gentlemen of the <hi>Jury,</hi> I have always been a Man of Valour and Courage, and have not been uſed when under the greateſt Clouds, to ſneak or hang down my Head like a Bull ruſh, nor was I pleaſed at that Time, to ſee ſo many Antagoniſts, and if I did ſay what is Evidenced againſt me, I am hopefull you Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Jury, will Conſider the Cauſe, and the Number of my Adverſaries.</p>

            <p>But for that you have diſloyally and rebelliouſly Curſt the King and Government, this is the Crime, and the thing wherewith thou art charged by the Indictment, and you have heard what theſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes have Evidenced againſt you.</p>

               <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the JURY.</p>
            <p>You have heard all the Evidence for the King and no doubt all you have heard is Truth, but thus far I muſt ſay in favour of the <hi>Priſoner</hi> at the Bar, that I have been acquainted with him theſe many Years, and never knew or heard of the leaſt Diſloyalty lay'd to his charge before this time, I have often dined with him in publick Company, where ſometimes his Majeſty's Health has been Drank, and I never knew him to refuſe it, and I am hopeful you Gentlemen of the Jury will be of opinion with me, as the Evidence all agree, that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010110_0010_0F7CE9DA0B673C38"/>he was in the hight of Paſſion, and that it was more thro' Paſſion then Malice, that he was lead to this fatal miſtake, you ſee Gentlemen how he hangs his Head with confuſion, and no doubt he will faint with ſhame, he is likewiſe an alien amongſt you, as well as my ſelf, and they are not ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to Loyalty in his Country as you here. in this ever memorable City of <hi>Londonderry.</hi>

            <p>The COURT, to the JURY.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you no doubt can ſee as plainly as I can, that Mr.<hi>Sly,</hi> the Kings Attorney Inclines to favour the Priſoner at the Bar, and pleads his being an Alien if ſo, I am ſure he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take it amiſs if we treat him in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that we have done our own Countrymen, there is one Inſtance that occurs to my Remembrance, that I ſhall mention, you no doubt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men all knew the late worthy Counſellor A—s the Crime that he was accuſed of, was only Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what we call a diſloyal Health, you know his Puniſhmet. He was ordered to ſtand one Hour in the <hi>Pillory,</hi> and before the Time was half ſpent, he expired. And now Gentlemen of the Jury. you heard this <hi>Saucy</hi> alias <hi>Swaggering John,</hi> the <hi>Priſ.</hi> at the Bar's Indictment, you have heard his plea, and what the Evidences have teſtified againſt him You are now to withdraw to your Room, where without confuſion you may conſider on ſuch a Verdict, as in way of Truth, you ought to bring in againſt the <hi>Priſoner.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>Saucy</hi> alias <hi>Swaggering John,</hi> you are to be taken from the Bar where you now ſtand, to the common Goal, and there to be laid in long Bolts in the Dungeon, untill there can be a Pillory erected cloſe to the Gallows on the <hi>Strand,</hi> and there you are to be fixed up, and three times a Day the white of an Egg, is to be given you for Suſtenance, the yolks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are to be rubed over your Face, to keep you from Sunburning, and every Evening at Sun ſet, your Cap is to be drawn over your Face, by the Hands of the common Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and by him uncover'd every Morning, at the Sun riſing, that the People may have a fair view of you the whole Day. This light diet you are favour'd with to keep you as clean as poſſible, as you are to carry your Excrements in your Breeches, unleſs you prove to be too Nauſeous in the Noſe of the common Hangman, thus when fixed up, you are to remain untill his Majeſty's will and Pleaſure be made more fully known unto us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clerk,</hi> to the <hi>Sheriffs, Gentlemen,</hi> The Court orders that you get a Pillory erected, three times three Feet from the Ground, and that you ſee <hi>Saucy</hi> alias <hi>Swaggering John</hi> fixed therein,</p>

But the <hi>Priſoner</hi> Saucy alias Swaggering John, has received this Lenity, from the Court. on account of his being an alian amongſt us, therefore you muſt ſee the preſent Sentence Executed.</p>
