            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT was not possible for me to be long undetermined, <hi>unto whom</hi> I should apply my self, in doing the part of a PARENTATOR, when I Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred what Acknowledgments I owe, to the Learned Body, before which I am now appearing. <hi>Unto whom</hi> can I so agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly present my FATHER as to my MOTHER; even to that Ancient and Famous <hi>University,</hi> whose Favours have so Cherished me, that they have rendered me as, <hi>A man whom his MOTHER Comforteth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no small Intimation, how much <hi>the Truth which is according to Godliness is acknowledged</hi> in the Exemplary Church of SCOTLAND, That the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Worth</hi> of an OWEN is considered in it
<pb n="II" facs="unknown:002557_0003_0FDB6CB73456AE80"/>
as it is, and his Writings are so much Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto your Students. And, I hope, ANO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, who was of his <hi>Evangelical Principles,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the History of his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> will also find some Regards with you. Yea, there have been some very Expressive Testimonies of His having already done so. And if you now see me helping my Aged Parent into the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Illustrious Men,</hi> you would no more tax it as a Fault in me, than you would in an <hi>Antoninus.</hi> But yet I have done it in such a manner, that after the first Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph I drop the <hi>Relation,</hi> and speak not only in the <hi>Style</hi> but also with the <hi>Faith,</hi> of an unrelated and Uninterested and Unbiassed <hi>Historian;</hi> putting on the <hi>Historian,</hi> I act the part of the Honest <hi>Levite,</hi> who <hi>said of his Father, I have not seen him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Renouned Church of SCOTLAND, in which I cannot but believe, that the Glorious Lord <hi>Looking down from Heaven, the Habitation of His Holiness and of His Glory,</hi> upon it, beholds those things that are very pleasing to Him, is doubtless <hi>an House of His Glory;</hi> and as he has <hi>Glorified</hi> it, so He will do it yet more abundantly.</p>
            <p>A CHURCH which does Rejoice in this Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Blessing of Heaven unto it, That it made a more <hi>Thorough Work,</hi> &amp; stop'd less than others at halfing of it in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> at the entrance of <hi>Antichrist</hi> into his last <hi>Half-Time,</hi> &amp; more <hi>thoroughly come out</hi> of the <hi>Romish Babylon;</hi> And has ever since been in <hi>singular</hi> Conflicts to <hi>hold fast that which it has Received,</hi> and <hi>let no Man take away its Crown.</hi> It's Motto has been, <hi>With great Wrestlings have I Wrestled, and I have prevailed!</hi>

               <pb n="III" facs="unknown:002557_0004_0FDB6CBA921F6398"/>
A CHURCH, which after it has undergone a <hi>Finishing Stroke</hi> of <hi>Persecution</hi> with such Barbarous and Inhumane Cruelties, for <hi>Four times Seven</hi> Years together, as were hardly ever equalled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the vile things done under the Sun, the <hi>Burning Bush</hi> has not been <hi>Consumed;</hi> but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the Truth have after all been found more Numerous and more Powerful than they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and able to bring about a <hi>Revolution,</hi> which was indeed the <hi>Lords Doing,</hi> and ought forever to be <hi>Marvellous in our Eyes!</hi> The <hi>Persecutors</hi> are by a mighty Hand of GOD Wondrously turned <hi>out of Doors;</hi> And the <hi>Historical Pen</hi> of a Meritorious <hi>Woodrow,</hi> following what has been done by the <hi>Polemical Pen</hi> of an Astonishing <hi>Jameson</hi> (who has pull'd a Temple down like another <hi>Sampson</hi>) it may be hoped, has clap'd an <hi>Eternal Bolt</hi> upon them.</p>
            <p>A CHURCH, wherein the <hi>Excellent Wisdom found</hi> in the Servants of GOD, which upon just occasions knows how to Bury in Oblivion the <hi>lesser Differences</hi> arising on Various Temptations, and coalesce in the <hi>Common Cause</hi> of <hi>all True Protestants,</hi> has in it something that is Great and Just and Generous, and not every where to be met withal, <hi>Where is the place of</hi> such <hi>understanding,</hi> which is <hi>hid, from the Eyes of almost all the Living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And where is the <hi>Church</hi> under Heaven that can shew a MINISTRY, more Faithful, more Painful, more Zealous, or under a <hi>Stricter Government?</hi> Unto which doubtless, the Abdication of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instituted and Unwarrantable <hi>Oversight,</hi> and of <hi>that</hi> whereof our <hi>Wickliff</hi> long ago declared, That
<pb n="IV" facs="unknown:002557_0005_0FDB6CBC221520D0"/>
it <hi>was not only contrary to the New-Testament; but also the Effect of Imperious Pride,</hi> may, (as it has done in other places also that have Dethroned that <hi>Idol</hi>) more than a little Contribute.</p>
            <p>A CHURCH, which that so nothing that would add unto the <hi>Perfection of its Beauty</hi> may be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, improves continually in a Spirit of kind <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance,</hi> and sweet <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Brotherly Affection</hi> towards <hi>Dissenters</hi> in <hi>smaller matters,</hi> while Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine PIETY is Conspicuous in them: and goes further than some others who boast <hi>they have need of nothing,</hi> in Conforming to that <hi>Golden Rule,</hi> To <hi>Receive all that CHRIST receives to the Glory of</hi> GOD. Indeed, what can be more Unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> measured by the <hi>Golden Reed,</hi> which knows no other Measures for <hi>Admission,</hi> but only that PIETY, which Qualifies for the Kingdom of GOD, and wherein all the <hi>Children of</hi> GOD are <hi>United Brethren!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where is the CHURCH, in which the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the <hi>Lords-Day</hi> is more Carefully &amp; Suitably Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated? The <hi>Sabbath,</hi> of which the <hi>Power of Godliness</hi> is kept or lost according to the Celebration? The <hi>Rest</hi> of GOD is <hi>Glorious</hi> in it, &amp; will make it <hi>Glorious!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A CHURCH wherein the SOCIETIES formed for the <hi>Propagation of Religion,</hi> do fairly serve the cause of <hi>Pure &amp; Undefiled Religion;</hi> and their <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom dwells</hi> with the <hi>Prudence,</hi> which <hi>finds out</hi> the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Well-Advised Inventions</hi> to do the <hi>Best Good</hi> that can be done unto &amp; among the Sons of Men; and such things are done, as may give a full Satisfaction unto those who send in their Bounties from all parts unto their <hi>Treasury,</hi> that their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="V" facs="unknown:002557_0006_0FDB6CBE45322F58"/>
is not Misapplied, but that their Bountiful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations will be such <hi>Sacrifices</hi> as GOD, thro' His CHRIST, will be <hi>Well-Pleased</hi> withal; and their <hi>Substance</hi> never better Bestowed, than in this way of <hi>Laying up good Bills of Exchange for the time to come.</hi> Their <hi>Missionaries</hi> have the right Spirit of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and not of a <hi>party</hi> in them: and are the Angels that carry the pure Maxims of the <hi>Everlasting Gospel</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>To do any Service for such a CHURCH, tho' the doer of it should be ranked among the lowest <hi>Netbinims,</hi> were an Honour, which I know one, who is as <hi>Ambitious</hi> as he is <hi>Unworthy</hi> of. And if the <hi>little Book</hi> which now goes over to you,—<hi>Alas, That he who sends it, can't go with it!</hi>—may be so Honoured, as to be in any sort useful to the best Interests among you, I am in the glad Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the Man who sees his <hi>Desire Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.</hi>

            <p>Among those who <hi>Compass the Camp of the Saints,</hi> and are as <hi>Disaffected</hi> unto you, as <hi>Good Men</hi> are <hi>Well-affected,</hi> there is a set of <hi>Strange Men</hi> who assault you and insult you, with <hi>Imagining a Vain Thing,</hi> wherein the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> in these Parts of <hi>America,</hi> &amp; on the whole Continent of <hi>Europe</hi> have aequally with <hi>You,</hi> an Attempt made upon them; The Men who try to shake the Minds of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, with Cavils at <hi>The Validity of a Presbyterian Ordination:</hi> The Men who crying up the <hi>Necessity of an Episcopal Ordination,</hi> do as your Worthy Champion <hi>Willison</hi> Expresses it, advance a most <hi>Unmerciful Opinion,</hi> which <hi>Unchurches</hi> almost <hi>all the Protestant Churches in the World,</hi> and which does the greatest <hi>Service</hi> that can be done to the <hi>Church

            <head>Introduction.</head>
            <p>ALL the World allows a SON, to Erect a <hi>Monument</hi> for, &amp; Preserve a <hi>Memorial</hi> of, his Departed FATHER. <hi>Antiquity</hi> proceeded so far in this Concession, that it Produced the <hi>Teraphim,</hi> wherein People kept the <hi>Images</hi> of their <hi>Ancectors,</hi> and Wickedly Consulted their <hi>Manes by them.</hi> At the same time there is an Allowance also given, that the <hi>Splendor</hi> of the <hi>Monument,</hi> and the <hi>Value</hi> of the <hi>Memorial,</hi> should bear a Proportion to the <hi>Merit</hi> of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. If the <hi>Parent</hi> be a <hi>Man of Worth,</hi> it is on all Hands Agreed, that the <hi>Commemoration</hi> may be Proportionable.</p>
            <p>This is what <hi>Legitimates,</hi> and even <hi>Encourages,</hi> that which is now a doing. And yet I Solemnly Declare, That my Pen should not have been Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd on this Occasion, if I had not been verily perswaded, That it would be a Thing <hi>Acceptable</hi> to the Glorious GOD, and <hi>Serviceable</hi> very many ways unto the cause of PIETY, to Exhibit the <hi>Conduct</hi> of His <hi>Providence</hi> in the <hi>Life</hi> of a <hi>Good Man,</hi> and the <hi>Exemplary Methods</hi> taken by such a Man, to <hi>do Good</hi> in the World. THIS is the <hi>Mark</hi>
               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002557_0013_0FDB6CD1D03C7E80"/>
I would perpetually Aim at; And if it has been Determined, That the <hi>Name</hi> of an <hi>Historian</hi> shall be, <hi>Vertues Secretary,</hi> I know not how the <hi>Pen</hi> of an <hi>Historian</hi> can be better Employ'd, than in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the <hi>Vertuous</hi> Tempers and Actions of the Men that have therein <hi>shown forth the Vertues of</hi> our Blessed REDEEMER, and been the <hi>Epistles</hi> of CHRIST unto the rest of Mankind. Nor indeed has Mankind generally found any sort of <hi>History</hi> more <hi>Useful</hi> and more <hi>Grateful,</hi> than what has been given in the <hi>Lives</hi> of Men that have been distinguished by an <hi>Excellent Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Best of Books</hi> does very much Consist of such an <hi>History!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Veracity</hi> with which the <hi>History</hi> which we are now going to, is carried on, I am Responsible to HIM, whose <hi>Eye</hi> I have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, I hope, Constantly upon me, while I have been Writing of it. But I have also <hi>Vouchers</hi> in my Hands, for every one of the <hi>Articles,</hi> which any one shall be Welcome to see, whenever he Pleases.</p>
            <p>I confess, <hi>It is a Lamentation, and it shall be for a Lamentation,</hi> That so much <hi>False History</hi> is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon the World. Many others, besides <hi>Vopiscus,</hi> have Detected it and Bewailed it, That among all the Celebrated Historians, it may be proved, <hi>Neminem non esse aliquid Mentitum;</hi> Or, as it had been said long before him, <hi>All are Lyars.</hi> The Old Gentleman whom they call, <hi>The Father of History,</hi> may (notwithstanding <hi>Harry Stephen's</hi> unluckly <hi>Apology</hi> for him) as truly be called, <hi>The Parent of Fable.</hi> But what a <hi>Fabulous Generation</hi> have come after him?</p>

No Man has with more Justice Complained of the <hi>Iniquity</hi> Chargeable upon <hi>Historians,</hi> especially upon a Black-sould <hi>Heylin</hi> and his Brethren on both sides the <hi>Alps,</hi> than our Venerable <hi>Baxter;</hi> And no Man could more truly say, <hi>I Hate and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor Lying,</hi> than he. But yet even <hi>He</hi> himself was taxeable with some <hi>Wrong Representations</hi> in his, <hi>History of his Life and Times:</hi> Among which, what he gives of Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> has been Happily <hi>Corrected,</hi> and should be <hi>Forgotten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many <hi>Excellent Men,</hi> and <hi>more Precious than the Golden Wedge of Ophir,</hi> have been strangely <hi>Sambenito'd</hi> by Partial, Prejudiced, Passionate Historians, and handed down unto Posterity in <hi>Vile Characters,</hi> which will never be wiped off, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the <hi>Resurrection of the Just!</hi> Such I really take <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This Author I may the more particularly mention, because Dr. <hi>Mather</hi> was the Person from whose Generous and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative

Goodness, he Obtained very much History of those Brave Men, whom he forever <hi>Skorakizes;</hi> and therein basely Deceived and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the Expectations of the Gentleman whose Communications he so much Subsisted on. But O great <hi>Burnet,</hi> Give thou the Character of the <hi>Scribler;</hi> tell what a Tool of <hi>Rome,</hi> he appears to be!</p>
            <p>It is not more <hi>Shameful</hi> than <hi>Certain,</hi> That <hi>Historians</hi> very Commonly Write as <hi>Tools of a party,</hi> to which every one may see, they are as much Addicted, as <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Philimus</hi> the two Opposite Writers of the <hi>Carthaginian War,</hi> were to <hi>Theirs.</hi> What a Credible Writer of History, was <hi>Paulus Jovius,</hi> a Bishop; with whom the Execrable <hi>John Bosilovitz</hi> is cryed up as <hi>A Good and Devout Christian;</hi> and of whom they tell us, that he brag'd he had one <hi>Pen of Gold,</hi> for his Friends, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Iron,</hi> for them that had not purchased his Favours; and the more impartial <hi>Thuanus</hi> affirms, <hi>Ad Gratiam et in Odium Scripsisse, et Venalem Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum babuisse, fere Omnibus persuasum est.</hi> But how many more may this be Affirmed of? If the <hi>Reformed</hi> in <hi>France</hi> might once make their just Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances, against such Historians as a <hi>Florimond de Remond,</hi> or a <hi>Varillas,</hi> I am sure, their Brethren the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> may make the same concerning some <hi>English Histories,</hi> that must pass for <hi>Uncontradictable Things.</hi> The <hi>True History</hi> of a <hi>Lucian,</hi> has as much <hi>Truth</hi> in it as <hi>they</hi> have, when some Affairs &amp; Persons come in their way! The Motto to be Inscribed on them is, <hi>Omnia pro Tempore, nihi! pro Veritate.</hi> The <hi>Time</hi> and not

And of these I know some that will Venture to say, <hi>Many have done vitiously, but thou</hi> Eachard, <hi>in some things Excellest them all: Except a</hi> Collier <hi>may be a Rival to thee.</hi> In the mean time, would not the <hi>Dissenters</hi> be more <hi>Wise for their Generation,</hi> if more Effectual care were taken, to transmit more <hi>Faithful Records</hi> unto Posterity? <hi>Consider of it, take Advice, and speak your Minds!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>History</hi> now before us, is not like much in the Life of a <hi>Cyrus,</hi> a feign'd Pourtraiture of, <hi>A Man to be wished for,</hi> but Written, <hi>Ad fidem veroe Historioe.</hi> And tho' people have usually a Pardon ready, for the Liberty taken by <hi>Josephus</hi> as well as <hi>Livy</hi> and others, to form <hi>Speeches</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues,</hi> which never were any where but in the <hi>Imagination</hi> of the <hi>Historians,</hi> yet so much Liberty as <hi>That,</hi> would be a <hi>Crime</hi> in the Apprehension, of him that is at Work in what is now a doing: I have kept close to matter of Fact, <hi>just as it was:</hi> I am not more fond of <hi>Obtaining</hi> any <hi>Testimony</hi> than that. <hi>Thou dost Faithful whatsoever thou dost.</hi>

            <p>I am no Pretender to what some have been Commended for, <hi>The Art of good Narrative</hi> And therefore, as for the <hi>Style</hi> of this <hi>Narrative,</hi> I will make no Excuses, till you, <hi>Gentlemen-Criticks,</hi> first can show your <hi>Patent</hi> for your <hi>Criticising,</hi> and who Constituted <hi>You</hi> to be <hi>Censors</hi> for the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and until you are better agreed among your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, upon the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Criticising;</hi> for I cannot Learn that there are any <hi>Two</hi> of you, but what are Intolerably Severe and Cruel in your <hi>Censures</hi> upon

I acknowledge, That I am too liable to an <hi>Infirmity,</hi> of <hi>Salting</hi> my Sentences now and then with short, Instructive, and Unforced <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures</hi> of something or other that I have Read of; but as I was upon Reforming it, I stumbled upon a Passage in a Letter of Monsr. <hi>Tournefort</hi> unto the Lord <hi>Pontchartrain, You gave me leave to insert some touches of Erudition, to heighten the Subjects treated of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And I fancy such Additions will, make them the less tiresome:</hi> And this a little hardened me. However, having Exhibited the <hi>Lives</hi> of about <hi>Seventy</hi> Ministers, all Published in one Volumn, and the Characters of near <hi>Twenty</hi> more, at several times in more Separate Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it can't well be expected, that I should be very Liberal in dealing out those <hi>intermixed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellishments,</hi> which make a <hi>Narrative</hi> less Tedious to the Sons of Erudition: or have my <hi>Speech Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned</hi> with so many Grains of <hi>Salt</hi> as it use to be. And yet I can truly say, I have <hi>Studiously</hi> laid aside that Care of <hi>Embellishing:</hi> I have drop't a <hi>World</hi> of what some would count <hi>Ornaments,</hi> which while I was Writing Offered themselves unto my Mind; Resolving upon a Plain, Simple, Honest <hi>Narrative</hi> of ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But having mentioned a Book (that is to say, The <hi>Magnalia CHRISTI Americana,)</hi> whereto <hi>this</hi> may pass for an <hi>Appendix,</hi> I think I have here a proper Occasion to take some Notice of the <hi>Fate</hi> which it has mett withal. For the very <hi>same thing</hi>

            <p>The BOOK being Written with a Variety of <hi>Projection</hi> and <hi>Contrivance,</hi> to serve that Real, Vital, Solid <hi>PIETY,</hi> which seems now almost wholly to have <hi>left the Earth,</hi> [O Glaucha, <hi>Do thou yet retain it!</hi>] and give some Account of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> which cannot be given without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the <hi>Persecuting Spirit</hi> of some that <hi>Hate to be Reformed;</hi> I could not be so weak, as to Imagine, That <hi>Impious</hi> People, or such as are no better than meer <hi>Formalists</hi> in Religion, would forbear their <hi>Invectives</hi> against it, and their endeavours to bring all possible Contempt upon it.

Proposal; Tis Impossible to Abridge it! You Injure it, if you go to do it.

            <p>But it is <hi>no wonder</hi> at all to me, that the Poor Book has met with some that have thought it proper to let the World see, that they look upon it as an Object for their <hi>Enmity.</hi> And among these none has more Signalized the <hi>Enmity,</hi> or more put the <hi>Third Chapter of Genesis</hi> in Execution, than one <hi>John Oldmixon,</hi> in a Book Entituled, <hi>The English Empire in America.</hi>

            <p>Nevertheless, <hi>Concerning the Work of him who thus turns aside,</hi> I owe so much <hi>Duty</hi> to Truth, and <hi>Service</hi> to Men, as to let the World be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised of it, That as <hi>Antonius Augustinus</hi> Affirms of <hi>Guevara,</hi> who was Historiographer to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V. <hi>Ea Comminiscitur quoe nec visa nec Audita mortalibus:</hi> He is always In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting things that no Mortal but himself ever dream't of; This I do affirm concerning this Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer to Sir Some body else; He is for Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry another <hi>Guevara</hi> And I do here publickly make this Declaration;</p>

               <p>THE Church of God is now to be Entertained with an <hi>History</hi> of a MAN, whose <hi>Life</hi> had in it many <hi>Memorable</hi> Things, which are Worthy to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded and Reported, and have the <hi>Memory</hi> of them kept alive, by a more <hi>Qualified Historian,</hi> than he whose Pen is now Employ'd upon it. But if since the Days of <hi>Josephus,</hi> the World has more than once allow'd an Eminent Person to <hi>Write his Own Life;</hi> and better Men than a <hi>Cardan,</hi> even a <hi>Junius,</hi> an <hi>Hall,</hi> a <hi>Baxter,</hi> to say nothing

of a <hi>Thuanus,</hi> have unexceptionably done it; (an <hi>Austin</hi> too has e'en almost done so:) and had a <hi>Goodwin</hi> and an <hi>Owen</hi> done so, we had been fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with some Antidote against some of the <hi>Lies,</hi> that Croak in our English Chronicles; Most certainly, it may now be allow'd a <hi>Son,</hi> to Write the <hi>Life of his Father.</hi> I shall before I have done, find such a <hi>Pattern</hi> of a <hi>Son Writing the Life of his Father;</hi> as will raise my Action, if it be at all <hi>well done,</hi> unto the Honour of being some <hi>Reward</hi> of a <hi>Sons</hi> doing so. In the mean time, I think it enough to say, my dear Friend Mr. <hi>Matthew Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> did it. I never heard any Blame cast on the Greek Lady, who used her Pen, to tell the Story of her <hi>Father;</hi> nor does any Body that I know of, blame <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> for his Panegyric upon his <hi>Father;</hi> But I may single out <hi>him</hi> the rather to be Mentioned on this occasion, because the Term of a <hi>Patriarch,</hi> (afterwards Applied unto an Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical <hi>Dignity,</hi> and Station, which the <hi>Gospel knows not,</hi> and which Introduced what <hi>we all know</hi> in the <hi>West,</hi>) was first Innocently used in an Oration of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> upon his Deceased <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> and it was with the same Innocency that the very Term was commonly used in the Language of our People, whenever Dr. INCREASE MATHER was at any time in his latter Years Discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Place</hi> Distinguished by the Birth of this Eminent Person, was <hi>Dorchester,</hi> of <hi>New-England;</hi> the <hi>Wilderness</hi> where his Father flying with his Family <hi>from the Face of the Dragon,</hi> Arrived Four Years before. The <hi>Time</hi> was, <hi>June</hi> the Twenty-first,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002557_0028_0FDB6CF846D7EC30"/>
One Thousand Six Hundred Thirty and Nine. His Father was Mr. <hi>Richard Mather;</hi> A Reverend and Renoumed Minister, (in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> before the Transplantation to <hi>New-England)</hi> and one of the greatest Instruments in Explaining and Maintaining those Principles of Evangelical <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> and the <hi>Congregational Church-Discipline,</hi> on which the Churches of this Country were first Established. His <hi>Life</hi> being published in the <hi>Church-History</hi> of this Country, as well as in <hi>Clark's</hi> Collections, I shall here say no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Mother</hi> was Mrs. <hi>Katharine Holt;</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman. Honourable for her <hi>Descent;</hi> but much more so, for her <hi>Vertue;</hi> and that for which a <hi>Woman</hi> is most of all <hi>to be Praised.</hi> She was a Woman of Uncommon Devotion, and in her Importunate Prayers for this her Son, she (like another <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica)</hi> became <hi>Twice a Mother</hi> to him. She some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times told her Son, while he was yet scarce more than an <hi>Infant,</hi> but very much her <hi>Darling,</hi> That she desired of the Glorious GOD only two Things on his behalf; the one was, The <hi>Grace</hi> to Fear and Love GOD; the other was, the <hi>Learning</hi> that might Accomplish him to do Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for GOD; both of which it was her <hi>strong Perswasion</hi> (She told him) that GOD would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon him. <hi>Child,</hi> said she, <hi>If GOD make thee a Good Christian and a Good Scholar, thou hast all that ever thy Mother Asked for thee.</hi> As the Lad grew up she <hi>Taught</hi> him, (as her <hi>Lemuel)</hi> all that was Good. But among her Instructions, it is to be <hi>Remembred,</hi> That she mightily Incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002557_0029_0FDB6CFC5916C290"/>
the Lesson of <hi>Diligence</hi> upon him, and often put him in Mind of that Word, <hi>Seest thou a man Diligent in his Business: He shall STAND BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE KINGS; he shall not stand before mean men.</hi> I said, It is to be <hi>Remembred;</hi> and e're long you'l see the Reason of my saying so. When he was about Fifteen Years Old, she Died Marvellously Triumphing over the <hi>Fear of Death,</hi> which thro <hi>all her Life</hi> she had been Afraid of; and with that Word in her Mouth, <hi>Eye hath not seen, Ear hath not beard, nor hath entred into the Heart of man, the things which GOD has prepared for them that Love Him.</hi> On her Death-Bed, she Earnestly Exhorted him, to Resolve upon Serving of CHRIST in the Work of the <hi>Ministry:</hi> and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised him often to consider on that Promise, <hi>They who turn many to Righteousness, shall shine as the stars forever and ever:</hi> Which left a great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression upon him; and the Remembrance of the Invaluable Mother that gave him the Advice, was Precious to him all his Days.</p>
               <p>If a pretty late Abortion might have Passed for a <hi>Birth,</hi> it might have been said of this, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, she was a Mother of <hi>Seven Sons.</hi> But without <hi>That,</hi> and allowing one of the <hi>Seven</hi> to have so disappeared, the Number of the Sons, which GOD bestow'd on this Happy Pair, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted unto <hi>six:</hi> Whereof one Dyed in his Childhood; and <hi>Four</hi> Proved Useful, and Faithful &amp; Famous Ministers of the Gospel.

And if he might have had an <hi>Hebrew</hi> instead of an English Name, I suppose it must have been a <hi>Joseph,</hi> which is of the like Significancy. Had he been Indisputably a <hi>seventh Son,</hi> yet he would not have Countenanced the Foolish, Profane, Magical Whimsey of the silly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which furnishes the <hi>seventh Son,</hi> with I know not what <hi>Uncommon Powers;</hi> T'was among the <hi>Vulgar Errors</hi> always derided with him.

After I was Recovered, the Arrows of GOD still stuck fast in my Heart, and I was followed with sore and grievous Troubles in my Mind for several Months together; that what in the World to do with myself I knew not: But the Terrors of GOD were so heavy upon me, that I Resolved I would no more Live in any known Sin; and Examining my own Heart, I could not find any Sin, which I was not Heartily willing to part with: And I set upon the Practice of Duty, and that Constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that in Secret Devotions too, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these Distresses of my Soul, I had not made Conscience of. Nevertheless my Wounded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science Remained with me; and GOD <hi>set my Sins in Order</hi> before me, and brought unto my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance many Sins that I had forgotten, with all their Circumstances and Aggravations. He shewed me the Vanities of my Childhood, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002557_0034_0FDB6D0AC5F48D28"/>
made me to Possess the Iniquities of my Youth, in such a manner that my Heart sometimes was even Sinking and Dying at the sight of it. I resolved, that I would Afflict my Soul, and seek unto GOD, by <hi>Fasting</hi> as well as by <hi>Praying,</hi> that He would Pardon all the Sins that were brought unto my Remembrance, and all the other Sins that I had been Guilty of. This course I took, [at <hi>Dorchester,</hi> shutting myself up in my Fathers Study, when he was gone abroad upon a Public Occasion, and not to Return for a Day or Two:] and I wrote down those <hi>Particular Sins</hi> which lay most of all upon my Conscience, and spread them before the Lord in Secret, after the manner of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> Spreading the Blasphemy of <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> before the Lord; and I begged of GOD, that he would Pardon them. At this time I thought with myself, that if all the World were mine, I would freely part with it, to have my <hi>Hard Heart</hi> taken away from me: And I pleaded hard with GOD that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which says, <hi>That He will take away the Heart of Stone, and give an Heart of Flesh.</hi> But I still thought, my Heart was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> a Stone. Thus my Soul Continued in the <hi>New Birth,</hi> And very sore were the Pangs of it. Sometimes I was afraid, I was Guilty of the <hi>Unpardonable Sin.</hi> But upon Discourse with my Father about the Nature of <hi>that Sin,</hi> I became Satisfied, and found that I had never been Guilty of the <hi>Great Transgression.</hi> And I thought my Sins were too <hi>Great to be Pardoned.</hi> But Reading a Book of Mr. <hi>Hooker's,</hi> Entituled, <hi>The Doubting Soul drawn
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002557_0035_0FDB6D0C46135410"/>
to Christ,</hi> I was Induced to believe, That my Sins were Capable of a <hi>Pardon,</hi> and that the <hi>Greatness of Sin</hi> could not hinder the Mercy of GOD. [Psal. XXV. 11.] I was brought not to doubt of GOD's <hi>Ability</hi> to Save and Pardon me. But still I did much doubt of His <hi>Willingness</hi> to do it. And I was foolishly ashamed to Acquaint any Body with my Troubles; I was loth to let any one know, that my <hi>Iniquities were gone over my Head, and as an heavy Burden too heavy for me:</hi> Till at last, not being Able to hold or bear any longer, the Hand of GOD Pressing me so sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, I Acquainted my Father with some of my Soul-Distresses, and (Living at <hi>Boston</hi>) I wrote unto him, how it was with me, &amp; Begg'd him to Pray for me. I Resolved upon setting apart another Day, to be Spent in Secret Prayer with Fasting before the Lord; and the Lord made it an Happy Day unto me; <hi>A Day I shall never forget while I have any Being!</hi> On the Day of our Anniversary <hi>Election,</hi> the Greatest Anniversary Solemnity of the Countrey, the Scholars which Boarded at Mr. <hi>Nortons,</hi> being all Abroad on their Diversions, I took this Opportunity of a Private Chamber; and shutting the Door I spent all the Day, in Pouring out my Complaints un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord. Towards the close of the Day, being full of Extremity of Anguish in my Soul because of my Sin, it was put into my Heart, that I must go and throw myself down at the Feet of my Saviour, and see whether He would Accept of me or no; Resolving, that if He would Accept of me, then I would be <hi>His;</hi> but
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002557_0036_0FDB6D11C84F1340"/>
if not, then I would Perish at His Feet. So I came before Him with those Words of <hi>Esther, If I Perish, I Perish. Yet,</hi> (I said) <hi>Lord, if it must be so, I am resolved to Perish at the Feet of thy Mercy. It is true, I am a Dog, and indeed unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of so much as a Crumb; I have been a great Sinner; Yet I am resolved, I will not Offend any more, but be Thine, and be Thine only, and be Thine forever!</hi> And while I was thus Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Pleading, those Words of CHRIST were darted into my Mind, <hi>Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise Cast out:</hi> Which Promise I Pleaded with the Lord. After that, I had some <hi>Comfortable Perswasion</hi> that my Sins were Pardoned, and that the Lord would shew me Mercy. And thus I went on Comfortably and <hi>Walked</hi> with GOD! But after some time, Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> shewed, That a Man might <hi>Forsake</hi> his Sins, and have been in some <hi>Sorrow of Heart</hi> for them, and yet not he <hi>truly Converted</hi> unto GOD. This Word stuck deep into me; And I was afraid, that though I had been in Unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Sorrow</hi> for my Sin, and thence had <hi>Forsaken</hi> it, yet my <hi>Conversion</hi> might not be <hi>Sound.</hi> But then, hearing my Father Preach on that, <hi>The whole have no need of a Physician, but the Sick,</hi> I thought the Sermon was Preached wholly for myself. My Father shewing, That where there was New and True Obedience, and where the Heart was Changed from the Love of Sin to the Love of God, it Argued <hi>Conversion;</hi> Examining myself, I thought it was so with me, My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also Answered a <hi>Scruple</hi> that was in my

Heart: For I feared, my <hi>Faith</hi> was not Right, because it was not so much some <hi>Word Preached,</hi> but <hi>Affliction</hi> that was the first means of my more Effectual <hi>Awakening.</hi> He shew'd how the Conversion of <hi>Menasseh</hi> was Accomplished. Sometime after this, Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> Preaching on Joh. 1 47. <hi>Behold, An Israelite indeed:</hi> He Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much to <hi>Self Examination!</hi> Laying down several Characters of Sincerity: As, When GOD in CHRIST is become the <hi>Rest</hi> of the Soul; And when there is no known <hi>Sin</hi> Lived in, or <hi>Duty</hi> Neglected; And when the <hi>Heart</hi> is for GOD Chiefly, Wholly, Universally. I set myself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Serious Examination by these Marks, and found that my Heart went along with the Word. So I went on cheerfully in the Ways of GOD; And if in any thing I have been Overtaken with a Fault, the Lord has given me to see it, and Mourn for it, and Turn from it.</q>

               <p>WHen the Year Arrived, wherein he should have Proceeded <hi>Batchelour of Arts,</hi> there was for I know not what Reasons of State, an Order Procured, That the <hi>Class</hi> whereto he belonged, &amp; some others also, should be detained a good part of a Year longer at the College, than of right they should have been. This gave so great a Dissatisfaction, that no fewer than <hi>Seventeen</hi> of the Scholars withdrew from the College with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Degree</hi> at all; Some of whom neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less proved afterwards very Considerable in the Service of the Churches. However the Father of this Young Man (though greatly Troubled, as diverse others of the Overseers were, at this Hardship on the Students,) would not have him take his Name out of the College-Register, which had been done by others. And when he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Travelled with a <hi>Testimonial,</hi> which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the Year of his <hi>Admission,</hi> and not of his <hi>Graduation,</hi> and elsewhere Claimed the <hi>Next-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> he found some <hi>Reward</hi> of his <hi>Patience.</hi> In the Year 1656. he took his <hi>First Degree;</hi> At which time the Praesident, who was deep in the Dark Principles with which the <hi>Stagyrite</hi> has for so many Ages Tyrannized over Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, upon a Dislike of the <hi>Ramoean</hi> Strains in which our Young Disputant was carrying on his

               <p>AT this Time, his Eldest Brother, Mr. <hi>Samuel Mather,</hi> (that great Man, whose Life makes a very considerable Figure in the <hi>Magnalia CHRISTI Americana,)</hi> being one of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Ministers in <hi>Dublin,</hi> wrote unto his Father, to Encourage his going over unto him.

and Advised him to Remember his own Sermon which he had Preached the Lord's-Day before; adding, <hi>That if he Heard well of him, and if he Proved Faithful to CHRIST, the Joy of it would lengthen out his Life,</hi> who was now Sixty One Years of Age. At his going off, many Gracious and Generous People in <hi>Dorchester,</hi> Assisted him with Private Presents, for his Voyage; of whose <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Gifts</hi> he kept an Ingenuous Record, which afterwards he sent unto his Father, with desires that the Thanks of <hi>both</hi> might be returned unto them. At this time, taking his leave of our Incomparable <hi>Mitchel,</hi> he had this Advice from him for his Farewel; <hi>My Serious Advice to you is, that you keep out of Company, as far as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and Civility, and Occasions will give you leave; take it from me, The Time spent in your Study you will generally find spent, most Profitably, most Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, &amp; most Accountably.</hi> Father <hi>Austin</hi> would no doubt have given the same Advice, with whom it was a Maxim, <hi>Non erit bonus Clericus qui non suit Bonus Monachus.</hi> When our SAVIOUR would make One a <hi>Good Speaker,</hi> He first of all <hi>takes him aside from the Multitude.</hi>

               <p>He sail'd from <hi>New-England, July</hi> 3. 1657. and in Five Weeks reached <hi>England.</hi> On <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> 24. he went from <hi>London</hi> for <hi>Lancashire:</hi> Where his Fathers old Friends received him, with a Singular and Mutual Satisfaction. In <hi>September,</hi> he Sailed from <hi>Liverpool</hi> to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and in Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four Hours arrived there. His <hi>Brother,</hi> who had not seen him for <hi>Seven Years,</hi> found it Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be Convinced by the <hi>Letters</hi> he brought
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002557_0042_0FDB6D1CC86AE458"/>
with him, and by <hi>Questions</hi> of Infallible Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he was indeed what he was. But now he became also as a Father to him: And on his Advice he Entred his Name in <hi>Trinity-College.</hi> In <hi>October</hi> he fell Sick of the <hi>Measles;</hi> at which very time, his Brother <hi>Eleazar,</hi> with whom he had always been brought up, as with a <hi>Twin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Brother,</hi> lay Sick of the same Disease, at a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Leagues Distance from him: And the Month after, the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> Arrested him, from which it Pleased GOD Graciously to Recover him. In the Year, 1658. <hi>June</hi> 24. When he was Nineteen Years of Age, he Proceeded <hi>Master of Arts</hi> in <hi>Trinity-College;</hi> having first Performed the Exercises required by the Statutes of that University. The <hi>Proctor</hi> &amp; some of the <hi>Fellows,</hi> who were Prelatically Disposed, gave him all the Discouragement they could, or durst; because of his being what they called, <hi>A Proecisian.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless the Scholars were so Pleased with the Wit and Sense and Polite Learning brillant in his Exercises, that they Publickly <hi>Hummed</hi> him; which being a Complement that he had never heard Paid unto any one before, at first had like to have given too much Surprise unto him, All the Seriously and Piously Disposed Scholars in the College Loved him; And none more than the Memorable Doctor <hi>Winter,</hi> who was the <hi>Provost</hi> of the College, and who had a son (Mr. <hi>Josiah Winter</hi>) that was unto him as a <hi>Jonathan</hi> unto his <hi>David.</hi> By the Influence of the <hi>Provoct,</hi> he was chosen a <hi>Fellow</hi> of the College: but he did not Accept it.

from diverse Places, to come and Preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel unto them; and the Lord-Deputy and Council particularly Assigned him to <hi>Marahfelt;</hi> Whither being on his Travel, he was taken so very Sick on the Road, that he was forced back to <hi>Dublin.</hi> The <hi>Irish Air</hi> proved so Disagreeable to his Constitution, that he resolved for <hi>England;</hi> though the Lord Deputy very kindly assured him, <hi>That he should not go over to</hi> England <hi>for want of Encouragement in</hi> Ireland, <hi>while he should be in any Power there.</hi> I will take the Occasion to say: This was that Admirable Man, the Lord <hi>Henry Cromwel,</hi> who in the time of his Government ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himself with so much Wisdom and Justice, and Goodness, and a Conduct so Unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that when he Voluntarily retired unto his own Estate in <hi>England,</hi> upon the Changes coming on, he was not known to have one Personal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the World. Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> had also an Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to <hi>Sedwells</hi> in <hi>Exon,</hi> (Procured by another Elder Brother Mr. <hi>Nathanael Mather,</hi> then a considerable Minister in those Parts,) by which his Resolution for <hi>England,</hi> were Confirmed: Where he Arrived in <hi>July.</hi> 1658.</p>
               <p>At <hi>London,</hi> he became Acquainted with that Man of a Thousand, Mr. <hi>John How,</hi> who was then a Chaplain to the <hi>Lord-Protector;</hi> and not only then, but also Thirty Years after, gave to Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> such a Character of that <hi>Mighty Man,</hi> as was altogether the Reverse of what some <hi>Histories</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> have given of him. He now perswaded Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> to lay aside his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

for <hi>Sedwells,</hi> and go to <hi>Great Torrington</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> where he had formerly himself Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided and Laboured. So he spent the following Winter there, Preaching the Gospel to a great Assembly and with a great Acceptance; only he spent One Month with his Brother Mr. <hi>Nathanael Mather</hi> who was then a Preacher greatly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired at <hi>Barnstable.</hi> On the Death of the <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Protector,</hi> Mr. <hi>How</hi> returned unto his Old People at <hi>Great Torrington;</hi> At which time Colonel <hi>Bingham,</hi> then Governour of <hi>Guernsey,</hi> sent him an Invitation to become a Chaplain unto the English Garrison there. He went thither in <hi>April,</hi> 1659. Where he Preached every Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Day in the Morning at the Castle, in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon at the Town, called <hi>Peters-port,</hi> where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the French people who understood Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, were his Auditors. Here he set himself to do good; And particularly, Observing the <hi>Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Day</hi> to be much profaned, he Preached on the <hi>Fourth-Commandment,</hi> with such Power and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, that it Produced a considerable Reformation in the Island.</p>
               <p>It was not long before his Friends in <hi>England</hi> pressed his return thither. A Church in <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyche</hi> sent him an Invitation with all their Names unto it; requesting him to Accept the Pastoral Charge of them. This he Declined for some Reasons; whereof one was, That the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church in the City of <hi>Glocester,</hi> where that Excellent Man Mr. <hi>James Forbes</hi> was now shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, procured for him a Legal Title to a place called, <hi>St. Maries.</hi> Thither <hi>He that holds the

Stars in his Right Hand,</hi> brought him in <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> 1659. And there he Preached in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon at <hi>St. Maries;</hi> in the Afternoon at the <hi>Cathedral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was willing to have settled there. But he saw a <hi>Change of Times</hi> at the Door. Yea, as Young as he was, he then very Publickly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, [from <hi>Rev.</hi> XI. 2.] that <hi>further Sufferings for the Faithful Witnesses of CHRIST were to be looked for.</hi> In this View he returned unto <hi>Guern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey;</hi> where he had not been many Weeks before King <hi>Charles</hi> II. came in; And, <hi>what</hi> came in with him, <hi>every Body knows.</hi> When the King was Proclaimed, he openly Refused and Rebuked the Paganizing Rite of <hi>Health-dringing,</hi> which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened on that occasion to <hi>drown</hi> all <hi>Sobriety:</hi> And anon, the King himself being by those whom he had <hi>Ensnared,</hi> Prevailed withal to Publish a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation</hi> against <hi>that Practice,</hi> it Proved an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage unto this <hi>Young Reprover,</hi> and put some stop to Insults upon him. At this time the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less General <hi>Monk,</hi> sent a Demand upon all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission Officers in those parts, to Subscribe a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, wherein they were to Declare, <hi>That they Believed the Times NOW were and would be Happy.</hi> But while some <hi>Old Men Dreamed Dreams,</hi> this <hi>Young Man saw</hi> a true <hi>Vision</hi> of the Times. He Declined a Subscription to the <hi>Vain Paper;</hi> and thereupon the Deputy-Governour, who greatly Valued him and Admired him, did so too. The Chaplain of <hi>Jersey,</hi> (one <hi>Ashton</hi>) who had the Character of a <hi>Naughty Person,</hi> Informed the Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> that the Reason why there did not

come such Complements from <hi>Guernsey</hi> as there did from <hi>Jersey,</hi> was, Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> being there. The Duke was violently Incensed, and in his Rage told the Governour, (Colonel <hi>Weaver,</hi> who was then at <hi>London,</hi>) that Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> should be sent for. But the Governour, though he was one of <hi>Monks</hi> appointing, and one that Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> had never seen, yet had his Heart so Disposed from above, that by his Means the Threatened Storm was diverted.</p>
               <p>While he was in <hi>Guernsey,</hi> the Salary Allow'd him was <hi>One Hundred and Twenty Pounds Sterling</hi> a Year: and every one thought, he would now lose his Arrears, which were above <hi>One Hundred Pounds:</hi> the rather, because one <hi>Sharp,</hi> a Vile Hypocrite and Apostate (who had once been a Member of Mr. <hi>Griffiths</hi> Church) was become the Deputy-Governour, and Secretly did him all the Mischief he could, and returned the Muster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Roll without his Name in it. But when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was brought before the Commissioners at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> (where one Difficulty Pretended was, <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scentius,</hi> forsooth, could not be the same with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease!)</hi> a Gracious Providence ordered it, that one Monsieur <hi>Martin,</hi> a Deacon of the French Church at <hi>Peters port<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>On <hi>March</hi> 6. 1662. he came into the Married State; Espousing the only Daughter, of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Mr. <hi>John Cotton;</hi> in Honour to whom, he did (as Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> had before done in Honour to a Patron of the same Name) call his First<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Son by the Name of COTTON. She was a Gentlewoman of much Goodness in her Temper; a Godly, an Humble, and a Praying Woman, and one that often set apart <hi>whole Days</hi> for Prayer and Secret Interviews with Heaven. When she Died, which was Fifty two Years after, her Eldest Son did as much of Justice to her Memory, as <hi>her Inhibitions</hi> of all Embellishments upon her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter would Permit him, and Published it under the Title of, <hi>Maternal Consolations.</hi> But of <hi>him,</hi> there is no more to be <hi>Written.

               <p>Their second Son, was Mr. <hi>Nathanael Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> who Died at the Age of Nineteen, an Instance of Uncommon Attainments in <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Erudition:</hi> deserving the Epitaph upon his Grave at <hi>Salem; The Ashes of an hard Student, a good Scholar, and a great Christian.</hi> His <hi>Life,</hi> Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>Early Piety Exemplified,</hi> has had the Respects of three or four Editions paid unto it; and this Addition thereto, that no little part of the first Edition was bought by that Good Man.

               <p>The North-Church in <hi>Boston,</hi> had a Struggle of diverse Years, before they could Obtain a Conquest over his Aversion, to the <hi>Consummation</hi> of his Desired Settlement: Which was Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally Occasioned by some Views he had of greater Service elsewhere.

After some time of <hi>Waiting</hi> upon a GOD <hi>of Judgment,</hi> who was all this time <hi>Waiting that He might be Gracious,</hi> there arrived a Day, in which he Wrote thus. <q>This Day pouring out my Complaints into the Bosom of the Lord JESUS, I begg'd of Him, that He would not Punish any of my poor People, because of their Neglects of me, but Pardon them and Bless them; And <hi>that He who heard my Complaints before Him, and knew the Sorrows of my Heart, yea, and knew that I was therefore Grieved at my outward Wants, because I was thereby hindred from doing Him Service, and from Glorifying His Name, and the Name of the Father, and because I lose Precious Time, of which I would not lose any Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, would pitty me when the World would not.</hi> After this, my Heart was at Ease; and I Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that the Lord JESUS heard me; only I Professed before Him, that I was <hi>Content to be Poor,</hi> and in <hi>Debt,</hi> and laid aside as a broken and useless Vessel, if He would have it so; Yea, to be any thing that CHRIST will have me to be. <hi>Now I am Satisfied; The Will of the Lord be done!</hi>

of those Prayers!</hi> On these Days, his manner was, one while in Papers wholly assign'd unto that purpose, to note on One Column, <hi>Causes of Humiliation;</hi> on the Adverse Column, <hi>Matters of Supplication.</hi> Afterwards, he entred them, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his <hi>Diary,</hi> without any <hi>Distinct Columns</hi> for them; and he never entred any where else, the like Enumeration, which he always made, of <hi>Matters,</hi> and <hi>Causes,</hi> for the <hi>Public Days</hi> also, which he kept in Conjunction with the People of GOD. And what he did for <hi>Fasts,</hi> he also did for <hi>Thanksgivings:</hi> For some such Days he kept also in <hi>Secret</hi> before the Lord; Affecting himself with the Various <hi>Mercies</hi> of GOD unto him, and Contriving special <hi>Returns</hi> of Obedience, wherein he was desirous to Glorify GOD. In these Registers one finds the very Spirit of PIETY in the true Breathings and Pulses of it. But the <hi>Public Spirit</hi> Conspicuous in them, and his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous concern for others as well as himself, and for the Town, and Land, and the whole Church of GOD, was highly agreeable to the <hi>large Heart</hi> which GOD had Crown'd him with.</p>
               <p>Besides these Things, he sometimes writ down what <hi>Hopes</hi> he had of having succeeded in his <hi>Prayers,</hi> and what <hi>Grounds</hi> he had for his <hi>Hopes.</hi> Of this it may be I shall tell you more ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time: At this Time, I will Illustrate it, with Transcribing of only Two or Three Passages.</p>

                     <hi>May</hi> 8. 1672. I set apart this Day to Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble myself in Secret, as for other causes, so in special on the account of the Death of my dear Brother <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Tidings whereof came lately to me.</p>
                  <p>In the Beginning of the Duty, the Lord melted my Heart; especially in the second time of my failing down on my Knees before Him. As I was Praying, that the Lord would Remember the Prayers which my Precious Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had put up for me, when he was liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the World, and that He would give much of that Spirit unto me, which he caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so Eminently to rest on my now Blessed Brother; as I was thus Praying, my Heart was exceedingly melted, and methoughts, I saw GOD before my Eyes in an Inexpressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Manner, so as that I was Afraid I should have fallen into a Trance in my Study.</p>

               <p>I am still in Arrears, for the <hi>Diary:</hi> and I am thus to Answer them. I remember that
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002557_0070_0FDB6D664A88D2B8"/>
                  <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> Speaking of the <hi>Prayers,</hi> which his Father poured out at the Celebration of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> says nothing of a <hi>Lifeless Liturgy,</hi> but says, <hi>They were Dictated by the Holy Spirit of GOD.</hi> The Prayers made by mine, on the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charistical Occasions</hi> often were most certainly so! And now and then in the more <hi>Early Years</hi> of his Ministry, he made a short entry of such Flights as his melted Soul was transported to. You shall have a Scantling.</p>
               <p>On a certain Day, he Writes. <q>I was this Day much Affected in Administring the <hi>Supper</hi> of the Lord: Especially in the <hi>last Prayer,</hi> saying, <hi>Now Dearest Lord, If ever there were poor Creatures in the World, that had cause to Love and Bless the Lord, we are they! We have done thee Infinite Wrongs; But thou hast forgiven us all those Wrongs, and dealest with us, as with thy Friends this Day. How can we but Mourn for the Wrongs that we have done unto thee! If we had Wronged an Enemy, and that in a small matter, we should be Grieved for it: But we have Wronged the Son of GOD; Wronged our</hi> SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR; <hi>Yea, we have killed Him. He had never come to the Cross, had it not been for our Sins, as we are the Elect of</hi> GOD. <hi>But the Blood that we have shed, has Procured our Pardon; as it did for the Jews that killed Him; So many of them as belonged unto thine Election. Yea,</hi> CHRIST <hi>Prayed for them, saying</hi> Father, Forgive them! <hi>And so thou knowest, He has done for us.</hi> CHRIST <hi>hath said before thee concerning us,</hi> Father, Forgive them! <hi>If Children much Offend their Father, yet
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002557_0071_0FDB6D6B98882AA8"/>
when any of them come and say,</hi> I am sorry for what I have done; I'l do so no more; Father, Be Reconciled unto me! <hi>Will not a Father then Forgive them? O our Father, we have sinned against thee; but we are sorry for it, and would do Iniquity no more; Father, Forgive us! Thou knowest our Hearts; Thou knowest, that we could be glad if we might never have so much as one sinful Thought in our Hearts, nor Speak so much as one Unprofitable Word more, whilst we Live? Yea, This is the Thing that we would beg of Thee! If ever thou wilt hear the Cries of Poor Creatures, oh! Deny us not this Request. It is, O Lord, Let thy Holy Spirit Sanctify us Wonderfully!</hi>

               <p>On another Day, thus. <q>I was this Day much Affected at the Table of the Lord, saying in Prayer unto Him there; <hi>Lord, we shall never Perish! They that Believe on thy</hi> CHRIST <hi>shall never Perish: And thou knowest, that we Believe on Him. Though hast brought us to the Blood of Sprinkling; and therefore thou wilt bring us to</hi> JESUS, <hi>the Mediator of the New Covenant, and we shall behold His Glory. We shall see our</hi> Joseph, <hi>our</hi> JESUS, <hi>in all His Glory, we shall behold our King</hi> Solomon, <hi>in all His Glory, yea,</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his Glory was not array'd like our</hi> JESUS. <hi>We shall see that Glory; yea, sit down with Him on the Throne of His Glory.</hi>

Such is the Grace of thy Covenant, that thou wilt not Impute our Infirmities to us, if they be our Burden. And thou knowest that they are so. We put the Answer of our Prayers upon That, and are willing to be Denied if it he not so. But thou that searchest all our Hearts, knowest that thou hast Created such a Spirit within us. We are willing to be Delivered from all Sin, and we are willing to yield Holy Obedience to all thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, though how to Perform, we find not.

               <p>On another, thus. <q>Quickenings at the Lords Table, especially in Praying for our Children, that GOD would Remember His <hi>Covenant</hi> with them: and saying, <hi>O Heavenly Father, Did not</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>make His Soul an Offering for the sins of our Children, as well as our sins? Did not He Dy, for our Children as well as for us? Therefore let thy</hi> CHRIST <hi>see His Seed; Let our poor Children be Converted unto Thee, that they may Glorify</hi> GOD <hi>with us in the World that is to come, and World without End.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed the <hi>Prayers,</hi> and the earnest and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Pleadings, with which on the <hi>Sacramental Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,</hi> he commonly Wept before the Lord, on the behalf of his own, and his peoples <hi>Off spring,</hi> were such as carried Evident Marks of an <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Afflation</hi> in them.</p>
               <p>In his latter Years, he did not Record so many of these <hi>Heavenly Afflations,</hi> because they grew so frequent with him.

                  <hi>Expressions,</hi> of the Soul in such <hi>Heavenward Salleys</hi> are presently lost; and though the Feasted Soul would give never so much to recover them, they can by no means do it.

               <p>O Disciple of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> Let not a <hi>Vain Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> tell thee, That such <hi>Heavenly Afflations</hi> are nothing but a <hi>melting of the Brain</hi> by chance hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in a <hi>Warm Temper;</hi> and that they who Speak of GOD <hi>shining out</hi> upon them, only happen to be under <hi>Heats</hi> of the <hi>Brain,</hi> that <hi>rise and flow Copiously</hi> more at some times than at others; and so by Consequence, that the <hi>case of a Troubled mind</hi> Complaining of <hi>Desertious</hi> and <hi>Aridities,</hi> is to be laugh'd at, as the Whimsey of a <hi>Brain</hi> happening to be under a <hi>Cloudy Vapour.</hi> It is true, <hi>Bodily Dispositions</hi> do often affect the mind; and <hi>Ministers</hi> are applied unto, when <hi>Physicians</hi> would be more properly and effectually called for.

               <head>ARTICLE XII. Second Thoughts on the Synod, in 1662.</head>
               <p>THere is now nothing to retard the Progress of our History: But having settled Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in the Pastoral Charge of the North Church in <hi>Boston,</hi> and exhibited the <hi>Dispositions</hi> and <hi>Exercises,</hi> of a more General Application, which he had, not only in the <hi>First Years</hi> of his Ministry, but also pretty <hi>far</hi> into it, we may now proceed unto some Remarkable Affairs and Actions of his Life, in the Order wherein we shall find them occur unto us.</p>
               <p>At the time of his Return to <hi>New-England</hi> he found the Country, deeply engaged in a Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, about <hi>The Church-state of their Posterity;</hi> wherein it is no wonder if the <hi>Political</hi> as well as the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> concerns of a Country found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Bottom of <hi>Religion,</hi> were affected. The Country soon became sensibly divided into <hi>Synoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian;</hi> and <hi>Antisynodalian;</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> from his Youth making a Figure wherever he came, he now did so on the <hi>Antisynodalian</hi> side. If I venture to say, <hi>He was in the Wrong,</hi> I shall anon shew so <hi>good Authority</hi> for my saying so, that <hi>He</hi> &amp; the World, will Pardon me. The case was This. When our Churches were come to between Twenty and Thirty Years of Age, a numerous Posterity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, among whom there were Multitudes of
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:002557_0076_0FDB6D7B4A11F8F0"/>
well-disposed persons, who professed themselves desirous to Renew their <hi>Baptismal Covenant,</hi> and Submit unto the <hi>Church-Discipline,</hi> and so have their Houses also marked for the Lords: but yet they could not come up to that <hi>Experimental Account</hi> of their own <hi>Regeneration,</hi> which would Sufficiently Embolden their Access unto the Table of the Lord; and which the Churches required of them. Now for the Churches to make no <hi>Ecclesiastical Difference</hi> between these hopeful <hi>Candidates</hi> and <hi>Competants</hi> for the <hi>Eucharist;</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> who might happen to Hear the Word of GOD in our Assemblies; This was judged an <hi>Unwarrantable strictness,</hi> which would quickly abandon the biggest part of the Country unto Circumstances by no means to be wished for. But on the other side, it was feared, that if all such as had not yet Exposed themselves by cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable Scandals found upon them, should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto all the Priviledges in our Churches, a Worldly Generation of Men, might before we are aware carry all things into such a course of Proceeding, as would be too Disagreeable unto the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> which the Church is to represent unto the World. The Thing became a <hi>Considerable Controversy.</hi> On this Occasion, there was by the Direction of the General Court, a <hi>Synod</hi> of the Churches Convened at <hi>Boston,</hi> in the Spring of the Year, 1662. Who Agreed upon certain <hi>Propositions concerning the Subjects of Baptism, and Consociation of Churches,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing presented unto the <hi>General Court,</hi> an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was there passed for the Publication and
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002557_0077_0FDB6D7E7B1434E0"/>
Commendation thereof unto all the Churches. The fifth of these <hi>Propositions,</hi> and what was most contested was, That <hi>Church members who were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Minority, understanding the Doctrine of Faith, and Publickly Professing their Assent thereto, nor Scandalous in Life, and Solemnly owning the Covenant before the Church, wherein they give up themselves and their Children to the Lord, and Subject themselves to the Government of Christ in the Church, their Children are to be Baptized.</hi> But there were several Eminent Persons in that Venerable Assembly, who were Jealous lest the Sacred Ordinance of <hi>Baptism</hi> should come to be Applied unto such Unmeet Subjects, as would in a while put an End unto <hi>New Englands</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and Peculiar <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>Undefiled Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> And some of these made very Public Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, to the <hi>Synods</hi> Decisions. One of these was the President of the College, the Learned Mr. <hi>Charles Chauncey;</hi> who Published a Treause, Entitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Famous Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> wrote in Opposition to the <hi>Synod,</hi> what he called, <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Essay for Investigation of the Truth.</hi> But it was Accompanied with <hi>An Apologetical Proeface,</hi> Written by Mr. <hi>Mather;</hi> wherein every one

He did not leave me to <hi>Doubts &amp; Fears</hi> concerning my <hi>Eternal Estate;</hi> but <hi>caused His Face to Shine</hi> upon me. I felt His <hi>Love,</hi> and saw that Jesus Christ <hi>gave Himself,</hi> even <hi>for me.</hi> I could not think of any Sin I had been Guilty of, but my <hi>Conscience,</hi> and I think the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of GOD with my <hi>Conscience,</hi> told me, that <hi>It,</hi> and all my Sins though Many and Great, were Repented of, and done away in the Blood of <hi>CHRIST.</hi> I found myself very Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Dy. When I thought of my Wife and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:002557_0093_0FDB6DA60B43D9A0"/>
Children, my Heart gave them up unto GOD, firmly believing, that he would take Care of them: And I had as much Quiet in my Mind, as if I had neither Wife nor Children to Care for. When I thought of that <hi>Blessedness,</hi> which is to be Enjoy d in <hi>Another World,</hi> I longed to be there. <hi>Oh! The Presence of GOD! Oh! The Presence of GOD! Oh! The Presence of GOD:</hi> It is sweeter than Life it self. <hi>My Soul knoweth it!</hi>—But when I thought of doing Service for JESUS CHRIST, I became desirous to Live yet a little longer.—</q>
               </p>
               <p>Before Winter came on, he returned unto <hi>Boston:</hi> But under such Languishments, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from that Comprehensive Mischief which they call, <hi>The Hypocondriac Affection,</hi> that he lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined all the Winter; and his Recovery to any Service, was by many very much Despaired of. That which added unto his Affliction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was a grievous and little short of Mortal, Molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the <hi>Ephialtes;</hi> which indeed ever now and then Afflicted him, all the rest of his Pilgrimage.</p>
               <p>While he lay yet very Low, he Wrote, <q>Some Considerations, which make me ready to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That GOD will continue me, to do Him Service in the World. 1. Because much <hi>Prayer</hi> hath been put up in many Places, that my Life might be Spared. 2. GOD hath returned me Home, through Wonderful Hazard and Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. He that hath done thus <hi>much</hi> will do <hi>more.</hi> 3. When I lay Sick at <hi>Northampton,</hi> there was a Strong Perswasion on my Spirit, <hi>That
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:002557_0094_0FDB6DA801252EB0"/>
GOD would spare my Life;</hi> Which I then told my Sister; Desiring her to read, <hi>Psal.</hi> CXVIII. 17, 18. 4. I am apt to hope, that GOD hath some <hi>Special Service</hi> for such a Poor Sinful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as I am, to do with Reference to the <hi>Rising Generation,</hi> and the Establishment of these Churches, upon foundations of <hi>Truth, Order,</hi> and <hi>Purity.</hi> This I am the more apt to Believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of my Fathers Dying Counsil to me. 5. There is <hi>Faith</hi> in the Hearts of many of my Christian Friends, concerning this matter. They Believe, <hi>That GOD hath more Work for me to do.</hi> 6. There is an <hi>Alteration on my Spirit</hi> since my Sickness, For I am not so <hi>Desirous to Dy</hi> as I have been, but more <hi>Desirous to Live,</hi> that I may Glorify GOD in my Lord JESUS CHRIST.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He was after all, <hi>By Faith out of Weakness made Strong.</hi> And <hi>Prayer</hi> to the <hi>Lord our Healer,</hi> the Glorious <hi>GOD of our Health,</hi> had its Efficacy very Conspicuously Signalized in the matter. I will single out one Passage from his Diary to Illustrate it, Written while he was yet under his Confinement.—<q>I Pleaded with the Lord for my Life and Health, and my Heart was raised in some Measure to Believe, That GOD would Restore me to His Service, and to my former Strength again. The Grounds of my Perswasion, were such as these. 1. I had <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered the Poor,</hi> GOD therefore Will <hi>Preserve me Alive,</hi> and Bless me <hi>upon Earth.</hi> 2. GOD'S Name and Truth is a little Concerned in my <hi>Restauration;</hi> For some say, That my Sickness
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:002557_0095_0FDB6DA907E23FE0"/>
is come upon me, for my being an <hi>Apostate from the Truth,</hi> and that I shall never Preach again. 3. GOD hath begun Mercy towards me; and His <hi>Works are Perfect.</hi> 4. GOD hath stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the Hearts of His Servants to Pray for me; and my own Heart also to Pray for my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. 5. The <hi>Reason</hi> why I desire my <hi>Health</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, is not that so I might Enjoy Honours &amp; Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in this World, but that so <hi>His Name might be Glorified by me.</hi> Now seeing I have Prayed for <hi>such</hi> Ends and from <hi>Such</hi> Grounds, <hi>My De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires will be fulfilled.</hi> 6. My Heart doth <hi>Trust in GOD for His Salvation.</hi> Therefore He will Save me out of this Distress. 7. Because of <hi>His Covenant,</hi> and because of the <hi>Blood of the Covenant.</hi> Zech. IX. 11. And, because I have <hi>Humbled myself under the Hand of GOD.</hi> 1 Pet. V. 6.</q>

               <p>In the Spring of the Year, 1670. he returned unto his Beloved Pulpit: And made his first Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on those Words: Psal. XCIV. 12. <hi>Blessed is the Man, whom thou Chastnest, O Lord, and reachest out of thy Law.</hi> But being still under feeble Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and having a Strong Impression on his Mind, that the Drinking of the <hi>Mineral Waters</hi> might be of use to him, he took a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Lyn,</hi> where he might repair every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to a <hi>Spring</hi> there, which was then Famous through the Country. I will Transcribe a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage or two from his Diary, which he wrote in the Time of his being there.</p>
               <p>

One is this. <q>At the Waters, retiring myself under the Trees, I poured out my Soul before the Lord, and there met with Him. I did humbly and believingly (through the Lords Grace towards me) betake myse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f unto GOD, and unto JESUS CHRIST, for the Healing of my Bodily Distempers. I Believed, Because, though <hi>Sin</hi> had brought these Distempers on me, yet GOD had accepted the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which CHRIST has offered for my <hi>Sin.</hi> Because also GOD had formerly heard my Prayers. And because CHRIST has Redeemed my <hi>Body</hi> as well as my <hi>Soul.</hi> CHRIST intends to bestow Eternal Glory on my <hi>Body</hi> as well as on my <hi>Soul:</hi> And therefore He will not deny unto me so small a matter as <hi>Bodily Health,</hi> which is nothing in comparison of <hi>Eternal Glory.</hi> Finally, Because I desire Health, for <hi>the Lord's Sake,</hi> and not for <hi>my own;</hi> Even that I may do Service for <hi>Him.</hi> After Prayer, I went away Inwardly Rejoicing, because, <hi>I have Prevailed! I have Prevailed I have Prevailed for Mercy!</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Another is This. <q>At the Waters. There a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Lord Enabled me with Tears, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of a Gracious Answer, to pour out my Desires before Him, for both Bodily &amp; Spiritual <hi>Healing</hi> to be vouchsafed unto me. My dear GOD in JESUS CHRIST, will certainly accept of some Service from me; Blessed be His Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Name forever and ever! <hi>Amen! Amen!</hi>

               <p>It was not long before the <hi>Lost Jewel</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored unto him. Nevertheless, in the way to it, he met with many grievous Pangs of <hi>Overwhelming
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:002557_0097_0FDB6DAFC566D3E8"/>
Melancholy:</hi> of which he also says, <hi>I found the Prayer of Faith to be the best Remedy against it.</hi> But of this also, I will from his Diary, only note a Couple of Passages.</p>
               <p>One is this; <q>As I was returning home from <hi>Lyn,</hi> at the end of the Town, a poor Godly Woman (whose Name is <hi>Mansfield</hi>) desired those that Rode with me to go forward, for she must needs speak with me. When I stop'd, <hi>O Syr,</hi> (said she, with much affection, and many Tears) <hi>I am troubled at my Condition. I am afraid, that I grieve the Good Spirit of GOD, by not being so cheerful as I ought to be. I am Dejected, and my Soul is Disquieted; and when I meet with Afflictions, I lay them too much to Heart; and I doubt, I herein of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend so Gracious a Father, as GOD has been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; a GOD who has done much for me, and and sometimes Manifested Himself unto me.</hi> I was astonished to hear her speak, and see her come thus to me for some Relief in such Temptations. I concluded, that this poor Woman (who little thought so herself) was a Messenger sent from GOD unto me; For she spoke to my very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as if He that knows all things had put Words into her Mouth. <hi>Oh! Let the Great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians of Souls</hi> (said I then) <hi>Look upon me, and let Him Heal me, and give me Power of Grace to be more than a Conqueror over my Special Infirmities.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Another is This. <q>I was in much Distress and Anguish in my Spirit. lest all my <hi>Faith</hi> should prove but <hi>Phansy</hi> and Delusion. In this Distress, I betook myself to CHRIST, and wept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:002557_0098_0FDB6DB21486F970"/>
Him, saying <hi>Lord JESUS, let me be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, if thou canst find in thy Heart to Destroy, a poor Creature, who desires above all thing to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify thy Name. Here I am before Thee; Do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>hat it should be so: But, Oh, that thou wouldest pitty me!</hi> After I had thus fled &amp; cried unto the <hi>Rock that is higher than I,</hi> I was revived. But Anxiety returning the next Day, and being hurried with Temptations, I professed before the Lord JESUS, <hi>That if the Tempter did fall upon me, to destroy me, he should find me at the Feet of CHRIST; and will CHRIST suffer him there to destroy me?</hi> I therewith Promised before the Lord, that if He would bring me out of my Distress, I would endeavour in all Respects a better Carriage before Him. After this, I had some Perswasion, That GOD heard my Prayers, and beheld my Tears, as he He did those of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and the Weeping <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And so it Proved. <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> returned unto him; And though the Labours of the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit now became near Twice as much as they were before, yet he Comfortably went through those &amp; all his other Labours: and Opportunities to do Good, grew upon his hands continually.</p>
               <p>By way of Gratitude unto Heaven, and as an Effect and Symptom of a <hi>Perfect Recovery.</hi> One of the first Things he did was TO WRITE THE LIFE OF HIS FATHER: which as I told you before, was Transcribed into <hi>Clarks</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections. He also Published the last Sermons of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:002557_0099_0FDB6EA18EB2F080"/>
his Brother <hi>Eleazar,</hi> who was led from the Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words of his Father about care for the <hi>Rising Generation</hi> just before, to Preach diverse Lords Days on those Words, 1 King. VIII. 57. <hi>The Lord our GOD be with us, as He was with our Fathers.</hi> He likewise Prepared for the Press, a very Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury Book, Entituled, <hi>Some Important Truths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Conversion,</hi> which was then quickly Printed at <hi>London,</hi> (and fifty Years after, he saw it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in <hi>Boston,</hi>) with a Preface of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> unto it, who gives the Author something of his Deserved Character; saying among other things, <hi>It is known unto all, to whom he is known, that he is a Person of Singular good Learning, and Reading:</hi> And here—a <hi>Workm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In fine, from an Heart now more than ever set upon doing for GOD, he now Wrote; <hi>Jun.</hi> 11. 1670.</p>

               <p>ON the Entrance of the Year 1674. Observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Sins of the Times,</hi> and therewith Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Signs of the Times,</hi> he had a sad and strong Impression on his mind, and a Spirit that could not rest until he had Publickly Declared it, That a Time of grievous <hi>Trouble</hi> was quickly coming on the Country; yea, that a <hi>Sword</hi> should quickly be drawn, which would bring a dark and dismal Time upon it. Under this Impression, he delivered on a Day of Prayer kept in his own Congregation, What the Learned Mr. <hi>Oaks</hi> in his Praeface to it, calls <hi>A solid, Succinct, Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Discourse,</hi> on Ezek. VII. 7. <hi>The Day of Trouble is near;</hi> Which was by the Ordering of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence immediately Published and Scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered through a Country, <hi>Warned thus to flee from the Wrath to come.</hi> The Country was then in all possible Tranquillity and Security.

               <p>In the Time when the <hi>Sword of the Wilderness</hi> was <hi>Devouring</hi> what it had its Commission to fall upon, he Employ'd the growing <hi>Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> which were now put into his Hands, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

               <head>ARTICLE XVII. Strange Impressions and Predictions.</head>
               <p>IN the Year, 1676. he had a strange Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on his mind, that caused him, on <hi>Nov.</hi> 19. to Preach a Sermon on those Words, Zeph. III. 7. <hi>I said surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; So their DWELLING SHOULD NOT BE CUT OFF;</hi> and Conclude the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, with a Strange Praediction, That a <hi>Fire</hi> was a coming, which would make a Deplorable Desolation. After he came home, as he was Walking in his Study, he was Exceedingly moved and melted in such a Soliloquy; <hi>O Lord GOD, I have told this People, that thou art about to cut off their Dwellings; but they will not believe it. Lord, who has believed! Nevertheless, O Lord GOD, I beseech <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At the same time, he Earnestly urged upon his Consort, a Speedy Change of Habitation; which could not be Accomplished. On the next Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Day, he Preached, [<hi>Not aware of its being so!</hi>] a Farewel-Sermon, on those Words, Rev. III. 3. <hi>Remember how thou hast Received and Heard.</hi> And the Conclusion of the Sermon was, That <hi>Proedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Evil to come ought to be Remembred;</hi> And, that when the Lord JESUS is about to bring any heavy Judgment upon His People, He is wont to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:002557_0104_0FDB6DBB0EC8D210"/>
stir up the Heart of some Servant of His, to give <hi>Warning</hi> of it; which <hi>Warning</hi> should be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,</hi> that so People may be ready to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what must come upon them. His last Words were, <q>People won't <hi>Remember,</hi> nor Mind these Things. But, as <hi>Jehu</hi> said unto his Captain, <hi>Remember how the Lord laid this Burden,</hi> so, when the Evil is come, you will <hi>Remember</hi> what you heard concerning it.</q> The very <hi>Night following,</hi> a Desolating <hi>Fire</hi> broke forth in his Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. The <hi>House</hi> in which he with his Flock, had <hi>Praised GOD,</hi> was <hi>Burnt with the Fire.</hi> Whole Streets were Consumed in the Devouring Flames, and laid in Ashes. His <hi>own House</hi> also took a part in the Ruines: But by the Gracious Providence of GOD, he lost little of his <hi>Beloved Library:</hi> Not an Hundred Books from above a Thousand; Of those also he had an immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit, by a Generous Offer which the Honourable Mrs. <hi>Bridget Hoar</hi> made him, to take what he Pleased from the Library of her Deceased Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. In less than Two years also, he became Owner of a Better House; And though his Flock was now Scattered, for several Months, GOD made it an Opportunity for him to Preach every Lords-Day, in the other Churches, and Entertain Successively the whole City, with his Enlightening and Awakening Ministry.</p>

                  <q>Though the <hi>Spirit of Prophesy</hi> in some sense be ceased, yet GOD hath not hereby Precluded His own Power, nor yet that of His <hi>Ministring Spirits</hi> from Visiting and Assisting of His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as He pleaseth.

               <p>THe Man, with whom the <hi>First Born of his Wishes,</hi> was, not for the Great or Sweet Things of This World, but that he might be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the Doing of Special Service for the Kingdom of GOD in the World; <hi>Behold, what the King</hi> of Heaven will do for the Man who <hi>so Delights to Honour Him,</hi> and whom <hi>He Delights</hi> [as He ever will for <hi>such!] to Honour!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was one excellently Prepared for <hi>Special Service;</hi> And GOD made him, all along so Significant and Conspicuous, but by'nd by (and <hi>Now</hi>) so placed him at the <hi>Head,</hi> in all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Affairs relating to <hi>Religion,</hi> in a Country whereof the main concern was <hi>Religion,</hi> that one can scarce Write the <hi>History of his Life</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Writing the <hi>History of his Times,</hi> and it will be the History of his Country for Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score Years together. But <hi>That</hi> having been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, I know not whether <hi>This</hi> may not be under a Necessity of Suffering some Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations: They shall be however as few as may be.</p>
               <p>I am arrived now to a <hi>Stage,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Year,</hi> (1679) wherein a <hi>Synod</hi> of all the Churches in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, whereof Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was esteemed a <hi>great part,</hi> even that which was called, The <hi>Reforming Synod,</hi> appears Convened. It is an Awful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:002557_0107_0FDB6DC410D56AF0"/>
which the Excellent <hi>Comenius</hi> has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his famous <hi>Bohemian</hi> (which were in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things like the <hi>New-English</hi>) Churches; That they were <hi>nearer to the Sanctuary</hi> than other Churches, and therefore when some <hi>Apostasy</hi> was found among them, CHRIST Expressed His Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure against them in most <hi>Swift</hi> and <hi>Severe</hi> Dispensations. <hi>New-England</hi> was not become so Degenerate a Country, but that there was yet Preserved in it, far more of Serious <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as of Blameless <hi>Morality,</hi> than was Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably to be seen in any Country upon the face of the Earth. Nor were they overgrown with the Vices which are Enumerated by <hi>Cyprian</hi> as Abounding among the Primitive Christians, for which he said, <hi>Vapulamus ita<expan>
                        <am>

But the Country saw a <hi>Succession</hi> of Heavy Judgments: and still upon the Relaxation of <hi>Calamity</hi> there was an Augmentation of <hi>Iniquity:</hi> so that Good Men
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:002557_0108_0FDB6DC5887F9920"/>
thought it high time to enquire with all possible Solemnity into the <hi>Grounds of the Controversy,</hi> which it appear'd that the Glorious GOD had with the Country; and this the rather, because many did <hi>not Enquire Wisely concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Indeed, as our SAVIOUR has no where Promised a <hi>Temporal Prosperity,</hi> unto a Life of <hi>Piety;</hi> but bid us look for the Discipline of the <hi>Cross,</hi> and has told us, <hi>That through much Tribulation we must enter into the Kingdome of GOD:</hi> So if a whole People were made up of such as led a Life of <hi>Piety,</hi> yet a Promise of all <hi>Temporal Prosperity</hi> could not be claimed for them. If every <hi>Individual Believer</hi> be still Obnoxious to the Things that are <hi>not Joyous but Grievous,</hi> how can a <hi>People</hi> consisting of such, look for an Exemption from them? It is true, the <hi>Israelites</hi> had a <hi>Promised Land,</hi> wherein they might hope for a <hi>Temporal Prosperity,</hi> while they kept the Condition of the <hi>Covenant</hi> by which they held it. But the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> is got out of that <hi>Minority.</hi> Nor has our SAVIOUR Promised His Church any <hi>Land flowing with Milk and Honey</hi> in <hi>this Present Evil World.</hi> We actually see this, in every Generation; That the most <hi>Reformed Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of GOD (the <hi>Vaudois</hi> for <hi>That!</hi>) have been harassed with <hi>Persecutions,</hi> as well as they that by Sinking into <hi>Criminal Corruptions</hi> have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Holy JESUS to say, <hi>I have something against thee;</hi> At the same time, they that <hi>Work Wickedness,</hi> have not wanted for <hi>Exaltation.</hi> Yea, let us look where we will at this Day; The People among whom the <hi>Covenant of the Gospel</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="unknown:002557_0109_0FDB6DC70D0AAB38"/>
is most adher'd unto, see much more <hi>Temporal Adversity,</hi> than many People who pay very little Regard unto it. Nevertheless, it will be the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of any People under <hi>Heavy Judgments</hi> of Heaven, to Apprehend Loud calls unto <hi>Repentance</hi> in them; and <hi>Confess</hi> and <hi>Forsake</hi> their <hi>Sins,</hi> that they may <hi>find Mercy</hi> with the Lord: They make a very Ill use of the Divine Dispensations, and run the Hazard of being dealt withal as the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory</hi> and <hi>Incorrigible,</hi> it they do dot so. Yea, they have cause to be Apprehensive, that the <hi>Heavy Judgments,</hi> may come to manage a <hi>Special Controversy,</hi> and be Inquisitive, <hi>what</hi> and <hi>where</hi> it may be, and be Sollicitous for the Removal of it. Be sure, the <hi>Prayers</hi> of such a <hi>Reforming People,</hi> under their Distresses, will be the most likely to be Prevailing ones: GOD has also Wondrous Rewards for the Encouraging of <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Sabbatizing</hi> and <hi>Almsgiving,</hi> even in the <hi>Life that now is.</hi> And <hi>good Order</hi> Flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among any People, has a <hi>Natural Tendency</hi> to befriend many Points of their <hi>Temporal Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; Righteousness will Exalt a Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore upon a Motion of Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> in Conjunction with others excited by him for it, the <hi>General Court</hi> called upon the Churches to send their Delegates for a <hi>Synod in Boston;</hi> To consider, <hi>What are the Evils that have Provoked the Lord to bring His Judgments on</hi> New-England. And, <hi>What is to be done that so those Evils may be Reformed?</hi> The Churches having first kept a <hi>General Fast,</hi> that a Gracious Direction might be Obtained of GOD in what was now to be done,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:002557_0110_0FDB6DCCECEDD0D8"/>
the <hi>Synod</hi> met at <hi>Boston Sept.</hi> 10. 1679. The <hi>Synod</hi> also kept a Day of Prayer with Fasting; in which Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was chose for one of the Preachers, when the Venerable Old Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> was chose for the other. Several Days were then Spent in free Discourses on the Two Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and at last, a <hi>Result</hi> with a <hi>Preface,</hi> were agreed unto, which were of Mr. <hi>Mathers</hi> drawing up. On the Day, when a Committee of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters Presented it unto the <hi>General Court,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> Preached a very Potent Sermon, on the Danger of not being <hi>Reformed by these Things:</hi> And the <hi>General Court</hi> thereupon Commended it unto the <hi>Serious Consideration of all the Churches and People in the Jurisdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD made this Instrument a <hi>Special Service</hi> to the cause of PIETY. Especially in that the Faithful Ministers throughout the Country, were Directed and Strengthened, in <hi>Lifting up their Voice like a Trumpet,</hi> against the <hi>Provoking Evils.</hi> But the most notable Effect was, the <hi>Renewal of Covenant,</hi> which was attended by many Churches, in Pursuance of the largest Article among the <hi>Reforming Expedients,</hi> which the <hi>Synod</hi> had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended. The Churches under the Conduct of their Pastors, having on Previous <hi>Days of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> set apart for that purpose, considered what Heaven Expected from them, were willing <hi>Anew</hi> to declare their most Explicit Consent unto the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and most Explicitly to Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize their Obligations to those Duties of it, in which the Singular Temptations and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Day called for their <hi>Excited Vigilance.</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:002557_0111_0FDB6DCDC550A820"/>
When their Praeparatory Church-Meeting had produced a Concurrence in this Resolution, they Publickly Devoted a Day for this Holy Intention; and with Suitable <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Sermons,</hi> there was Read their <hi>Covenant,</hi> whereto their Assent was expressed by the <hi>Brethren</hi> lifting up their Hands, and the <hi>Women</hi> only standing up. The Church whereof Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was the Pastor, was a Pattern to many others, in this Religious Action; And as there was usually a vast Confluence of People on these Occasions, thus, there were Thousands of Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators who testified, that they never saw what may be called, <hi>A Special Presence of GOD our</hi> SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, more gloriously Discovered, than in those awful Solemnities.</p>
               <p>As a sort of <hi>Parenthesis</hi> unto these Designs, of PIETY, it may not be amiss here to Observe, that Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> being a Person Polished with an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rudition</hi> beyond what was Ordinary, among other Symptoms and Effects of it, a little after this, he formed a <hi>Philosophical Society</hi> of Agreeable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who met once a Fornight for a Conference upon Improvements in <hi>Philosophy</hi> and Additions to the Stores of <hi>Natural History;</hi> From which the Learned <hi>Wolferdus Senguerdius</hi> a Professor at <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> had some of the Materials, wherewith his <hi>Philosophia Naturalis</hi> was Enriched; And in part from <hi>their</hi> Collections also One that had a share in that Combination, and is now Fellow of the ROYAL SOCIETY in <hi>London,</hi> afterwards trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Communications thither. But the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of the Times, anon gave a fatal and total Interruption to this Generous Undertaking.</p>

               <p>THe last <hi>Parenthesis</hi> being so dropt, we may go on, where we left off before it, in our History.</p>
               <p>On <hi>May.</hi> 12. 1680. The <hi>Synod</hi> had a Second Session at <hi>Boston;</hi> When Our <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> was agreed upon. Though there were many Elder, and some Famous, Persons in that Venerable As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, yet Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was chosen their <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator.</hi> He was then Ill, under the Approaches &amp; Beginnings of <hi>Fever;</hi> but so Intense was he on the <hi>Business</hi> to be done, that he forgot his <hi>Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> and he kept them so close to their <hi>Business,</hi> that in <hi>Two Days</hi> they dispatch'd it: and he also Composed the <hi>Proeface</hi> to the <hi>Confession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On this he immediately took his Bed under a dangerous <hi>Fever;</hi> which anon left him under an <hi>Ague;</hi> and this was attended with a <hi>Cough,</hi> which carried the Symptoms of a <hi>Consumption</hi> with it; so that he was brought very low, and his Life was much despared of. But GOD stirred up the Hearts of many Godly and Worthy People, to be much in <hi>Prayer</hi> for him. His own Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed their Love to him, in keeping of no less than <hi>Three Days of Prayer</hi> that his Life might be prolonged, and his Health restored. On one of those Days, the Venerable Old Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Sermon on those Words, Joh. XI. 3. <hi>Lord,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:002557_0113_0FDB6DD26FE1FEE0"/>
Behold, he whom thou Lovest is Sick.</hi> And after the Sermon, that Man of GOD returning to him, said, <hi>Blessed be GOD! Brother, you are ours; we have Obtained you from GOD; you shall yet continue with us.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> himself also, being asked by some of his Friends, <hi>Whether he did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self think, that his Time was now come to Dy?</hi> He Replied; <hi>I am not at all Careful about that matter, I have the Satisfaction, that I have endeavoured to Walk before GOD with a Perfect Heart, and to do that which is Well-Pleasing in His Sight. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, I do not think, that I shall Dy at this Time; For I have not yet Suffered for my Lord JESUS CHRIST, so much as I have Desired.</hi> He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and that he might Express the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of his Life after his Recovery, his First Sermon upon it, was on Phil. 1. 21. <hi>To me to Live is CHRIST.</hi> His Church also did him the Uncommon Honour, of keeping a Day of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic THANSGIVING to GOD for his being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored unto them. Soon after which, the Death of his <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> the Excellent Praesident of Harvard-College, Mr. <hi>Urian Oakes,</hi> opened a New Field of <hi>Special Service</hi> for him; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of—<hi>more hereafter!</hi>—I will <hi>Remember my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will here take notice only of one point, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Restored Servant of GOD, grew yet more <hi>Abounding in the Work</hi> of his Lord. Good Old Mr. <hi>Eliot,</hi> as long ago, as not long after the Death of Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> said unto Mr. <hi>Mather: Brother, The Lord has Bless'd you with a Leading Spirit, as he did</hi> Mr. Mitchel, <hi>who is gone unto Him, Certainly
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:002557_0114_0FDB6DD5A40150D0"/>
'tis no little Notice, that is taken by our Holy Lord, of what is done in the Meetings of His Ministers. I pray, Brother. Lead us, in our Meetings: Bring forward as much Good in them as you can.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> made it one of his <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Studies,</hi> from this Time, unto the End of his Pilgrimage; to make the Weekly (and other) <hi>Meetings of the Ministers</hi> Profitable. How much <hi>Special Service</hi> he did in them, and how many <hi>Good Motions,</hi> he brought forward, there is no Record kept, except in that <hi>Book of Remembrance,</hi> which our GOD has <hi>Written before Him,</hi> for them who <hi>Think upon His Name.</hi>

               <p>In the latter end of the Year, 1683. there arrived a <hi>Declaration</hi> from King <hi>Charles</hi> II. with a Signification to the Country, That except they would make a <hi>full Submission and entire Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of their Charter to his Pleasure, a <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The Ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was offered unto Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> whether the Country could without a plain Trespass against Heaven, do what was Demanded of them; and in his Elaborate Answer to it; he Demonstrated, That they would act neither the part of <hi>Good Christians,</hi> nor of <hi>True Englishmen,</hi> if by any Act of theirs they should be Accessary to the <hi>Plot</hi> then manageing to produce a <hi>General Shipwreck of Liberties.</hi> Communicating his Answer to several of the Magistrates, the Copies thereof came into many Hands; and with so much Efficacy, that the Country was preserved from a <hi>Mean Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance</hi> with the <hi>Vile Proposal.</hi> Great was the Rage of Adversaries on this Occasion; and Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was by <hi>them</hi> called and spited as, <hi>The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet of New-England.</hi> He felt it; but yet so Satisfied in the <hi>Good Work,</hi> that when the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Boston</hi> met on <hi>Jan</hi> 23. that they might give Instructions to their Deputies for the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Court, and the Deputies with others, desired

him to be present, and give them his Thoughts on the <hi>Case of Conscience</hi> before them; he made a short Speech in the Town House; and <hi>This</hi> was it, as I find it in his own Copy of it. <q>As the Question is now Stated, <hi>Whether you will make a full Submission and entire Resignation of your Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Priviledges of is, unto his Majesties Pleasure,</hi> I verify Believe, We shall Sin against the GOD of Heaven if we Vote an Affirmative unto it.

And it was a thing little short of Miraculous, that considering the Tricks and Frauds, wherewith every thing was then Managed, the Point was not gained.

Behold, The whole <hi>Jury</hi> cleared Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> and ordered the Plaintiff to Pay <hi>Costs of Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> went on with his Praeparations for his Voyage; and had his Mind more and more Irradiated with a Strong Perswasion, That GOD would give him <hi>to find Things in</hi> England, <hi>in such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Terror, that he had no power to meddle with him.

               <p>After the Ship had made the Land, in a Fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy Day, they narrowly escaped Perishing among the Rocks of <hi>Silly.</hi> And some very Wicked Fishermen of St. <hi>Ives</hi> also after <hi>That</hi> gave them false Advice, on purpose to have Shipwreck'd 'em; which they again Escaped by Mr. <hi>Mathers</hi> taking one of the <hi>Sharks</hi> aside, and hiring him with Four Half Crowns to tell the Truth.

               <p>BUt Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> willing to lose no Time, hastened up to <hi>London,</hi> where he arrived, <hi>May.</hi> 25. 1688. And he <hi>found Things in such a state, as that he had Opportunity to do Special Service for his People;</hi> Even beyond what he could have Imagined. An Eminent Person often at Court, Informed King <hi>James,</hi> of his coming with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to His Majesty from <hi>New-England:</hi> And upon <hi>May</hi> 30. which was the Time the King had ordered for it, he attended on his Majesty, in the long Gallery at <hi>Whitehall.</hi> Offering to kneel, the King forbad that Posture to him: whereupon Presenting the Address, he said, <hi>Syr, Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties most Loyal Subjests in</hi> New-England, <hi>with all Possible Veneration, Present this Address of Thanks to Your Majesty, for Your most Gracious Declaration of Indulgence unto them and their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> The king replied, <hi>Read it Syr;</hi> which he did, and added the Number of the Ministers who had Subscribed it, in the Name of their several Congregations. The King then received it out of his Hand, and said, <hi>I am glad my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in</hi> New-England <hi>are sensible of any Ease and Benefit by my Declaration: And it shall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. I hope, by a Parliament to Obtain a</hi> Magna Charta <hi>for</hi> Liberty of Conscience. He then Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented an Address to the King from <hi>Plymouth;</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:002557_0135_0FDB6E0F092FF978"/>
to which His Majesty replied, <hi>I kindly accept of this Address also, and I say again, as I said before; You shall have a</hi> Magna Charta <hi>for</hi> Liberty of Conscience.</p>
               <p>Two Days after this, Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Kings Closet; and there said unto him: <hi>Syr, Your Majesties most Loyal Subjects in</hi> New-England <hi>think, they can never be sufficiently Thankful to GOD, and to Your Majesty, for the Benefit they have received by Your most Gracious Declaration of Indulgence.</hi> The King Replied; <hi>I am sure, they that are truly</hi> Conscientious, <hi>are Pleased with my Declaration; As for those that are not Satisfied with it, they are Men that have little Designs of their own; <note place="margin"> [LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE! Can the Ethiopian Change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots! THEN!—]</note> and their Tricks are well known to the World. I was for</hi> Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science <hi>before I was King: And I Thank GOD, that since I was King I have been able in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to give some ease unto my Subjects.</hi> He then said unto the King; <hi>Syr, Your Subjests in</hi> New-England <hi>are a People that were Persecuted thither on the meer Account of Religion.

                     </gap>asmuch as Your Majesty has Delivered them from the Fear of a future Persecution, they are Transported with Joy; and there are great Numbers, Desirous that I shall report their Dutiful Affection unto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</hi> The King thereupon asked him, whether Sr. <hi>Edmond Andros</hi> gave good Satisfaction to his Subjects there.</p>

               <p>Upon this, Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> kneeled, and the King Offering his hand unto him, he Kissed it; and for this Time took his Leave.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> Immediately got ready, not only a <hi>Memorial</hi> of the Grievances which filled his Country with the <hi>Cry of the Oppressed,</hi> but also a <hi>Petition</hi> for a Redress of them, in several <hi>Proposed Instances.</hi> Indeed, he could not now propose the Restoration of the Condemned &amp; Vacated <hi>Charter;</hi> But he did Propose (what the King himself had Instructed him to call) a MAGNA CHARTA, for an Everlasting <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> to the Churches, to the Religion whereof no less than an utter <hi>Extinction</hi> was intended and eagerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by the <hi>Sons of Strangers</hi> who now Lorded it over them. He did therewithal Propose, a Confirmation of the Peoples <hi>Title</hi> to their Lands, which had been brought under such an Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Contestation. He did also Propose, a Liberty for an <hi>Assembly.</hi> But he had nothing more at Heart than the Interest of the <hi>College;</hi> whereof he was now the <hi>Rector:</hi> (and his appearing in

that <hi>Quality</hi> was no little Advantage to him in his Present <hi>Agency:</hi>) but the Ruin whereof was evidently in the View of the Persecutors. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared the way for it by Private Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, to the Lords of the Kings Privy Council, and the Chief Ministers, he again Waited on His Majesty, (<hi>July</hi> 2.) and was Admitted into his Closet; where he Presented kneeling his <hi>Memorial</hi> and <hi>Petition.</hi> The King put forth his Hand to take him up and said, <hi>You shall not kneel, Syr:</hi> and therewithal received the Papers out of his Hand; saying, <hi>I suppose these Papers concern</hi> New-England, <hi>and are about the same things, which you had some Discourse with me, not long since upon:</hi> And then putting them into his Pocket he said, He would take care about it. Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was accompanied with Two Gentlemen whom the King treated, (not to say, <hi>Cheated</hi>) as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Both of whom Declared unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, That if he shewed Favour to <hi>New-England</hi> it would have a Good Influence on the whole <hi>Body of Dissenters</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> Whereto the King Replied, <hi>I believe so, and it shall be done!</hi> And Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> then added, That his poor Subjects in <hi>New-England,</hi> very much Desired he should be Acquainted with their Condition: But he said, <hi>The Obligation will be beyond Expression great, if your Majesty, will Please to grant them a Charter for their College.

                  <note place="margin">[What? King JAMES himself declare so!]</note>
                  <hi>should be taken from them, &amp; put into the Hands of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists.</hi> The King Replied, <hi>It is Unreasonable, &amp; it shall not be!</hi>

On <hi>Sept.</hi> 26. Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> again waited on the King in his Closet; and there said unto him; <hi>Syr, I count it my Duty, most Humbly to Thank Your Majesty, in that you were Pleased some time since to give Assurance, that you would Confirm to your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in</hi> New-England, <hi>their Liberties and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, aud the Benefit of your Gracious Declaration.</hi> The King Replied, <hi>I will take the same Care of</hi>New-England, <hi>as of</hi> England; <hi>And you may be sure, they shall have what I have Promised.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> went on, <hi>I Humbly Pray, Syr, that the matter may be Expedited. Your Majesties Affairs here may feel some Advantage from it.</hi> The Kings Answer was; <hi>Trouble yourself no farther; I will take Care, that the thing shall be done with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But,—<hi>Quid Verba audiam, quum sacta non Videam?</hi>—There was nothing Effectually <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> of all that had been <hi>Promised.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> made as many Friends as he could: And it was Remarkable to him, That not only the Lord-Proprietor of <hi>Pensylvania,</hi> (then a Great Man at Court) treated him with much Civility, but even the <hi>Goggle-Ey'd Monster</hi> too who used no other Man so, treated him with some Humanity, and the <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> themselves used him very Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously. It often made him think on that Word, <hi>They shall take up Serpents, and it shall not burt them:</hi> The <hi>Serpents</hi> were so far from <hi>Hurting</hi> him, that they Extremely Caressed and Flattered him. He had something better than a <hi>Staff of Laurel</hi> for his Preservative! When he was in the midst
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:002557_0140_0FDB6E1CF59233F0"/>
of these Dangerous People. Among these, <hi>Nevil Pain</hi> told him, That Father <hi>Peters</hi> would gladly speak with him, and was willing, [<hi>Pray, Master</hi> Apella, <hi>can even you Believe a Word of this?</hi>] to do Good Offices for <hi>New-England.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> did not see cause to trust him; nor did he ever Exchange Ten Words with him; though Reports were spred by some Spiteful Persons of his maintaining an Intimacy with him; and he was once in Eminent hazard of losing his Life, by a <hi>Mob,</hi> which from some Resemblance of Stature and Habit mistook him for the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Thing in the World. Some that were Friends to <hi>New-England</hi> strongly advised him to seek an Acquaintance with that Gentleman, and use his Interest with the King; but he always declined it and said, <hi>It was next to going to the Devil for Help and he could never find in his Heart to do it.</hi> Some others, he did more freely Apply to; and especially, the Lord-Praesident and the Earl of <hi>Melfort;</hi> who both still <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Fair.</hi> He also hoped, That the Distress and the Terror of the impending <hi>Revolution,</hi> would compel the <hi>Doing of something:</hi> And for this purpose, he attended on the King, once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in his Closet, on <hi>Oct. 16.</hi> who then Positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told him, That <hi>Liberties,</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> and the <hi>College,</hi> and all that he had <hi>Promised,</hi> should be Immediately Confirmed: And it seem'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed on the point of being Executed.

               <head>ARTICLE XXVI. The History of the NEW CHARTER.</head>
               <p>LET my Reader, I beseech him, now be armed with abundance of Patience. I am entring into a Story, which I wish I could manage with the Dispatch of the <hi>He-Goat</hi> in the Visions of <hi>Daniel.</hi> But it is a Story that should and must be told: and I foresee, it will prove a <hi>long Chapter,</hi> let me do what I can. Of the Poets, whereof tis Remark'd the one knew <hi>what to say,</hi> the other knew <hi>what Not to say,</hi> I am Confident, even the latter, (and he who has made his <hi>Eneids,</hi> as we now have them, twenty times as short as they were in the first Composing of them) could not give it much more Concisely than what shall be now endeavoured.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou art not in a <hi>Time</hi> or a <hi>Frame,</hi> for the Reading of <hi>Civil</hi> matters, Turn over a few Leaves, and <hi>Skip the Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps, the <hi>Partitioning</hi> of the Story into <hi>Sections</hi> may give the Reader some necessary <hi>Breathing-Spaces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 1. <hi>England</hi> made and saw an Happy RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOLUTION. And <hi>New-England</hi> upon, (and <hi>almost before)</hi> the Advice of it, made as <hi>Just and Fair</hi> an One, in Conformity to it; and not <hi>Resisting an Ordinance of GOD,</hi> but <hi>Restraining</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:002557_0143_0FDB6E21C6051B70"/>
a Cursed Violation of His <hi>Ordinance,</hi> Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned Sr. <hi>Edmond Andros,</hi> and his Accomplices.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving to <hi>London,</hi> and he with the Princess, being soon after, <hi>Chosen</hi> and <hi>Crowned,</hi> KING and QUEEN, of the British Empire, Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> had a New Field, and a Large one, for special <hi>Service</hi> offered him.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> having declared, the <hi>Restoration of Charters</hi> to be one Intention of his Expedition into <hi>England,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately used his Most Vigorous Endeavours, That the <hi>Charters</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> might be Restored as well as those of <hi>England.</hi> The good Old Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> whose Memory ought forever to be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto <hi>New England,</hi> went with Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> to Wait on the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> at St. <hi>James's;</hi> and on <hi>Jan.</hi> 9. then Presented the Petition for it unto His Highness. That noble Person, with a great Zeal told his Highness, <hi>That if he were sure to Dy the next Day, he would as he now aid this Day, appear on behalf of</hi> New-England, <hi>and Sollicit His Favour to that Religious Country.</hi> He said, <hi>That they were a Godly Conscientious People, and there were Proportionably more Good Men in</hi> New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England, <hi>than in any part of the world.</hi> He said, <hi>They did not Petition for Money, nor for S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uldiers, nor any other Succours under their heavy Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; but for their Ancient Privileges.</hi> His Highness replied. <hi>That His Purpose was, to take the Best care he could about it; and He would give order to His Secretary</hi> Mr. Jepnson! <hi>concerning it.</hi> My Lord then carrying Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> to
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:002557_0144_0FDB6E269DF04E80"/>
Mr. <hi>Jephson,</hi> said, <hi>Cousin,</hi> (for such he was) <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve this Gentl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>man; and whenever he comes to you, Receive him, as if I came myself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> soon had something to do with Mr. <hi>Jephson!</hi> For by the Procurement of some old Courtiers and Jacobites, a <hi>Circular Letter</hi> was drawn up unto all the Plantations, and unto <hi>New-England</hi> among the rest, <hi>Confirming all their Old Governours until further Order.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mathers</hi> Vigilance, got the Knowledge of this Letter, from the Secretary: But what a concern did it give him! Had this Letter come to <hi>New-England,</hi> and the <hi>Pounded Rulers</hi> taken the Advantages of it, as they would have done, to have resumed the Government, <hi>Boston,</hi> would have been a <hi>Shambles.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> Effectually Remonstrated it unto the Secretary, who carried his Remonstrance unto the Prince; and he then gave Order that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>New-England</hi> should be stop'd; but the rest proceed. This one <hi>Special Service</hi> was well worth his voyage to <hi>England</hi> for it!</p>
               <p>§. 2. It is Commemorated among the Memorable Things in the <hi>Prudentia Veteris Ecclesioe;</hi> That the People <hi>Antioch</hi> having by some rash doings, exceedingly Incensed the <hi>Emperour Theodosius,</hi> and Fearing his Vengeance upon them, Composed very Mournful Hymns, which they sang in their Publick Devotions. Upon which they also sent their Pastor, even the most Eminent Minister in the City, as an <hi>Agent</hi> for them, to the Imperial Court; who Prevailed with the Young Men that were Singers at the Emperours Table, to Sing
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:002557_0145_0FDB6E27C27BA690"/>
those Mournful Songs: At the hearing whereof the Emperour, when he understood the Original &amp; Intention of them, was Dissolved into Relenting Tears and shewed Mercy to the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>New-England</hi> had not so far Incurred the Royal Displeasure; though some Displeasing Things had been Unwisely done in the Country. Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> being in an Agency for them, like his Predecessor <hi>Flavian,</hi> thought it no Imprudence to let the King hear something of what passed in the Public Devotions of the People for which he was concerned.</p>
               <p>On <hi>March</hi> 14. 1689. The Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to King WILLIAM; and Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> knowing that the king desired none but <hi>very short Speeches,</hi> only said, <hi>I Congratulate your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties happy Accession to the crown, and I Humbly Implore, your Favour to</hi> New-England.</p>

                  <speaker>KING.</speaker>
                  <p>I Will forthwith give Order, that Sr. <hi>Edmond Andros</hi> shall be removed from the Government of <hi>New-England,</hi> and he called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Account for his Male-Administration.

               <p>§. 3. This true <hi>New-Enland</hi>-Man considering how Wonderfully <hi>New-England</hi> had Prospered under the <hi>Old Charter,</hi> and how Desirous the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for whom he was now concerned, were to have it Restored; he Advised with the Wisest Friends he could find, about this Momentous Affair. Their Concurrent Judgment was, That the best course would be to Endeavour for a <hi>Reversion of the Judgment</hi> against the <hi>Massachuset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Charter</hi> by an <hi>Act of Parlaiment;</hi> and afterwards Petition to the King for the <hi>Additional Privileges.</hi> Without which the <hi>Old Charter</hi> would not answer
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:002557_0147_0FDB6E2E8C4CB268"/>
the Occasions, and Necessities of the People. Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> hereupon made most Indefatigable Applications unto the Principal Men in that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention Parliament;</hi> The Effect of which was, That in the <hi>House of Commons</hi> the <hi>Charters</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> were expresly put into the <hi>Charter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bill:</hi> It was Voted. That the taking of them away, was a <hi>Grievance,</hi> and that they should be <hi>Restored.</hi> And a great interest was also made in the <hi>House of Lords.</hi> that when the Bill should come up to them, for their Concurrence, <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England</hi> might be there also Favoured. At the same time, [<hi>July</hi> 4. 1689.] Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain Introduced by the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> unto the king at <hi>Hampton Court:</hi> and said,</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Presume your Majesty had been Informed of the Great Service, which Your Subjects in</hi> New-England, <hi>have done for your Majesty, and for this Nation, and for the Protestant Interest, in Securing that Territory for King WILLIAM.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>KING.</speaker>
                  <p>I have seen some Letters that speak of it, and I kindly accept of what they have done.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If Your Majesty would Please to Command that Your kind Acceptance of what they have done shall be Signified unto them, it will be a great Encouragement.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>KING.</speaker>
                  <p>I will give order to the Secretary of State, that a Letter be Written to them, to
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:002557_0148_0FDB6E30020B25C8"/>
let them understand, that what they have done is Acceptable to me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ma.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Your Majesty may, by the Assistence of</hi> New-England. <hi>whenever You Please, become the Emperour of</hi> America. <hi>I durst engage, that Your Subjects there, will readily venture their Lives and Estates in Your Service. All that is Humbly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired on their behalf, is only that they may Enjoy their Ancient Rights and Priviledges.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>KING.</speaker>
                  <p>I do assure you, I will do all that it is in my Power to do, that it may be so.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> being with him, told the Kind, that he could not possibly do any thing more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Dissenting Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> than in being kind unto <hi>New-England</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing of their former Privileges. The King had them rest Satisfied, <hi>That it should be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But behold, while the <hi>Charter Bill</hi> was Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Convention-Parliament</hi> was Unexpectedly <hi>Prorogued,</hi> and then <hi>Dissolved;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> found the <hi>Sisyphoean</hi> Labour of a whole Year come to nothing.</p>
               <p>§. 4. The Disposition of the next Parliament soon appeared such, that nothing in the Favour of <hi>New-England</hi> was to be Expected there. Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> then made some Essays, to see if by a <hi>writ of Error in Judgment,</hi> the case relating to the <hi>Massachuset-Colony</hi> might be brought out of <hi>Chancery</hi> into the <hi>Kings Bench;</hi> but this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:002557_0149_0FDB6E3418F77AC0"/>
also was Defeated by so Surprizing a Providence, that Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> Declared upon it; <hi>Never did I see a more Signal Hand of Heaven in any matter, than in Disappointing all Hopes, for the Obtaining the so much Desired full Restitution of all our Charter Privileges, by a Reversion of the Judgment Entred against them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All Hopes of Obtaining the Restoration of the <hi>Old Charter</hi> being at an End, there was no way left, but a Flight unto the Royal Favour; For though it was not in the Kings Power to <hi>Reverse the Judgment</hi> against the <hi>Old Charter,</hi> yet His Majesty had power to Re-incorporate his good Subjects there, and grant them a NEW CHARTER, that should contain all the <hi>Old,</hi> with New and more Ample Privileges; With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, the <hi>Old</hi> would not have seen Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> with Two other Agents, which the <hi>Massachuset Colony</hi> had then joined with him, now Signed, a Petition to the KING, for such a NEW CHARTER: which Petition the Right Honourable Earl of <hi>Monmouth</hi> Condescended so far, as to deliver with his own truly <hi>Noble Hand.</hi> Whereupon Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> Obtained the interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a great Personage, which Prevailed with the king to refer the Affair of <hi>New-England</hi> unto the Consideration of the Two Lord Chief Justices, with His Majesties Attorney and Sollicitor General: All of whom had by Mr. <hi>Mathers</hi> Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Assiduous Applications been brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>New English-</hi> Interests. They met Three or Four Times, and kindly gave him leave to be
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:002557_0150_0FDB6E36CA4D40B8"/>
Present with them at all their Consultations. The Heads of the <hi>Massachuset</hi> OLD CHARTER, and Sr. <hi>Ferdinando Gorges,</hi> were Presented in Writing, together with such <hi>Additional Privileges,</hi> as were then Pray'd for: And they all judged, there was nothing Unreasonable, or Prejudicial to the Kings Interest in what was Proposed. They were Presented unto the King, by the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Holt;</hi> and the King Ordered him to Present them unto the Conncil; who did accordingly; and from thence they were transferred unto the <hi>Lords of the Committee for Trade and Plantations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. Immediately upon this, the King took his Voyage for <hi>Holland:</hi> and before his Return, there was <hi>no more to be done.</hi> But still Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> would be <hi>doing of something</hi> for the good of his Country. He published, <hi>Reasons for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of charter-privileges, granted to the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sachuset-Colony,</hi> which he Dispersed among the Lords of His Majesties most Honourable Privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Council; and Personally Addressed himself unto the most of them; humbly Praying their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Favour to <hi>New-England,</hi> in a matter that appeared so Equal. His <hi>Maxim</hi> was, That in all Affairs, a <hi>Few did All;</hi> and his <hi>Method</hi> was, To find out the most <hi>Potent Leaders</hi> in all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and make sure of them. If he knew any N. C. Minister, who had an Interest in any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Quality, he would engage that Minister to Employ his Interest on the behalf of <hi>New-England;</hi> One way of engaging him, was by
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:002557_0151_0FDB6E39331FB520"/>
Preaching for him: And, This also Introduced <hi>him</hi> into the same Acquaintance. There were several Noblemen, who likewise, brought him into the Knowlege and Favour of others. But none did more for him that way, than that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial and Constant Lover of all good Men, the Aged Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> who was the last Surviving Member of that Famous <hi>Assembly of Divines</hi> at <hi>Westminster.</hi> Among those Eminent Persons, who Admitted him to be Familiar with them, I will particularly mention Two that were of an <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Character,</hi> for the sake of the Good that was done to <hi>New-England</hi> by his Acquaintance with them. The one was Dr. <hi>Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>son,</hi> the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> who did at his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, often concern himself to do kind Offices for the Country, and Pray, both the King and Queen to put Marks of their Favour on their Faithful Subjects there; and once he went so far as to tell the King, <hi>It would by no means do well for him to take away any of those Privileges from the People of</hi> New-England, <hi>which</hi> K. Charles I. <hi>had granted them.</hi> And indeed Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ten spoke of the Catholic Spirit, with which the Arch Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> blamed the Conduct of his Predecessor <hi>Land,</hi> in his Discourses with him. The other was, Dr <hi>Burnet,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury:</hi> who besides many Real and Weighty Expressions of his kindness for the Country, told him, That he would on the first Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity declare Openly in the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> That <hi>there was a greater Sacredness in the Charter of</hi> New-England, <hi>than in those of the Corporations

in</hi> England; <hi>Because those were only.

               <p>Having so spoken, he bowed unto the King; who then retired into his Closet</p>
               <p>Two Days after this, the Lords of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee Proposed unto the KING, whether he would have the People of <hi>New-England,</hi> make what <hi>Laws,</hi> and Appoint what <hi>Officers</hi> They Pleased? Or, Whether He would not Appoint a <hi>Governour</hi> of His own, that should have a <hi>Negative Voice</hi> on all Acts of Government? The King was very Inquisitive to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he might without any <hi>Breach of Law,</hi> set a Governour over that Colony? Diverse Lords of the Council, and some of the Judges, answered, That whatever might be the Merit of the Cause, inasmnch as the <hi>Charter</hi> of the <hi>Massachuset-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony</hi> stood Vacated by a Judgment against it, it was in his Power to put them under what Form
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:002557_0158_0FDB6E498D0BF358"/>
of Government he should think best for them. The King then said, That he was Desirous to Promote the Welfare of <hi>New England</hi> as well as of <hi>England;</hi> and that he Believed it would be for the Advantage of the Subjects in that Colony to be under a Governour appointed by himself: but that he would have the Agents of <hi>New-England</hi> Nominate a Person that should be Agreable to the Inclinations of the People there: And that notwithstanding This, he would have <hi>Charter-Privileges Restored and Confirmed unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 8. The next Day, the King began his Voyage to <hi>Holland:</hi> but an <hi>Order of Council</hi> was drawn up, [<hi>Who can tell, How, or Why?</hi>] for a <hi>Charter</hi> to be Prepared, with something in it, very Disagreable to Mr. <hi>Mather;</hi> who immediately waited upon Four or Five Lords of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties most Honourable Privy-Council with his Remonstrances; Every one of which Declared, that in their Opinion, it was not worded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to His Majesties Intentions. He also caused a Copy of the Order to be transmitted unto One of his Majesties Principal Secretaries of State then with Him in <hi>Flanders;</hi> Praying, That if that Order were not according to the Kings Mind, His Majesty would Graciously Please to Signify His Disapprobation thereof: But no such Signification ever came. In the mean time, the Attorney General, Prepared a Draught of a <hi>Charter</hi> according to what he took to be the Kings Mind, as Expressed when His Majesty
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:002557_0159_0FDB6E4F98866D58"/>
was last in Council. In this Draught, the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (and not all Free-holders) had Power to choose the Deputy-Governour, and the other General Officers; And the Kings Governour had not a Negative Voice in any case allow'd unto him. The Draught being presented at the Council-Board, it was by some Objected, That by such a <hi>Charter</hi> as this, the <hi>Kings Governour</hi> would be made a <hi>Governour of Clouts:</hi> And Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was given for other <hi>Minutes</hi> to be Inserted, which Deprived the <hi>Massachuset-Colony</hi> of some very Considerable Privileges in their <hi>former Charter.</hi> The Secretary gave Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> a Copy of them, with an Order from their Lordships, That if the Agents for the <hi>Massachuset-Colony</hi> were not Satisfied, they should bring in their Objections to Mr. Attorney General. Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> on this occasion Expressed his Dissatisfaction, to the Attorney-General, with a <hi>Pathos,</hi> that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Reflection he thought might be too Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary: Earnestly Protesting, That he would sooner part with his Life than Consent unto such <hi>Minutes,</hi> or unto any thing that might In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe any Liberty or Privilege that justly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd unto his Country. The like Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he made unto several of the Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters; who all replied, That no body Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or Desired his Consent: for they did not look on the Agents from <hi>New-England,</hi> as <hi>Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries</hi> from another Sovereign State; But that if they Declared, they would not Submit unto the Kings Pleasure, His Majesty would set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Country as He Pleased, and They were
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:002557_0160_0FDB6E5108629F28"/>
to <hi>take what follow.</hi> However, Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> drew up Reasons against the Minutes Proposed; and particularly urged, That <hi>Charter-Privileges</hi> might with as much (if not more) of Justice, be witheld from the Corporations in <hi>England,</hi> which were never legally Restored, as from <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England:</hi> with several other Arguments. These Reasons he Delivered in Writing to the Kings Attorney-General, who Presented them unto the Lords at the Council-Board; and he also caused a Copy of them to be sent unto the King in <hi>Flanders;</hi> Procuring some Great Persons at the same time, to sollicit by Letters, the Ministers of State with the King, that they would use their Interest with His Majesty, to prevent any thing that might be, grievous to His Good Subjects in <hi>New-England.</hi> Some thought, that if the <hi>King</hi> were in <hi>England,</hi> there might be more likelihood of Stopping the Disagreable and Undesireable <hi>Minutes;</hi> and the <hi>Queen</hi> was therefore Prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed withal, to Write unto the <hi>King,</hi> requesting him, That He would Graciously Command, that the <hi>Charter</hi> should pass as the Attorney-General had prepared it, or else that it should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd until His Majesties coming over. Mr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> taking it for granted, That he might get some Liesure to recover his <hi>Health,</hi> which had been greatly Impaired, by his Neglect both of <hi>Rest</hi> and <hi>Food</hi> in his close Attendance to the Service of his Country, made a short Recess un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Waters.</hi> But he was quickly surprized, with Notice, That the King had signified His Approbation of the <hi>Minutes,</hi> and His Royal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:002557_0161_0FDB6E53427D9A90"/>
that the <hi>Charter</hi> should be accordingly forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with proceeded in. His Majesties Principal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State shewed Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein the King also Declared, That he did <hi>by no means Approve</hi> of the Objections, which had been offered. When there could no more <hi>Good</hi> be done, what remain'd was to stave off <hi>Harm</hi> as far as might be; and in Pursuance of This, he Presented a Petition, That no <hi>Property</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Colony, or to any therein, might by the <hi>New Charter</hi> be taken from them, nor any Privileges which they had a Right to; That the <hi>Province of Main</hi> might be confirmed, and <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> added unto the <hi>Massachusetts:</hi> (Both of which were obtain'd against much Opposition:) And, That <hi>Hampshire</hi> might be under that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: (But This was refused, because it was declared, That the People there had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed a great A version for it.) Just at this Time, he received Letters from the General Court of <hi>Plymouth-Colony,</hi> which Thanked him for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting their being annexed unto <hi>New-Tork,</hi> which had been above a Year before if <hi>he</hi> had been out of the way; and Pray'd, That if they might not be confirmed as a <hi>Distinct Government</hi> among themselves, he would, <hi>for the Lords sake,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to get them annexed unto <hi>Boston;</hi> And This was accomplished. When the <hi>New Charter</hi> was finished, and had been Read before the Lords, he pray'd, that he might see it; because there might be some Clauses in it, which their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship might upon a Suggestion of Reasons for it, think proper to alter; and perhaps there might
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:002557_0162_0FDB6E571F1181A8"/>

               <p>§. 9. NOW came on a <hi>Strange</hi> Question: <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Agents for the Country should Submit unto this NEW CHARTER? Or, in hopes of Obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at some time or other a Reversion of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the OLD CHARTER, Signify to the Ministers of State, that they had rather have NO CHARTER at all, than such an one as was now Proposed!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On this occasion, Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> advised with as many Unprejudiced and Judicious Persons as he could; wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>men, Gentlemen, Divines, and Lawyers; and with the Best<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Friends <hi>New-England</hi> had in the World. They ALL agreed, That it was a <hi>Duty,</hi> to accept of the Offered CHARTER; And some greatly wondred at them
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:002557_0163_0FDB6E5A043FEBD0"/>
that should make any <hi>Question</hi> of it: and were almost ready to say of them, as <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Philebus</hi> does of some who made a Question of another matter; <hi>Let them be Committed unto the Care of some Learned Physician, who by wholesome Physic may restore their Heads unto a better Temper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Peremptory <hi>Refusal,</hi> would have brought a Fatal Ruin on the Country; and the Blame would have been laid on those, who when they could not <hi>Obtain</hi> all they would have, would <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse</hi> what they might have had.</p>
               <p>The Lawyers declared, That a passive <hi>Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> here, had nothing of a <hi>Surrender</hi> in it; for here was nothing of <hi>Hand and Seal</hi> in the Case. Besides, <hi>Judgment</hi> was already Entred and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded against the <hi>Old Charter.</hi> And a taking up with the <hi>New Charter,</hi> did not render the Colony uncapable of recovering their <hi>Old Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges</hi> if there should be a favourable Opportunity to Sollicit for it.</p>
               <p>At present, there was no Possibility of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a <hi>Reversion of the Judgment</hi> against the <hi>Old Charter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, and it was considered, That the <hi>Old Charter</hi> was on more Accounts than One, so very Defective, that without a Grant of <hi>Additional Privileges,</hi> it would have left the Colony under Insupportable Infaelicities.</p>
               <p>By it, the <hi>Massachuset-Government</hi> had no more power than the Ordinary <hi>Corporations</hi> have in <hi>England;</hi> But those Corporations have no power in <hi>Capital Cases.</hi> Though Corporations have Power given them in <hi>Criminal,</hi> yet they have not in

                  <hi>Capital Cases,</hi> except it be <hi>Expresly Declared;</hi> which it was not <hi>here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Old Charter</hi> directed not an <hi>House of Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> or <hi>Assembly of Representatives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor did it give Power unto the <hi>Governour and Company</hi> to Impose Taxes on any but the <hi>Free-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it knew not <hi>Courts of Admiralty;</hi> So that if the <hi>New Charter</hi> have them not, it is not the Loss of the <hi>Old</hi> One that has Lost them. Yea, The <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ficiencies</hi> were so many, That the Kings Attorney General declared, the Two Lord-Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Justices and Sollicitor General Concurring with him; That Supposing the Judgment against the <hi>Massachuset-Charter</hi> to be Reversed, yet, if the Government should exert <hi>such Powers</hi> as before the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> against the <hi>Charter</hi> they tho't it necessary to do, there would <hi>now</hi> be a Writ of <hi>Scire facias</hi> issued out against them in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster Hall,</hi> and their <hi>Charter-Privileges</hi> would undoubtedly be taken from them.</p>
               <p>It was moreover Considered, That if the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the <hi>Old Charter</hi> had been fully Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> (which Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> had so much Laboured for,) the <hi>Massachuset-Colony</hi> would, for all <hi>that,</hi> have been reduced into Misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Circumstances.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Province of Main,</hi> as to the Government, would have been taken from them. <hi>Hampshire</hi> and <hi>Plymouth</hi> would have been put under a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour sent from <hi>England.</hi> This Governour would have had the Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> as well

               <p>The Kings Governour has indeed a <hi>Negative</hi> in all Acts of <hi>Government;</hi> (And indeed all <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> forever implies a <hi>Negative:)</hi> which renders the Government of <hi>New-England,</hi> less <hi>Democratical</hi> than once it was.

               <p>Appeals to <hi>England</hi> are allow'd in the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Charter,</hi> but only in <hi>Personal,</hi> (not at all in <hi>Real</hi> or <hi>Mixed) Actions,</hi> where the matter of Difference, is of above Three Hundred Pound <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> But above all, that <hi>Breath of PIETY,</hi> his Old strokes of Incessant PRAYER, was kept in its Unintermitted Respirations with him.</p>
               <p>It is a little Observable That though <hi>Homer,</hi> by first Introducing the Gods as having the same <hi>Vicious</hi> Characters, and Actions with miserable <hi>Mortals,</hi> Proved one of the Greatest Apostles the Devil ever had in the World; yet the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies born to many Points of <hi>Morality</hi> in his Famous and Wondrous <hi>Epic Poem,</hi> are number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.

in a Gracious Answer to it.

In these Days, I find him sometimes, under those <hi>Afflations from Heaven,</hi> which assured him, <hi>That be should Return to</hi> New England, <hi>with Good Tidings for the People there.</hi> When he saw his Designs Crost, and his Labours Lost, in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of the <hi>Old Charter,</hi> it greatly Perplexed him to see what look'd unto him, as if his <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> were Baffled. But GOD was Graciously doing better than he Imagined, for him, and for his People, whom the <hi>Old Charter, (as it was)</hi> would not have near so well Accommodated <hi>(as things go)</hi> as what is now Obtained for them.

Once a Month, he Preached with Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> at <hi>Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:</hi> who though he were a Person of so <hi>Catholic</hi> a Spirit, had one of the Smallest and Purest Churches about the City; with which he chose to have his more Constant Communion at the Holy Table: And the Doctor told his People, That if Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> might be detained in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he had rather have him joined with him in the Pastoral Charge, than any man in the World.</hi>

               <p>§. 13. The <hi>Business</hi> being so Accomplished, there yet remains One Enquiry more; How was he Subsisted for the <hi>Expences</hi> of his Agency.</p>
               <p>In the Year, 1691. while he was yet in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> he wrote these Words, in a brief <hi>Account of his Negotiation,</hi> which he sent over to the Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Besides what was sent to me out of <hi>New-England,</hi> I Expended upwards of <hi>Two Hundred Pounds</hi> of my own Personal Estate, out of Love to that People. And I did for their sakes, borrow of a Merchant in <hi>London,</hi> above <hi>Three Hundred Pounds</hi> more, which it was Tow Years before Care was taken for the Repayment of it. The last Year, some who were hearty Well-wishers to <hi>New-England,</hi> wrote thither, That they must consider, how much depended on a suitable Supply; yet for more than a Twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month, not one Penny was returned; so that I was necessitated, either to suffer a Ruin to come upon the Country, or else must borrow Money again to Serve them; which I did, and engaged all the Estate I have in the World, for the Repayment thereof.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="unknown:002557_0175_0FDB6E7826FFF688"/>
Some time after this, there was Published a Venemous and Malicious Libel, by a mean Hand, instigated in part from the <hi>Invisible World,</hi> and well worthy to be Recommended unto the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke of the Lord,</hi> which was Entituled, <hi>More Wonders of the Invisible World.</hi> The Conscience of Duty to the <hi>Ninth Commandment</hi> of my GOD, as well as the <hi>Fifth,</hi> obliges me to Declare, (which I hope, I may d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <q>I am also told, that his great Friends Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, That I spent the Country a great deal of Money, during my Agency in their behalf. These little Men know not what it is, to attend in the Courts of Kings for Four Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: if they <hi>did,</hi> they would not make that Objection And sure I am, that when I did, at the desire of many Principal Persons in the Country, undertake a Voyage for <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>April.</hi> 1688. People in this <hi>Province</hi> would have given <hi>Ten times more</hi> than what I Expended in their Service, on condition they might have Restored and Confirmed unto them, what they

now Enjoy; yea, if it had been but in <hi>One Article</hi> of it. But besides this, I may truly affirm, that in Effect I served the Country on <hi>Free cost.</hi> For I never demanded the least Farthing as a Recompence for the Time I spent in attending on their Affairs; but instead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I procured in <hi>Donations</hi> for the public (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Privileges of the <hi>Charter</hi> itself, which, though not so great as I would have had, and as I would gladly have parted with all I have in this World for to have purchased, are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than what any other Plantations besides <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England</hi> enjoys: I say, Besides these Things. I procured in <hi>Donations</hi> to the Province and the College) at least <hi>Nine Hundred Pounds more than all the Expences of my Agency came to.</hi> This being plain <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> which the whole <hi>General Assembly</hi> once had before them, I suppose, all Reasonable men will own, That <hi>Reproaches</hi> cast on me, for my <hi>Expensiveness</hi> in the Public Service are most Ungrateful and Unworthy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But here, this <hi>Long Chapter</hi> shall have a <hi>Period;</hi> and, I hope, a <hi>Pardon.</hi> Only it seems I must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ask a <hi>Pardon</hi> also for the <hi>Agent,</hi> whose Actions I have been telling of. Some who have been vexed at good Things done by <hi>Ministers of the Gospel,</hi> have made mighty Clamours against <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> having any thing to do in <hi>Secular Affairs.</hi> But the <hi>Scripture</hi> which forbids <hi>Ministers</hi> to <hi>Entang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

as well as to that of <hi>Ministers.</hi> A <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,</hi> an <hi>Husbandman,</hi> a <hi>Merchant,</hi> may not so med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with <hi>State-Affairs,</hi> as to neglect the <hi>Personal Business</hi> which GOD has call'd them to. We may as well forbid <hi>Ministers,</hi> to Write any <hi>Books,</hi> but those of <hi>Pure Divinity,</hi> as forbid them all Cognisance of <hi>Secular Affairs</hi> on some Great and Just Occasions. A Speech of an Eminent Person once in the <hi>House of Lords</hi> observed, That no Reformed Church in the World, held that <hi>Ministers</hi> may not Intermeddle in <hi>Secular Affairs.</hi> He particularly mention'd <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> whose Influences very much governed the <hi>Council of State at Geneva: Brentius</hi> and <hi>Scultet,</hi> and <hi>Du moulin,</hi> and <hi>Rivet;</hi> and others who were <hi>Privy Counsellors</hi> to <hi>Princes.</hi> Tis true, <hi>Ministers</hi> usually have <hi>enough to do</hi> in attending to their <hi>Pastoral Charge;</hi> and the <hi>Ordaining</hi> of them to <hi>That,</hi> is a <hi>Filling of their Hand.</hi> They must <hi>Watch for Souls</hi> as those that must <hi>give an Account.</hi> But when without Injury to <hi>That,</hi> they do upon Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and Pressing <hi>Emergencies,</hi> apply their <hi>Superior Talents</hi> to some things of a <hi>Secular</hi> Importance, they do but what <hi>Honest Men</hi> ought to do. <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to do good,</hi> not only <hi>Legitimate</hi> the Application of their <hi>Capacities</hi> to do it, but also Oblige them and Require them to do it.</p>
               <p>Hence it is among the sayings of the great <hi>Selden: Tis a foolish Thing to say, A Minister must not meddle with Secular matters, because his own Profession will take up his whole man: May be not Eat, or Drink, or Walk, or Learn to Sing?

               <p>I <hi>Remember my Obligations.</hi> It was as long ago, as the Year, 1681. that I began to mention the Care of HARVARD-COLLEGE Devolved upon Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> and the Opportunities for <hi>Special Service,</hi> with which His Glorious Master therein favoured him.</p>
               <p>He Discharged his Trust, with a <hi>Diligence,</hi> and a <hi>Discretion,</hi> and a <hi>Fidelity,</hi> in his Weekly Visits to the Society, which found a General Acceptance; and the <hi>Commencements</hi> he also Managed, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a decent <hi>Orator</hi> and a Learned <hi>Moderator.</hi> His <hi>Commencement-</hi> Performances, were always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very much Admired! His Church refusing to Relinquish the Right they had in him, he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined for a while, to do the part of a <hi>Praesident,</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="unknown:002557_0195_0FDB6EA8E0A95BD0"/>
and got another chosen; upon whose Death in the Year, 1684. the <hi>Overseers</hi> with the <hi>Fellows</hi> of the College again Devolved his former Care upon him; Desiring him to act as, <hi>Praeses pro Tempore,</hi> till a further Settlement could be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
               <p>In that Station he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ound, when the <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the Colony was Destroy'd; but they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whose Hands the Government of the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory fell, Changing his Title from that of <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident</hi> into that of <hi>Rector,</hi> continued him in the Government of the <hi>College;</hi> where he set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to Prevent all <hi>Disorders,</hi> and Encourage <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Industry,</hi> and <hi>Erudition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he went over to <hi>England,</hi> he carried his Care of his beloved <hi>College</hi> with him. Among other Expressions of it (whereof some have been related,) he Procured some valuable <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> to it. Yea, it was <hi>His</hi> Acquaintance with, and <hi>His</hi> Proposal to, That Good-Spirited Man, and Lover of all Good Men, Mr. THOMAS HOLLIS, that Introduced his Benefactions unto that <hi>College;</hi> to which his Incomparable Bounty has anon flow'd unto such a Degree, as to render him the <hi>Greatest Benefactor</hi> it ever had in the World.</p>
               <p>Upon his Return to <hi>New-England,</hi> one of the first Things he did, was to Obtain from the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assembly</hi> of the Province, (what he was in <hi>England</hi> advis'd unto, when he began <hi>there</hi> to move towards Obtaining a <hi>Charter</hi> from the <hi>King</hi> for that purpose) <hi>An Act for the Incorporation of the College,</hi> upon a larger Foundation than the

By this Act, The <hi>College</hi> was enabled among other Things, to Confer <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,</hi> which could not by its former <hi>Charter</hi> be pretended to; and Particularly, to Create <hi>Batchelours,</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of <hi>Theology.</hi> At this Time, and while that <hi>Act</hi> was yet in Force, this <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity</hi> (as <hi>now</hi> it was) thought it their Duty to Present unto their Praesident, a <hi>Diploma</hi> for a <hi>Doctorate,</hi> under their <hi>Seal,</hi> with the Hands of the Fellows annexed; which being the <hi>First</hi> and the <hi>Sale</hi> Instance of such a Thing done in the whole English <hi>America,</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Fate</hi> of the <hi>College</hi> after this, belongs not unto our Story. The <hi>Care</hi> which the <hi>Doctor</hi> took of it will. He required a Conforming to the <hi>Statutes</hi> of the College, with a Stedy <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and Faithful <hi>Discipline.</hi> He gave the Students his Directions about their <hi>Studies!</hi> He advised them what <hi>Books</hi> they should cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Converse withal, and caution'd them against such as might <hi>Poison</hi> their Young Minds, and give them a <hi>Taint</hi> which they must Sweat out if ever the Churches of GOD had any Real Service from them. He kept alive the <hi>Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the Batchelours, in which he Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; and assigned them especially such <hi>Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> as I d them to an Establishment in the <hi>Truths</hi> which the <hi>Temptations of the Day</hi> rendred most needful to be Defended. He usually <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> unto the Scholars every Week, <hi>Sermons</hi> on such Subjects as he thought most useful for them, and in a manner, Calculated for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of such as would of him Learn to be <hi>True Preachers of the Gospel.</hi> And sometimes he Illuminated the <hi>College-Hall</hi> with Elaborate Expositions. It was also a frequent Custom with him, and how worthy of <hi>Imitation!</hi>—to send
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:002557_0198_0FDB6EAED18F8F48"/>
for the <hi>Scholars</hi> one by one into the <hi>Library,</hi> and there confer with them about their <hi>Interiour State,</hi> and Quicken their Flight unto their SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, and invite them into the Dispositions and Resolutions of Serious PIETY; and lay the Solemn Charges of GOD upon them to Turn and Live unto Him; and sometimes bestow <hi>Pious Treatises</hi> upon them. Some of them will Bless GOD all their Days, for these Admonitions; and will <hi>never forget the Words that Quickened them.</hi> Thus Dr. <hi>Mather did continually!</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it was needful, and much for the Welfare and Honour of the <hi>College,</hi> to take it out of the Hands of such a <hi>Praesident!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were some Disaffected Men who for some Reasons, [<hi>GOD knows, what they were,</hi>] were willing to have the <hi>College</hi> taken out of Dr. <hi>Mathers</hi> hands.

Twenty Years after his beginning to serve that Society in Quality of a PRAESIDENT. And I think, It will do no Hurt for me, to mention a Passage which he

wrote on this Occasion; <hi>I have received more Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in the Work of GOD from those whom I have laid under the greatest Obligations, than by all the World besides.

Tis true, Tis an <hi>Honourable Calling</hi> which you are Entring upon. To be <hi>Embassadors of CHRIST</hi> who is the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> is to be in an <hi>Honourable Station.</hi> The greatest Persons on Earth, have not thought it Beneath them, to <hi>Preach</hi> the Word of the GOD of Heaven. The <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and as Great a <hi>King</hi> as ever they had, is called, <hi>The Preacher.</hi> Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Writers Affirm, <hi>Titus</hi> to have been one of a Noble Extraction among the <hi>Cretians.</hi> And since the Reformation, what was <hi>George</hi> the Prince of <hi>Anhalt?</hi> What was the Lord of <hi>Chandieu,</hi> who goes under the Hebrew Name of <hi>Sadeel?</hi> What was <hi>John Alasco?</hi> Yea, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Enriched</hi> is that Man, whose Business it is, <hi>To Preach the Unsearchable Riches of CHRIST!</hi> But you must not propose the <hi>Honours</hi> of This World, in what you undertake.

Your <hi>Special Advantages</hi> to Serve CHRIST, which Ministers have above other men; <hi>Here</hi> let there

No, They could say, <hi>We Preach not our selves but CHRIST JESUS the Lord.</hi> What were the <hi>Pauline</hi> Sermons! We read, <hi>He Preached those things which concern the Lord JESUS CHRIST.</hi> Alas, There are <hi>Preachers</hi> in the World, who have little of a CHRIST in their <hi>Sermons;</hi> A <hi>Morality</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Gospel</hi> of CHRIST, is all that is to be found in their <hi>Sermons:</hi> Nothing higher than what is to be mett withal in a <hi>Cicero,</hi> a <hi>Seneca,</hi> an <hi>Epictetus,</hi> or a <hi>Plutarch,</hi> is to be found in their <hi>Sermons. Nomen CHRISTI non est ibi!</hi> Nay, They count it a Disparagement unto their <hi>Sermons,</hi> to have the Name of CHRIST often mention'd in them. How unlike are such, unto that Servant of the Lord, who has the Name of CHRIST, no less than <hi>Ten Times</hi> in the Ten first Verses of his first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians?</hi> CHRIST! How <hi>Copious</hi> the Subject! How <hi>Sublime!</hi> There is matter enough in it for your Meditation all the Days of your Lives. Do not Neglect by any means to Preach on the <hi>Glories,</hi> the <hi>Person,</hi> the <hi>Offices,</hi> the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and the <hi>Benefits</hi> of CHRIST; and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest which He indeed has in <hi>Every Article</hi>

of our Holy Religion. <hi>Know the Truth as it is in</hi> JESUS! Wherefore,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Have an Eye still on a CHRIST, even when you are Preaching on <hi>other Subjects.</hi> We may not think, that if a Man Preaches on Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects wherein CHRIST is not Immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd unto, CHRIST &amp; the Gospel is not Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them: But This I will say unto you. <hi>Other Subjects</hi> are to be Preached on; and yet still in all, a CHRIST is to be Repaired unto. The <hi>Evil of Sin</hi> is to be Preached upon; The <hi>Misery</hi> of Man fallen by <hi>Sin,</hi> is to be Preached upon. But it must be to Lead the Hearers unto the CHRIST, who is the Mighty and Only SAVIOUR of <hi>Sinners.</hi> The <hi>Moral Law</hi> is to be Preached upon as the Rule of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to GOD. The Duties of <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> are to be Preached upon. But the <hi>Example</hi> of a CHRIST Observing the <hi>Law,</hi> and a <hi>Manuduction</hi> to <hi>Him</hi> for our <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence</hi> and <hi>Acceptance</hi> in all we do, is always to Accompany it. Remember, The <hi>Life</hi> of your Preaching will be according to what there is of a CHRIST, who is, <hi>The Life,</hi> shining in it.</p>
                  <p>If you do thus <hi>Glorify</hi> CHRIST, GOD even His Eternal FATHER, will take it kindly from you. For there is nothing so <hi>Dear</hi> to HIM, as that <hi>Son of His Love.</hi> His CHRIST is <hi>Dearer</hi> to Him than all the Men on Earth; <hi>Dearer</hi> to Him than all the Angles in Heaven; <hi>Dearer</hi> to Him, than all the Worlds, which are the Works of His Hands; yea, tis for HIM that
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:002557_0203_0FDB6EB6461F94C8"/>
He has made them all. He <hi>Delights</hi> exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to see His CHRIST <hi>Glorified;</hi> and if this be what your Hearts are set upon, He will <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> you Wonderfully! You will have this Glorious Reward among the rest; That you will have His Holy SPIRIT Powerfully and Marvellously Breathing in your Ministry. An Eminent Scotch Divine, hearing a Young Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister Preach an <hi>Elaborate Sermon;</hi> when he Commended the Sermon, yet Complained of it; <hi>I wanted one Thing; I wanted the</hi> SPIRIT of GOD, <hi>that was not so sensible and apparent in it.</hi> You will take an <hi>Excellent way,</hi> [<hi>Behold, I shew unto you an Excellent way!</hi>] to escape this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint upon your Services. <hi>The SPIRIT of Truth will Glorify me,</hi> Saith our SAVIOUR. That Holy SPIRIT will sadly withdraw from the Ministry that has not a CHRIST animating of it. No doubt, This may be the very cause, why an <hi>Unsuccessful Ministry</hi> is become so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally a matter of Observation and of <hi>Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, <hi>My Children,</hi> what shall I say more unto you? I hope, that as to <hi>many</hi> of you, [<hi>Oh! That it might be All of you!</hi>] I shall meet you with Joy, at the Right Hand of CHRIST, in the <hi>Great Day</hi> of <hi>His Appearing and His Kingdom,</hi> when both you and I shall Rejoce, that ever He brought and placed me among you. But, if any of you, who are the Students in the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> prove so Miserable, as to <hi>Dy in your Sins,</hi> and in a <hi>Christless Condition,</hi> I earnesty Protest unto you <hi>this Day,</hi> that I shall Testify against

you before the Lord JESUS CHRIST in <hi>That Day,</hi> that I have called upon you both Publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Privately, to make sure of an Interest in Him. I am now Pure from the Blood of your Souls; If any of you (which <hi>Mercy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent!</hi>) shall <hi>Dy in your Sins,</hi> your Blood will be upon your own Unhappy Heads. <hi>I have done the part of a Faithful Father to you!.</hi>

Now it is worth our Enquiry, whether it may not be Ascribed unto the <hi>Abscence of CHRIST</hi> in our Sermons. And what Reason indeed can we have, to expect the Presence and Influence of the SPIRIT of CHRIST, if we leave His Person, His Offices, His Grace, and His Gospel out of our Discourses, or give but a slight and casual Hint at these Glorious Subjects, which ought to be our daily Theme!</q>

               <p>§. 1. His <hi>Purpose and manner of Life,</hi> is Exactly Described, in a Book about <hi>Holiness,</hi> which was Written by him, Twenty Years before he Died. In that Book he offers Admirable Rules for

Growth towards a <hi>Perfection of Holiness in the Fear of GOD:</hi> which he Introduces with say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I shall not set before you Directions impossible to be followed, or heavy Burdens which I would be lothe myself to touch.</hi> No, we saw his <hi>Rules</hi> Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily Exemplified. But his <hi>Daily Course</hi> may be enquired after. Besides his <hi>Patient Continuance,</hi> in that stroke of <hi>Well-doing,</hi> which lay in his course of setting apart <hi>whole Days</hi> for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Closet,</hi> and which he continued until the last Year of his Life was coming on: His <hi>Daily Course</hi> was This: And what a Grateful <hi>Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle to Angels</hi> in it!</p>
               <p>In the Morning repairing to his Study, (where his Custom was to sit up very late, even <hi>until</hi> Midnight, and perhaps <hi>after</hi> it) he deliberately Read a <hi>Chapter,</hi> and made a <hi>Prayer,</hi> and them plied what of Reading and Writing he had before him. At Nine a Clock he came down, and Read a <hi>Chapter</hi> and made a <hi>Prayer,</hi> with his Family. He then returned unto the <hi>Work of the Study.</hi> Coming down to <hi>Dinner,</hi> he quickly went up again, and begun the Afternoon with another <hi>Prayer.</hi> There he went on with the <hi>Work of the Study</hi> till the Evening. Then with another <hi>Prayer</hi> he again went unto his Father; after which he did more at the <hi>Work of the Study.</hi> At Nine a Clock he came down to his <hi>Family-Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</hi> Then he went up again to the <hi>Work of the Study;</hi> which anon he Concluded with another <hi>Prayer;</hi> And so he betook himself unto his Repose.</p>

In the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the Day, what there fell short of the Number, in the <hi>Hundred and Sixty fourth</hi> Verse of the <hi>Hundred and Nineteenth</hi> Psalm, was doubtless made up with Numberless <hi>Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>—Of such <hi>Ejaculatory Prayers,</hi> no doubt, is to be understood, what Antiquity reports of the Apostle <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> That he Pray'd one <hi>Hundred Times</hi> in a Day; and of one <hi>Paulus,</hi> That he did it <hi>Three Hundred Times.</hi> I can't say, That this our <hi>Eusebius</hi> had so many <hi>Ejaculatory Prayers</hi> as these come to, But he was the <hi>Happy Man,</hi> that had his <hi>Quiver full</hi> of them!</p>
               <p>He commonly spent <hi>Sixteen Hours</hi> of the Four and Twenty, in his <hi>Laborious Hive!</hi> Being very much of <hi>Thomas Akempis</hi> his Mind, <hi>Nus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Requiem invenio nisi in Libro et in claustro.</hi> He was <hi>There,</hi> some thought <hi>even to a Fault.</hi> More of his <hi>Pastoral Visits</hi> were wished for.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Unto a Good Man there once came that Message from Heaven; <hi>Thy Prayers and thy Alms are come up for a Memorial before GOD.</hi> This Good Mans did so! His <hi>Devotions</hi> towards GOD, were accompanied with his <hi>Benignities</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men; And these Two, filled his Life with <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> and assured him a share in the <hi>Royal Preisthood.</hi> It was the <hi>Doctors</hi> Perswasion, That though our GOD is to have our All used for Him, there was a <hi>Special Portion</hi> of his Revenues, which was more <hi>Immediately</hi> and more <hi>Explicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to be Devoted unto <hi>Pious Uses:</hi> A S<hi>pecial Portion</hi> to be so set apart for GOD, and be so <hi>the Lords,</hi> that it would be a <hi>Sacriledge</hi> to Spend
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:002557_0208_0FDB6EC242D449F8"/>
it in any other than those which may be called, <hi>Pious Uses.</hi> Concerning this <hi>Portion of GOD</hi> it was his Perswasion, That a <hi>Tenth Part</hi> of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, was the least, that could go for the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> He thought, That since there is a <hi>Part</hi> which is <hi>the Lords,</hi> it is but proper, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of <hi>what part</hi> it shall be, should be left unto the <hi>Lord.</hi> It was his Opinion, That our own <hi>Carnal Heart,</hi> is no <hi>Competent Judge,</hi> to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine <hi>What</hi> and <hi>When</hi> the Revenues which our GOD has given us, are to do for <hi>Him.</hi> Now, if GOD ever did fix any part, it was plain to him, that nothing lower than a <hi>Tenth</hi> was ever fixed by Him. As with out <hi>Time,</hi> it was not left unto our Arbitrary Fancy, to <hi>take our own Time</hi> for the Worship of our GOD, but He Himself Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, <hi>I will have a Seventh Part of your Time En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely mine;</hi> So tis with our <hi>Wealth:</hi> It is not left unto our own <hi>Humour,</hi> to say, <hi>How much He shall have.</hi> He has Determined, <hi>A Tenth Part of the Wealth flowing in upon you shall be mine.</hi> It seems, the Good GOD, who with a <hi>Seventh Day</hi> will be owned as the <hi>Creator,</hi> will with a <hi>Tenth Part</hi> be own'd as the <hi>Possessor,</hi> of all things. He was aware, That even the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> taught the Ancient Pagans to <hi>Decimate</hi> for <hi>Pious Uses.</hi> He could levy a whole Army of Authors, to carry this cause; <hi>Decima quaeque Veteres Diis Suis Offere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant.</hi> And he thought it strange for <hi>Christians</hi> to do less for our GOD, than <hi>Pagans</hi> did for theirs. <hi>They</hi> built upon This; A <hi>Tenth</hi> is the <hi>least part</hi> in any Division of Numbers: The lowest is that of <hi>Unites;</hi> and less than a <hi>Tenth</hi> is less than
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:002557_0209_0FDB6EC49495A740"/>
what all Nations make the <hi>least.</hi> And he thought, shall not our GOD have so much as the <hi>Least</hi> of the Revenues, whereof we owe so <hi>much</hi> unto Him? The <hi>Light of Scripture</hi> was that which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and fully Satisfied him. Our Father <hi>Jacob</hi> said, <hi>The Lord shall be my GOD, and of all that thou shalt give me, I will give the Tenth unto Thee.</hi> He thought, one way of his owning <hi>the Lord for his GOD,</hi> &amp; approving himself an <hi>Israelite indeed,</hi> would be, <hi>To give the Tenth unto Him.</hi> Yea, when he considered, That our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> did pay unto <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> the <hi>Tenth</hi> of all; And that our Lord JESUS is a <hi>Priest forever after the Order of Melchizedek;</hi> he felt the Force of this Argument upon it. The <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedek,</hi> belong to our Blessed JESUS, the Royal <hi>High-Priest</hi> concern'd in the Heavens for us: The <hi>Tenths</hi> were the <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Melchizedek;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Tenths</hi> belong to our JESUS. I have heard the <hi>Doctor</hi> say, <hi>That he look'd upon this as an Argument that could not be answered!</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, he Conscienciously and Constantly Devoted a <hi>Tenth Part</hi> of his Income to <hi>Pious Uses.</hi> But this was <hi>the least:</hi> He often did much more than so. I find in one Paper of his Accounts, [For he kept unto the Maxim, <hi>Noli Decimas dare per Conjecturas:</hi>] That in One Year, he laid out upon <hi>Pious Uses,</hi> no less than <hi>Twenty four Pounds</hi> above the <hi>Tenth Part</hi> of his whole Income that Year, taking in <hi>Donations</hi> as well as his more <hi>Stated Salary.</hi> Besides which, the Generous Things which he often did for the <hi>Widows</hi> and <hi>Orphans</hi> of Ministers, by ordering them to be the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:002557_0210_0FDB6EC616E586C8"/>
of the <hi>Gratuities,</hi> which the Bereaved Churches on whom he bestow'd his Labours would have Presented <hi>him</hi> withal, times that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be numbred; and by Remitting what was owing to him from <hi>such,</hi> when the <hi>College</hi> allow'd him some of their <hi>Debts,</hi> for a Recompence of his Labours there; These are Things that <hi>never came into his Reckoning.</hi> He knew, <hi>who's</hi> they would one Day come into! He had a <hi>Bountiful Eye, a Liberal Soul,</hi> a Tender Compassion for the Miserable. A Noble Demonstration did he give, That they who do <hi>Good Works</hi> BECAUSE they are already <hi>Justified,</hi> will not come short of those who do <hi>Good Works</hi> THAT THEY MAY be <hi>Justified;</hi> and, That they who Renounce all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to <hi>Merit</hi> by their <hi>Good Works,</hi> will more abound in <hi>Good Works</hi> than the greatest <hi>Merit-Mongers</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p>§. 3. It is Required of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> That he be, <hi>A Man of Good Behaviour.</hi> Our Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> thinks, part of the meaning may be, that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister must not be <hi>Slovenly,</hi> not of such an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly Carriage</hi> as may bring his calling into Contempt.

<pb n="186" facs="unknown:002557_0211_0FDB6EC9F69B5308"/>
this Character; and it was a Remark which I have heard so often made upon him; that I could not well avoid just a Touch upon it; That he was one of a very <hi>Gentlemanly Behaviour;</hi> full of <hi>Gravity,</hi> with all the Handsom <hi>Carriage,</hi> as well as <hi>Neatness,</hi> of a <hi>Gentleman;</hi> and though his Conversation lay sometimes with Persons of the First Quality, he was never Charged with an <hi>Indecency.</hi> He was at the same time a great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to, and Censurer of, <hi>Loquacity. His Words</hi> were <hi>Few,</hi> as <hi>Wise Mens</hi> use to be; and much on the <hi>Guard, (Bis prius ad Limam quam semel ad Linguam;</hi>) Pertinent, and Ponderous, and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible.</hi> It may be, I am upon too small a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and so <hi>my Words</hi> also shall be but <hi>Few</hi> upon it.</p>
               <p>§. 4. But what? Am I Describing one of them whose D<hi>welling is not with Flesh?</hi> I <hi>don't</hi> pretend unto it. Sr. <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> when he mention'd his <hi>Father</hi> commonly did it in those Terms, <hi>That Best of Men my Father.</hi> None Faulted <hi>him.</hi> And yet I durst not come up to those <hi>Terms.</hi> Let us then hear of <hi>all</hi> his <hi>Humane Frailties.</hi> Nay, No occasion for <hi>That</hi> neither! But some tell me, That a <hi>Life</hi> which only flourishes on the <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Praises</hi> of the Person Written of, and shows only the <hi>Bright side</hi> of the Object, is not so Edifying or so Acceptable, or so Comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as a more <hi>Impartial Story,</hi> and a fair <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Infirmities.</hi> Well, Then, you shall have <hi>something</hi> of it, and as much as tis fit for <hi>me</hi> to give you of it. An Hundred witty Speeches of

If I do, it will be an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Demonstration of the <hi>Impartiality,</hi> the <hi>Fidelity,</hi> the <hi>Integrity,</hi> with which our History is carried on. But <hi>That</hi> which finally Determines me to do it, is, The Regard which I <hi>Owe,</hi> and which, I hope, I shall ever <hi>Pay,</hi> to that more <hi>Substantial</hi> PIETY, which we are forever to insist upon.</p>
               <p>What, <hi>what</hi> is the meaning of that <hi>Particular Faith,</hi> about <hi>Future Events,</hi> with which the <hi>Prayerful Servants</hi> of GOD, sometimes find their Minds <hi>Irradiated,</hi> and Marvellously perswaded and Comforted, in their Prayers before Him? There is a <hi>Praying in Faith,</hi> which is the <hi>Duty</hi> of every Christian in all his <hi>Prayers;</hi> An entire Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness</hi> of the Glorious GOD, and in the <hi>Mediation</hi> of the Blessed JESUS; and so an Hopeful Expectation of such Blessings as our <hi>Advocate in the Heavens</hi> will please to Procure and Order for us. But then, there is a <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Faith,</hi> which is not so much the <hi>Duty,</hi> as the <hi>Comfort</hi> of them that have it; and which is Granted, but <hi>here</hi> and <hi>there,</hi> but <hi>now</hi> and <hi>then,</hi> unto those whom a <hi>Sovereign</hi> GOD shall Please to Favour with it. The Devout Believer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cause himself to Believe <hi>What</hi> and <hi>When</hi> he will; but under the <hi>Energy</hi> of some <hi>Superiour Cause,</hi> when he is on his knees, [or Perhaps, <hi>Prostrate in the Dust,</hi>] before the Lord, there is a Strong <hi>Impression</hi> made upon his mind; which Dissolves him in a Flood of Tears, and Assures him, <hi>Thou shalt have the Petition which thou De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest

[Reader, <hi>I am only carrying on the History now on the Anvil, in all of this!</hi>] It were perhaps as easy for me to give unto a Man born Blind, an Idaea of <hi>Light,</hi> and of the <hi>Colours</hi> made by it, as for me to Describe in Words unto the Understanding of a <hi>Stranger</hi>—<hi>How it is!</hi> But you may have some Illustration of it in what our Martyrology has related con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Blessed Martyr, Mr. <hi>Holland.</hi> 
                  <q>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sentence was Read against him, he said,—<hi>And now I tell you, that</hi> GOD hath heard the Prayer <hi>of His Servants, which hath been Poured forth</hi> with Tears, <hi>for His Afflicted Saints, which you daily Persecute. This I dare be bold in GOD to Speak; and I am by</hi> His Spirit <hi>moved to say it: That GOD will shorten your Hand of Cruelty: For after this Day in this place, there shall be no mor put unto the Trial of Fire and Faggot.</hi> Which accordingly came to pass; He was the
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:002557_0216_0FDB6ED74A14A870"/>
last that was Burnt in <hi>Smithfield.</hi>
                  </q> You may see it a little further Illustrated in the Strange <hi>Affla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which have Enabled and Impelled many Confessors of CHRIST in the Renoumed Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> sometimes to break forth into Passages that might be Expected from none but such as have Illapses of the <hi>Prophetic Spirit</hi> upon them.</p>
               <p>—I Enquire, [<hi>But not of Thee,</hi> O Natural Man; <hi>For, thou art no Competent Judge of the matter!</hi>] what is the Meaning of this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>Whence</hi> comes it? <hi>Who</hi> gives it? How far is it akin to the <hi>Faith of Miracles?</hi> or, is it all a meer Delusion?</p>
               <p>Verily, It looks very like an Operation of the HOLY SPIRIT, wherein His ANGELS may be His <hi>Ministers</hi> and His <hi>Instruments.</hi> However, it may Remonstrate, <hi>The Proud have greatly had me in Derision.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, what shall we say, about the <hi>Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments,</hi> that (<hi>as they say</hi>) have sometimes made this <hi>Particular Faith</hi> to appear no other, than an <hi>Over-heated Fancy,</hi> and left the Subjects of it, in <hi>Distresses</hi> and <hi>Confusions</hi> that must needs be very uneasy Ones? I make no doubt, that there have been Relations of such <hi>Disappointments,</hi> which have had little Foundation for them. <hi>I know very well,</hi> That when a Person has been <hi>Praying</hi> for a <hi>Complication of Blessings,</hi> and in the Ardours of Supplication, there have dropt from him only some Words of this Importance, <hi>Our GOD has graciously heard us, and will surely do us Good;</hi> the <hi>Unwary</hi> (and it may be, some
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:002557_0217_0FDB6ED90A4B1220"/>
of them worse than meerly <hi>Unwary</hi>) Hearers have run away with a <hi>Notion,</hi> and made a very <hi>Formal and Punctual Story</hi> upon it; That the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Declared himself <hi>Assured</hi> of having Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>All and Each of the Blessings</hi> that have been asked; and one of them failing, all the whole <hi>Particular Faith</hi> remains only to be Laugh'd at. This was doubtless the very case, in a <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and Punctual Story,</hi> which some of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Histories</hi> employ their Banter and Burlesque upon. Yea, I am ready to think, That some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Supplicants</hi> themselves have procured some <hi>Distresses</hi> and <hi>Confusions</hi> to themselves by not Attending well to the <hi>Terms of the Impression</hi> made upon their Minds, and carrying the <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> beyond what they should have done, or what was <hi>Necessary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is now Time for me to Observe, That the Instances of a <hi>Particular Faith,</hi> wherewith Dr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was Distinguished, were very Various and Wondrous. Of these I have told <hi>Some</hi> in the foregoing <hi>History;</hi> [and if I had <hi>not,</hi> the caution of this <hi>Paragraph,</hi> had not been so Needful to be Introduced:] And I could insert <hi>Many more,</hi> if it were Proper to treat the Public, with such <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal</hi> or <hi>Domestic</hi> Matters: And, <hi>All Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!</hi>—</p>
               <p>—But <hi>One;</hi>—And that was <hi>This.</hi> After his last Return to <hi>New-England,</hi> he had a Strange <hi>Impression</hi> on his Mind, <hi>That he should yet have an Opportunity to do Special Service for CHRIST in</hi> England. The <hi>Impression</hi> was <hi>many times</hi> very strongly made upon him, for diverse Months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:002557_0218_0FDB6EDA511C4B78"/>
And even at such <hi>times</hi> as one would suppose least Obnoxious to <hi>Satanic</hi> Illusions. But yet,—He never saw <hi>England</hi> any more. Now, what shall we make of This? Will it be enough to say, That he <hi>Misinterpreted</hi> his own <hi>Impression,</hi> when he thought it must needs imply, his own going <hi>in Person</hi> to the other side of the <hi>Atlantic?</hi> But that <hi>this very Book</hi> may sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Accomplish the Praediction? Or, shall we say, what he himself wrote upon it; <q>As for the <hi>Impression,</hi> I have had concerning my <hi>Doing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for GOD</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> I <hi>know not what to think of it.</hi> Such Things are often from <hi>Angels:</hi> And I sometimes think, that <hi>Angles</hi> may be Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of some <hi>Future Events;</hi> but may cause Motions on the Spirits of Men, according to what will in <hi>Probability</hi> come to pass. I am Desirous to Dy where I am. No quaestion but <hi>Jacob</hi> thought, that he should return again to the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and that <hi>Joseph</hi> should out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live him there. [<hi>Gen.</hi> XLVI. 4.] Whereas, the Promise was made Good, when his Body was Buried in that Land, and his <hi>Posterity</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned thither. However it shall be as to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, I hope, my Son <hi>Samuel</hi> will do Service for the Name of CHRIST in <hi>England;</hi> which is in some sort as if I did so: And <hi>Books</hi> of mine Published there, will be Serviceable to the Kingdom of GOD.</q> One thing which a little Emboldened, that stroke about the <hi>Angels,</hi> was, that about the Time, when the <hi>Impression</hi> was in its Liveliest Operation, [<hi>October</hi> 1694.] there was among some in his Neighbourhood, a strange
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:002557_0219_0FDB6EDBC8012220"/>
Descent of <hi>Shining Spirits,</hi> that had upon them great marks of their being such <hi>Angels</hi> as they Declared, themselves to be. [What they were, <hi>GOD knows!</hi>] And from these there was that Message (and, <hi>no more!</hi>) directed unto him; <hi>He is much Exercised in his Mind about his going for</hi> England; <hi>but he need not and should not be so; For GOD will bring to pass That which will be most for His Glory and Service; And the Angels of GOD will attend him, wheresoever His Providence may dispose of him.</hi> I might say This more upon it. No less than <hi>Thrice Seven Years</hi> after this <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi> and after a long <hi>Sentence of Death</hi> had been Written upon it (as there generally is for a while, upon every Thing that a <hi>Particular Faith</hi> has laid hold upon) he had <hi>an Opportunity</hi> to Return for <hi>England,</hi> and there to do <hi>Special Service for CHRIST,</hi> Surprizingly thrown into his Hands. The Ministers of the Province, by their Delegates met at <hi>Boston, [April.</hi> 1715.] and Unanimously desired him, to take a Voyage for <hi>England,</hi> with an <hi>Address</hi> from them, to our Lawful and Rightful King GEORGE, whose Accession to the Throne gave an Universal Joy to a Country Proportionably fuller of Subjects well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected unto Him, than any part of His Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; as also to Establish and Cultivate a Good Correspondence between the Churches of this Country, and the <hi>United Brethren</hi> on the other side of the <hi>Great and Wide Sea,</hi> And there was a Provision made, for the <hi>Expences</hi> of the Voyage. But, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he <hi>himself</hi> now Declined it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="unknown:002557_0220_0FDB6EDFAB82EE68"/>
After all, I will freely Confess what I <hi>most of all chuse to say.</hi> There might be Danger, lest some Inconsiderate Christians, when they Read the Life of Dr. <hi>Mather,</hi> might be as many have been, when they have Read the Life of Dr. <hi>Winter</hi> unawares led into, an Indiscrete <hi>Affectation</hi> of <hi>Extraordinaries,</hi> and <hi>Singularities,</hi> in the Course of their <hi>Devotions.</hi> This is a Thing that may have Perillous Consequences! Whereas now, if they find such a Man as Dr. <hi>Mather,</hi> once Plunged into such <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Perplexities,</hi> in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of a <hi>Particular Faith,</hi> as left him very much in the Dark about it, and Compell'd him to say, <hi>I know not what to think of it:</hi> This <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> will be so Discouraged in them, that they will suffer no Danger from it.</p>
               <p>If I may be thought Worthy to offer my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice upon the whole, I would humbly say; <hi>Christians,</hi> Reproach not a <hi>Particular Faith</hi> as if there never were a <hi>Gracious Work of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> in it. But yet he Caution'd against lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much stress upon it, lest you find your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves incautelously Plunged into an <hi>Hope that will make ashamed.</hi> A <hi>Particular Faith</hi> may be a <hi>Work of God;</hi> But the <hi>Counterfeits</hi> of this <hi>Jewel</hi> are so very fine, that it will require a <hi>Judgment,</hi> almost <hi>more than Humane</hi> to Discern them. It is best not being too fond of <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasms,</hi> that may carry you beyond the <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the Day.</hi> It is best that you should be Content with the <hi>Ordinary Satisfaction</hi> of

                  <hi>Praying</hi> and so <hi>Waiting</hi> for the Blessings of GOD in such Pious <hi>Resignations</hi> to <hi>His</hi> Will, and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilations</hi> of your <hi>own,</hi> as an <hi>Uncertainty about Issues</hi> would most properly lead you to.</p>

                  <hi>Old Age</hi> came on. But what an one? How Bright! How Wise! How Strong!

from him! The Churches would not permitt an <hi>Ordination</hi> to be carried on without him, as long as he was able to Trayel in a Coach unto them.</p>
               <p>Though in the Praefaces of the useful Books which he now Published, he Repeated an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grantable Request</hi> unto his Friends, <hi>No longer to Pray for his Life;</hi> They only Pray'd the more for it. When he had finished <hi>Forty nine Years</hi> of his Public Ministry, he Preached a Sermon full of Rare and Rich Thoughts upon, <hi>A Jubille;</hi> And he requested for a Dismission from any further Public Labours. His Flock Prized them too much, to hear of <hi>That:</hi> But anon, when they saw the Proper Time, for it, that they might render his <hi>Old Age</hi> as <hi>easy</hi> as might be to him, they <hi>Wisely</hi> and <hi>Kindly</hi> Voted it, <hi>That the Labours of the Pulpit should be expected from him, only when he should find himself able and inclin'd for them.</hi>—It would be no strange thing, if while he wanted yet <hi>some Years</hi> to reach <hi>Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score,</hi> there should be found some little thing that might carry something of <hi>Senile Weakness</hi> in it. But, he held it unto <hi>Four score</hi> in a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Exercise of his <hi>Intellectual Powers,</hi> and with <hi>Public Ministrations</hi> to very Great Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, which his Ministry continued still to give the greatest Satisfaction to. A Treatise, which he Published about this Time, concerning <hi>An Hoary Head found in the Way of Righteousness,</hi> notably Described what he <hi>was himself,</hi> and as notably Declared, what he was yet <hi>able to do.</hi> He continued Preaching to vast Assemblies; and
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:002557_0223_0FDB6EE40259F978"/>
such well-composed <hi>Sermons,</hi> that the Notes taken by some <hi>Ready Writers</hi> after him, when Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto the Public by the way of the <hi>Press</hi> found their Acceptance in the Churches: Among which <hi>Ready Writers,</hi> we owe our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Thanks to a Vertuous Gentlewoman, whose <hi>Exquisite Pen</hi> help'd several of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises into the World: in some sort as the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Lady <hi>Rich</hi> did the most Valuable and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Book of Mr. <hi>Strong,</hi> on, <hi>The Covenant.</hi> Yea, and even <hi>After Fourscore</hi> the old <hi>Prophetic Strain</hi> had not forsaken him.</p>
               <p>In <hi>September</hi> 1720. he Preached an awful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon [from <hi>Amos</hi> III. 7.] on this Doctrine; <hi>When GOD has an Holy purpose to Visit His People with Great Judgments, He uses to give them Notice and Warning of it before Hand.</hi> In the Conclusion he exprestly foretold, First, <hi>That an heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Impending over</hi> Boston, <hi>that would speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be Executed.</hi> And then, <hi>That the Churches of the Country were near to some shaking Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> He added; <hi>My Brethren, I take no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in Testifying unto you of Evil Days. But when the Word of the Lord is like a Fire in a Mans Bones, there must be something said, that may A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken you out of your Security.</hi> Now, within a few Months after this, the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> was brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Boston,</hi> and within as few Months more the <hi>Besome of Destruction</hi> swept away near a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand People. And how <hi>Strangely</hi> was way made for the <hi>Destroying Angle</hi> to do his Execution!</p>
               <p>But let me not Anticipate. I am saying, That <hi>until Four score</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> held it unto Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!

And on the Day of his Attaining to <hi>Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score,</hi> he Preached a Sermon full of Light and Life, on those Words, Ezek. XVI. 5. <hi>The Day when thou wast Born.</hi> They that wrote after him, have Printed it. The, <hi>Mens et Ratio et Consilium,</hi> which are by <hi>Cicero</hi> mention'd as the Praerogatives of <hi>Old Age,</hi> were found in him to an uncommon Degree. On very many Accounts he might have said, as old <hi>Georgias</hi> did, <hi>Nihil habeo propter quod Senectutem meam accusem;</hi> Yea, as a Better Man, Old <hi>Drusius</hi> did, <hi>Senectus mihi melior quam ipsa Juventus.</hi> But that which most of all gave him a Comfortable <hi>Old Age,</hi> was what <hi>Calvin</hi> who did not Live to <hi>Old Age,</hi> well pitches on, as the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Comfort of <hi>Old Age: Tenendum est, proecipuam partem</hi> Bonae Senectutis, <hi>in bona Conscientia, Animo<expan>

                  <hi>O Quam continuis, et quantis plena Senectus Longa Malis!—</hi>
               </p>
               <p>but also caused him several times to say to me, <hi>Be sure, you don't pray, that you may Live beyond Fourscore!</hi> Yet Now, he Preach'd nobly on, <hi>An Old Disciple:</hi> as well as many other Subjects.</p>
               <p>And NOW, He that had wished for, <hi>Sufferings FOR the Lord,</hi> must be content with, <hi>Sufferings FROM the Lord.</hi> Even <hi>These</hi> born with the <hi>Faith and Patience of the Saints</hi> have a sort of <hi>Martyrdom</hi> in them, and will add unto the <hi>far more exceeding and Eternal Weight of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>Sept.</hi> 25. he did with an Excellent and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic Prayer, in a mighty Auditory, Conclude a <hi>Day of Prayer</hi> kept by his Church, to obtain a <hi>Good Success</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the growth of Real and Vital PIETY, with Plentiful Effusions
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:002557_0226_0FDB6EEBB9C8E478"/>
of the Good SPIRIT, especially upon the <hi>Rising Generation.</hi> Within Two Days after This, he fell into an <hi>Apoplectic</hi> sort of <hi>Deliquium;</hi> (very much occasion'd, as it was thought, by too extreme a concern of his Mind on some late Occurrences at <hi>New-Haven:</hi>) out of which he Recovered in a few Minutes; but it so enfeebled him, that he never went abroad any more.</p>
               <p>However, His <hi>Wisdom yet remained with him.</hi> And while it was yet in its unexceptionable Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays, there were a few <hi>Questions</hi> put unto him, whereto his <hi>Answers</hi> were immediately written down; and shall he now Produced. <hi>Homer</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to a Dying Man, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> Let <hi>such a Speech</hi> now have thy Best Attention.</p>
               <p>It was asked; <q>What he thought about the Controversy agitated between our <hi>United Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> in <hi>England?</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He answered; <hi>I wish they would agree upon some effectual Method, that the Regards</hi> of Brethren in CHRIST, <hi>may be withdrawn from them who deny the GOD HEAD of the Lord that bought us; Lest they unawares Betray the most Glorious CAUSE in the World. They will but Assert and Preserve the Sacred Scriptures, and keep close to them in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Reasonable Provision, to Reject the Hereticks, who under the Colour of Scripture Terms, hold and broach Damnable Hoeresies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was asked; <q>What he thought about the <hi>Country,</hi> and the Condition it might come to?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="unknown:002557_0227_0FDB6EEFF10D30A0"/>
He answered; <hi>The Country has yet such a number of Godly People in it, that GOD will not yet ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly cast off this People. CHRIST has an Interest here that shall not yet be lost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was asked; <q>What he thought about <hi>Boston,</hi> and the things that are impending over it?</q>
               </p>
               <p>He answered; <hi>There is yet a number of Godly People in the Town; They may be brought low, But the Town shall be yet Preserved If the</hi> MINISTERS <hi>continue Faithful, and carry on the Work and Cause of GOD well together, the Town will yet have Things go well in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was asked; <q>What he thought of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us whose late Renouncing of their own Ministry, and that of almost all the Protestant Churches in the World, was an extreme Trouble to him?</q>
               </p>
               <p>He answered; <hi>It is a very Evil and Grievous Thing, which they have been guilty of. But GOD may so Over rule their Folly &amp; Impiety, that the cause of Truth may anon be a Gainer by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was asked; <q>What he thought of the <hi>Times in General?</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He answered; <hi>There will be no settled Good Times, I suppose, till the second coming of the Lord. I suppose, His coming will be at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Good Times Promised by the Mouth of all the Prophets. His Kingdom takes not place, nor is the Israelitish Nation restored, until His Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was in this Time, that among other Acts of <hi>Special Service</hi> which he continued still to do for the Churches of GOD, he signed with much wise

                  <hi>Deliberation</hi> upon them, several Instruments of Consequence, which were to be transmitted unto <hi>London;</hi> whereof one was an Address from the <hi>United Ministers</hi> of <hi>Boston,</hi> unto our Lawful and Rightful Sovereign King GEORGE, expressing the Just Abhorrence in Them, and <hi>All their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> for the Conspiracy then lately Discovered.</p>
               <p>But that which his Heart was most of all set upon, was, To bear his Part, with <hi>A Faithful Testimony to the CAUSE and WORK of GOD, in the Churches of</hi> New-England; Left by the Memorable <hi>Mitchel,</hi> the Venerable <hi>Higginson,</hi> and the Honourable <hi>Stoughton;</hi> and now Published under the Title of, Elijahs Mantle.

View of Posterity, something of their <hi>last Will and Testament</hi> has been inserted. We have as good as done this for Dr. <hi>Mather,</hi> in our offering of this <hi>Instrument.</hi> NEW-ENGLAND, Behold and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy <hi>Legacy!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sovereign Disposer of all things, would not allow us now to say, <hi>Sortitus est facilem exitum, et qualem semper Optaverat.</hi> However, I will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now with such <hi>Punctual Relations,</hi> of the Doctors <hi>last Sickness,</hi> as the <hi>Funeral Orations</hi> on the <hi>Professors</hi> beyond Sea, use to be stuff'd withal. But for the sake of what follows, I will Relate this: It was not long after this, that among other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, he was extremely tortured and enfeebled, with an obstinate <hi>Hicket,</hi> which would sometimes hold him a Week or perhaps a Fortnight, without Intermission, and then Intermit a little while, but return with the former Violence, to such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that it was at last found, His <hi>Diaphragm</hi> Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a Corrosion from it. Under the Uneasy and Incessant Malady, and the <hi>Vapours</hi> which produced it, and were produced by it, he grew at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very <hi>Forgetful,</hi> and even <hi>Delirious:</hi> And In the Minutes of the Darkness wherein he lay thus <hi>feeble and fore broken,</hi> he sometimes let fall expressions of some <hi>Fear</hi> lest he might after all be Deceived in his <hi>Hope</hi> of the <hi>Future Blessedness.</hi> His Holy Ministry having very much insisted on that Point, That <hi>no care could be too much to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our being Deceived in that Important Matter;</hi> tis no wonder, that as the <hi>Dark Vapours</hi> which assaulted and fettered his Intellectual Powers, broke in upon him, his <hi>Head</hi> should run much
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:002557_0233_0FDB6EFC0C6C2148"/>
upon the Horror of being <hi>Deceived at the last.</hi> Yea, had there not been any thing at all of a <hi>Natural</hi> Debilitation and Obnubilation in it, yet it were a very Supposeable thing, and not at all to be wondred at, if the <hi>Serpent</hi> be let loose to vex a Servant of GOD in the <hi>Heel</hi> of his Life; and if the <hi>Powers of Darkness,</hi> Knowing the <hi>Time to be short,</hi> fall with <hi>Great Wrath</hi> on the Great Opposers of their <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and make a very <hi>Dark Time</hi> for them just before the <hi>Break</hi> of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Day upon them. And how justly might it awaken the rest of us to <hi>Work out our own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Fear and Trembling,</hi> When we see such a Man as Dr. <hi>Mather,</hi> concerned with so much <hi>Fear and Trembling,</hi> lest he should be <hi>Deceived at the last?</hi> But in the midst of his greatest <hi>Obtenebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> he still discovered such an Holy Sollicitude, that he might not in any thing Dishonour the Glorious GOD, nor lose his Hold of the Blessed JESUS, and such an Holy Resolution to stand by the <hi>Choice</hi> which he had made <hi>Seventy Years</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and which above all things he did now with unspeakable Consolation look back upon; as were indeed Preferrible to those <hi>Joys of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse</hi> that some are Transported withal. The best Judges of Things have agreed in this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; That going to Heaven <hi>in the way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> is much safer and surer than going <hi>in the way of Extasy.</hi> After all, tis to be declared, That the <hi>Doctor</hi> often saw the Scattering of these <hi>Accidental Clouds,</hi> and we saw him <hi>Rejoicing in the Hope of that Glory of GOD,</hi> which they were to Praepare him for. He not only very often said,
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:002557_0234_0FDB6F00B598DEF8"/>
                  <hi>The Infinite Mercy in GOD, and the Infinite Merit in CHRIST, keeps me above all Discouragement:</hi> But he kept continually feeding, on those Words of our SAVIOUR, <hi>Where I am, there shall my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant be:</hi> upon which he would add, CHRIST <hi>is in Heaven; and if I am a Servant of His (which I am sure I am,) then I shall be There!</hi> In this Time, his Complaints, That he was laid by, and now <hi>did no good,</hi> were more Frequent and more Grievous, than any that we heard from him about any of his <hi>Complicated Maladies:</hi> And he would say, <hi>For what Sin is the Holy One thus Chastising me! I have Examined myself, and I can't find what it is!</hi> Yea, in a deep Abyss of <hi>Humility,</hi> there was utterly Absorb'd with him all <hi>Sense</hi> of his <hi>ever having done any good at all</hi> in the World. He chose to Forget all, to Renounce all, and cry out, as he did numberless Times, <hi>Lord JESUS, I will make mention of thy Righteousness, even of thine only.</hi> And he would often have the <hi>Seventy First</hi> PSALM read unto him. He still express'd his Delight in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and would call for much of it: scarce let me Leave him without some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it. If he were asked what he would have us <hi>Pray</hi> for, he often Answered, <hi>That I may do Good while I Live, &amp; that I may Honour CHRIST in my Death.</hi> One Day telling him, that his Excellent Friend Mr. <hi>Thomas Hollis</hi> in his Letters to me, was Inquisitive whether he were <hi>yet in the Land of the Living;</hi> He replied, <hi>No, Tell him, I am going to it; This Poor World is the Land of the Dying; Tis Heaven that is the true Land of the Living!</hi>

At last, he began to fall into the Torments of the <hi>Wheel broken at the Cistern:</hi> Which yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came not Intolerable, and forced no Ejulations from him, till about <hi>Three Weeks before be Died.</hi> Under these, about <hi>Three Days</hi> before his Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, coming out of a Dark Minute, he said, <hi>It is now Revealed from Heaven to me, That I shall quickly, quickly, quickly be fetch'd away to Heaven, and that I shall Dy in the Arms of my Son.</hi> After this, he kept very much calling for me; till <hi>Friday,</hi> the <hi>Twenty Third of August,</hi> 1723. in the Morning perceiving the <hi>Last Agonies</hi> now come upon him, I did what I could after my poor man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he might be <hi>Strengthened</hi> by such <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Words</hi> as the <hi>Lively Oracles</hi> of our GOD have provided for such Occasion. As it grew towards Noon, I said unto him, <hi>Syr, The Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger is now come to tell you;</hi> This Day thou shalt be in Paradise. <hi>Do you Believe it, Syr, and Rejoice in the Views and Hopes of it?</hi> He Replied, <hi>I do! I do! I do!—</hi> And upon those Words, he <hi>Dyed in my Arms.—</hi>
               </p>
               <p>—But when the Physicians came to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visceration of the Dead Body, how astonished were they to find, what cause there had been for the Complaints of the <hi>last Three Weeks before he died;</hi> and it added unto all our Astonishment that they were <hi>no Earlier!</hi> They found, besides a <hi>Polypus</hi> on his Bladder, no less than Six Large Stones in it, on several uneven Shapes, and some of them above an Inch Diameter, the least of which was big enough to have made a Giant roar. Some of the <hi>Stones</hi> being broken, were
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:002557_0236_0FDB6F06E4BDD688"/>
found Collections of loose pieces of <hi>Gravel,</hi> which had a thin shell grown over them.—<hi>Animus meminesse horret Luctuque refugit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have said, It was on the <hi>Twenty Third of August;</hi> A Day so neer to the Black Day, of which it may be said, <hi>There never had been a Day in any Nation</hi> under Heaven, wherein so many such <hi>Lamps of Heaven</hi> were at once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished; that it puts me in mind of Observing, That, I suppose, Dr. <hi>Mather</hi> now brought up the <hi>Rear</hi> in that Illustrious Army of <hi>Confessors,</hi> who go by the Name of <hi>The ejected Ministers;</hi> and on whose Ill usage, I am sorry the Writers of Mr. <hi>Doolittel's Life,</hi> have newly seen sad cause to make this Reflection; <hi>Such an Invasion upon the Kingly Office of CHRIST—was an Act that calls for greater Signs of Repentance than have yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, Or than the Present Generation shows any Disposition to.</hi>

               <p>On the <hi>Seventh Day</hi> after this, he was laid in the <hi>Cave of the Treasure, and GOD</hi> Honoured him with a Greater <hi>Funeral,</hi> than had ever been seen for any <hi>Divine, in these</hi> (and some Travellers at it, said, <hi>in any other)</hi> parts of the World.

               <head>ARTICLE XXXIII. The Preacher; How and What he Preach'd.</head>
               <p>WE can't part with such an <hi>Able Minister of the New-Testament</hi> as Dr. <hi>Mather</hi> so; but we must look back upon the Performances of His Holy <hi>Ministry.</hi> Though the <hi>Preacher,</hi> have been, what <hi>all Flesh</hi> is, <hi>as Grass;</hi> and the <hi>Glory</hi> Wherein he shone, prove <hi>like the Flower of the Field;</hi> yet what he brought, and his way of bringing, the <hi>Living Word of GOD,</hi> may and should <hi>Abide</hi> with us.</p>
               <p>Though I never knew a more <hi>Candid Hearer,</hi> yet Thousands and Thousands have concurr'd in saying, They never knew a more <hi>Compleat Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> He was indeed the Rabbi <hi>Hadarsan</hi> of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Engalnd!</hi> and one of whom very Competent Judges would say, <hi>He never Preached a Sermon but what was worthy of the press.</hi>—And there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more Common then for People, when they would give the Highest Applause unto a <hi>Preacher,</hi> to say, <hi>He Preaches like Dr. Mather.</hi> A very Accomplished Person, Dedicating to him a Disputation full of Erudition, De CHRISTI <hi>Descensu ad Inferos,</hi> Printed in <hi>Holland, 1702.</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry justly Saluted him, as, <hi>Theologorum et Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorum onnium, per totam, qua late patet,</hi> Nov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Angliam, <hi>facile Princeps.</hi> Being such a <hi>Price of Preachers The Manner</hi> and the <hi>Matter</hi> of his <hi>Preaching,</hi> will certainly deserve to have some Notice taken of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="unknown:002557_0240_0FDB6F0C2C7B96A8"/>
He much despised what they call <hi>Quaintness,</hi> but affected a <hi>Plain</hi> and therefore a <hi>Short</hi> sort of a <hi>Style.</hi> Though he were such a <hi>Scholoer,</hi> yet his <hi>Learning</hi> hindred not his Condescension to the Lowest and Meanest Capacity: aiming to shoot not over the <hi>Heads,</hi> but into the <hi>Hearts,</hi> of the Hearers. He was very careful to be <hi>understood,</hi> and <hi>concealed</hi> every other <hi>Art,</hi> that he might Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue and Practice that one <hi>Art of Being Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible.</hi> With <hi>Luther,</hi> he said, he counted him the Best Preacher. <hi>Qui Simplicissime docet.</hi> A <hi>Simple Diet,</hi> he counted the most <hi>Wholsom Diet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was his perpetual endeavour therewithal to Preach very <hi>Scripturally,</hi> and like an <hi>Hildersham,</hi> to back every thing he spoke, with some agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sentence of the <hi>Sacred Scriptures</hi> Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. His Judgment was, That the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD is the <hi>Food</hi> of Souls; and the more there is of <hi>That</hi> pertinently Produced, the <hi>Better Fed</hi> are the Flocks under our <hi>Feeding.</hi> He judged also, That in the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, there is that <hi>Voice of the Lord,</hi> that is <hi>Powerful and full of Majesty.</hi> Nor did he think, that any <hi>Language</hi> could aequal it, for the <hi>Beauty</hi> of it. I am sure, I ought never to Forget a Passage he had in the Sermon he Preached at my Ordination; [On <hi>Act.</hi> XIII. 2.] <q>Since the SPIRIT of GOD is concerned so much in the <hi>Separation of Persons to the Work of the Ministry,</hi> how much does it concern them, to be very <hi>Spiritual</hi> in their <hi>Ministry!</hi> Let it be their Care to <hi>Live Spiritually,</hi> and be <hi>Spiritually<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Men,</hi> and <hi>not Grieve the Holy Spirit of GOD</hi> by any Irregularities. But let them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:002557_0241_0FDB6F0FDBA8DB38"/>
so <hi>Preach Spiritually;</hi> and therefore <hi>Preach Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,</hi> The <hi>Word of GOD</hi> is the <hi>Sword of the Spirit;</hi> and they must Have and Quote much of <hi>That</hi> in their Sermons, if they would have the SPIRIT of GOD breathing in them.</q> It may be added, That he had a notable way now and then, to bring in a Pertinent Passage of <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>History,</hi> which mightily Awakened the Attention of the Auditory, and made his Words the more Pungent <hi>Goads</hi> unto them.</p>
               <p>His Delivery had something Singular in it. He spoke with a Grave and Wife <hi>Deliberation:</hi> But on some Subjects, his Voice would rise for the more <hi>Emphatical Clauses,</hi> as the Discourse went on: and anon come on with such a <hi>Tonitruous Cogency,</hi> that the Hearers would be struck with an <hi>Awe</hi> like what would be Produced on the Fall of <hi>Thunderbolts:</hi> He was our <hi>Farel,</hi> than whom, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo tonuit fortius!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He used no <hi>Notes</hi> in his Preaching to the very Last. Though in Committing to his Memory, the Sermons which he wrote in <hi>Quarto-Volumns,</hi> he would write an <hi>Octavo-Page</hi> or two, of <hi>Texts</hi> and of <hi>Words,</hi> which he carried in the Beginning of his Bible, to help him in case he were at a loss, yet he never look'd upon it. <hi>Once</hi> in his <hi>Old Age</hi> he did; but presently wrote a Remark upon it, as a <hi>Symptom of a Decay,</hi> which told him, he was to <hi>Dy immediately.</hi> He was indeed a Friend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Using</hi> of Notes in <hi>Preaching:</hi> [The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Orator himself did sometimes, <hi>De Scripto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citare:]</hi> But he Distinguished <hi>That</hi> from the <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Notes.</hi> He wished, there were more <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="unknown:002557_0242_0FDB6F1106813CC8"/>
and less <hi>Reading,</hi> in our <hi>Sermons:</hi> and would have had the <hi>Preacher</hi> to be more of a <hi>Speaker;</hi> even so much, that the Necessary <hi>Vigour</hi> and <hi>Address,</hi> of proper <hi>Preaching,</hi> might not be lost, with any that were at all Capable of Preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>I may not pass it over, That his <hi>Ministry</hi> was carried on, with continual <hi>Supplications</hi> over it. On his <hi>Days of Prayer,</hi> a common Article of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi> with him, was, <hi>Direction what Subjects to Preach upon.</hi> He perpetually went from his Knees unto the Pulpit, and before his going forth to Preach a Sermon, the <hi>last Thing</hi> with him, was, A <hi>Secret Prayer</hi> for a Gracious Presence of GOD with him, in the Work before him. And when he came home, the <hi>First Thing</hi> with him was, A <hi>Secret Prayer,</hi> to give Thanks for the Help he had enjoy'd, and ask a Blessing on the Truths De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievered. I find him sometimes Importunate in these Prayers. Once particularly when he was a very <hi>Young Preacher,</hi> I find this Passage in his <hi>Diary; After I came home, in my Study I was much affected and carried out, in Prayer for the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of some of those Young Merchants that usually hear me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And with what <hi>Leading</hi> of Heaven granted unto it, would a Ministry so filled with <hi>Visits</hi> to Heaven, be likely to be befriended!</p>
               <p>Let one Instance instead of many Illustrate it. The Doctor felt once upon his mind, a strong Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, to Preach a Sermon about the Crime of <hi>Self-Murder;</hi> but he resisted, he declined, he laid it aside.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="unknown:002557_0243_0FDB6F1349D9BA80"/>
He then wrote in his diary. <q>This Day my former Thoughts about <hi>Preaching</hi> on the Evil of <hi>Self-Murder,</hi> returning upon me again; I look'd up to GOD, and as I was lifting up my Heart to him, then walking in my Garden, I was most strangely moved and melted. I could not speak a word for some time. Tears gushed from my Eyes. And it seemed as if it were said to me, <hi>Preach on that Subject, and thou shalt Save Bodies and Souls from Death. The Lion is among thy Flock; Resist him with the Sword of the Spirit, and the Sheep Committed unto thy Charge shall be rescued out of his Bloody Hands.</hi> What the meaning of this is, I know not; but wonder at it. There may be something of Heaven in it, more than I am aware of.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The next Lords-Day, he Preached the Sermon [On, <hi>Act.</hi> XVI. 27, 28.] And behold, soon after it, there came such to him, as informed him, That <hi>at that very Time,</hi> the Temptations to <hi>Self-Murder</hi> were impelling of them with an <hi>Horrible Violence</hi> But GOD had Blessed that Happy Sermon for; their Deliverance! They afterwards joined to his Church.</p>
               <p>But that the Account of Dr. <hi>Mathers</hi> Ministry, may be given in the most <hi>Affectuous</hi> as well as the most <hi>Expressive</hi> way, We will here insert what was given of it; in a Sermon to his Flock, a few Days after his Expiration.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Sep.</hi> 8. 1723. there was a Sermon Preached unto the Old North-Church; whereof the <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> was This.</p>

                              <hi>Remember</hi> it, after we have <hi>seen the end of their conversation.</hi> Ecclesiastical History mentions one, who having word brought him. <hi>That his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was Dead,</hi> made this Answer, <hi>Desine Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemias loqui, Pater mous est Immortalis.</hi> No, Syr, <hi>My Father is one who never can Dy.</hi> Upon the Death of him who was the <hi>Father of my Flesh,</hi> I desire to take the <hi>Great Consolations</hi> of GOD, that I have in Him who is my <hi>Immortal Father,</hi> and with whom the <hi>Fatherless find Mercy.</hi> But at the same time you will allow me to do what I can, to <hi>Immortalize the Memory,</hi> and above all things, to <hi>Immortalize</hi> the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> who is <hi>not suffered by reason of Death,</hi> to continue with me.</p>
                           <p>In the <hi>Ministry</hi> of our Departed Pastor, there were some Articles of a more frequent and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent inculcation, whereof you shall allow me to be this Day, a <hi>Remembrancer</hi> unto you. Though he Preached over the whole <hi>Body of Divinity,</hi> in the <hi>Amesian</hi> method among you; and went over the <hi>Epistles</hi> to the <hi>Seven Churches;</hi> The <hi>Ten Commandments;</hi> And the <hi>Lord's Prayer;</hi> The Parables of the <hi>Builders;</hi> And of the <hi>Sower;</hi> And of the <hi>Tares;</hi> The <hi>Second Chapter</hi> of the Epistle to the <hi>Eplusians;</hi> The <hi>Eighth Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Romans;</hi> The <hi>Seventeenth Chapter of John;</hi> The whole <hi>Spiritual Armour;</hi> The <hi>Temptations</hi> of our SAVIOUR; The <hi>Chain of Graces</hi> in the Second Epistle of <hi>Peter;</hi> And other Portions of the Scriptures; And <hi>Occasional Subjects</hi> without Number; Yet there were all along some <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> which in the <hi>Fulfilling of his Ministry,</hi> he
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:002557_0248_0FDB6F21B4747F50"/>
pressed with a <hi>Peculiar Flame;</hi> And I hope, you will apprehend <hi>him</hi> Speaking to you, in <hi>my</hi> short Recapitulation of them. It was mentioned as a Fault; Heb. XII. 5. <hi>Ye have forgotten the Exhortation.</hi> O Dear People, on whom his <hi>Doctrine dropt as the Rain,</hi> and his <hi>Speech distill'd as the Dew as the small Rain on the Tender Herb, and as the Showres upon the Grass;</hi> Let not this Fault be what you shall be Charged withal.</p>
                           <p n="1">1.

But This you may all of you <hi>Remember;</hi> That the unknown, and the too much Unregarded and Unlamented <hi>Evil of Sin,</hi> was what his Ministry did exceedingly mind you of. What Pains did he take, to Convince you, That none but <hi>Fools make a Mock of Sin;</hi> That it is a most Vile thing by <hi>Sin to Deny the GOD that is Above;</hi> That the Sinner cannot look to <hi>go Unpunished</hi> (How Vehemently did he, with the <hi>Hammer which breaks the Rocks to Vieces</hi> drive this home upon you, That <hi>no Sin</hi> is to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged and Harboured, nor so much as a<hi>Sinful Thought</hi> with Allowance <hi>Lodged</hi> within you?

What <hi>mighty Thundrings</hi> did you hear from this Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, as from a flaming Mountain, against those <hi>things for which the Wrath of GOD comes on the Children of Disobedience?</hi> What warnings did he therefore give against the <hi>Particular Sins</hi> by which he saw the Souls of Men Endangered?</p>
                           <p>But when the <hi>Wrath of GOD was Revealed from heaven against all Ungodliness and Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Men,</hi> in his doing the part of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover,</hi> there was especially <hi>One Sin</hi> that he singled out for his Frequent Fulminations; That was, The Sin of <hi>Drunkenness;</hi> Bruitish, and Baneful, and Woful <hi>Drunkenness;</hi> Intemperance in <hi>Drinking;</hi> A Slavery to the <hi>Bottle.</hi> Of this, with what Vehemency did he warn the Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling Tribe, That <hi>at the last! At the Last! At the Last!</hi> it will <hi>Bite like a Serpent,</hi> and <hi>Sting like an Adder! His, Wo to Drunkards,</hi> has been twice Printed among us.</p>
                           <p>Oh, <hi>Remember</hi> these things, and from the <hi>Words of his Lips,</hi> which came from the <hi>Lips of GOD,</hi> Learn to <hi>keep yourselves from the Pathes of the Destroyer.</hi> Afraid of the <hi>Wounds</hi> whereof he forewarned you, if you do so, oh! Let none of you <hi>go on still in your Trespasses!</hi>

Mat. XVIII. 3. <hi>Except ye be Converted, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> These were not the only Sermons, in which he pressed upon you the <hi>Necessity of Turning</hi> and of <hi>Living</hi> unto GOD. The <hi>Alienation</hi> from GOD, which our Fall has brought upon us, was a Thing so Grievous unto him, that the Necessity of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi>appeared unto him a Thing that could not be too frequently or too earnestly pleaded for. With what loud calls and peals did he Thunder it over you; That you must have a <hi>Good Work</hi> of Grace wrought in you, and an <hi>Holiness without which no Man shall see the Lord;</hi> That you must have the Experience of a <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Birth,</hi> or else it had been <hi>Good for you that you had never been Born;</hi> That you must become <hi>New-Creatures,</hi> or else <hi>He that made you will not have Mercy on you, and He that formed you will show you no Favour?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And though he continually asserted the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Impotency</hi> and would have you sensible, <hi>That you cannot Convert yourselves;</hi> Yet he urgent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dehorted you from <hi>siting still</hi> Profanely, as if you had <hi>nothing to do;</hi> urgently directed you to make that Cry unto the Glorious One, <hi>Turn thou me and I shall be Turned; urgently</hi> Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged you to <hi>make yourselves a New Heart,</hi> by seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto GOD, that He would bestow a <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Heart</hi> upon you.</p>
                           <p>But then, like the Angel, that <hi>Hastened</hi> the Lingerers out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> how Zealously, how Terribly, did he call on the Delaying Sinner, <hi>Fly for thy Life!</hi> The Word with him, was

The uncertain Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and Surprizals of <hi>Certain Death,</hi> and the <hi>Hazardous Madness</hi> of Disobliging the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly SPIRIT, whose Influences your <hi>Conversion</hi> depends upon; how powerfully for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, were you minded o' them!</p>
                           <p>Hence, as he had been himself a <hi>Pattern</hi> of <hi>Early Piety,</hi> and in the close of his Days, there was no one thing that so much Comforted him, as This; <hi>I gave myself up to GOD in my Youth!</hi> So he was a most fervent <hi>Preacher</hi> of it. <hi>Early Piety,</hi> how Mightily, how Ardently, and with how Frequent Excitations, did he Sollicit for it! His <hi>Printed Essays</hi> upon it, are in your <hi>Hands, Children,</hi> may your <hi>Hearts</hi> feel the Efficacy of them.

A Deceived Heart has turned them aside!</hi> How Pathetically would he Bewayl the Fate of these Poor <hi>Self Deceivers!</hi>
                           </p>

Remember how you have Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and heard, <hi>That to Pray with all manner of Prayer, is the Best way to all manner of Good.</hi> Your Pastor, not only Preached what you have on your <hi>Shelves,</hi> oh! may it be also in your <hi>Minds!</hi>—on Psal. XXXII. 6. <hi>Every one that is Godly will Pray:</hi> But in his Preaching you heard it more than a Thousand Times over from him; That, <hi>Behold he Prayes!</hi> is the <hi>first Note</hi> of a Soul Returning to GOD, and capable of Good: That without <hi>Prayer</hi> there is nothing to be <hi>done,</hi> and no Good can be <hi>look'd for;</hi> That <hi>Prayer</hi> is the <hi>Main Engine</hi> with which all Good Purposes are to be carried on. <hi>Prayer, Prayer</hi> was that which he <hi>us'd</hi> with an unceasing As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduity; And he <hi>Preach'd</hi> it as he <hi>us'd</hi> it. He saw amazing <hi>Answers of Prayer;</hi> The <hi>Prevalency
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:002557_0253_0FDB6F2CC752D508"/>
of Prayer</hi> was Demonstrated and Exemplified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Admiration in what he had himself met withal; And this, also added flame to the <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Heat,</hi> with which he would have <hi>Melted</hi> you to run into the like Devotions, and have <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed</hi> with you to <hi>Go and do likewise.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>How Potently have you heard <hi>Secret Prayer</hi> Commended to you, Demanded from you, as a Thing which it is Impossible any <hi>Child of GOD</hi> should be a Stanger to? How forcibly, and with what an <hi>Arrest</hi> upon the <hi>Conscience,</hi> have you heard <hi>Houshold Prayer</hi> called for; And with what Flashes of Lightning have you heard that <hi>Voice of the Lord</hi> uttered among you; <hi>The Fury of GOD Poured out on the Families that call not on His Name!</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Oh, <hi>Remember</hi> these Things; and let none of you be the inexcusable <hi>Workers of Iniquity,</hi> which <hi>call not upon GOD!</hi>

which bids us to <hi>come as well as we can.</hi> But yet he strongly urged the <hi>Preparation of the Sanctuary</hi> in all that came unto the <hi>Holy Table</hi> there. He did not look on the <hi>Supper of the Lord</hi> as designed for a <hi>Converting Ordinance;</hi> He thought, the <hi>Bread</hi> there belonged unto none but the Children, and the <hi>Living.</hi> Though he did not judge it necessary, that a <hi>Communicant</hi> should have a <hi>Full assurance</hi> of his being <hi>sincerely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi> yet it was his Judgment, that he should be one who upon <hi>Trial</hi> might not have cause to Pronounce himself, an <hi>utter Stranger</hi> to the <hi>Work of GOD;</hi> and find that he did not Heartily Consent unto the <hi>Baptismal Covenant.</hi> How Powerfully did he Preach, on Mat. XXII. 12. <hi>How camest thou in hither, not having a Wedding Garment? A Process of Repentance,</hi> to be first gone through; <hi>This</hi> he forever insisted on.</p>
                           <p>And then he proposed an <hi>Actual Preparation,</hi> like what should be in People Advertised, <hi>That at such a Time GOD would come down unto them.</hi> He would say, when it is Propounded on the <hi>Lords Day</hi> before it, <hi>The next Lords-Day the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper is to be Administred,</hi> it should be even almost as if it were said, <hi>You shall Dy the next Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Day; Prepare to shew forth your Lords Death, in some Respects as if you were to meet with your own.</hi> His own Custome accordingly it was, for <hi>Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score Years</hi> together, to spend a <hi>whole Day</hi> in Secret Interviews with Heaven, and <hi>Praying and Fasting,</hi> before the Celebration of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist.</hi>

Oh, <hi>Remember</hi> these Things; and let none of you <hi>Ear and Drink Judgment</hi> unto your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by <hi>Unworthy Approaches</hi> unto the <hi>Table of the Lord.</hi>

                           <p n="6">VI. Remember how you have Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and heard, When the ETERNITY into which we are all hastening, has been Declared unto you, Displayed before you. What was there, that your Pastor did with a <hi>Countenance like that of an Angel of GOD,</hi> more mind you of, than ETERNITY! <hi>Eternity! Eternity!</hi> He often told you, The Word ETERNITY, is enough to <hi>Break the Heart</hi> of any one, that will with any Attention look upon it! He often told you, That if you would spend <hi>one quarter of an Hour in</hi> thinking on ETERNITY, he doubted not, but it would have an happy Consequence! With what Anticipations of the <hi>Last Trumpet</hi> was it, that he Preached on, Heb, IX. 27. <hi>After Death the Judgment! How Solemn</hi> was he in it, when, <hi>The Judgment of the Great Day, and The Eternal Judgment,</hi> was to be spoken of? And how <hi>often</hi> was it spoken of?</p>
                           <p>You saw him Opening the <hi>Bars of the Pit,</hi> and setting before you the <hi>Second Death</hi> in the most <hi>Lively Colours,</hi> and bringing up the Damned Spirits from the <hi>Place of Torment,</hi> into the view of the Living, and showing you the everburning <hi>Lake,</hi> and the <hi>Smoke of the Torment Ascending forever and ever.</hi> He removed the <hi>Skreen,</hi> and gave you a sight of the <hi>Fire that never will be quenched;</hi> the <hi>Fire</hi> which the <hi>Unfruitful Trees</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>You saw <hi>Heaven Opened,</hi> in the <hi>Discoveries</hi> which he thence brought unto you, concerning the <hi>Worship</hi> of GOD, by <hi>Myriads of Angels,</hi> and the <hi>Spirits of the Righteous,</hi> with JESUS the <hi>Mediator of the New-Covenant</hi> at the Head of them, carried on in the <hi>True Temple</hi> above: <hi>Discoveries</hi> of the <hi>Rest from the Days of Evil,</hi> and <hi>Fulness of Joy and Pleasures forevermore,</hi> to be enjoy'd in the <hi>Blissful Mansions.</hi> He drew aside the <hi>Veil,</hi> and shewed you what is to be seen in <hi>the most Holy place;</hi> to be seen without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption or Profaneness; but with the greatest Advantage for a Progress towards <hi>Perfection of Holiness in the Fear of GOD.</hi> Thus he Invited you to accompany him in the <hi>way to Zion, with your Faces thitherward;</hi> He said, <hi>Come, let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant; and go to the City of the Living GOD.</hi>
                           </p>

his Ministry, he made Him <hi>so:</hi> Yea, <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to know nothing but a CHRIST,</hi> in his Discharging of it. You never saw him so much in his Flement as when the <hi>Glories</hi> of His <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> CHRIST, were to be set before you. The <hi>Preaching of CHRIST,</hi> was the Grand Thing to which he advised them who would be the <hi>Preachers of the Gospel;</hi> The <hi>Reverse</hi> of what he with Grief saw advised by some Celebrated writers, in our Unhappy Days, wherein—<hi>Actum est de Religione CHRISTI apud Anglos.</hi> And he took the Advice for his own Ministry, in a manner well worthy to be Imitated. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> how clearly you have had, <hi>The Mystery of CHRIST,</hi> explain'd unto you. <hi>Remember</hi> what you have <hi>Heard</hi> about the Importance, of Accepting a Glorious CHRIST with all HIS <hi>Benefits,</hi> as Offered in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> to be <hi>Preached unto every Creature.</hi> And, <hi>Remember</hi> what you have <hi>Heard,</hi> about the way of <hi>Living on</hi> a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious CHRIST, in all that you have to <hi>Do,</hi> and in all that you have to <hi>Bear,</hi> while you are in this <hi>Dying World:</hi> and the way of <hi>Living</hi> to Him, which you were told must be your Study, if you would be able to say, <hi>For me to Dy, shall be my Gain.</hi> And, oh!
