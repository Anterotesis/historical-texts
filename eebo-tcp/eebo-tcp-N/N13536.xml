            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>Introductory to ſome EXTRACTS from the writing of the ABBE RAYNAL, on that important Subject.</p>
            <p>WHEN the General Congreſs firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, they prefaced the reaſon of their ſeparation from Great Britain, with the following ſentence, <q>We hold theſe truths to be ſelf evident, That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator, with certain unaliable rights; that amongſt theſe are life, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the purſuit of happineſs.</q> And in the declaration of the 6th of July 1775, Congreſs have in very forcible language declared their opinion <q>that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the intent of the Divine Author of our exiſtence, that a part of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man kind ſhould hold an abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and unbounded power over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, marked out by infinite goodneſs and wiſdom, as the objects of a Legal Domination.—That reverence for our
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:017096_0002_0F9FC4850A54A740"/>
great Creator, principles of humanity, and the dictates of common ſenſe, muſt convince all thoſe who reflect upon the ſubject, that Government was inſtituted to promote the welfare of mankind, and ought to be adminiſtered for the attainment of that end.</q> As theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections apply to human nature in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, however diverſified by colour and other diſtinctions, how far the ſituation of the Negroes ſtill kept in Slavery, on this continent is conſonant thereto, is a matter which calls for the moſt ſerious attention of all thoſe who, indeed believe, in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Providence, and that the good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our being multiplies his bleſſings in proportion as we render ourſelves wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy by the practice of Juſtice and Love. Hence it becomes a matter of the utmoſt weight to the Americans, in a peculiar manner, duly to conſider how far they can juſtify a conduct ſo abhorrent from theſe ſacred truths as that of dragging theſe oppreſſed Strangers from their native land, and all thoſe tender connections, which we hold ſo dear; the violence exerciſed over them, to oblige them to do the ſervile offices of life, for thoſe whoſe ſuperiority has been obtained by an illegal force; under the ſanction of unjuſt laws; laws fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:017096_0003_0F9FC485BB0BD070"/>
to hold in bondage, a bondage often ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and cruel, a people over whom they have not the leaſt ſhadow of right; a bondage without condition, without end, and without appeal. Under this proſpect of the ſituation of theſe Black People, muſt not every ſenſible, feeling heart be filled with ſympathy and fearful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. Well may the words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be applied to them, <q>Behold the tears of the oppreſſed and they had no comforter;</q> and indeed, what refuge, what appeal can a ſlave have, when cruelly uſed by an inconſiderate maſter, or by a hard-hearted overſeer. How inconſiſtent is this abhorrent practice, with every idea of Liberty, every principle of humanity. Nay is it not of publick notoriety that thoſe maſters or overſeers, who by ill uſage, or by an unrelenting ſcourge, have brought their Slaves to an untimely end, have ſcarce been called to any account, by thoſe who ought not to bear the ſword in vain: Scarce an inſtance can be mentioned even of any man's being capitally arraigned for the wilful murder of a ſlave. Nay, dreadful to mention, do not the laws in ſome of the iſlands, and frequent advertiſements in the Southern States, in effect encourage the murder of a Negroe, who has abſented

himſelf for a certain time from his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's ſervice, by giving a reward greater for the poor fugitive's head than for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him home alive.</p>
            <p>When this unjuſt and cruel treatment of the Negroes is conſidered, and brought to the teſt of the above declarations, will it not appear wonderfully inconſiſtent and a matter of aſtoniſhment, to the whole world, that an alteration of conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, has not yet taken place, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to a general abolition of Slavery on the continent; a ſtep which every prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of honour, reaſon, and humanity call for, and which may well be effected in ſuch a manner as will conduce to the happineſs of the maſter as well as the ſlave. But ſuch is the force of the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual depravity, when ſupported by the practice of great numbers, eſpecially in that which flatters our intereſt and ſooths our paſſions, that the moſt ſtriking inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of oppreſſion and cruelty, ſuch as would make a ſtranger, at the firſt glance, ſhudder loſe all their force upon minds accuſtomed, from their infancy, to ſee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion reign uncontrouled; theſe can ſee the galling chains, the cruel ſtripes; the dying groan without pain; and without reflection or pity, can diſregard the heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rending

ſuffering, which many of theſe their afflicted fellow-men undergo,<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſtriking inſtance of this kind appeared in the caſe of a NEGROE, reſiding near PHILADELPHIA. From his firſt arrival he appeared thoughtful and dejected, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently dropping tears, when fondling his maſter's child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren; the cauſe of which was not known till he was able to be underſtood, when he gave the following account. That he had a wife and children in his own country, that ſome of theſe being ſick, he went in the night time to fetch water at a ſpring, where he was, violently, ſeized and carried away, by perſons who lay in wait to catch men; from whence he was tranſported to AMERICA; that the remembrance of his family and friends, whom he never expected to ſee any more, were the principal cauſe of his dejection and grief. Now can any whoſe mind is not rendered quite obdurate by the practice of oppreſſion, or the love of gain, hear this relation without being affected with ſympathy and ſorrow; and doubtleſs the caſe of many of theſe afflicted people will be found to be attended with circumſtances equally tragical and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating. And if we enquire of thoſe Negroes who were brought from their native country, when children, we ſhall find many of them have been ſtolen away, when abroad from their parents on the roads, or watching their corn fields. Now TENDER PARENTS; and all who are real friends of LIBERTY; and you who are willing to read the book of Conſcience, and thoſe that are learned in the law, what can you ſay to theſe deplorable caſes: When and how have theſe oppreſſed ſtrangers forfeited their liberty; muſt not your heart aſſent to the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion publickly made by a reſpectable member of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Virginia? <q>That there cannot be in nature, there is not in hiſtory, an inſtance in which every right of men is more flagrantly violated.</q> Does not juſtice loudly call for LIBERTY being reſtored to them? Is it not the duty of every diſpenſer of juſtice, who is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of his own humanity, to remember that they are men, and to declare them free. Where evils of ſuch magnitude are neither inquired into nor redreſſed by thoſe whoſe duty, it is, <q>to ſeek judgment, to relieve the oppreſſed, to judge for the fatherleſs, and plead for the widow,</q> Iſa. i.17. what can be expected but that the groans and cries of theſe ſufferers will reach HEAVEN, and what ſhall ye do. <q>when GOD riſeth up, and when he viſiteth.</q> What will ye anſwer him? Did not he that made them make us; and did not one faſhion us in the womb. Job. xxxi.I4.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the remembrance of paſt enjoyments

and their native vigour and love of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, can be broke down into tame ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the abſolute will of their lordly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors. No plea of difficulty ought to prevent our ſpeedily doing that juſtice to theſe oppreſſed people, which the nature of their ſeveral caſes will allow, ſuch as declaring their offspring free at a ſuitable age; and inſtead of extorting their ſervice by ſeverity of diſcipline, make way for their freedom, by giving them ſuch an intereſt in their own labour as may ſtir them up to the utmoſt exertion of their vigour and induſtry, and encourage them to employ thoſe talents and ingenuity, which are now depreſſed by ſlavery, for the general good; thus from grudging dangerous Slaves they may become willing minded labourers, equally concerned with their maſters in promoting the ſafety and happineſs of their country. It will be when meaſures of this kind takes place in America, and when a final end is put to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017096_0007_0F9FC488BA560560"/>
a horrible Slave Trade in England, that both countries may expect to flouriſh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bleſſing of Him who delights in Juſtice and Mercy; and has promiſed to reward every country, as well as indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, according to their deeds.</p>
            <p>To aſſiſt in eradicating the deep rooted prejudice which an education amongſt Slaves has planted in many minds, let us attend to what the Abbe Raynal, that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Philoſopher and friend to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, has ſaid on the ſubject of Slavery.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I will not, ſays he, diſgrace myſelf by adding one to the liſt of venal writers, who have proſtituted their pens in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a trade ſo abhorrent from the laws of universal juſtice. No principles of policy can juſtify the breach of her Sacred Laws. In ſo enlightened an age, an age where ſo many errors are boldly laid open, it would be ſhameful to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal any truth that is intereſting to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. We will firſt prove that no reaſon of ſtate can authorize Slavery. In doing this we ſhall not heſitate to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, before the Tribunal of Eternal Light and Juſtice, all thoſe governments who tolerate the cruel practice, or are not aſhamed to make it the baſis of their
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017096_0008_0F9FC489EEA80FB0"/>power.</q> The great Monteſquieu could not prevail upon himſelf to treat the queſtion concerning Slavery, in a ſerious light. In reality it is degrading to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to employ it. I will not ſay in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, but even in refuting an abuſe ſo repugnant to it; whoever juſtifies ſo odious a ſyſtem deſerves the utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, &amp;c. &amp;c.—Will it be ſaid that he who wants to make me a Slave does me no injury, that he only makes uſe of his rights? Where are thoſe rights (may the Slave ſay) who has ſtamped upon them ſo ſacred a character as to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence mine. He who ſupports the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of Slavery is the enemy of the whole human race. He divides it into two ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of Legal Aſſaſſins, the Oppreſſor and the Oppreſſed, &amp;c. &amp;c.—But the right of Slavery, you ſay, extends only to the right of labour, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of liberty, not life. What! does not the maſter who diſpoſes of my ſtrength, at his pleaſure, diſpoſe of my life, which depends on the voluntary and moderate exerciſe of my faculties: What is exiſtence to him who has not the diſpoſal of it? I cannot kill my Slave, but I can make him bleed under the whip of an executioner; I can <q>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017096_0009_0F9FC48A4E6F3890"/>
him with ſorrow, drudgery, and want: I can injure him every way, and ſecretly undermine the principles and ſprings of life: I can ſmother by ſlow puniſhment, the wretched infant which a Negroe Woman carries in her womb. Thus the laws protects the Slave againſt a violent death, to leave to my cruelty the right of making him die by degrees.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Let us proceed a ſtep farther, the right of Slavery is a right to perpetrate all ſorts of crimes; thoſe crimes which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade property; for Slaves are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to have any, even in their own perſons; thoſe crimes which deſtroy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſafety, for the Slave may be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to the caprice of his maſter; thoſe crimes which make modeſty ſhudder; my blood riſes at thoſe horrid images. I hate, I ſly the human ſpecies, made up only of victims and executioners, and if it is never to become better, may it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate itſelf. A word more, ſince all muſt be ſaid, Cartouche, the famous (French Highwayman) Cartouche ſeated at the foot of a tree, in a deep foreſt, calculating the profits and charges of his robberies, the rewards and pay of his aſſociates, and adjuſting with them the idea of proportion and diſtributive
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017096_0010_0F9FC48D711DCE88"/>
juſtice; this Cartouche is he not like a merchant equiping a veſſel for the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea Trade, who reclined on his deſk, with his pen in his hand, ſettles the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of attacks which he can cauſe to be made on the coaſt of Guinea, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately examines how many firelocks each Negroe will coſt him, how many iron fetters to confine him on board, how many whips to make him work. What think you of this parallel. The highwayman attacks you and takes your money; the trader carries off even your perſon. The one invades the rights of ſociety, the other thoſe of nature. This certainly is the truth; and if there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted a religion which authorized, even only by its ſilence, ſuch horrors, if it did not continually denounce vengeance againſt the authors or the inſtruments of this tyranny; if it made it criminal for the Slave to break his bonds; if it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in its boſom the iniquitous Judge who condemns the fugitive to death; if ſuch a religion exiſted, the miniſter and the altar ought to be cruſhed in one common ruin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Author makes a farther note (which is left out in the Engliſh Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) upon the arguments frequently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017096_0011_0F9FC48E67694778"/>by ſome, even teachers under dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent denominations, in vindication of the Slavery of the Negroes, as being the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the curſes denounced againſt Cain or Canaan, whoſe deſcendants they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to be; in 4 vol. p. 158, French Edit. <q>Great God, ſays the Abbe, what attrocious extravagancies are imputed to thee, by beings who ſpeak and act only by a free gift of thy power; who aſcribe to thee words and actions agreeable to the ridiculous caprice of their ignorant preſumption. Are they Devils who blaſpheme thee, or men who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thy miniſters.</q> Philo. Hiſt. of the Indies.</p>

Benezet, teacher of a ſchool eſtabliſhed by private ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Philadelphia, for the inſtruction of the Black Children and others of that people, has, for many years, had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of knowing the temper and genius of the Africans; particularly of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his tuition, who have been many, of different ages; and he can with Truth and Sincerity declare, that he has found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them as great variety of Talents, equally capable of improvement, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a like number of Whites; and he
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017096_0012_0F9FC48EDF82D178"/>
is bold to aſſert, that the notion entertained by ſome, that the Blacks are inferior to the Whites in their capacities, is a vulgar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, founded on the Pride or Ignorance of their lordly Maſters, who have kept their Slaves at ſuch a diſtance, as to be unable to form a right judgment of them.</p>
            <p>☞ In the HOUR OF REFLECTION, that awful hour which will come upon all, not hardned in obduracy or ſunk in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, when people are ſo far brought to themſelves, as impartially to review the tranſactions of their paſt life, how much comfort will it afford to thoſe, who lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide all views of intereſt, have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured by precept and example to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate and remove an evil of ſo deep a die, an evil ſo big with dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences to their Country, to themſelves, and yet more ſo to their unhappy offspring, thereby made a prey to that ſloth and idleneſs, that pride, cruelty and laciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the natural produce of SLAVERY.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, what ANGUISH OF SOUL, what Reflection from others, will at ſuch a period be the portion of thoſe who for ſelfiſh ends, in order to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a life of Pride and Luxury, will have ſtifled the Convictions of Conſcience, in favour of a practice as pregnant with ruin of every kind, as it is inconſiſtent with every idea of Reaſon, Feeling and Humanity.</p>
