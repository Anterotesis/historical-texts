            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

word of truth, &amp; do more explicitly in the name and fear of God, profess and protest to walk as followeth, through the power and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>We avouch the Lord to be our God, and our selves to be his people, in the truth and simplicity of our spirits.</p>
            <p>We give our selves to the Lord Jesus Christ, and the word of his grace, for the teaching, ruling and sanctifying of us in matters of worship and conversation, resolving to cleave to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for life and glory, and to oppose all contrary wayes, Cannons and constitutions of men in his worship.</p>
            <p>We promise to walk with our Brethren and Sisters with all watchfulness and tenderness, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding Jealousies and suspitions, backbitings, censurings, provokings, secret risings of spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; but in all offences to follow the rule of the Lord Jesus, and to bear and forbear, give and forgive as he hath taught us.</p>
            <p>In publick or private we will willingly doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the offence of the Church; but will be willing to take advice for our selves and ours, as occasion shall be presented.</p>
            <p>We will not in the Congregation be forward either to shew our own gifts and parts, in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and scrupling or there discover the weaknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and failings of our Brethren, but attend an orderly call thereunto, knowing how much the

Lord may be dishonoured, and his Gospel &amp; the profession of it slighted by our distempers and weaknesses in publick.</p>
            <p>We bind ourselves to study the advancement of the Gospel in all truth and peace, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of those that are within or without, no way slighting our Sister Churches, but using their counsel as need shall be, not laying a stumbling block before any, no not the Indians, whose good we desire to promote, and so to converse as we may avoid the very appearance of evil.</p>
            <p>We doe hereby promise to carry our selves in all lawfull obedience to those that are over us in Church or Commonwealth, knowing how well pleasing it will be to the Lord that they should have encouragement in their places, by not grieving their spirits through our irregularityes.</p>
            <p>We resolve to approve our selves to the Lord in our particular Callings, shunning idleness as the bane of any State, nor will we deal hardly or oppressingly with any wherein we are the Lords Stewards.</p>
            <p>Also promising to our best ability to teach our Children and Servants the knowledge of God and his will, that they may serve him also; and all this not by any strength of our own, but by the Lord Christ, whose blood we desire may sprinkle this our Covenant made in his Name.</p>

               <hi>This forementioned Covenant was often read and Renewed by the Church at the end of dayes of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, especially in the year</hi> 1660, <hi>on the sixth of the first moneth; when also considering the hour of Temptation amongst us by reason of the Quakers Doctrine, to the levening of some in the place where we are, and endangering of others, we doe see cause to remember the admonition of our Saviour Christ unto his Disciples, Math.</hi> 16. Take heed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the leven of the doctrine of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees. <hi>And doe judge (so far as we understand it) that the Quakers doctrine is as bad or worse then that of the Pharisees.

            <p n="1">1. We doe give up our selves to that God whose name alone is Jehovah, Father, Son and Spirit, as the only true and living God, and unto our Lord Jesus Christ, as our only Redeemer and Saviour, as the only Prophet, Priest &amp; King over our Souls, and only Mediator of the Covenant of Grace, engaging our hearts unto this God in Christ by the help of his Spirit of Grace, to cleave unto him as our God and chief good, and unto Jesus Christ as our Mediator by Faith, in a

way of Gospel Obedience, as becometh his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant People for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We doe also give up our Offspring unto God in Jesus Christ, avouching the Lord to be our God and the God of our Children, and our selves with our Children to be his People, humbly ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Grace of God in Christ Jesus, that we &amp; our Children may be looked upon as the Lords.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p>And whereas the Elders and Messengers of these Churches have met together in the late Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod to enquire into the Reasons of the Lords Controversy with his people, have taken notice of many provoking Evils as the procuring causes of the Judgements of God upon <hi>New-England,</hi> so far as we or any of us have been guilty of those Evils, or any of them, (according to any light held forth by them from Scripture) we desire from

our hearts to bewail it before the Lord; and humbly to entreat for pardoning mercy for the sake of the blood of the everlasting Covenant. And as an expedient unto Reformation of those Evils, or whatever else have provoked the Eyes of Gods glory amongst us, we do promise and engage our selves in the presence of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we will (by the help of Christ) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour every one to reform his own heart and life, by seeking to mortify all our sins, and to walk more close with God then ever we have done, and to uphold the power of godliness, and that we will continue to worship God, in publick, private and secret, and this (as God shall help us) without formality and hypocrisie, and more fully and faithfully then heretofore, to discharge all Covenant duties one towards another in a way of Church Communion.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We promise by the help of Christ, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our Families, and to walk before God in our houses with a perfect heart, and that we will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Worship of God therein continually, as he in his Word doth require both in respect of prayer, and reading of the Scriptures, and that we will do what lyes in us to bring up our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for God, and therefore will (so far as there shall be need of it) Catechize them, and exhort and charge them to fear and serve the Lord, and endeavour to set an holy Example before them, and be much in prayer for their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Salvation.</p>
