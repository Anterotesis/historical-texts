            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A DIALOGUE between a MINISTER and his PARISHIONER, concerning the HALF-WAY-COVENANT.</head>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pariſhioner.</speaker>
                     <p>SIR, this third viſit I am come to make you, for I have lately read a piece, printed at <hi>New-London,</hi> entituled, "A dialogue between a miniſter and his pariſhioner, concerning the half-way-covenant <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued;</hi>" ſaid to be written by one of the moſt learned and ingenious miniſters in the colony. I hope, therefore, now, if ever, by the aſſiſtance of ſuch a patron, to be able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry my point,—Inſtructed by him, I give up the half-way-covenant; I grant there is but one covenant. I give up the half-way-practice too, as founded only in ignorance, and the miſtaken notions of the vulgar. I am convinced, that he that is qualified to have his children baptized, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually qualified to come to the Lord's-table.—I come, therefore, to claim baptiſm for my child, and a place at the Lord's-table for myſelf, as my proper right. p. 6.—How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I am not well pleaſed at the publication of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in my firſt viſit, altho' I muſt confeſs you have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a fair repreſentation of what paſſed, becauſe being very dull at that time, I make but a very indifferent figure in the eyes of the public. p. 2.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Miniſter.</speaker>
                     <p>Be comforted, my friend, no blame is laid on you by the public. I bear it all; and I am willing to bear it for your good: and methinks you have only cauſe of joy and thankfulneſs; for, to be convinced, ſo ſoon, of your miſtake, is no ſmall favour. No doubt the voice of the clergy, who practice the half-way, declaring as one man, that he, who is qualified to offer his child, to baptiſm, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually qualified to come to the Lord's-table, has wrought your conviction; for your former faith and practice were
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011174_0003_0F857FDF9DAB7D50"/>
grounded merely on the cuſtom of the country: this led you to think, that the Lord's-ſupper was more holy than baptiſm. But while you hear all the miniſters, with whom you converſe, declare, they mean no ſuch thing; they prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the half-way only in condeſcention to the ignorance and groundleſs, unſcriptural ſcruples of the common people, you are convinced; you give up the point: you own the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, <hi>do this in remembrance of me,</hi> is binding on all his diſciples.—But, pray, upon what grounds, do you now ſo boldly claim baptiſm for your child?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>Altho' I was "uncommonly dull and muddy," in my firſt viſit; yet <q>you know, ſir, what I wanted was to have my child baptized. As you told me there was but one covenant, ſo we were agreed, that I had entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that covenant, the very ſame covenant that you entered into three and thirty years ago, when you was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the church. And, ſir, why may I not have the ſeal of it ſet upon my child? p. 4.</q>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>M.</speaker>
                     <p>Did not I expreſsly tell you, that <q>If the covenant owned is the covenant of grace, and if the parent acts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandingly &amp; honeſtly in the affair, he is a good man, he has a right before God to baptiſm for his children, and an equal right to the Lord's-ſupper? But that if the covenant owned is not the covenant of grace, thoſe who have owned it, have in the ſight of God no right to either of thoſe ordinances which are ſeals of that covenant, and of no other: no more right than if they had given their aſſent to any chapter in the aprocrypha?</q>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>True, you did ſo—and there is but <hi>one covenant,</hi> ſays my patron.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>M.</speaker>
                     <p>This covenant then is the covenant of grace, which, we are all agreed, requires repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: or elſe there is no covenant of grace at all—for he ſays there is but one.—But lay your hand upon your heart, and tell me the truth honeſtly, did you mean to profeſs repentance toward God &amp; faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when you owned the covenant? or in other words, did you mean to profeſs a compliance with
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011174_0003_0F857FDF9DAB7D50"/>
the covenant of grace? Pray, ſir, recollect and repeat the very words you ſpake to me in your firſt viſit.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>You make me bluſh—for I told you the truth in my firſt viſit, from the bottom of my heart; and this is what I ſaid, <q>I knew myſelf to be unconverted.—I meant to own the covenant, as the phraſe is, and have my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren baptiſed; but I had no deſign to profeſs godlineſs, or to pretend a real compliance with the covenant of grace. This godly people may do; but it had been great hypocriſy in me to do it. To lie to men is bad, but to lie to God is worſe. I ſuppoſed that owning the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was what the unconverted might do.</q> Theſe were my very words: and on theſe principles I acted, as do all others, that I am acquainted with, who own the covenant, have their children baptiſed, and do not come to the Lord's table; and I verily tho't this was right before my firſt viſit.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>M.</speaker>
                     <p>How is it poſſible a man, ſo honeſt as you <hi>then</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be, ſhould <hi>now</hi> act ſuch a diſhoneſt part, as you have done? It is my duty as a miniſter of Chriſt, to rebuke you ſharply; for <hi>then</hi> you told me, as you <hi>now</hi> own, that you did not mean to profeſs a compliance with the covenant of grace, upon which I denied baptiſm to your child; and yet <hi>juſt now</hi> you pretended you did mean to do it.—You have need to bluſh—This deliberate diſſimulation in ſuch an affair, is no ſmall crime. Did your learned patron adviſe you to this ſtep, to get your child baptiſed? Is this the way to obtain God's bleſſing?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>Be this as it may, I am willing now to make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and publickly to enter into covenant with God, and I have no objection againſt the form uſed in your church. I can make that covenant, and ſpeak truly in the ſight of God, notwithſtanding I know I have no grace. p. 6, 7.</p>

                     <speaker>M.</speaker>
                     <p>How can a man who knows he has no grace profeſs a compliance with the covenant of grace, without wilful lying?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>I do not mean to make a profeſſion that ſhall imply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. There would be 'ſpecial hypocriſy' in doing ſo. p. 14.</p>

                     <speaker>M.</speaker>
                     <p>What then! do you ſuppoſe the unconverted do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the covenant of grace? That the unconverted have
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011174_0004_0F857FE01A637670"/>
repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? That the unconverted chooſe the Lord Jehovah for their ſovereign Lord and ſupreme good thro' Jeſus Chriſt, and give up themſelves to his ſervice, to walk in all his ways, ſeeking his glory?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P.</speaker>
                     <p>No, ſir, by no means. But <q>if it be true that the Lord Jehovah is my ſovereign Lord and ſupreme good thro' Jeſus Chriſt. i. e. if it be true, that he who thro' Chriſt is the author of being, and of every mercy, to all the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the ſovereign Lord and ſupreme good of every living ſoul, 'tis no harm to avouch it.</q> I mean to give my aſſent to this truth, and no more.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>M.</speaker>
                     <p>Doth not the devil believe the truth of this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as firmly as any wicked man does? and is he in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? You have need to be better inſtructed about the nature of entering into covenant with God, before you can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as qualified in point of doctrinal knowledge.</p>

                     <p>No, ſir, I am not ſo ignorant neither. I know in what ſenſe you mean to underſtand your covenant. But knowing myſelf to be unconverted, I cannot profeſs a compliance with the covenant of Grace in that ſenſe. I cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs ſupreme love to God, and that I do actually take him as my God, my chief good, thro' Jeſus Chriſt. This is not in my heart. Therefore I mean to adopt the words of the covenant in a different ſenſe; even in a ſenſe, in which, an unconverted man, who is at enmity againſt God, may uſe them, and yet ſpeak true.</p>

                     <p>But this is not to profeſs a compliance with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. And therefore ſhould you make it, it could give you no right to ſealing ordinances for yourſelf or your child. Rather is it groſs and ſcandalous diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, very much like what is practiſed by <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> among the clergy of the church of <hi>England,</hi> when they ſubſcribe the 39 articles, in order to qualify themſelves for a benefice upon the eſtabliſhment; which practice is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by all honeſt men.</p>

                     <p>The obedience engaged by one who profeſſes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the covenant of grace is that kind of obedience which the covenant requires, viz. An holy obedience, an obedience which proceeds from faith and love. And do you mean to engage this?</p>

                     <p>No, by no means. I mean only to engage what an unconverted man may do, while ſuch. p. 7. <note n="*" place="bottom">Other writers maintain, that ſuch as know themſelves to be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, when they join in full communion with the church, are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage that very kind of obedience required in the covenant of grace, from that time and forward till they die. They are not to profeſs that they have as yet loved God, believed in Chriſt, repented of their ſins, or liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed holy lives, but they are to engage that they will do all this as ſoon as ever they have Joined with the church, and from that time forward till they die. This is Mr. <hi>Beckwith</hi>'s ſcheme, Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Green,</hi> p. 26. — If theſe profeſſors are ſo near being converted in their own judgments, really and honeſtly, that they do expect to be actually converted as ſoon as they have joined with the church, it is a pity they do not put off their public profeſſion till the next ſabbath; and ſo be converted firſt: and then they might make a full profeſſion of a preſent compliance with the covenant of grace, and ſo the whole controverſy might be ended. This is always the way that honeſt people take when they enter into the marriage covenant, to which this writer compares this tranſaction. They do not come and preſent themſelves before the prieſt to enter into the marriage covenant, till they begin to love each other. And now they can with a good conſcience give their conſent to the whole marriage co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as being conſcious to themſelves that they already have ſuch an heart in them. But ſhould a pair offer to be married, who had thro' their whole courtſhip, and to that moment, been at enmity againſt each other, as much as <hi>Paul</hi> declares every <hi>carnal mind</hi> to be <hi>againſt God.</hi> Rom. 8.7.

                     <p>But this unholy obedience is not that kind of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which the covenant of grace requires at your hands. So that you mean to profeſs neither to comply with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace at preſent, nor to live ſuch a holy life as it requires for the future. In ſhort, you mean to uſe the words of a ſaint with the heart of a hypocrite; and ſo to come into Chriſt's viſible church, with the language of a friend; but with the heart of an enemy.

                        </q> p. 8. And it is damnable hereſy to teach that the unconverted ought not to pray. p. 9. And if they ſin in praying, yet it is leſs ſin to pray, than not to pray. p. 12.</p>

                     <p>It is a greater ſin to lie, than to do nothing. Lying is not a means of grace. Lying is not an appointed means of converſion. There are many things unconverted ſinners may ſay to God, and ſpeak true. To ſpeak the truth to God is well. Jam. 2.19. but to ſay that which they know is not true is a thouſand times worſe than to ſay nothing. Mat. 23, 14. Acts 5.3. And for a man who is ſenſible, that it is not in his heart to forgive thoſe who have treſpaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and that in fact he does not forgive them, to come into the preſence of God, and pray, ſaying, <hi>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,</hi> is, implicitly, to aſk
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011174_0006_0F857FE31F4B71B0"/>
God not to forgive him; but this is a greater ſin than not to pray at all, as all will allow; and it will hold true, as true as any "theorem in Euclid," that lying is worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in praying, in covenanting, and in every thing elſe.</p>

But for a man to profeſs a compliance with the covenant of grace, when he knows he has no grace is no better; and yet without ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion no man can viſibly enter into covenant with God. For God has no other covenant extant, of which baptiſm and Lord's-ſupper, are ſeals; for there is but one covenant, as you allow; and to uſe the words of this covenant in ſuch a ſenſe, as to make it a graceleſs half-covenant, gives no more right to ſealing ordinances, than to repeat any chapter in the apocrypha.</p>

So a man whoſe mind is wavering between God and mammon, inclining ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to one maſter with a view to his future intereſt, and ſometimes to the other from an attachment to his preſent, may not be able to ſay, which maſter upon the whole he chooſes, for <hi>the double minded man is unſtable in all his ways.</hi> But Chriſt does not deſire men to make a profeſſion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And when men are come to that ſettled determination, which our Saviour there deſcribes, they may ſay, that they have come to it. And this is all the profeſſion which we deſire.</p>

                     <p>Thus far I have acted the part of a diſputant, and I have now done. Suffer me therefore once more to reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that honeſt character which I ſuſtained in my firſt viſit; for let others ſay, what they will, I deſign to act an honeſt part. Now the truth of the caſe is this, I am not ſpecially concerned to know by what rule the church muſt be governed in admitting members, neither am I concerned to know what they muſt do who are in doubt about themſelves; the only queſtion about which I am exerciſed relates to my own particular caſe. I know I have no grace. I know I am unconverted. I told you ſo at firſt, and ſo I have told all the miniſters with whom I have converſed; and how any man, that knows he has no grace, can profeſs a compliance with the covenant of grace, &amp; ſpeak true, I could not underſtand years ago. It was this that induced me to own the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as the phraſe is, &amp; not to join in full communion, that ſo I might have my children baptiſed. Not one of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with whom I have converſed, appears to juſtify the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples upon which I acted; but all as one man, ſay, there is but one covenant, &amp; this one covenant is the covenant of grace: indeed they explain away the covenant of grace, till they bring it down into a graceleſs covenant, and then tell me I can comply with that, and ought to do ſo, and thus join in full communion. But you have fully convinced me of the inconſiſtence and abſurdity of this; and yet I would beg leave to enquire, why might not the covenant of grace be voted out, by the church, and a graceleſs covenant be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in its room? and then ſuch as I am could conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently profeſs a compliance with ſuch a covenant, and have baptiſm for their children.</p>

chriſtianity, how could it any longer be conſidered as a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible church of Chriſt, or as having a viſible right to the viſible ſeals of God's covenant?—And beſides, ſhould you bind your child to one of your neighbours, to learn ſome mechanic art, why, in this caſe, might not the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be ſealed, ratified and confirmed by the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of baptiſm, <hi>In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt?</hi>

                     <p>The propoſal ſhocks my mind. It would be a profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's holy ordinance, to take God's ſeal, appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to God's covenant, and put it to man's covenant.</p>

                     <p>But this ungracious covenant is man's covenant, and not God's. And to take God's ſeal, appropriated to God's covenant, even to the covenant of grace, and apply it to a covenant which God never made, to a covenant made by men, is to profane the holy ordinance: and knowingly to profane God's holy ordinance is not a duty, nor is this to put ourſelves in the way of a bleſſing.</p>

                     <p>It is not the manner of men to put a ſeal to a clean piece of paper. Nor did God ever appoint ſeals to be put to a blank. God's ſeals were appointed to be put to God's covenant; and we have no right to put them to a blank: and beſides, it would be to give up the import of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to render ſealing ordinances unmeaning, empty, uſeleſs ceremonies.</p>

concerning the Half-way-covenant,</hi> ſaid, <q>There is no half-way-covenant. Doubtleſs it is the covenant of grace. No one diſputes its being the covenant of grace;—no one DARE DENY IT.</q>— And your preſent patron ſays much the ſame.—You remember alſo, that in your <hi>ſecond viſit,</hi> I told you, that, to ſay this, was implicitly to "yield up every point for which we contend;" and, in this view, I added, <q>nor do I doubt, if this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy ſhould go on, it will ſoon appear, that there is <hi>one who dares deny it.</hi> For otherwiſe all men of ſenſe will ſee, that gentlemen on that ſide of the queſtion, are groſsly inconſiſtent with themſelves.</q>—And now it hath come to paſs, that one of the moſt diſcerning gentlemen on that ſide of the queſtion has publiſhed a laboured piece, to prove, that in order to enjoy ſealing ordinances for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and our children, we are not to profeſs a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the covenant of grace, but only with a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs covenant. This therefore is the only point, that needs to be ſettled, in order to ſettle the whole controverſy; to this point therefore I adviſe you to give a moſt ſerious attention. For, if it can be proved, that baptiſm and the Lord's-Supper are ſeals of the covenant of grace, and not of a graceleſs covenant, <hi>the ax will be laid to the root of the tree.</hi> Attend, therefore, to the ſubject with the utmoſt impartiality, that you may obtain, not only light in your head, but alſo reap ſaving advantage to your ſoul. I have known ſome chriſtleſs ſinners, by the means of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, awakened to a greater concern about their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation, than ever they were before. And, be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſir, that the truths of the goſpel, if they are not unto your own ſoul <hi>a ſavour of life unto life,</hi> will be <hi>a ſavour of death unto death.</hi>—Eternity— an endleſs eternity lies before you. You have ſlept ſecure in ſin long enough; it is high time you ſhould awake. Every circumſtance of your own ſoul, and every circumſtance of your dear off-ſpring calls upon you without delay to awake, and turn to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity and truth.—O, what joy, would it give me, ere long, to admit you into full communion

                  <list>

                     <item>III. <hi>All ſcruples to the contrary are groundleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>There is therefore, but one ſingle point, which now needs to be ſettled, to ſettle the whole controverſy, viz. <hi>With what covenant are we to profeſs a compliance, the covenant of grace, or a graceleſs covenant?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this point is of ſuch a nature, that it ſeems neceſſary to ſettle it, before we proceed to act at all in church affairs; in gathering a church, ſettling a miniſter, admitting mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or adminiſtring ſealing ordinances. For 'till this is ſettled, we know not upon what covenant the church is to be formed, nor what covenant is to be profeſſed by thoſe who are to be admitted, nor what covenant is to be ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper, nor what covenant the miniſter is to preach up and hold out to public view, as the thing to be complied with by profeſſors and to be ſealed by the ſacraments. So that if we mean to proceed like rational creatures, in our church-affairs, we muſt look this matter to the bottom, and come to a determination.</p>
                  <p>To ſay, that it is needleſs to determine this point, is the ſame thing as to ſay, that it is of no conſequence whether our churches are founded on a right covenant, or on a wrong one; or whether God's ſeals are fixed to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant he deſigned, or to a covenant to which he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they ſhould be affixed; which none will care to ſay: For, if it is of no conſequence what covenant we profeſs, nor what covenant we ſeal, a right one, or a wrong one; it is
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:011174_0010_0F857FE8C585AA70"/>
ſurely of no conſequence whether we profeſs or ſeal any covenant at all; which to ſay, is to tear up by the roots all notion of a viſible church in the world. But to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide a viſible church, as a needleſs thing, is to ſet aſide chriſtianity, as an impoſture. There muſt be chriſtian churches; there muſt be a public profeſſion of ſome cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or other; there muſt be ſealing ordinances; theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances muſt be adminiſtered by the miniſters of Chriſt to the proper ſubjects; it muſt be determined who they are; it muſt, therefore, be determined on what covenant church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are to be formed, and what covenant is to be preached up, profeſſed and ſealed. It is a controverſy, which no honeſt man, who means to have any thing to do in church-affairs, can let alone, as a mere circumſtantial point. Much leſs can thoſe, who are already in the miniſtry, or are about to ſettle in that work, conſiſtently content themſelves to proceed without any ſettled ſcheme at all; unleſs all they aim at, is to live a quiet life, right or wrong; which is what none will profeſs to do.</p>
                  <p>OUR churches were originally founded on a profeſſion of a compliance with the covenant of grace, at leaſt, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. And, indeed, I know not of one church in New-England, of our own denomination, which is now other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe founded, if we may judge of their foundation by the words of the covenant which is read to thoſe who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to full communion. So far as I know, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulas in uſe, expreſs the chief things contained in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, &amp;c. "That they avouch the Lord to be their God and chief good, and give up themſelves to him, thro' Jeſus Chriſt, to live to him and ſeek his glory." And therefore, ſhould we be convinced, that the covenant of grace is not the covenant with which the church of Chriſt ought to profeſs a compliance, there ought to be an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our formulas. For, as they ſtand at preſent, they tend to lead all perſons whoſe conſciences are awake, to think they ought to be converted, before they make a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of religion, &amp; join in full communion with the church. For, ſuch do not think it right to profeſs a compliance with
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:011174_0011_0F857FEA549754F0"/>
the covenant of grace, when they know they have no grace. Nor do they think it conſiſtent with moral honeſty, to give their conſent to the covenant in a ſenſe different from it's plain and natural ſenſe. There is a neceſſity, therefore, if the covenant of grace is not the covenant which ought to be entered into, to call our churches together, to point out to them plainly this fundamental error in their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and to lead them to vote out the covenant of grace, and to vote in a graceleſs covenant, in order to open a wide and effectual door to let ungodly men as ſuch, into our churches. And in this method, may be adapted regularly, the new ſcheme advanced, by the <hi>Rev. Mr. Moſes Mather,</hi> an ingenious writer, in his piece lately publiſhed, entitled, "The viſible church in covenant with God," &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This author has offered this doctrine of an <hi>external grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs covenant</hi> to public conſideration, as taught in <hi>the word of God,</hi> and as the only conſiſtent plan on which the viſible church can be founded, and infant baptiſm vindicated. He had no deſire, it may be preſumed, that his ſcheme ſhould be received by our churches without examination. The ſtricteſt ſcrutiny cannot hurt the truth. The truth, like the ſun, can bear to be looked upon, without any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its luſture. A glow-worm is in danger of loſing its brightneſs, if the light of day ſhines around it. This may be the nature of error; but the truth itſelf, the more ſtrictly it is examined, the more will it appear to be like <hi>the morning light, which ſhines more and more to the perfect day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our confeſſion of faith and plan of church diſcipline have determined for "the covenant of grace," declaring that "ſacraments are holy ſigns and ſeals of the covenant of grace;" and for the neceſſity of a profeſſion of a "cordial ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt." But theſe are not <hi>the word of God.</hi> Mr. Mather undertakes to prove his doctrine from <hi>the word of God.</hi> And we ought, with the utmoſt readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to give up all human compoſures, when found incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with <hi>the word of God.</hi> He appeals to ſcripture: we join in the appeal; and let him that readeth, underſtand.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. I.</hi> The nature of Mr. M's external, graceleſs covenant it's difference from the covenant of grace, and a general view of the ſubject.</head>
                  <p>BY the <hi>covenant of grace,</hi> Mr. M. means, that covenant with which every true believer complies in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of repentance towards God and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and which promiſes pardon and eternal life to all who comply with it. Or to uſe his own words, "A ſure promiſe of eternal life, to all ſuch, as with a true heart, believe in Jeſus Chriſt." P. 4. And in this we are agreed. But he maintains, that this is not the covenant, a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with which is to be publickly profeſſed by any of the followers of Chriſt, when they join in full communion with the church. It is a chief deſign of this piece to prove this point. And in this we differ.</p>
                  <p>BY the <hi>external covenant,</hi> he means, not the covenant of grace, externally entered into, by a public profeſſion of a compliance with it, which is what ſome divines have meant by the phraſe; but a covenant ſpecifically different from the covenant of grace. It differs from it in three things. (1.) The covenant of grace requires holineſs, a holy faith, a holy repentance, a holy obedience: The external cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant requires no holineſs at all. (2.) The covenant of grace is complied with by none but the regenerate, in the exerciſe of holineſs: The external covenant may be complied with by the unregenerate, by thoſe that have no grace, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious, unholy exerciſes. (3.) The covenant of grace promiſes eternal life: The external covenant promiſes no ſuch thing; but leaves thoſe who comply with it, &amp; do no more, under the ſentence of the divine law to eternal death. This appears through the whole performance. We main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011174_0012_0F857FEB8EB00668"/>
that there is no ſuch covenant—he endeavours to prove that this is the only covenant, a compliance with which was profeſſed by Abraham, by the Iſraelites in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and by the apoſtolic converts, when they entered vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly into covenant with God, and became members of God's viſible church; as will be plain to any one that reads his book. We affirm that a profeſſion of a compliance with this covenant never was required by God of any man.</p>
                  <p>THERE is a covenant of grace, indeed, according to Mr. M. which promiſes eternal life to the true believer, to which this external covenant, he ſays, ſerves, as means to the end; p. 9. But a compliance with this covenant of grace never was required, and never was profeſſed, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſealing ordinances, under the old teſtament or the new; for the ſeals were not deſigned primarily to be ſeals of the covenant of grace, but of a gracelſs covenant, with which graceleſs men may comply in the ſight of God, while ſuch. And ſo there is no need of a compliance with the covenant of grace, in order to a conſiſtent attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on ſealing ordinances. P. 36, 37. As graceleſs men may comply with this graceleſs covenant; ſo they may conſiſtently be active in ſealing it. And ſo there is not the leaſt need of our being born again, or the leaſt occaſion of a profeſſion of godlineſs, or making any pretence of love to God or Chriſt; or to vital piety in order to a regular admiſſion into the church of Chriſt. We need not be ſaints in reality, or in profeſſion; in the ſight of God, or in the ſight of men; no ſuch thing is required: no ſuch thing is pretended. For "The external covenant does not reſpect a gracious ſtate of heart, as the qualification requiſite, to a perſon's entering into it." P. 22. <hi>A church of Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is a congregation, in which, there is no viſible profeſſion made of real chriſtianity;</hi> i. e. <hi>of friendſhip to Chriſt, or of chriſtian grace, or of any thing but what is conſiſtent with a ſtate of total enmity to God and Chriſt, and to all ſpiritual good.</hi> This is Mr. M.'s idea of a viſible church; and any higher profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he thinks, of very bad tendency. P. 51, 52, 53.</p>
                  <p>IF the leaſt ſpark of grace is required in the external co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011174_0012_0F857FEB8EB00668"/>
or if the leaſt ſpark of grace is profeſſed in viſibly entering into it, then the man that knows he has no grace, but is dead in ſin, cannot make a profeſſion, and Mr. M.'s end is fruſtrated, which was to open a wide and effectual door for ſuch as know themſelves to be ungodly to join in full communion with the church.</p>
                  <p>AND if this external covenant does not require the leaſt degree of grace or holineſs; then it requires nothing but ungracious, unholy, ſinful performance, (for Mr. M. will not chooſe to ſay, that their is a ſyſtem of religious voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, affections and actions, which are neither virtuous nor vicious, neither holy nor ſinful, neither conformable to the holy nature and law of God, nor unconformable; for this would be to ſuppoſe that the divine law is not a univerſal rule of life.)—So that, altho' Abraham and all Abraham's ſpiritual ſeed, when they firſt comply with the covenant of grace exerciſe real holineſs, and live in the exerciſe of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thro' the courſe of their lives, agreeable to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's character of them, in Mat. 7.24. and attend the means of grace in a holy manner, (Mat. 13.8.) and even hate and abhor that impenitent, ſelf-righteous, ſinful manner in which all the ungodly attend them, (Prov. 15.8.) Yet when they come to make a public profeſſion, they are to covenant and promiſe to attend all means in no better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than that, in which, impenitent, ſelf-righteous ſinners do. For they are publickly to profeſs and promiſe nothing but a compliance with the external covenant: and the ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ternal covenant requires nothing more.—And having made this ungodly profeſſion, and by covenant bound themſelves to attend all means of grace in this manner, they ſet to it God's appointed ſeal; and this unholy covenant the moſt holy Chriſtian is to renew and ſeal every time he comes to the table of the Lord till he dies; which, how it can poſſibly be done with a good conſcience, Mr. M. has not yet told us.<note n="*" place="bottom">The external covenant it a graceleſs covenant, ſuited to the hearts of graceleſs men. Therefore to be in heart conformed to the external covenant, is to have a heart deſtitute of grace. Every true convert there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore renounces the external covenant in his heart at the time of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and complies with the covenant of grace. Nor can he ever go back to the external covenant in his heart without falling from grace. So that if Abraham was in the covenant of grace before, as Mr. M. ſays he was, p. 8. then he fell from grace when he entered into the external covenant. And if by ſealing the external covenant he obliged himſelf to conform to it as long as he lived, he did thereby bind himſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue unconverted till death. But the covenant with Abraham was an <hi>everlaſting covenant.</hi> Gen. 17, 7. To which Abraham was obliged to conform in heart and life as long as he lived.</note>

                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:011174_0013_0F857FEC22AC7ED0"/>THUS we have taken a brief and general view of Mr. M.'s ſcheme of an external graceleſs covenant. I think I underſtand him right. But if any of his admirers ſhould ſay, this is not his ſcheme, but the external covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires real holineſs, and the public profeſſion is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, a profeſſion of godlineſs, then thoſe, who know themſelves to be unconverted, are as much ſhut out from full communion in the viſible church on his ſcheme, as on the ſcheme of our forefathers; which Dr. <hi>Increaſe Mather,</hi> affirmed to be the ſcheme of proteſtants in general, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to papiſts. "I do readily acknowledge," ſays he, <q>that as it is only a juſtifying faith which giveth right to baptiſm before God, ſo it is the profeſſion or viſibility of this faith that giveth right thereunto before the church. Some have maintained that a <hi>dogmatical hiſtorical</hi> faith, or faith of <hi>aſſent</hi> to the truth of the goſpel, doth entitle to baptiſm. But the common proteſtant doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the papiſts, ſpeaketh otherwiſe.</q>

                  <p>But the queſtion now before us is not what was the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of proteſtants or papiſts? but a queſtion much more intereſting, viz. What is the doctrine of the bible? the only book we are obliged to believe and obey on pain of God's eternal wrath. And the queſtion is, What is God's covenant, which is to be profeſſed and ſealed; a gracious, or an ungracious covenant? What was the Abrahamic co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant? and what the covenant into which the Iſraelites pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to enter in the wilderneſs? and what is that covenant revealed in the goſpel, of which baptiſm and the Lord's-ſupper are ſeals? an holy covenant? or an unholy one?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:011174_0013_0F857FEC22AC7ED0"/>But before we enter on the ſubject, it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to obſerve, that Mr. M. has given up the grounds on which Mr. <hi>Jonathan Dickinſon,</hi> and after him Mr. <hi>Peter Clark,</hi> vindicated infant baptiſm, viz. That the covenant with Abraham was the covenant of grace. See Mr. <hi>Clark's defence of infant baptiſm, ch.</hi> iv. in which the covenant with Abraham is proved to be the covenant of grace; and Dr. <hi>Gill's</hi> objections, in his piece againſt Mr. <hi>Dickinſon;</hi> ſome of them the ſame with Mr. <hi>Mather's,</hi> are anſwered.— And Mr. M. endeavours to lay a new foundation for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm, perhaps never before laid by any writer on that ſubject, viz. An external graceleſs covenant; and what the effect among common people will be, if they ſhall ſee Mr. M.'s external covenant proved to be a mere non-entity, cannot yet be known. But if any are ſhaken in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of infant baptiſm, when they find Mr. M.'s foundation give way under them, they ought to remember, that the defenders of infant baptiſm have not built their arguments on this foundation, but always on a ſuppoſition, that the covenant with Abraham was the covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Boſtwick,</hi> late miniſter of the preſbyterian church, in New-York, in his <hi>vindication of infant baptiſm,</hi> p. 19, ſays, <q>
                        <hi>The covenant made with Abraham was a covenant of grace, and the ſame for ſubſtance that is now in force under the goſpel.</hi> This I look upon to be the grand turning point on which the iſſue of the controverſy very much depends; for if Abraham's covenant, which included his infant children, and gave them a right to circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was not the covenant of grace, then I freely confeſs that the main ground on which we aſſert the right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to baptiſm is taken away; and conſequently the principal arguments in ſupport of the doctrine are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</q>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now theſe are the contents of the covenant with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, in Gen. 12; where it is firſt of all mentioned; <q>Now the Lord had ſaid unto Abram, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's houſe, unto a land that I will ſhew thee.

And I will bleſs them that bleſs thee, and curſe him that curſeth thee; and <hi>in thee ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed.</hi>
                     </q> And was this a graceleſs covenant, or the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry goſpel of Chriſt? Hear what an inſpired apoſtle ſaith, Gal. 3.8. <hi>And the ſcripture foreſeeing that God would juſtify the heathen thro' faith, preached before the</hi> GOSPEL <hi>unto Abraham, ſaying,</hi> IN THEE SHALL ALL NATIONS BE BLESSED. And in Gen. 12.4; follows an account of Abraham's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance. <hi>So Abram departed, as the Lord had ſpoken unto him.</hi> He did not merely "endeavour," but he actually complied. And was this done <hi>in faith,</hi> or in <hi>a graceleſs</hi> manner? Take the anſwer from an inſpired writer.

                  </p>
                  <p>AND this ſame covenant was renewed on GOD'S part in Gen. 15.5. <hi>And he brought him forth abroad, and ſaid, look now toward heaven, and tell the ſtars, if thou be able to number them.

                  </p>
                  <p>AND in chap, 17. This ſame covenant was renewed again,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011174_0014_0F857FECDDF44620"/>
with this additional declaration, <hi>I am God almighty,</hi> abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all-ſufficient. For he had before ſaid, chap. 15. <hi>I am thy ſhield, and exceeding great reward;</hi> which is ſomething of a higher nature than what is promiſed by Mr. M.'s exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal covenant; yea, it is added, <hi>to be a God to thee, and thy ſeed after thee.</hi> In conſequence of which he was called <hi>the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob:</hi> and what is implied in this we may learn from, Heb. 11.16. <hi>Wherefore God is not aſhamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.</hi> Yea, all the great bleſſings of the goſpel are ſummed up in one promiſe, Rev. 21.7. <hi>He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things,</hi> AND I WILL BE HIS GOD. And this divine injunction was added at this ſeaſon of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing this covenant, <hi>walk before me and be thou perfect;</hi> which implied a life of real holineſs, and ſincere devoted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God.</p>
                  <p>Mr. M.'s external covenant requires no higher kind of faith, than the devil has, &amp; nothing but ungracious, unholy obedience, which thoſe who are dead in ſin may perform: But neither this faith nor this obedience were the faith and obedience of Abraham. Mr. M.'s covenant requires what <hi>James</hi> calls a <hi>dead faith,</hi> by which no man can be juſtified; but Abraham's was a <hi>living faith,</hi> by which he was juſtified, and by which all others will be juſtified who have it. And his obedience was an holy obedience, ſuch as is peculiar to the friends of God. Mr. M.'s external covenant, is adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the temper and ſtate of the unconverted, requiring only ſuch religious exerciſes as may take place in them: But Abraham was not in an unconverted ſtate; and ſo Mr. M.'s external covenant was not adapted to the temper and ſtate in which he was, if the reader will be at the pains to take his bible and turn to Gen. 12, and read the whole hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Abraham's life, he will not find the leaſt hint of more than one covenant with Abraham; nor was one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy duty ever required at his hands: rather, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, theſe were the expreſs words of God Almighty to him, <hi>walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi>—If therefore we judge of the nature of the covenant with Abraham, as we do of all
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011174_0015_0F857FED9B2C7390"/>
other written covenants, viz. By the contents of the written inſtrument, there is no room to doubt.</p>
                  <p>AND now this covenant being thus made, and thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed from time to time, thro' the ſpace of above twenty years, an external ſeal was at length by GOD appointed to it. For circumciſion was appointed as a token of this very covenant, which was made with Abraham before he was circumciſed. For an inſpired apoſtle has ſaid it. Rom. 4.9, 10, 11. <hi>Cometh this bleſſedneſs,</hi> (viz. that ſpoken of in the foregoing verſe, <hi>bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute ſin) then upon the circumciſion only, or upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion alſo? for we ſay, that faith was reckoned to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham for righteouſneſs. How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumciſion, or in uncircumciſion? not in circumciſion, but in uncircumciſion. And he received the ſign of circumciſion, a ſeal</hi> (not of Mr. M.'s external covenant, but) <hi>of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the faith which he had yet being uncircumciſed; that he might be the father</hi> (not of thoſe graceleſs men, that enter into Mr. M.'s graceleſs covenant, but) <hi>of all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;—that righteouſneſs might be imputed to them alſo.</hi> That all who comply with that covenant as Abraham did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, might be juſtified and ſaved, as he was. From all which it is evident, that that covenant with which Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham viſibly complied, when in obedience to GOD'S call, he ſeperated himſelf and his family from the idolatrous world, to worſhip the true GOD only, and to believe in, and wait for the coming of the Meſſiah, whoſe <hi>day he ſaw, and was glad,</hi> was not Mr. M.'s external graceleſs covenant, by which no man can be juſtified and ſaved; but the covenant of grace, which promiſes eternal life to thoſe who comply with it; <hi>for God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi> Mat. 22, 31, 32; and that circumciſion was a ſeal of this very covenant. Which were the points to be proved.</p>
                  <p>There is not one text in the new-teſtament where the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the covenant with Abraham is pointed out, but that it is ſpoken of as the covenant of grace; for it is always ſpoken of as the way, and as the only way in which a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can be juſtified. Particularly, read the fourth chapter
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011174_0015_0F857FED9B2C7390"/>
of the epiſtle to the Romans, and the 3d, and 4th chapters to the Galatians, and this will appear in the cleareſt light. For, from the manner in which Abraham was juſtified, Paul illuſtrates and confirms the goſpel way of juſtification. For he conſiders Abraham as the pattern, and teaches that all ſinners are juſtified in the ſame way in which he was; and in this ſenſe he is <hi>the father of many nations,</hi> as he is <hi>the father of all that believe.</hi> Rom. 4: 16, 17. <hi>For what ſaith the ſcripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>Now it is not written for his ſake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, that it was imputed to him; but for us alſo, to whom it ſhall be imputed, if we believe on him that raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead.</hi> Ver. 23, 24. <hi>Know ye, therefore, that they which are of faith,</hi> (who are true believers) <hi>the ſame are the children of Abraham.</hi> Gal. 3.7. <hi>And the ſcripture foreſeeing that God would juſtify the heathen thro' faith, preached before the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel unto Abraham, ſaying in thee ſhall all nations be bleſſed. So then they which are of faith,</hi> (i. e. are true believers) <hi>are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with faithful Abraham.</hi> Ver. 8, 9. But, ver. 10, all ſelf-righteous ſinners are under the curſe; <hi>for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curſe.</hi> But ver. 13, 14. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe—that the bleſſing of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham might come on the Gentiles thro' Jeſus Chriſt; that we might receive the promiſe of the ſpirit thro' faith.</hi> For it is the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar privilege of believers to have the ſpirit. Rom. 8.9. <hi>Ye are not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit, if ſo be that the ſpirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> Gal, 4.6, 7. <hi>Becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, abba, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And if a ſon, then an heir of God thro' Chriſt.</hi> But, chap. 3, 26. <hi>Ye are all the children of God by faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Ver. 29. <hi>And if ye be Chriſt's then are ye Abraham's ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe.</hi> For ver. 16. <hi>To Abraham and his ſeed were the promiſes made. He ſaith not, and to ſeeds, as of many; but as of one, and to thy ſeed, which is Chriſt.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>if ye are Chriſt's then are ye Abraham's ſeed, and heirs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that if we read the contents of the written inſtrument,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011174_0016_0F857FEE61BD2D30"/>
as it is recorded in the old teſtament, or conſider how the inſpired writers of the new, underſtood it, nothing can be plainer than that the covenant with Abraham, into which the believing Gentiles are received under the goſpel diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, was the covenant of grace, even that covenant in which, and in which alone juſtification and eternal life are to be expected. Nor can Mr. M. apply theſe texts to his external, graceleſs covenant, without perverting the word of GOD in a moſt ſhocking manner. Yea, if theſe texts do not ſpeak of the covenant of grace by which alone ſinners are juſtified, no ſuch covenant can be found in the bible. There was no other covenant revealed to Abraham; and Paul knew of no way of juſtification but this. We have as much evidence then that the covenant with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was the covenant of grace, as we have that there ever was a covenant of grace, exiſting ſince the world began.— Now obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the nature of this covenant with Abraham we may learn the nature of GOD'S viſible church. For as a real compliance with this covenant renders us the children of Abraham indeed: So a viſible compliance with it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us viſibly the children of Abraham. And as this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is but one, ſo GOD'S church is but one; according to that article in the apoſtle's creed, ſo called, "I believe in the holy catholic church." There is but one <hi>good olive tree,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to St. Paul. Rom. 11. Were there two covenants, there would be two churches, two olive trees, anſwerable to the nature of the two covenants. But the bible knows of but one covenant with Abraham. And ſo God's church is compared to one good olive tree. And graceleſs profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors are compared to <hi>dry branches,</hi> in this one good olive tree. Whereas on Mr. M.'s plan the viſible church is founded on a graceleſs covenant: This graceleſs covenant is the bond of union. So the olive tree itſelf, root and branch, is dead and dry, wholly graceleſs; and appears to be ſo; for their is no pretence to any thing elſe. Yea, Mr. M. thinks it was GOD'S deſign, that his real friends ſhould keep hid, ſo as not to profeſs their friendſhip to him
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011174_0016_0F857FEE61BD2D30"/>
publickly before the world: And ſo that GOD ſhould have, in this ſenſe, no viſible church in the world; p. 49; not one open friend upon earth. But Abraham profeſſed to be a friend to GOD, and was by GOD publickly owned as ſuch before the world; for he is called <hi>the friend of God.</hi> Jam. 2.23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. WE may alſo learn that the ſeal of the covenant of grace may with propriety be applied to ſome infants. For all will allow that GOD is the proper judge of propriety in ſuch a caſe. And all grant that GOD appointed circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be applied to ſome infants. And therefore if bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is a ſeal of the covenant of grace, yet it may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to ſome infants; provided only they have the ſame right to baptiſm, that the children of Abraham had to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. WE may alſo hence learn the foundation of the right of believing Gentiles to baptiſm for their children. <hi>For if we are Chriſt's, then are we Abraham's ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe.</hi> Gal. 3.29. For, <hi>if ſome of the branches be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and thou being a wild olive, wert grafted in amongſt them, that with them thou partakeſt of the root and fatneſs of the olive tree.</hi> Rom. 11.17. But from the very time that the practice of grafting in Gentile converts into the good olive took place, it had alſo been the cuſtom, by divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to put the ſeal of the covenant upon the children, as well as upon the father. Exod. 12.48. <note n="‡" place="bottom">

                           <q>If you conſider the covenant of grace, which was made with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham—and by GOD'S expreſs command to be ſealed to infants, you will there find a ſufficient ſcripture inſtitution for <hi>infant baptiſm.</hi> You will find this covenant in Gen, 17.2—10. Here we are taught as plainly as words can teach us, that this covenant was made with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, as he was <hi>the father of many nations,</hi> the father of the Gentiles as well as the Jews; that this covenant was a covenant of grace, an <hi>everlaſting</hi> covenant—that this covenant was to be ſealed to <hi>infants.</hi> — From all which it undoubtedly follows, that this covenant was made with us the ſeed of Abraham, as well as with the Jews; he was the father of believers in our nations as well as theirs.</q> Preſident <hi>Dick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon's Divine Right of infant Baptiſm.</hi> P. 10. <hi>Providence Edition.</hi>

But the covenant of grace is that covenant upon which GOD'S viſible church is founded.

FOR any church to lay aſide the covenant of grace, and introduce a graceleſs covenant in its room, is ſo far forth to unchurch themſelves: i. e. ſo far as this has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, to render themſelves not a viſible church of Chriſt; but a ſociety, viſibly, of a nature eſſentially different; even, ſo different as the covenants are. —But it is time to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the grand objection againſt this doctrine, that the covenant with Abraham was the covenant of grace; taken, as Mr. M. ſays, "from the covenant it ſelf." Other objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of a more general nature, ſhall be obviated in <hi>Sect.</hi> VII. It may be thus ſummed up.</p>
                  <p>OBJECTION. That the covenant with Abraham menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Gen. 17. Was not the covenant of grace, is evident, not only from this, that he was in the covenant of grace before; but from the covenant it ſelf, which was merely "as external mark in the fleſh." For the circumciſion of the fleſh was the covenant: as it is written, <hi>this is my covenant.</hi> But circumciſion is not the covenant of grace, but a mere external mark, which may be put upon a man that has no grace. Nay, circumciſion cannot be the covenant of grace, for by neglecting to circumciſe a child this covenant might be broken, but there is no falling from grace. Therefore circumciſion is not the covenant of grace, but an external covenant of a very different nature. P. 5, 6, 7, 8. <note n="*" place="bottom">The reaſons which induce me to think that Mr. M. means as above, are theſe, I. Becauſe, ſpeaking of the external covenant, in order, to prove, that it is not the covenant of grace, and to ſhew the difference, he ſays, "that, by which, any one enters into this covenant, is an external mark is the fleſh; viz. Circumciſion, "but that, by which, any one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the covenant of grace, is the circumciſion of the heart." p. 7. By <hi>entering into covenant,</hi> he means, complying with it. For this is his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. viz. As in the circumciſion of the heart, the covenant of grace is complied with; ſo in the circumciſion of the fleſh the external cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is complied with: therefore they are not ore &amp; the ſame covenant, but two, of a nature as different as theſe two kinds of circumciſions. 2. He ſays, P. 8. That circumciſion was a cmpliance with the external covenant. Theſe are his words, <q>This covenant appears to be an external covenant, in that, altho' a perſon was in a ſtate of grace, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently included in the covenant of grace, yet this covenant remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be <hi>complied with.</hi> Abraham was a true believer before, yet he muſt needs be <hi>circumciſed.</hi>
                        </q> which implies, that circumciſion it ſelf was a compliance with the external covenant. And on this hypotheſis, he teaches, that baptiſm which comes in the room of circumciſion, gives a right to all the bleſſings of the external covenant; makes us "Abraham's ſeed, &amp; heirs according to the promiſe," P. 12. 13. Even baptiſm alone, P. 16. 59 which it could not be ſuppoſed to do, were it not ſuppoſed to be the only condition of the bleſſings, i. e. the only thing required in the external covenant neceſſary to give us a title to its bleſſings.—So that we have beyond doubt Mr. M's true meening in the objection above, however inconſiſtent it is with ſome other things in his book; of which, hereafter, <hi>Sect.</hi> VIII.</note>

                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:011174_0017_0F857FEF1E52A260"/>ANSW. This is the foundation of Mr. M's. ſcheme. And perhaps there never was a fabrick built on a more ſandy foundation. For he has miſtaken, the external ſeal of the covenant for the covenant it ſelf. Becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>this is my covenant,</hi> he at once concludes, that circumciſion is the very covenant it ſelf. Juſt as the papiſts do in the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation: becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>this is my body,</hi> they at once conclude, that the bread is the very body of Chriſt it ſelf. Whereas nothing can be plainer, than that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of God's covenant had been ſtated, and Abraham had complied with them, above 20 years before the inſtitution of circumciſion. And this very covenant which had, from time to time, been renewed, is again renewed in Gen. 17; and an external ſeal is appointed to it. So that nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders but that the covenant with Abraham may be what the ſcriptures teach it to be, and what the chriſtian world have always thought it to be; viz. The covenant of grace: and circumciſion may ſtill be, what it has been always
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011174_0018_0F857FF10EAAA768"/>
thought to be; viz. An external ſeal of the covenant of grace, which God made with Abraham. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>And if circumciſion was a ſeal of the covenant of grace, then every circumciſed Iſraelite was under covenant bonds, in all things to comply with and live up to the covenant of grace, as adminiſtered under that diſpenſation. Particularly, he was under covenant bounds to ſeperate himſelf and his houſhold from the idolatrous world, and to love and worſhip the true God, and to believe in and wait for the promiſed Meſſiah, and to look for a better country, that is, an heavenly one. And he was under covenant bonds in theſe views and with this temper to circumciſe his children, and bind them in all things to comply with and live up to the covenant of grace. And to neglect this was to be guilty of the breach of the Abrahamic covenant. And thoſe who perſiſted in this neglect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves to be not the genuine children of Abraham, but rather apoſtates from the God of their father: and as ſuch they deſerved to be cut off, according to Gen. 17.14. — for Abraham acted ſincerely and from the heart in complying with God's call to leave his native country and in ſeperating himſelf and his houſhold from the idolatrous world to worſhip and ſerve the true God, to believe in and wait for the promiſed Meſſiah, looking upon the land of Canaan as a type of heaven, which was indeed the country for which he ſought. For this world was not his home. But he was a pilgrim and ſtranger on earth. And all the genuine children of Abraham are of the ſame ſpirit. For they <hi>do the works of Abraham,</hi> Joh. 8.39. All his ſeed therefore according to the fleſh by being circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed on the eighth day were bound by God to be of the ſame ſpirit. And when they became adult, and children were born to them, they were bound in the ſame ſpirit to circumciſe their childen. If they neglected to circumciſe their children in this ſpirit, they broke God's covenant. If they performed the external rite of circumciſing their children, they did, by that action, practically profeſs to be of this ſpirit. For this was the import of the action. If their hearts were anſwerable to their external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, then they were Abraham's children indeed: and heirs not only of earthly, but alſo of the heavenly Canaan. If they had no love to the God of Abraham, or faith in the promiſed Meſſiah, they were pagans at heart. Or in other words, they were uncircumciſed in heart; and will be conſidered and trented accordingly, as ſoon as ever they ſhall come to ſtand before the bar of God, as ſearcher of hearts, in the inviſible world. <hi>For he is not a Jew, who is one outwardly, neither is that circumciſion which is outward in the fleſh. But he is a Jew which is one inwardly; and cicumciſion is that of the heart. But if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumciſion is made uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</hi> Rom. 2.25—29 However, in this preſent world, God conducted toward them not as the ſearcher of hearts, but in the character of a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble head; and therefore dealt with them according to viſible appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, truſting their profeſſion, ſaying, <hi>ſurely they are my people, children that will not lie.</hi> And in this character he conſidered them as covenant breakers not according to what they were in heart ſecretly, but according to what they appeared to be in external conduct. Theſe hints may ſerve to ſhew the true import of Gen. 17.14. And the meaning of Exod 4 24.25, 26.</p>
                        <p>There have been four diſpenſations of the covenant of grace, the Adamaic, Abrahamic, Moſaic and the Chriſtian. Repentance toward God and faith in the promiſed ſeed, and holineſs of heart and life have been equally neceſſary in all times and under all diſpenſations; but rites and ceremonies have been varied. Offering ſacrifice was always practiſed from the days of Adam, but circumciſion was appointed to the family of Abraham. Melchizedeck and Lot were under the Adamaic diſpenſation, therefore they practiſed ſacrificing, but not circumciſion. But there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a covenant made by God adapted to the temper and conduct of impenitent ſelf-righteous ſinners, requiring men to feel and act as they do, in their religious exerciſes and performances; but from the early days of Cain to the preſent period, God has ever refuſed to ſmell a ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior in ſuch ſacrifices. The firſt perſecution and the firſt martyr was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to this point. Gen. 4.3,—8.</p>
                     </note>—And if God's
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011174_0018_0F857FF10EAAA768"/>
covenant with Abraham was the covenant of grace, and if the ſame covenant, which took place then, continues under the goſpel diſpenſation, as Mr. M. aſſerts, P. 12. Then the diſpute is at end. Mr. M's. ſcheme is demoliſhed.—Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe he means to gather ſtrength from the Sinai co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, let us proceed to conſider that.</p>
                  <p>N. B. If the Abrahamic covenant was is no ſenſe any part of the Sinai covenant, then circumciſion was in no ſenſe a ſeal of the Sinai covenant: and in this view the Sinai co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ought to be entirely left out of the diſpute. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are all agreed, that the goſpel covenant is the ſame, for ſubſtance, with the Abrahamic. However, let us ſee what evidence there is that the Sinai covenant was a holy cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which could not be really complied with, but in the exerciſe of real holineſs.</p>

                  <p>THE whole law of Moſes, which was written in a book, compriſes at large all the contents of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Iſraelites in the wilderneſs. This book,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011174_0019_0F857FF19A7306D0"/>
therefore, was called, <hi>the book of the covenant.</hi> And the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cheſt in which it was put, from the ſpecial uſe to which it was appropriated, was called, <hi>the Ark of the covenant,</hi> Deut. 31.9, 25, 26. A brief ſummary of this law was written on <hi>two tables of ſtone.</hi> Deut. 4.13. Which two tables of ſtone were, therefore, called <hi>the tables of the covenant,</hi> Deut. 9 9, 10, 11, 15; and were alſo put into <hi>the Ark of the covenant,</hi> Deut. 10.4, 5. So that we may be as certain of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that covenant, as we can be of the meaning of the Moſaic law.</p>
                  <p>THE Iſraelites in the wilderneſs profeſſed a compliance with this covenant and with no other, as is beyond diſpute certain from Exod. 19.8. And chap. 24.3. Deut. 5.1—6. And chap. 26. 16, 17, 18. Chap. 28. 1. 15, 58. And chap. 29. 9—13, compared with chap. 30. 10—16.</p>
                  <p>AND as ſoon as they ſhould paſs over Jordan, they were expreſsly commanded, to ſet up great ſtones, and plaiſter them with plaiſter, and write upon them all the words of this law; and to build an alter, and offer ſacrifice; and half the tribes were to ſtand on mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> and half on mount <hi>Gerizzim,</hi> and the Levites were to ſay unto all the men of Iſrael with a loud voice <hi>curſed be the man,</hi> &amp;c. that breaks this and that law, twelves times ſucceſſively, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the number of the twelve tribes of Iſrael. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, to ſum all in one word, <hi>Curſed be the man that confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not all the words of this law to do them: and all the people ſhall ſay, Amen.</hi> Deut. 27. And this moſt ſolemn and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affair was accordingly attended, ſoon after they had paſſed over Jordan. Joſh. 8.30—35.</p>
                  <p>So that, by their own act and deed, they did, in the moſt public and explicit manner, declare their hearty approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, and acquieſcence in, not Mr. M.'s external covenant, but the perfect law of GOD, in all it's ſtrictneſs, and with all it's curſes, as holy, juſt and good. Nor was there, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that conſtitution, any hope of pardon in caſe of tranſgreſſion, but by the blood of atonement. Nor was there any pardon to be obtained in this way, until they repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until their uncircumciſed hearts were humbled, even
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011174_0019_0F857FF19A7306D0"/>
ſo deeply humbled as to accept the puniſhment of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Lev. 26.40, 41. Neh. 9. Dan. 9. Then they were to pray for pardon, looking towards GOD'S holy dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place, where the covenant was laid up in the ark, and covered with a lid all made of pure gold, to keep the law in honor, which was a type of Chriſt, whoſe office it is to magnify the law, and make it honorable, and to open a way for grace to reign. That lid was called <hi>the mercy ſeat,</hi> or rather as criticks ſay, it ought to have been tranſlated, <hi>the propitiatory;</hi> for it was a ſhadow of Chriſt the <hi>Great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory.</hi> And moreover, to complete the ſhadow, <hi>without ſhedding of blood there was no remiſſion.</hi> Juſt thus ſtands the account in the ſacred writings.</p>
                  <p>THIS cordial approbation of their law in all its extent, and with all its curſes; and this praying for pardon, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards GOD'S holy dwelling place, offering ſacrifices, &amp;c. was, for ſubſtance, the ſame, with what the Apoſtle Paul meant by <hi>repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which was the ſum of that goſpel he uſed to preach to the Jew and alſo to the Greek; Acts 20.21. For in <hi>repentance toward God,</hi> the divine law is heartily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſed in and loved as holy, juſt and good; and the whole blame of every tranſgreſſion is taken to ourſelves; with a diſpoſition to ſay unto GOD, <hi>thou art juſt when thou ſpeakeſt, and clear when thou judgeſt.</hi> And in <hi>faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> we look only to free grace thro' him for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and eternal life. So that the covenant of grace, in a legal dreſs, was the very covenant into which they profeſſed to enter. So Paul underſtood it; Rom. 10.6—10. Compared with Deut. 30.11—14; of which more preſently.</p>
                  <p>BUT a heart wholly dead in ſin, is in a ſtate of total con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to the divine law, and to the way of ſalvation thro' Jeſus Chriſt; or in the language of ſcripture, <hi>is enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, is not ſubject to his law, neither indeed can be.</hi> So that there is not the leaſt degree of real compliance with this holy covenant, in one who is entirely deſtitue of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and ſo no degree of real compliance can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly and honeſtly profeſſed. But if the truth was
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011174_0020_0F857FF2729AC1F8"/>
known, and the truth was ſpoken, by graceleſs ſinners, they would all as one man declare, agreeable to our confeſſion of faith, "we are utterly indiſpoſed, diſabled and appoſite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil;" for this is the very truth of the caſe; as Mr. M. himſelf profeſſes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
                  <p>And where now is there the leaſt appearance of Mr. M.'s external graceleſs covenant in the old teſtament? The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Abraham's covenant are juſtifying faith; <hi>he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs;</hi> and goſpel obedience; <hi>walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi> And he was called <hi>the friend of God.</hi> Jam. 2.23. The contents of the covenant at <hi>Sinai</hi> is the <hi>holy law of God,</hi> as the rule of life, and the blood of atonement as the foundation of hope. And where is this <hi>unholy covenant?</hi> But to be more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in the confutation of this notion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. IT is readily granted, that a notion of the Sinai cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſomewhat like this, was once eſpouſed by the moſt reſpectable ſect in the Jewiſh church: I mean, the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees. They underſtood the Moſaic law in this very ſenſe, and in no other. And in this they were more conſiſtent than Mr. Mather. For he underſtands the Moſaic law in this very ſenſe, and in a ſenſe diametrically oppoſite to it, at the ſame time; for he believes the Moſaic law requires perfect holineſs, even that every law which was itſelf the rule of duty in that covenant, which was externally enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into; and yet he believes that the covenant externally entered into did require no holineſs at all; but might be really complied with in the ſight of GOD, by a graceleſs man, dead in ſin. But the Phariſees were more conſiſtent.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>For the divine law to require contrary and inconſiſtent volitions, is to be a ſelf contradictory and inconſiſtent law, Mat. 6.24. But ſinful and holy volitions are contrary and inconſiſtent. John 3 6. Rom. 8.7. Gal. 5 17.</p>
                        <p>For God to make two laws, one requiring none but holy volitions, the other none but ſinful volitions, is to make two laws, contradictory and inconſiſtent; both of which cannot be in force at the ſame time: Yes, rather, neither of which can be in force at all, as they mutually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy each other.</p>

                     <pb n="23" facs="unknown:011174_0020_0F857FF2729AC1F8"/>
They believed that the Sinai covenant required nothing more in religion than they performed. For, <hi>as touching the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the law they were blameleſs</hi> in their own eyes. For they lived up to its demands in their ſenſe of it. <hi>All theſe things have I done from my youth up,</hi> ſaid one of them. And it was the ſpirit of the whole party to ſay to GOD, as the elder brother did to his father, <hi>Lo theſe many years do I ſerve thee, neither tranſgreſſed I at any time thy commandment.</hi> Luk. 15. For they were in their own eyes, <hi>righteous men, who need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no repentance.</hi> And this encouraged them to pray to GOD, and to hope for his approbation; for they could ſay as he did, <hi>God I thank thee, I am not as other men;</hi> for <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the law ſin was dead;</hi> and ſo they were <hi>alive without the law.</hi> And in this view of themſelves, they were bold to claim a covenant relation to GOD; <hi>we have one father, even God.</hi> And they gloried much in having <hi>Abraham to their father;</hi> and were vexed at John Baptiſt, and Jeſus Chriſt, for not admitting their claims to be well grounded; and for repreſenting them to be not the children of Abraham, nor the children of GOD, but the <hi>children of the devil,</hi> a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of vipers.</hi> This was ſhocking treatment, indeed, of thoſe, who were not only in covenant with GOD, as they thought; but who, as they underſtood it, had lived up to it too: and Mr. M. may be challenged to point out any eſſential difference between their notion of what the law of Moſes required, and his notion of what his external covenant requires. For both agree in this, that a man may live up to the one, and to the other, without really embracing Chriſtianity. They lived up to the law in their ſenſe of it, and openly rejected Chriſt. And one may live up to Mr. M.'s external covenant and reject Chriſt in his heart, as he allows. And were it the faſhion, he, who rejects Chriſt in his heart, might do it in open profeſſion. <note n="‡" place="bottom">In the dark days of popery there were no profeſſed infidels among Chriſtians. Since the reformation light and knowledge are greatly increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and infidelity is become very faſhionable in Great-Britain. However, there are thouſands of profeſſed Chriſtians yet remaining in the viſible church, who believe the bible to be the word of GOD, not becauſe they underſtand and believe that ſcheme of religion which in fact is contained in the bible; but becauſe they think it contains their own ſchemes. Thus Pelagians believe the bible to be the word of God as ſuppoſing it contains a ſyſtem of Pelagianiſm, and Socinians as ſuppoſing it contains a ſyſtem of Socinianiſm, and Arminians, Neonomians, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians do the like; while they allow themſelves to diſbelieve and hate and oppoſe that very ſyſtem of doctrines and practice which in fact it does contain. In this view there may be not a few profeſſed Chriſtians, who are infidels in reallity; <hi>i. e.</hi> who really diſbelieve that ſcheme of religion which is contained in the bible, while they profeſs to believe the bible to be the word of GOD. Thus it was among the Jews. Joh. 5.46, 47. Mat. 23 29—36 Should light ſtill increaſe, and theſe men find out that their various ſchemes are not contained in the bible, if left to their own hearts, they would univerſally prefer infidelity to Chriſtianity. And in this caſe there would be nothing to prevent their throwing off the profeſſion of Chriſtianity but their worldly intereſt. For it is plain fact, that the external evidences of Chriſtianity, when freſh and before the eyes of the Phariſees, were not ſufficient to conquer their aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to it, ſo as to prevent their rejecting of it. And human nature is the ſame that it was ſeventeen hundred years ago.</note> Nay,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011174_0021_0F857FF32475B998"/>
How many profeſſors are there, who, in their conſciences, view the divine law very much in the ſame light that the Phariſees did? They are ſenſible it forbids open, groſs, and (what the world calls) ſcandalous ſins; ſuch as ſtealing, &amp;c. Their conſciences will ſmite them if they are guilty of any ſuch groſs ſins: But their conſciences never ſmote them in their lives, for not being converted, for impenitence, for unbelief, for not loving GOD and Chriſt above all things, &amp;c. &amp;c. But they are agreed to a man to juſtify themſelves in theſe ſins, for they ſay, "we do as well as we can."— And theſe are the men, who claim church privileges with the greateſt boldneſs, and have the higheſt notions of their being in covenant with GOD, and having a right to covenant bleſſings.—If it ſhould ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to theſe men, that their conſciences ſhould be ſo awakened, as to ſee, that a ſtate and courſe of enmity againſt GOD and his law, and of rebellion againſt the Majeſty of Heaven, is as great a ſin, in the ſight of the holy One of Iſrael, as ſtealing, conſidered as a crime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt our neighbour; their conſciences would ſoon tell them, that the one diſqualified them in the ſight
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011174_0021_0F857FF32475B998"/>
of GOD, for entering into covenant with GOD, as much as the other.—But if we tell men, that a ſtate and courſe of enmity againſt GOD and his law, and of rebellion againſt the Majeſty of Heaven does not, in the ſight of GOD, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualify them to enter into covenant with GOD, tho' ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing does, it will have, according to Mr. M.'s reaſoning, p 44. <q>A direct tendency to prevent their minds being impreſſed with a ſenſe of the heinous nature of ſuch ſins, and of GOD'S diſpleaſure againſt them; but it is highly expedient, they ſhould be ſo dealt with, as to awaken in their minds a ſenſe of the diſpleaſure of GOD againſt their conduct.</q>

                  <p n="2">2. JESUS CHRIST did not underſtand the law of Moſes, which was the rule of duty in the Sinai covenant, in the ſame ſenſe with the Phariſees, as requiring ſuch a kind of obedience as they performed, and as other unconverted men may perform; but profeſſedly ſet himſelf to give another explanation of it. This he did in his ſermon on the Mount, which may be conſidered as a confutation of the Phariſaic ſcheme of religion. But a man may comply with Mr. M.'s external covenant fully, who has not the leaſt degree of that religion taught in this ſermon. A graceleſs man may live up to Mr. M.'s covenant, and at the ſame time be entirely deſtitute of a compliance with the law of Moſes, in our Saviour's ſenſe of it. For, ſays Chriſt, <hi>he that heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doeth them, ſhall be like a man that built his houſe upon a rock.</hi> But a man may hear and do thoſe things required in Mr. M.'s external co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and yet finally be like the man, that <hi>built his houſe upon the ſand;</hi> as he himſelf allows.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. THE law of Moſes, which was the rule of duty in the covenant into which the Iſraelites entered, required nothing but holineſs. That covenant, which was externally exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and externally entered into, was ſo far from being altogether a graceleſs covenant, that it required nothing but true grace and real holineſs; nothing but <hi>love,</hi> with all it's various exerciſes and fruits, in heart and life; <hi>love to God and man;</hi> of this we are expreſsly aſſured by one who
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011174_0022_0F857FF3E6AE05F8"/>
came from GOD, and infallibly underſtood the nature of that diſpenſation. Mat. 22.36—40. <hi>Maſter, which is the great commandment in the law?</hi> ſaid a Phariſee to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, referring to the law of Moſes. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him, thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind: this is the firſt and great command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſecond is like unto it, thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf.</hi> Thus he had anſwered the Phariſee's queſtion. But he proceeded to add another ſentiment, which overthrew the Phariſaic ſcheme by the roots. <hi>On theſe two command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hang all the law and the prophets;</hi> for if the law oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Jew to perform every duty in a holy manner, out of love; and required no other kind of obedience but this; <hi>if all the law and the prophets hung on theſe two commands;</hi> ſo that radically love was all; ſo that this <hi>holy love</hi> was <hi>the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the law,</hi> Rom. 13.8, 10; then the Phariſees, who were entirely deſtitute of this, were equally deſtitute of that kind of religion required in the Moſaic law, and ſo their ſcheme was torn up by the roots. <note n="§" place="bottom">It is not only a fundamental maxim in the ſcripture ſcheme of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that <hi>love is the fulfilling of the law;</hi> but it is expreſsly affirmed, that without love the higheſt gifts and the greateſt attainments, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive deeds and the moſt cruel ſufferings are nothing, and will profit nothing. The apoſtle Paul carries the point ſo far as to ſay, <hi>though I ſpeak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity, I am as ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding braſs, or a tinkling cymbal;</hi> as deſtitue of true and real virtue. <hi>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and underſtand all myſteries, and have all knowledge: and though I have all faith, ſo that I could remove mountains, and have no charity, I am nothing.</hi> And to carry the point as high as it can poſſibly be carried he adds; <hi>and though I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me nothing.</hi> For in his view charity, or love was the ſum total of all virtue. And ſo there is no virtue in any knowledge, faith, or practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further then there is love in them, and ſo where there is no love, theſe are all nothing. In a word, holineſs in the creature is a conformity to God's moral perfections. The law is a tranſcript of God's moral charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: God is love. The whole of what the law requires is love with all it's various exerciſes and fruits. Therefore love is the ſum of all virtue. Therefore where there is no love there is no virtue: not the leaſt degree of a real conformity to God's nature and law. Were this point underſtood and attended to, it would put an end to above half the diſputes in the Chriſtian world.</note>

                  <p n="4">4. IT is manifeſt, that Moſes himſelf inſtructed the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011174_0022_0F857FF3E6AE05F8"/>
to underſtand the covenant in this ſenſe, and that the bleſſings of it were promiſed, not to an ungracious, but to a holy obedience. Moſes did inſtruct the Iſraelites to underſtand it in this ſenſe, as requiring holineſs, Deut. 6.4, 5. <hi>Hear, O Iſrael, the Lord our God is one Lord. And thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy might.</hi> Lev. 19.18. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi>—And as requiring nothing but holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Deut. 10.12. <hi>And now Iſrael, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to ſerve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul.</hi> —And that the bleſſings of it were promiſed to this holy obedience. This was one clauſe of the covenant, Exod. 20.6. <hi>Shewing mercy unto thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of them, that love me, and keep my commandments.</hi> And thus it was afterwards explained. Deut. 11.22. <hi>For if ye will diligently keep all theſe commandments which I command you to do them, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him, then will the Lord drive out all theſe nations from before you,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. And if any man will read the firſt eleven chapters of Deut. he will ſee with what plainneſs and fidelity Moſes explained the covenant to the Iſraelites: or rather let the whole book be read thro', from beginning to end in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſame, kind of faith in GOD, as their conductor thro' the wilderneſs to the promiſed land, which was a type of the heavenly Canaan, was required of the whole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Iſrael in their covenant, as is required of every believer, under the goſpel diſpenſation, in Chriſt Jeſus, the captain of our ſalvation, on whom we depend to conduct us ſafe thro' this world to that reſt that remains for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD; and this they profeſſed, when they profeſſed to take <hi>Jehovah for their God.</hi> And for the want of this faith their carcaſſes fell in the wilderneſs, juſt as falſe profeſſors under the goſpel fall ſhort of heaven <hi>thro' unbelief;</hi> as is plain from Num. 14, and from the 3d and 4th chapters of the epiſtle to the Hebrews. And this, beyond all diſpute, is a ſaving faith, a faith of a holy nature, and not the faith of devils.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="28" facs="unknown:011174_0023_0F857FF4B89C7650"/>6. Paul underſtood Moſes to include the covenant of grace in his law. This is ſo plain, that any may ſee it, that will read and compare, Rom. 10.6—10, with Deut. 30.11, 12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Peter alſo underſtood the holineſs required in the Sinai covenant to be the ſame kind of holineſs, which the goſpel requires of true ſaints, and without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord; as is ſo evident, that none will fail to ſee it, that will read and compare, 1 Pet. 1.15, 16, with Lev. 19.2.</p>
                  <p>Thus it appears, that the covenant externally exhibited, and externally entered into, in the wilderneſs, was, not a graceleſs, but a holy covenant.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <q>It will follow, that perfect and ſinleſs obedience was what they prefeſſed"; for "nothing ſhort of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comes up to the demand of loving GOD with all the heart.—Altho' therefore they entered into a covenant which required them to love GOD with all their heart; yet the profeſſion which they then made, cannot conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be underſtood as a profeſſion that at that time, there was ſuch an heart in them; but that ſuch a heart was their duty, and intended as the object of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. But that an unrenewed ſinner can, in no ſenſe, be ſaid to ſeek ſuch an heart, is what, to me, wants proof.</q> P. 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>ANS. Altho' the Iſraelites did not profeſs a perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the law of perfection; yet they did profeſs a cordial compliance with it, even with the whole of it; but the unrenewed ſinner can, in no ſcripture ſenſe, he ſaid cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially to comply with it, in the leaſt degree. But to be more particular,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. IN this objection Mr. M. grants one main point for which we contend, viz. That the law, which was the rule of duty in the Sinai covenant, required perfect holineſs. He muſt therefore acknowledge, that it forbid every ſin, the leaſt as well as the greateſt: and that it therefore required nothing but holineſs. And that therefore his unholy grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs covenant was not required by it, or contained in it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 IT will on the other hand be readily granted by us, that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011174_0023_0F857FF4B89C7650"/>
the law of God (conſidered, as requiring prefect holineſs, and forbidding every ſin, the leaſt as well as the greateſt) is the rule of life to believers; and as ſuch, is preſuppoſed and implied in the covenant of grace, which is not deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>make void, but to eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> Rom. 3.31. And therefore whenever the covenant of grace is complied with in the exerciſe of faith, the law, in the very act, is cordially received as a rule of life by the believer: even as Abraham received that divine injunction, <hi>walk before me and be thou perfect,</hi> in the very act of his renewing covenant with God. Gen. 17. —But I have endeavoured already to explain and prove this at large in <hi>an eſſay on the nature and glory of the goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. NONE can conſiſtently pretend, that Moſes intended to lead the Iſraelites to profeſs ſinleſs perfection in that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; becauſe the daily ſacrifice of a lamb, the great type of the Lamb of God which takes away the ſins of the world, which was to be offered, morning and evening continually, as well as a great variety of others ſacrifices of atonement, were aſſential parts of the Sinai covenant. But theſe had been needleſs inſtitutions, had perfect holineſs been profeſſedly expected. For it was profeſſedly expected that they would keep covenant. For they were taken into covenant in that view. Iſa. 63.8. <hi>For he ſaid, ſurely they are my people, children that will not lie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. AND yet no fact can be plainer than that Moſes led them to receive the whole law for the rule of their lives, and that they profeſſed to do this. Exod, 24.3. <hi>And Moſes came and told the people all the words of the Lord, and all the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and all the people anſwered with one voice, and ſaid, all the words, which the Lord hath ſaid, will we do:</hi> Compared with Deut. 26.17. <hi>Thou haſt avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his ſtatutes and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice.</hi> For they profeſſed, not merely to give the <hi>aſſent of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings</hi> to this truth, viz. That the law of God ought to be the rule of their lives; but, to uſe the modern phraſe, they profeſſed the <hi>conſent of their wills:</hi> "All the words which the Lord hath ſpoken, <hi>will we do.</hi>" And God declares that
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011174_0024_0F857FF51AEE0B00"/>
this was "well ſaid." And had there been "ſuch an heart in them" anſwerable to their viſible profeſſon, they would have been <hi>Iſraelites indeed:</hi> for <hi>their hearts would</hi> then have <hi>been right in the ſight of God,</hi> and they would have been <hi>ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in his covenant.</hi> Num. 32.11, 12. Their profeſſion therefore was full enough, but <hi>they lied to God will their tongues.</hi> Their profeſſion was as full as God deſired: but there was not <hi>ſuch an heart in them.</hi> Pſal. 78.36, 37. For,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is the peculiar character of the regenerate cordially to receive the divine law as the rule of their lives. Heb. 8.10. But it is the univerſal character of the unregenerate to be in a ſtate of total contrariety to the divine law in their hearts. Rom. 8.7. <hi>Becauſe the carnal mind is enmity againſt God: for it is not ſubject to his law; neither indeed can be.</hi> Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As every true believer does cordially receive the law of God for the rule of his life, ſo he may underſtandingly and honeſtly profeſs it: but one whoſe heart is in a ſtate of total contrariety to the divine law, if he underſtands and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſpeaks the truth, muſt ſay, <q>I am not ſubject to the divine law, neither indeed can I be; yea, ſo far from it, that I am at enmity againſt God.</q> But,</p>
                  <p n="7">7. None of the religious ſeekings and endeavours of one, in whom a total non-compliance with God's holy cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant takes place, are of the nature of a compliance with that covenant, in the leaſt degree; as is ſelf-evident. For to ſay otherwiſe, is an expreſs contradiction. Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="8">8. THERE is no way left for a profeſſion of a compliance with God's holy covenant, to thoſe who know themſelves to be unconverted, (without lying) but to deny the doctrine of total depravity. For ſince the covenant cannot be proved to be an unholy graceleſs one, we muſt pretend that grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſinners have ſome grace, in order to obtain our end. But,</p>
                  <p n="9">9. IF unconverted ſinners have that grace, which is a compliance with the covenant of grace, then they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the bleſſings of the covenant of grace, to pardon, juſtification and eternal life; which to ſay, is at once to ſet aſide the whole New-Teſtament. Thus ſtands the caſe.</p>
                  <p>Now what method Mr. M. will take, to get along with
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011174_0024_0F857FF51AEE0B00"/>
his ſcheme, after time for reconſideration, is not yet known: or whether a gentlemen of ſo much good ſenſe will not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give it up.</p>
                  <p>OBJECT. But if theſe things are true, it will follow, that the covenant with Abraham, the Sinai covenant, and the goſpel covenant are for ſubſtance, one and the ſame cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; even the covenant of grace: but this does not agree with many ſcripture texts. For the Apoſtle Paul diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es between the Abrahamic covenant and the Sinai covenant, between the <hi>promiſe to Abraham</hi> and <hi>the law which was</hi> 430 <hi>years after,</hi> and calls them <hi>two covenants.</hi> Gal. 3.16, 17, 18, and Chap. 4.24. And he repreſents the Sinai covenant, which he calls <hi>the law</hi> as requiring perfect obedience on pain of the curſe. Chap. 3.10. And affirms that by the <hi>deeds of the law no fleſh can be juſtified.</hi> Rom. 3.20. Gal. 2.16. And that Abraham was <hi>not juſtified by the law, but by faith.</hi> Gal. 3.6, 7, 8, 9. And that the <hi>law is not of faith.</hi> Ver. 12. but a <hi>School-Maſter to bring us to Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by faith.</hi> Ver. 24 Moreover, it is plainly intimated, that in the Sinai covenant God did not communicate ſanctifying grace to thoſe that were under it; but that in the goſpel covenant he does. At mount Sinai God <hi>wrote the law on ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſtone,</hi> and obliged the people to keep it: but did not give them a heart to do ſo: but in the new covenant God <hi>writes his law on the heart.</hi> i. e. by the influences of his ſpirit gives a diſpoſition of mind anſwerable to the law. Heb. 8.8—12. Therefore Paul calls the Sinai covenant the <hi>miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of death</hi> and <hi>condemnation,</hi> and the <hi>letter</hi> that <hi>killeth</hi> in diſtinction from the goſpel, which he calls the <hi>ſpirit</hi> which <hi>giveth life,</hi> the <hi>miniſtration of the ſpirit,</hi> and the <hi>miniſtration of righteouſneſs.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>ANSW. As Mr. M. maintains that the Abrahamic, the Sinai, and the Goſpel covenants are for ſubſtance one and the ſame covenant; ſo the foregoing objection cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently be made by him or by his admirers; nor has he taken any notice of it. It may ſuffice therefore to ſay;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That every ſelf-righteous Jew was diſpoſed to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old-Teſtament as a covenant of works, and every
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011174_0025_0F857FF8117A1F00"/>
ſelf-righteous chriſtian is diſpoſed to conſider the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament in the ſame light. They attended the externals of that diſpenſation and expected to find acceptance with God, by what they did. Luk. 18.11. Rom. 9.31.32. And their example is cloſely followed by too many under the chriſtian diſpenſation: neither of them underſtanding the true nature of the divine law. Rom. 7.8, 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is readily granted, that St. Paul taught, that all ſelf-righteous ſinners, be they Jews or Chriſtians, are under a law which requires perfect obedience on pain of eternal damnation: that this law is holy, juſt and good; that they are in duty bound to fulfil this law themſelves; that GOD is not bound to give them any aſſiſtance at all; and that it curſes every one that continueth not in all things. And it is readily granted, that this law is a miniſtration of death and condemnation, and killeth. It was <hi>ordained to life,</hi> i. e. it promiſes life to every one that lives up to it; but it is <hi>found to be unto death</hi> to every one who makes the attempt. Rom. 7.10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is readily granted, that this law is as different from the Abrahamic covenant, and the goſpel covenant, as the covenant of works is from the covenant of grace: And that it was the deſign of the apoſtle to ſet this difference in a clear and ſtriking light, that he might kill all the ſelf-righteous hopes of the ſelf-righteous ſinner; and convince him that there is no hope in his caſe, but of mere free grace thro' Jeſus Chriſt. Gal. 3.10, 24. Rom. 3.9—25.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is alſo granted, that this law was one principal part of the Sinai covenant: and that every carnal Jew was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and held bound by it: Yea, that it is the peculiar privilege of the true believer to be delivered from it, and that by being united to and intereſted in Chriſt Jeſus, the ſecond Adam, who hath completely anſwered it's demands; Rom. 6.14, and chap. 7.4, 5, 6. Gal. 2.19, 20. and chap. 3.10—14.—And to grant theſe things is to grant all that the Apoſtle ſays about this law. And yet conſiſtently with all theſe things it may be aſſerted, that</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Moſaic diſpenſation did reveal a way in which
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011174_0025_0F857FF8117A1F00"/>
pardon of ſin might be obtained: it did exhibit in types a ſhadow of the goſpel way of obtaining pardon. See the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 16th chapters of <hi>Leviticus.</hi> And it did promiſe pardoning mercy and ſanctifying grace to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent believer. Lev. 26.40, 41, 42. Deut. 30.1—6. And the land of Canaan was a deſigned type of heaven; &amp; long life and proſperity there, of eternal life and bleſſedneſs above. Heb. 4.1—11.—But this is the ſum of what is intended, when the Sinai covenant is repreſented as a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Iſraelites when they entered into covenant at Mount-Sinai in words, did by their unbelief reject the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace in their hearts. Pſal. 78.36, 37. Heb. 3.19. And therefore notwithſtanding they were then viſibly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to GOD in a covenant containing the promiſes before mentioned, whereby they laid themſelves under bonds to keep covenant; yet GOD was not obliged to give them a heart to keep covenant, by any promiſe contained in that diſpenſation, as he would have been had they been ſincere, and as he is to all who are united to Chriſt by a true and living faith. And ſo it came to paſs that they broke cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in an open, public manner; and <hi>he regarded them not,</hi> but their carcaſes fell in the wilderneſs: Whereas GOD <hi>writes his law in the heart</hi> of the true believer, and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclines him to walk in his ways. And thus every falſe profeſſor, whether Jew or Chriſtian, will fall ſhort of the heavenly Canaan; as it is written, Joh. 15.2. <hi>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit.</hi>—But,</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If any, after all, ſhall inſiſt, that the Sinai covenant was merely a covenant of works, and that the Abrahamic covenant was not in any ſenſe contained in it, they ought to conſider, that if this be ſo, then the Sinai covenant ought to be entirely left out of the account in the preſent diſpute, &amp; circumciſion ought to be conſidered, as being in no ſenſe a ſeal of it. For it was appointed to be a ſeal of the Abrahamic covenant, and of no other; and therefore if the Abraha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011174_0026_0F857FF82E3F8DC8"/>
covenant was in no ſenſe a part of the Sinai covenant, then circumciſion, was in no ſenſe a ſeal of the Sinai covenant. For no new ſeals to the covenant of works have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſince Adam was turned out of paradiſe. And as for Mr. M.'s external graceleſs covenant, it never had any exiſtence. The bible knows nothing about it, either name or thing.—We have already ſeen that it is not contained in the Old-Teſtament, and we ſhall preſently perceive, that it is not to be found in the new.</p>

Repreſenting graceleſs profeſſors by <hi>ſalt that has loſt it's ſavor, and is good for nothing, but to be caſt out &amp; trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foot.</hi> Mat. 5.13. Luk. 14.34, 35. He warned his hearers againſt profeſſing and not living up to his religion, as an inconſiſtent conduct. Luk. 6.46. He called them to make ſuch a profeſſion, as he might own to their honor in the heavenly world, before his Father. Mat. 10.32. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall confeſs me before men, him will I confeſs alſo before my Father which is in heaven.</hi> This is that profeſſion unto which he invited men, and never invited them to any other. Rather to falſe profeſſors Chriſt declares it will be ſaid, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither, not having on a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> Mat. 22.</p>
                  <p>THE apoſtles had no commiſſion to preach and baptize upon Mr. M.'s external covenant; but were expreſsly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to <hi>preach the goſpel to every creature;</hi> a goſpel that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed eternal life: and to baptize thoſe who appeared to comply with it. Mark 16.15, 16. They were ſent to make diſciples, not to Mr. M.'s external covenant, but to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Mat. 28.19, 20. In a word, they were ſent to <hi>preach repentance and remiſſion of ſins to all nations in the name of Chriſt.</hi> Luk. 24.47. And they acted up to their commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>three thouſand were pricked in their heart,</hi> Peter did not tell them to comply with Mr. M.'s external cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and be baptiſed, which they might have done, and yet have continued impenitent and unpardoned; but, exactly according to his Maſter's orders, he ſaid, <hi>repent and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in the name of the Lord Jeſus for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Acts 2.37, 38. Repent firſt, and then be baptiſed.</p>
                  <p>And when Peter went to preach to Cornelius, it was not to preach up an external covenant, with which a man may comply and yet periſh; but to declare to him the goſpel way of ſalvation, to <hi>tell him words whereby he might be ſaved,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011174_0027_0F857FF9747A2888"/>
and all his houſe.</hi> Acts 11.14. And accordingly, he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the goſpel, viz. <hi>That thro' Chriſt's name, whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Acts 10.43. But he ſaid not one word about Mr. M.'s external graceleſs cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And when the church at Jeruſalem heard what had happened, they <hi>glorified God,</hi> not that the Gentiles were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into an external graceleſs covenant, a thing not heard of in the apoſtolic age; but they glorified GOD, ſaying, <hi>then hath God alſo to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.</hi> Acts 11.18. For it had been their notion, that an uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Gentile could not be ſaved. Acts 15.1.</p>
                  <p>PETER, before he began his ſermon, was well aſſured that Cornelius was a real ſaint; for Cornelius had known ſo much about the Jewiſh religion, that altho' born a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, yet he had renounced idolatry, and had become a true and acceptable worſhipper of the GOD of Iſrael. He was a believer in the ſame ſenſe that Nathanael was, who was <hi>an Iſraelite indeed in whom there was no guile,</hi> and who however did not at that time know that Jeſus was the Meſſiah who was to come. John 1.43—47. For <hi>without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Heb. 11.6. But Cornelius <hi>obtained witneſs that he was righteous, God teſtifying of his gifts,</hi> by an angel from heaven, which appeared to him. Acts 10.4. And by a viſion which appeared to Peter, and a voice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring Cornelius, tho' uncircumciſed, yet in the ſight of GOD to be <hi>not unclean,</hi> but <hi>clean;</hi> for that GOD himſelf had <hi>cleanſed him;</hi> ver. 9—16. Peter therefore began his ſermon with a declaration, that Cornelius, altho' uncircumciſed, was nevertheleſs in a ſtate of acceptance with GOD; ver. 34, 35. It had been mad work therefore now for Peter to preach up Mr. M.'s external graceleſs covenant to one, who was already really in the covenant of grace, and whom Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had juſt declared to be ſo. But, Peter, far from this, knowing his buſineſs well, gave to him and to the whole company a brief narrative of the life, death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt; exhibiting the evidence there was, that he was indeed the promiſed Meſſiah, and that <hi>through his name whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Ver.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011174_0027_0F857FF9747A2888"/>
36— 43. And it happened to the hearers, while he was preaching, as Chriſt ſaid it would to them that believe, even in the very commiſſion which he gave to his apoſtles. (Mark 16.15, 16.) <hi>The Holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard the word.</hi> And that not only in his extraordinary gifts, but alſo in his ſanctifying influences, and that to a great degree; for they not only "ſpake with tongues," but "MAGNIFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED GOD;" as the bleſſed Virgin did, when filled with the Holy Ghoſt, Luke 1.46. Or rather, as thoſe, who, on the day of Pentecoſt, <hi>ſpake the wonderful works of God.</hi> Acts 2.11.—This appearance ſtruck Peter and all the ſaints pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with aſtoniſhment. <hi>Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghoſt, as well as we?</hi> ſaid Peter. And exactly in this point of light did Peter afterwards ſet this fact, when he gave a narrative of it to the council at Jeruſalem. Acts 15.8, 9. <hi>And God which knoweth the hearts, beareth them witneſs, giving them the Holy Ghoſt, even as he did unto us, and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</hi>—And again,</p>
                  <p>When Paul had the awakened jailor to inſtruct, and to prepare for baptiſm, he ſaid not one word to him, about Mr. M.'s external covenant, either name or thing; but preached the goſpel to him, ſaying, <hi>believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thy houſe.</hi> Acts 16.30, 31. And thou ſhall be "ſaved." He did not preach up an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaving, graceleſs faith, the faith of devils: but a ſaving faith. To that, and to no other, did he exhort the jailor, in order to prepare him for baptiſm. <note n="§" place="bottom">It is not looked upon, among men, ingenuous, fair and honeſt to lead any to ſign and ſeal a bond, before we let them know the contents of it. But the apoſtles led their converts to ſet to their ſeal in baptiſm, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying one word to them about Mr M.'s external covenant, name or thing. This, therefore, was not the covenant which they led them to ſeal. Nay, the apoſtles themſelves do not appear to have known, that there was any ſuch covenant to be preached up by them, or to be ſealed by their converts.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Mr. Sandeman ſays, that "a ſimple belief of the ſimple truth," (<hi>the heart</hi> left out of the account) is ſaving faith; Mr. M. will doubtleſs agree with me in ſaying, "This
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011174_0028_0F857FF9B82E6688"/>
cannot be ſaving faith; becauſe the devil has it." When therefore Mr. Mather (p. 25) repreſents the eunuch, as entering into covenant with GOD, by the ſimple belief of the ſimple truth, by an ungracious, unholy faith, and is reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make that phraſe, "with all thine heart," ſtand for nothing; I beg leave to reply, "this faith cannot bring thoſe into covenant with GOD that have it; becauſe the devil has it." And I humbly conceive that no man need be at a loſs about the meaning of Philip's words, or of the eunuch's anſwer, that will compare them with Rom. 10.9. "If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart, that GOD hath raiſed him from the dead, THOU SHALT BE SAVED." And with 1 John 4.15. "Whoſoever ſhall confeſs that Jeſus is the Son of GOD, GOD dwelleth in him, and he in GOD." And chap. 5.1. "Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God." For juſt this was the profeſſion which Philip de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and which the eunuch made.</p>
                  <p>And in this view of things, it is eaſy to diſcern the true reaſon, why the apoſtolic churches, were, in the epiſtles wrote to them, conſidered and treated as <hi>ſaints,</hi> by the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who it is not to be ſuppoſed had any perſonal acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at all with many of them; and why they were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as <hi>beloved of God,</hi> Rom. 1.7. <hi>Sanctified in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.2. <hi>Choſen in Chriſt before the foundation of the world.</hi> Eph. 1.4. &amp;c. &amp;c. For ſuch they were by profeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world; and ſuch generally ſpeaking they proved themſelves to be by their practice. Indeed it was always expected, that tares would, more or leſs be among the wheat. But the apoſtles did not think it their duty to ſow tares knowingly and on deſign, as Mr. M. would have us do. In that age of the church this was thought to be the work of the devil. Mat. 13.39. And, methinks, he may, now in our age, do enough at it, without any help from the clergy.—And if profeſſors in that age lived up to their profeſſion, and gave abundant evidence of their ſincerity, by the holineſs of their lives, as Mr. M. obſerves they did. P. 31, &amp;c. Then they were indeed <hi>the ſalt of the earth,</hi> and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011174_0028_0F857FF9B82E6688"/>
                     <hi>the light of the world,</hi> in their profeſſion and in their practice too, as all church members ought to be. Mat. 5.13, 14, 15. Nor did the apoſtles think it a thing of dangerous tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to treat them as ſuch in the moſt public manner, in the ſight of the world; as Mr. M. muſt have thought on his ſcheme, p. 51, &amp;c. Theſe were churches of <hi>viſible ſaints,</hi> who appeared to be the <hi>body of Chriſt,</hi> a <hi>living body</hi> to a <hi>living head.</hi> P. 48, 49. And not <hi>ſynagogues of ſatan,</hi> to which graceleſs profeſſors are ſaid to belong, in Rev. 2.9.—To conclude,</p>
                  <p>When we read the life of John Baptiſt, and of Jeſus Chriſt; when we read the commiſſion given to the apoſtles, in Mathew, Mark, and Luke; and when we read the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of their conduct in the Acts; and conſider how they treated the churches which they ſet up; nothing can be plainer, than that they preached the goſpel, made proſelytes to Chriſtianity, ſet up Chriſtian churches, on the goſpel plan; and not on the plan of an external graceleſs covenant, a thing not heard of in that age.</p>
                  <p>Obj. But there was not time to examine the three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand on the day of Pentecoſt, in order to form a judgment of their gracious ſtate: nor to judge of them by their fruits. P. 26.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. They profeſſed to comply with Peter's exhortation, <hi>repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</hi> Their profeſſion, circumſtanced as it was, was to all appearance ſincere. And this was enough; for the doctrine of the neceſſity of an infallible certainty that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors were what they profeſſed themſelves to be, in order to their admiſſion into the church, was not an apoſtolic doctrine. And beſides, they had as much time to examine into their grace, as into their moral ſincerity.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <q>How could the character of the apoſtles be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as infallibly inſpired guides to the church, when thoſe they had received, did ſo often prove hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, falſe-brethren and apoſtates?</q> P. 29.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. By infallible inſpiration they were taught, that it was GOD'S prerogative to ſearch the heart. They never
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011174_0029_0F857FFA64F9F140"/>
pretended to do it themſelves. They preached repentance toward GOD and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Their converts profeſſed that repentance and faith which they preached: They received them upon their profeſſion; they expected there would be tares among the wheat. But they did not mean to ſow tares knowingly and upon deſign: this was the work of the devil; and is it not fit that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt ſhould take the work of the devil out of his hands.</p>
                  <p>Obj. It is true, Peter ſaid of Cornelius and thoſe that were with him, <hi>God put no difference between us and them, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying their hearts by faith.</hi> But he ſaid this ſome years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which time they had doubtleſs given ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: but this is of no weight, to prove that they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to baptiſm on that ſuppoſition. P. 28.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. If he did ſay this ſome years after, and if they had in that time given ever ſo great evidence of the ſincerity of their converſion; yet Peter ſays not one word about this conſequent evidence, nor gives the leaſt hint that they had given ſuch evidence. He mentions not one ſingle fact, on which his charity for them was founded, but that only which happened before they were baptized, viz. <hi>Giving them the Holy Ghoſt even as he did unto us.</hi> But the Apoſtles received not only the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt on the day of pentecoſt, but alſo large effuſions of his ſanctifying influences, filling their hearts with love to divine things: And out of the abundance of their hearts, their mouths ſpake of <hi>the wonderful works of God.</hi> Acts 2.11. And it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to Cornelius and his houſhould juſt as it had to the Apoſtles on the day of pentecoſt, and their hearts were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with divine Love; and out of the abundance of their hearts their mouth ſpake, MAGNIFYING GOD, extolling and praiſing him for the glorious diſplay of his perfections in the work of redemption by Jeſus Chriſt. Acts 10.46. By which Peter and the ſaints who were with him perceived to their full ſatisfaction, that theſe Gentile converts had the ſame holy views, and holy affections, which they themſelves had; which led Peter to ſay, <hi>God bare them witneſs, giving them
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011174_0029_0F857FFA64F9F140"/>
the Holy Ghoſt, even as he did unto us; and put no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</hi> This is the plain and natural ſenſe.</p>

                  <p>MR. Mather ſays, p. 36, <q>Seals are rites of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.—Nothing is confirmed by the ſeal, but what is expreſſed in the written inſtrument to which it is annexed. And thus, GOD confirms and ratifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by the ſacraments, but what is contained in the declarations of his word." And, p. 37. "Theſe ſeals with reſpect to us, confirm the profeſſion which we make, and the engagements we come under." So that if the written inſtrument</q> is the covenant of grace; GOD, by affixing his ſeal, ratifies his promiſe to ſave thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it; and this on God's part, is the import of the action of ſealing. And, if the "written inſtrument" is the covenant of of grace; the profeſſor, by actively receiving the ſeal, declares, on his part, that he does comply with that covenant, and ratifies his engagements to live up to it. For, thus it is, in all mutual covenants among men, where both parties ſeal; they do, by ſealing, declare a preſent compliance with the bargain and mutually oblige themſelves to act up to it for the future. To the bargain, I ſay, as contained in the written inſtrument; to that, and to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. So that when once it is determined what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the written inſtrument; it is at the ſame time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, what is ſealed, and what is the import of the act of ſealing. But Mr. M. ſays, "The ſealing ordinances; by which the external covenant is ſealed and confirmed, do equally ſeal and confirm the the covenant of grace." P. 36. Upon which it may be obſerved, that, to be conſiſtent, it will follow,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That when a graceleſs man ſeals the external graceleſs covenant, binding himſelf to perform all the graceleſs du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which it requires; he does at the ſame time equally ſeal
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011174_0030_0F857FFB3B409FF8"/>
the covenant of grace, and equally bind himſelf to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all the gracious duties which this requires. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as theſe two covenants require religious exerciſes of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary nature, even as contrary as graceleſs and gracious, which in other words, are as contrary as ſin and holineſs; ſo Mr. M.'s unconverted covenanter, in the act of ſealing theſe two contrary covenants, binds himſelf to perform all religious duties in theſe two contrary manners; and that at the ſame time; for he binds himſelf by ſealing both co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants at once, to perform every duty as both covenants require, from day to day as long as he lives; and every time he comes to the Lord's-table, he binds himſelf a freſh. But our Saviour ſays, <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters.</hi>—Beſides, on this plan, the door of the viſible church is ſhut againſt all who know themſelves to be graceleſs. For they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a profeſſion of a compliance with the covenant of grace; and ſo the end and deſign of Mr. M.'s whole ſcheme is fruſtrated.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will alſo follow from Mr. M.'s own words, that when (a Godly man) Abraham, for inſtance, ſealed the external covenant, and the covenant of grace both at once, he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually bound himſelf all his life long to perform all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties, both in a gracious and ungracious manner, at the ſame time. But how could Abraham, at the ſame time, ſerve theſe two contrary maſters, requiring things as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as ſin and holineſs? Or how could he, being a Godly man, with a good conſcience, bind himſelf by covenant to perform all religious duties in an unholy manner? Surely he could not do it! and ſo on Mr. M.'s plan, the door of the viſible church is ſhut againſt both the Godly and the wicked. The Godly cannot come to ſacraments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſeals of an unholy covenant, binding them to live in a courſe of unholy duties; and the ungodly, knowing themſelves to be ſuch, cannot come, becauſe they are ſeals of a holy covenant, binding them to live in a courſe of holy duties. <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. M. thinks, that there "was a manifeſt propriety in chooſing Abraham, a man of eminent holineſs," to be at the head of this grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs covenant, p. 9.—But I am of our Saviour's mind, Mat. 12.33. <hi>Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or elſe make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt.</hi> Let holy Abraham be at the head of a holy covenant; but let ſome graceleſs profeſſor, be at the head of Mr. M.'s external graceleſs covenant. For it was contrary to the Jewiſh law <hi>to yoke an ox and an aſs together.</hi> And ſaith the apoſtle, Paul, <hi>What fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs with unrighteouſneſs?</hi> 2 Cor. 6.14.</note> Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="43" facs="unknown:011174_0030_0F857FFB3B409FF8"/>3. Mr. M. muſt give up the common notion of a ſeal, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring a preſent compliance with, &amp; binding both parties to act up to what is contained in the written inſtrument, or elſe he muſt honeſtly leave the covenant of grace out of the written inſtrument, or he muſt give up his ſcheme as wholly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent.—To ſolve this difficulty he ſays, "In their primary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference they may be ſeals of the external covenant; and yet, conſiſtently, in their ultimate reference, may be ſeals of the covenant of grace." P. 36.—But if they, in fact, really ſeal both covenants, then the man who comes to the ſacraments, does, in fact, really bind himſelf to fulfil both covenants. For, let him aſk any lawyer on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and he will be told, that by ſealing a "written in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument," if it contains two or ten covenants, we oblige ourſelves, either to fulfil all of them, or none of them.— The truth is, Mr. M. had propoſed this objection againſt his ſcheme, viz. <q>The preceeding diſcourſe repreſents the ſealing ordinances of the goſpel, not as ſeals of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, but of the external covenant with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible church.</q> And he had no way to get rid of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſcheme, but to run into theſe inconſiſtences, or roundly to deny the received doctrine of the Chriſtian church, that baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper, are ſeals of the covenant of grace. He has denied it implicitly: but he did not chooſe to deny it expreſsly; but ſeems to own it; and ſo runs himſelf into theſe inconſiſtences.</p>
                  <p>But if we turn our eyes off from Mr. M.'s inconſiſtent ſcheme, to the New-Teſtament, which was deſignedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to the capacities of common people, we ſhall ſee not the leaſt appearance of two covenants of which baptiſm and the Lord's-ſupper are the appointed ſeals; we ſhall find no covenant but the covenant of grace; no goſpel, but the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011174_0031_0F857FFBFAB6C300"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt, which promiſes pardon and eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the penitent believer; and baptiſm &amp; the Lord's-ſupper are repreſented as ſeals to no other covenant but this.—For, to uſe Mr. M.'s phraſe,</p>
                  <p>In the "written inſtrument" GOD promiſes ſalvation to the true believer. Mark 16.16. Therefore, <hi>if thou believeſt with all thine heart, thou mayeſt</hi> be active in receiving the ſeal of the covenant, ſaid Philip, divinely inſpired. Acts 8.37.</p>
                  <p>Again. In the "written inſtrument" GOD promiſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins to the true penitent thro' Jeſus Chriſt, Luke 24.47. Therefore, <hi>repent and be baptiſed in the name of the Lord Jeſus for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Acts 2.38. (that is, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the covenant, and then be active in receiving the ſeal;) was the language of a divinely inſpired apoſtle.—And, another divinely inſpired miniſter of Chriſt, already know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the man to be a true penitent, and ſo prepared to be active in receiving the ſeal of the covenant, ſaid, <hi>ariſe, and be baptiſed, and waſh away thy ſins, calling on the name of the Lord.</hi> Acts 22.16.—Thus we ſee what covenant is rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and confirmed by this ſeal, on GOD'S part.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the apoſtolic profeſſors, in offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to baptiſm, and in being active in receiving the ſeal of the covenant, did, on their parts, thereby bind themſelves to live according to all things contained in it, therefore Paul ſaid, Gal. 3.27. <hi>As many of you as have been baptiſed into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt;</hi> not <hi>put on the external covenant;</hi> but <hi>put on Chriſt.</hi> i. e. put on Chriſtianity: So as to be entituled to the heavenly Canaan, granting their hearts to anſwer to their external conduct; for, he adds, ver. 29. <hi>And if ye are Chriſt's, then are ye Abraham's ſeed, and heirs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to promiſe.</hi> Heirs to what? To all the bleſſings of the covenant; particularly, to the heavenly Canaan, of which the earthly Canaan was a type, and which Paul had juſt ſaid, was given to Abraham by promiſe, ver. 18.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe in baptiſm, in the apoſtolic age, men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed a cordial compliance with the covenant of grace, &amp; bound themſelves in all things to be affected and act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; therefore, when it was objected, that Paul's
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011174_0031_0F857FFBFAB6C300"/>
doctrine of juſtification by faith, without works, tended to make men licentious, and to encourage them to live in ſin, that grace might abound; he thought it ſufficient to ſay, "This can never be, for we have been baptized, and ſo we are dead to ſin and alive to GOD." <hi>Shall we continue in ſin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How ſhall we that are dead to ſin live any longer therein? Know ye not, that ſo many of us as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his death? therefore we are buried with him by baptiſm into death: that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life; for if we have been</hi> (in baptiſm) <hi>planted together in the likeneſs of his death: we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his reſurrection.—For ſin ſhall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.</hi> Rom. 6.1—14. Which proves, that in baptiſm they profeſſed a compliance with Chriſtianity itſelf, and not with Mr. M.'s external graceleſs covenant, with which a man may comply, while under the dominion of ſin.</p>
                  <p>And, indeed, for men to come to the apoſtles to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed <hi>in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> could, conſiſtently, mean nothing leſs than a public practical declaration of a preſent compliance with what the goſpel reveals concerning the Father, the Son, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; and an engagement to act accordingly in all future time: in which the whole of Chriſtianity conſiſts. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what the goſpel reveals concerning the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; and to receive God for our Father, and Chriſt for our Mediator, and the Holy Ghoſt for our Enlightener and Sanctifier; and to be affected and act accordingly, is the whole of Chriſtianity. But to be active in offering our ſelves to be baptiſed in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; and in the very act, to refuſe in our hearts, &amp; in the ſight of GOD, to have God for our Father, or Chriſt for our Saviour, or the Holy Ghoſt for our Sanctifier, is to contradict ourſelves, in the ſight of GOD. It is, to lie to the Holy Ghoſt. It is to renounce Chriſtianity in heart, at the very moment when we embrace it in our viſible conduct. But ſuch wicked diſſimulation is not an appointed means of grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="unknown:011174_0032_0F857FFCCD150B78"/>As to the Lord's-ſupper, our Saviour teacheth us, that it is the ſeal of the new-covenant, in which remiſſion of ſins is offered thro' the blood <hi>of Chriſt.</hi> Mat. 26.28. <hi>For this is my blood of the New-Teſtament, which is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſins:</hi> Which is eſſentially different from Mr. M.'s exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal covenant, by which no remiſſion of ſins can be obtained.</p>
                  <p>At the Lord's-table, Chriſt, by the mouth of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſays, <hi>this is my body, take ye, eat ye all of it. This is my blood, take ye, drink ye all of it.</hi> Hereby ſealing to the truth contained in the "written inſtrument." But it is therein written, in ſo many words, <hi>I am the living bread, which came down from heaven; if any man eat of this bread, he ſhall live forever: and the bread that I will give him is my fleſh, which I give for the life of the world. He that eateth my fleſh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> John 6.51, 56. Thus it is written, and thus it is ſealed on Chriſt's part.— On the other hand the communicant by his practice declares, "I take his fleſh, and eat it: "I take his blood, and drink it,"—and ſeals the covenant on his part—and thus the "written inſtrument" is externally and viſibly ſealed, ratified and confirmed on both ſides, with as much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality as any "written inſtrument" is mutually ſealed by the parties in any covenant among men.—And now, if both parties are ſincere in the covenant, thus ſealed; and if both abide by and act according to it, the communicant will be ſaved. For ſalvation is promiſed in the "written inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment" to thoſe who <hi>eat his fleſh and drink his blood.</hi> Joh. 6.51. This promiſe is ſealed by Chriſt at the Lord's Table. The condition of it is externally complied with, in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental actions, by the communicant, who viſibly <hi>eats his fleſh and drinks his blood.</hi> And if the exerciſes of his heart anſwer to his external actions, the covenant is on his part complied with, ſealed, ratified and confirmed. And if the goſpel is true, he will be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>But if the communicant's heart does not anſwer to his external ſacramental actions; but on the contrary, if when he viſibly and ſacramentally <hi>eats his fleſh, and drinks his blood,</hi> even at that very time, in his heart and in the ſight of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011174_0032_0F857FFCCD150B78"/>
God, he rejects his fleſh and his blood, his atonement, and all the bleſſings purchaſed by his death, his viſible actions are a lie: and lying is not a converting ordinance.</p>
                  <p>An impenitent ſinner under legal terrors may forſake bad company, lay aſide the practice of uncleanneſs, of drunkenneſs, of backbiting, of lying and cheating, &amp;c. he may make reſtitution to thoſe whom he has injured in name and eſtate: he may ſpend much time in hearing and reading the word of God, in meditating on death and judgment, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and hell, in comparing his thoughts, words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the law of God, and with the goſpel of Chriſt: and he may ſpend much time in ſecret prayer, and in trying to get his heart deeply affected with eternal things, &amp;c. &amp;c. without lying.—And thus reforming his life and attending theſe means may be uſeful to promote a conviction of his ſinful, guilty, helpleſs, ruined ſtate: But lying tends to ſear his conſcience and harden his heart in ſin.—To make a profeſſion of a compliance with the covenant of grace with his mouth, when he knows he does not comply with it in his heart; and to renew this covenant at the table of the Lord in viſible actions, while he continues to reject it in his heart, and knows this to be the caſe with him, is wilful lying, and tends directly to the eternal ruin of the ſinner's immortal ſoul.</p>
                  <p>OBJECT. By my ſacramental actions I mean to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the goſpel is true; but not to profeſs a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with it. P. 41.</p>
                  <p>ANSW. Should your neighbour treat you thus, in any covenant depending between you; ſhould he ſay, "I own the things contained in it are true, but I do not mean to bind myſelf to fulfil covenant, by ſigning and ſealing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evidence;" you, and all the world, would look upon him as a diſhoneſt quibbler.</p>
                  <p>OBJ. But I mean "to have the truths of the goſpel deeply impreſſed upon my heart by the ordinance." P. 41.</p>
                  <p>ANSW. This end might be as well obtained, if you tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried as a ſpectator. Thoſe who ſtand by as witneſſes, when a bond is ſigned and ſealed may know what is done, as well as thoſe who are parties, and who bind themſelves. Men
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011174_0033_0F857FFD72F9FCE0"/>
that mean not to bind themſelves ſhould not ſign and ſeal the bond. No one ſeals a bond, unleſs he means to bind himſelf to fulfil it. Sould a man offer to ſign and ſeal a bond, which he did not mean to bind himſelf to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil, in order to get his heart affected with what is contained it, his neighbours would think him delirious.</p>
                  <p>OBJ. But I mean to bind myſelf to "endeavour" to fulfil it; i. e. to "endeavour to conform my practice to the rules of it." P. 21.</p>
                  <p>ANS. Should you offer your houſe and farm to your neighbour upon the moſt reaſonable terms, which, if he had a heart, he might fulfil with eaſe and pleaſure, Mat. 11.28, 29. Prov. 3.17. And ſhould he plainly tell you, that at preſent he could not find it in his heart to comply with your offer; nor could he promiſe that he ever ſhould comply; but however he was willing to bind himſelf to "endeavour" to comply, and no more; you would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs think beſt to put off the bargain till you ſhould find him of another temper. And what our Saviour thinks beſt in the preſent caſe is moſt plainly expreſſed in Luk. 14.25—33.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. VI.</hi> It cannot be determined what Mr. M's external covenant requires, and wherein a real compliance with it doth conſiſt, ſo that any man can ever know that he has complied with it.</head>
                  <p>NEGATIVELY, Mr M. has determined with great exactneſs, what it does not require, and what is not neceſſary in order to a perfect compliance with it: viz. holineſs. For it requires no holineſs at all: no, not the leaſt ſpark of true grace. So that, if we could know what it did require, it might be perfectly complied with, by one, who is quite dead in ſin. This is very plain.</p>
                  <p>POSITIVELY, he has not determined, what it does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, ſo that any man can ever know, that he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with it: nor can it be determined by him, or by any other.—For it cannot be determined from ſcripture: for the ſcripture knows nothing about ſuch a covenant, either name, or thing.—And it cannot be determined from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for it is ſuppoſed to be a matter of pure revelation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="unknown:011174_0033_0F857FFD72F9FCE0"/>Indeed, Mr. M. has attempted to ſettle this matter, he ſays, p. 21. <q>I will allow, that none but ſuch as profeſs the chriſtian religion, and will endeavour to conform his practice to the rules of it, ought to be admitted into the church.</q> Upon which, it may be obſerved,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Abraham made no profeſſion at all, of any faith, but of a ſaving faith. <hi>He believed in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> And if Abraham is to be our pattern, as Mr. M. inſiſts, then we muſt make a profeſſion of this faith, or of none. To ſet aſide Abraham's faith, which was, as James aſſerts, <hi>a living faith;</hi> and to introduce into it's room a <hi>dead faith,</hi> which James calls <hi>the faith of devils;</hi> and to ſubſtitute this in the ſtead of the faith of Abraham, and to put God's ſeal, which belongs to God's covenant, to this new invented covenant of human device, is not "to conform our practice to the rules" of God's word; nor ſo much as to "endeavour" it.—Beſides,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Mr. M. ſays, p. 7. <q>That by which ANY ONE was to enter into this" external "covenant was an <hi>external mark</hi> in the fleſh.</q> But faith, altho' a dead faith, is an <hi>internal thing,</hi> and is as much inviſible, as any other mental qualification whatſoever: and therefore is not neceſſary on his ſcheme, to be in the heart of the profeſſor: nor need he profeſs it to be in his heart. For "to require more of the perſon to be admitted into the church, than is made neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary by the covenant on which it is framed, is really abſurd." p. 22.—For, to imitate his manner of reaſoning, it may be ſaid, <q>to ſet this matter in the cleareſt light, an Infidel, or an Atheiſt, with a fair profeſſion of the external cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, when he is received into the viſible church, on Mr. M's ſcheme, is in the ſight of God either a member of it, or he is not. If he is a member, then the faith of devils is not neceſſary. If he is not, then on Mr. M's ſcheme there can be no viſible church.</q> This is Mr. M's manner of reaſoning, p. 49. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Theſe are Mr. M's words. <q>To ſet this matter in the cleareſt light; an unregenerate man, with a fair profeſſion of religion, when received into the viſible church, is in reality, either a member of it, or he is not: If he is a member, his union muſt be conſtituted by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides the covenant of grace, which extends to none but ſuch as have true grace in heart: but if he is not in reality, a member of the viſible church, then there can be no ſuch thing as a viſible church, that has a real exiſtence.</q>—Anſw. The viſible union of the viſible church is conſtituted by a viſible credible profeſſion of a compliance with the covenant of grace: juſt as their real union is conſtituted by a real compliance with the covenant of grace.</p>
                        <p>To ſet this matter in the cleareſt light; in a Spaniſh milled dollar there is a certain quantity of ſilver, the ſtamp, &amp;c.—Silver is eſſential to a real dollar. If there is no ſilver in the ſeeming dollar, it it not a real dollar, but a counterfeit one. So here. If a body of men profeſs friendſhip to Chriſt, they are a viſible church of Chriſt: but if there is no friendſhip in their hearts, they are like the counterfeit dollar.</p>
                        <p>Should any one object, "a pewter dollar, with a good ſtamp, and well waſhed over, is a real dollar, or it is not: if it is a real dollar, then ſilver is not eſſential to a real dollar: If it is not a real dollar, then there is no ſuch thing as a viſible dollar in the world:" Would any man by ſuch logic as this, be induced to receive pewter dollars, profeſſedly ſuch, in pay for his whole eſtate?</p>
                     </note> I hope this may ſhew
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:011174_0034_0F857FFE2C7CDEC8"/>
the inconſiſtence of excluding <hi>a living faith,</hi> becauſe it is an inviſible mental qualification; and yet retaining <hi>a dead faith,</hi> which is equally an inviſible mental qualification. To make Mr. M's ſcheme conſiſtent, no mental qualification ought to be profeſſed. Nothing but baptiſm, which is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in the room of circumciſion, is needful. Baptiſm alone, without any profeſſion at all, is the only requiſite to conſtitute any man a member of Mr. M's viſible church. But in the apoſtolic age no man was ever received into the viſible church by baptiſm alone, without a profeſſion. Mr. M. is obliged therefore to allow of the neceſſity of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. But this ſuppoſes the neceſſity of ſome <hi>mental, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, internal</hi> qualification to be profeſſed: But this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the notion, that nothing is neceſſary but what is <hi>external</hi> and <hi>viſible.</hi> So his ſcheme cannot hang together.—Beſides,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To have no other faith than the devil has, and to profeſs no other faith than he has profeſſed, is not to enter into covenant with God, unleſs the devil is in covenant with God. Therefore let the articles of faith to which
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:011174_0034_0F857FFE2C7CDEC8"/>
profeſſors give their aſſent be ever ſo orthodox, and their profeſſion be ever ſo true; yet if they profeſs only "a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple belief of the ſimple truth," it is not a viſible entering into covenant with God. It is not a covenanting tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Where there is no conſent of the will profeſſed, there is no covenant viſibly made, in any caſe whatſoever. But if they profeſs not only to believe, but to <hi>love the truth,</hi> this is what no ungodly man can underſtandingly and honeſtly do. For to <hi>receive the truth in the love of it,</hi> is the ſcripture cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a true ſaint. 2 Theſ. 2.10. And ſo did Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham the father of all believers —So again,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. "To conform our practice to the rules of the chriſtian religion," is to be real chriſtians. This therefore muſt not be profeſſed. But without this, there is no compliance with the goſpel covenant. He who does conform his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the rules of the goſpel, does really comply with the goſpel. And he who doth not, does really reject it. The one will go to heaven, and the other will go to hell. In this we are all agreed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But Mr. M. ſays, they muſt profeſs, that they "will endeavour" to conform their practice to the rules of the chriſtian religion.—But, pray, how much muſt they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? Not ſo much as actually to conform: for in this real chriſtianity conſiſts. How much then? Can any man tell? Will you ſay, "as much as they can?" What! quite as much? What, every day, every hour of their lives? This is what no ungodly man ever did, or ever will do. Will you ſay, "they muſt ſincerely endeavour?" But how ſincere muſt ungodly men be? "As ſincere as they can?" What, quite as ſincere as they can, every day and every hour? This is what no ungodly man ever was, or ever will be.—Will you ſay, "they muſt endeavour ſo much, and ſo ſincerely, as to keep from open ſcandal?" But is this enough? What if they live allowedly in ſecret ſins, in enmity to God, in enmity to their neighbours, in ſtealing, in adultery, in ſodomy? Will this do? Is this enough in the ſight of God and conſcience, that they are free from open ſcandal, while they live ſecretly in ſuch and ſuch like ſins?—Will you
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:011174_0035_0F857FFEE270F4A0"/>
ſay, "No, they muſt <hi>endeavour</hi> to forſake all ſin and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their practice to all the rules of the chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?"—But the queſtion ſtill returns, how much muſt they endeavour? Not ſo much as to get free from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin. For this is peculiar to the godly. Rom. 6.14. How much then? No ſon of Adam can ever tell!</p>
                  <p>IT can be determined what that repentance toward GOD, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is, which the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel requires; and a man may know when he complies with the goſpel covenant; but it cannot be determined what Mr. M.'s external covenant requires; nor can any man know when he complies with it.</p>
                  <p>THE loweſt degree of true grace is a real and ſaving com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the goſpel covenant. <hi>This is life eternal to know thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Joh. 17.3. Where ſaving grace begins, it ſhall end in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It's ſpecial nature can be as certainly determined, as the nature of the goſpel way of ſalvation can; for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a compliance with the goſpel. But this external covenant is neither law, nor goſpel.</p>
                  <p>No man will ſay, that "the leaſt degree of endeavour," which ever takes place in an ungodly man, is all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, to bring men into the external covenant. Nor will any man ſay, "that the greateſt degree of endeavour" that ever takes place in an ungodly man, is neceſſary to this end. Nor can any man fix upon any certain degree, between the leaſt &amp; the greateſt, that is the very degree neceſſary to bring a man into this covenant. It is a blind affair, and is adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to a blind conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Every ungodly man, whoſe conſcience is thoro'ly awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to know the truth about himſelf, knows that he is dead in ſin, an enemy to God, "utterly indiſpoſed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled and oppoſite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil;" as Mr. M. will allow. And therefore, were ſuch men to make a profeſſion of the truth, they would profeſs this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and confeſs themſelves to be altogether helpleſs and undone, under the wrath of God, the curſe of the law, and condemned by the goſpel; (Joh. 3.18, 36. Gal. 3.10.)
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:011174_0035_0F857FFEE270F4A0"/>
and incapable of entering into covenant with God, (Pſ. 50.16.) and coming into the kingdom of Chriſt, until they are born again. Joh. 3.5.—And how much ſoever pains ſuch may take, to eſcape everlaſting burnings, they can never think, that this labour of their's brings them into covenant with the holy One of Iſrael, ſo long as they find themſelves dead in ſin, enemies to God and rejecters of Jeſus Chriſt. But rather, in the midſt of all their diligence and endeavours, they do, as Mr. M. elſewhere obſerves, <note n="*" place="bottom">Sermon on Rom. 9.14, 15. p. 28.</note> "in their own apprehenſions grow worſe and worſe."</p>
                  <p>Yea, the beſt ſaint on earth would not dare, with his eyes open, to enter into covenant with the holy One of Iſrael, without a Mediator; or in the neglect of him whom God has provided, on the foot of his own righteouſneſs. No ſaint can have impudence enough, with his eyes open, to offer ſuch a thing to God. For ſuch know no way to come to the Father but by the Son. Joh. 14.6. But ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſinners, with ſtupid conſciences, are good enough to come nigh to God in their own names, and enter into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God in their own ſtrength and in their own righteouſneſs, while, with their whole heart, they reject the Mediator and the Sanctifier revealed in the goſpel. But that baptiſm and the Lord's-ſupper ſhould be ſo degraded and proſtituted, as to become ſeals to this <hi>ſelf-righteous, graceleſs covenant of works,</hi> muſt be not a little ſhocking to many pious minds. Nor indeed can ſinners under deep and genuine conviction come into this ſcheme. For,</p>
                  <p>This external covenant is not adapted to the ſtate of a ſinner under genuine and deep conviction. For it is with ſuch agreeable to Rom. 7.9. <hi>The commandment came, ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and I died.</hi> Rather, it is ſuited only to the hearts of ſecure, ſelf-flattering, ſelf-righteous ſinners, of blind and ſtupid conſciences; and is of no uſe but to build them up in their ſelf-righteous ways; to lead them to cry, "We have Abraham to our father, yea, we have one father, even God." When in the language of Chriſt, the meek and lowly Jeſus, they are the <hi>children of the devil,</hi> and the <hi>wrath of God abideth on them.</hi> Mat. 3 9. Joh. 8.39—44. Joh. 3.36.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. VII.</hi> Various diſtinctions ſtated, to render the ſubjct more eaſy to be underſtood by Chriſtians of the weakeſt capacities, and to enable them to anſwer the uſual objections, at leaſt to their own ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. WE are to diſtinguiſh between objections, which are taken from the nature of the covenant, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the written inſtrument, and thoſe objections which are taken from the character of many that have ſealed it. If there was not one unholy graceleſs duty required of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, in that covenant, Gen. 17. With which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and which he ſealed, Mr. M. muſt loſe his cauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the names and ſeals of thouſands of graceleſs hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are found annexed to it. For the nature of a written covenant is to be determined from the contents of it, and not from the hypocriſy of the men that have ſigned &amp; ſealed it. As for example, ſuppoſe we have a bond of £. 1000, ſigned and ſealed by a man not worth a groat; it alters not the caſe, the bond is a bond of £. 1000, as much as it was ſigned and ſealed by a man ever ſo rich. For all mankind are agreed in this, that the nature of the bond is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined from the contents of the written inſtrument, and not from the poverty or knavery of the ſigners and ſealers.</p>
                  <p>If the covenant with Abraham was the covenant of grace, yet poſſibly thouſands of graceleſs men might be active in ſealing it. Or if the covenant with Abraham re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired only freedom from open ſcandal, yet poſſibly it might be ſealed by thouſands who lived in open ſcandal. The ten tribes, for ought that appears, practiſed circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion without one exception; and yet they lived in open idolatry from the time of their revolt to their captivity: That is, about 250 years. And if we are to determine the nature of the covenant from the character of the ſealers; then, from this, it will follow, that freedom from open ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry was not required of the Iſraelites, in the covenant which they were under, and of which circumciſion was a ſeal.</p>

                     <pb n="55" facs="unknown:011174_0036_0F857FFFAA7585A8"/>2. We ought to diſtinguiſh between <hi>fact</hi> and <hi>right,</hi> and to underſtand, that there is no concluſive arguing from the one to the other. As for inſtance. It is fact that there were tares ſowed in the field; but it does not follow, that it was right that the ſervants ſhould ſow them there: this was the work of the devil.—It is fact, that there was a man who came into the viſible church without a wedding garment; but it does not follow, that it was right for him ſo to do.—It is fact, that there were falſe profeſſors, who unawares crept into the apoſtolic churches. But it does not follow, that it was right, that they ſhould creap in thither.—It is fact, that the net gathered bad fiſhes as well as good; but it does not follow that the fiſhermen were employed to gather any but good fiſh.—It is fact, that in the apoſtolic age, ſome impenitent hypocrites made a profeſſion of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and were baptized; but it does not follow, that it was right in them to make ſuch a falſe profeſſion.—It is fact, that the Iſraelites at Mount Sinai made a falſe profeſſion, that they lied to GOD with their tongues, &amp; flattered him with their lips; but it does not follow, either, that it was right for them to do as they did, or that it is right for us to imitate their wicked example.—It is fact, that there have been in all ages graceleſs men in the viſible church; but it does not follow, either, that they had a right to be there, or, that we ought to lay aſide the covenant of grace and to introduce a graceleſs covenant merely in order to open a door for their regular admiſſion.—It is fact, when the doctrines and diſcipline of the goſpel are brought down to the taſte of carnal men, that they appear to be better pleaſed with both; but it does not therefore follow, that it would be right for miniſters to combine to ſet aſide truth and ſtrictneſs and to introduce error and looſeneſs, in order to pleaſe a wicked world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a diſtinction to be made between an adult perſon's <hi>really</hi> entering into covenant, and <hi>viſibly</hi> entering into covenant. He who complies with the covenant of grace, really enters into it: but he who profeſſes to comply with it, viſibly enters into it. The former is peculiar to the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011174_0037_0F8580007AE45EC8"/>
godly; but ungodly men may do the latter; for none but the godly comply with the covenant of grace; but many ungodly men profeſs to comply with it. And theſe are like dry branches.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is a difference between being in the covenant of grace, by a compliance with it; and being under the bonds of the covenant of grace, without a compliance with it. The former is peculiar to the godly; and from this ſtate of grace none fall away; the latter is true of the moſt ſcandalous profeſſor. An adultreſs woman may be under the bonds of the marriage covenant; and that even while ſhe perſiſts obſtinately in her adulteries; but this gives her no right to the peculiar privileges of a virtuous wife. In this ſenſe the idolatrous Iſraelites, were <hi>in covenant</hi> with GOD, notwithſtanding their obſtinacy in that moſt ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous practice of idolatry. Jer. 3.14 But this gave them no right to covenant bleſſings. For it is our compliance with the covenant of grace, which gives an intereſt in it's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; and not our being under the bonds of it.—For, the ten tribes, who are ſaid, in Jer. 3.14. to be <hi>married to the Lord,</hi> and who had lived in idolatry ever ſince the days of Jerebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am the ſon of Nebat, for thus <hi>playing the harlot had been put away,</hi> ver. 1. and a <hi>bill of divorce</hi> had been <hi>given</hi> to them. ver. 8. They had been turned out of the promiſed land and ſent into captivity, above an hundred years ago. 2 Kin. 17.6. And ſo had not only forfeited, but were actually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed of all the external privileges of the Abrahamic co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: and yet they were ſtill under <hi>covenant bonds.</hi> And ſo an excommunicated perſon may, in this ſenſe, be ſaid, to be <hi>in covenant,</hi> even <hi>in the covenant of grace.</hi> For the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement he came under to live according to that covenant all his days, when he made a profeſſion of religion, is as binding in the ſight of God as ever. But being <hi>in covenant</hi> in this ſenſe, altho' it may increaſe obligation and guilt; yet entitles to no covenant privileges.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We are to diſtinguiſh between the means which God uſeth to bring us to comply with the covenant of grace, and our conſenting to ſeal it in token of compliance. Thoſe
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011174_0037_0F8580007AE45EC8"/>
who have not complied with the covenant of grace may attend the former without lying: but we ought in all caſes to conſent to a covenant in our hearts, before we are active in ſealing it with our hands. For to ſeal a covenant with our hands, when we reject it in our hearts, is in the ſight of God to lie: but lying is not a means of grace.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We are to diſtinguiſh between the <hi>man</hi>'s rule and the <hi>church</hi>'s rule of judging concerning his fitneſs publickly to enter into covenant, and publickly to ſeal it. The man himſelf makes his judgment by looking into his own heart; but the church make their judgment by looking only to what is viſible. Juſt as it is when men ſwear allegiance to the <hi>king</hi> and renounce the <hi>pretender.</hi> The man who takes the oath of allegiance and abjuration, ſees his way clear to do ſo, by looking inward, and finding ſuch an heart in him; but he who adminiſters the oaths, judges concerning the propriety of his own conduct in ſo doing, only by what outwardly appears. And thus it is alſo when perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the marriage covenant; they ſee their way clear to act, by looking, each one, into his own heart, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch affections in themſelves, as are anſwerable to the external tranſaction before them: but he who leads them to enter into the marriage covenant, judges of the propriety of his conduct only by what is viſible. A man by looking into his own heart may be certain, that he believes and loves the doctrines of the goſpel; but the church by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearances can be certain of neither. Peter was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he believed. Mat. 16.16. And as certain that he loved. Joh. 21.15, 16, 17. And it is the duty of all to believe and love as he did. The blame is wholly in ourſelves, if we do not. But we ought not to profeſs faith and love, till we ſee our way clear; ſo as that in profeſſing we may act an honeſt and conſcientious part: even as it would be a wicked thing, for perſons to enter into the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage covenant, if the prevailing judgment of their own minds, were, that they were not in a proper ſtate for ſuch a tranſaction.—However, it muſt be owned, that not to love Chriſt above all things, not to be willing to forſake
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011174_0038_0F8580012047DAE0"/>
all for his ſake, and not to eſpouſe his cauſe and intereſt heartily before men is moſt inexcuſable wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We are to diſtinguiſh between things not at all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to any man; as eating blood: and things cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly commanded to ſome men; as to confeſs Chriſt before men. It is wrong to eat blood, if we at all doubt of the lawfulneſs of it, becauſe it is not a commanded duty to any man. So <hi>he that doubteth is damned if he eat;</hi> i. e. is ſelf-condemned, becauſe in ſuch a caſe as this he ought not to eat. But it will not hence follow, that we ſhall be ſelf-condemned, if we confeſs Chriſt before men without full aſſurance. For, by the command of Chriſt we are bound in duty, if we are on his ſide in our hearts, openly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him before men. If we neglect it, in this caſe, we ſin. And if we do it in hypocriſy, we ſin. A man's conſcience in all ſuch like caſes will lead him to act according to his prevailing judgment. It is in fact thus, with the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious part of mankind, in all doubtful matters; if they are obliged to act one way or the other; they make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of acting according to prevailing evidence.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We are to diſtinguiſh between objections, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be equally againſt both ſchemes, and other objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and are to look upon the former as of no weight to ſettle the controverſy. If they ſay, it is difficult to know whether we comply with the covenant of grace; we may anſwer, that it is as difficult, and more ſo, for any man to know whether he complies with the external covenant. If they ſay, the church cannot be certain that any man has ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace; we may anſwer, neither can the church be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that any man believes in his heart, the doctrines which he profeſſes with his mouth. If they ſay, aſſurance of our right to come is neceſſary on our ſcheme; we may anſwer, that it is no more neceſſary on one ſcheme than on the other. Beſides, aſſurance of a right to come is attainable by true ſaints; but no man can know that he has a right on Mr. M's ſcheme. Becauſe no man can know what his external co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant requires. If they ſay, Peter had not time to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011174_0038_0F8580012047DAE0"/>
into the gracious ſtate of the three thouſand converts on the day of pentecoſt; we may anſwer, that he had as much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> for this, as to examine into their doctrinal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and moral ſincerity.—So alſo, thoſe objections ought to weigh nothing, which are taken merely from the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of mankind, and which would vaniſh of themſelves, ſhould the Spirit of God be poured from on high, as it was when the firſt chriſtian church was ſet up. For there is no more reaſon, that the diſcipline of Chriſt's houſe ſhould be brought down to ſuit our corruptions, than that the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the goſpel ſhould alſo.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We ought to diſtinguiſh between an appeal to <hi>reaſon,</hi> and an appeal to <hi>corruption.</hi> For example, theſe words are contained in the marriage covenant, unto which we oblige the woman to give her conſent, viz. "You take this A. B. for your married huſband, and promiſe to be a loving, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and obedient wife to him," &amp;c. Should a few women object againſt this covenant, and publickly propoſe an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, ſaying, "We pray, that the words, <hi>loving, faithful and obedient</hi> may be left out, for the ſake of ſome young <hi>women of tender conſciences,</hi> who cannot ſee their way clear to uſe them." The only queſtion would be this, "ought the alteration to be made in the marriage covenant, or in the young women?" Or in other words, "which is wrong, the woman's heart, or the covenant?" A queſtion, which may eaſily be decided, if we appeal to reaſon or to ſcripture: but if we appeal to corruption, the more we wrangle, the more we may, ſome might ſay, <q>If the covenant is not altered, no woman can be married without full aſſurance. For it is not lawful to enter into this covenant in doubt. For <hi>he that doubteth is damned.</hi> An infallible aſſurance therefore is neceſſary. But who has this? Or what wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, on this plan, can be married, with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? And, beſides, what prieſt can be able to judge, whether any are fit to be married? By what rule ſhall it be certainly known, when a woman is really diſpoſed to be a <hi>loving, faithful and obedient</hi> wife, and when ſhe is not? Moreover, it will only tempt bad women to make
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011174_0039_0F85800202165CE0"/>
a lying profeſſion, while women of tender conſciences will be kept back; and thoſe who are married will grow proud becauſe they are judged to be qualified. Mean while, the failings of married women will be more taken notice of, to their diſhonor, for uſing this covenant. Upon the whole, it is a very bad plan, and a thing of a very dangerous tendency; therefore, we propoſe, that in all future times, theſe words, <hi>loving, faithful, obedient,</hi> be left out of the marriage covenant.</q>—How ridiculous would any woman make herſelf, that ſhould advance ſuch ſtuff! But if this claſs of women were the majority, they might make a ſhocking noiſe, but there would be no more ſenſe in it, than if but one ſingle woman was in the ſcheme.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We are to diſtinguſh between that character which the Iſraelites gave of themſelves, when Mount Sinai was covered with a thick cloud, and the Lord appeared in the flame of a devouring fire on the top of the mount, and it lightned and thundred, and the voice of the trumpet was exceeding loud, and the people trembled under a ſenſe of the greatneſs and majeſty of the holy One of Iſrael, and every one, even <hi>all the people anſwered with one voice, and ſaid, all the words, which the Lord hath ſaid, will we do;</hi> (ſuch manifeſtations of God, and a people under ſuch deep reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious impreſſions, never had been before heard of, ſince the world began: ſo that even God himſelf, judging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to appearances, was ready to ſay, <hi>Surely, they are my people, children that will not lie.</hi> Iſa. 63.8.)—And that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which they afterwards gave of themſelves, by their conduct forty years in the wilderneſs.—In the former, they appear heartily diſpoſed to comply with God's covenant. In the latter, they appear a rebellious generation, whoſe <hi>hearts were not right with God, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his covenant.</hi> Pſal. 78.37.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. We are to diſtinguiſh between that character which the Iſraelites gave of themſelves, by their conduct forty years in the wilderneſs, by which it appeared, that they <hi>had not eyes to ſee, nor ears to hear, nor a heart to underſtand;</hi> (for they <hi>made a calf</hi> even before the Mount of God. And <hi>rebelled at

Kadeſh-barnea;</hi> and <hi>at Taberah, and Maſſah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, they provoked the Lord to wrath.</hi> So that Moſes might well ſay, <hi>Ye have been rebellious againſt the Lord, from the day that I knew you.</hi> Deut. 9.7—24.)—And that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which that pious generation gave of themſelves, who, in the plains of Moab, heard Moſes rehearſe all God's ways to that nation, and their ways to God, forty years in the wilderneſs, and now on a review of the whole, manifeſted a diſpoſition unitedly to become God's people, to enter into God's covenant anew, and to bind themſelves to him, as their God, to love him, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep all his commandments.—Concerning the former character, more ſevere things are ſpoken in ſcripture, than of any other, which that people ever gave of themſelves, under that diſpenſation; and concerning the latter, more good things. The piety of this new generation God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered many ages after, Jer. 2.2. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I remember thee, the kindneſs of thy youth, the love of thine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſals</hi>—ver. 3. <hi>Iſrael was holineſs to the Lord.</hi> See alſo Judg. 2.7. <hi>And the people ſerved the Lord all the days of Joſhua, and all the days of the elders that out lived Joſhua.</hi> So that they tranſmitted the true religion to the next generation, and kept it up all the days of their lives.—And if theſe things are well conſidered, and the great comparative darkneſs of that age of the world, and the abundant pains which Moſes took in the plains of Moab to explain the covenant, and to render them deeply ſenſible of their obligations to comply with it, with all their hearts, no man will find cauſe to ſay, that Moſes acted an unfaithful part, in leading that people, to enter into that very covenant, in the manner he did.</p>
                  <p>OBJECT. But it was the deſign of Moſes to charge in a public manner, as what viſibly and publickly appeared to be the truth of the caſe, thoſe very individual perſons with being unregenerate, on that very day, in which he led them to enter into covenant. For he ſays, <hi>the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to ſee, and ears to hear unto this day.</hi> Deut. 29.4. p. 18.24.</p>
                  <p>ANS. It is evident, that in the public ſpeech which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:011174_0040_0F858002DB7D00A8"/>
made to the Iſraelites, in the plains of Moab, of which theſe words are a part, he conſtantly addreſſes them in their national capacity, and not as individuals. Thus, in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph in which theſe words are contained, ver. 2. <hi>Moſes called unto all Iſrael, and ſaid unto them, ye have ſeen all that the Lord did before your eyes, in the land of Egypt, &amp;c.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as every one in the congregation, who were but one month under forty years of age, which was doubtleſs by far the greateſt part of the congregation, never were in Egypt, for they were born in the wilderneſs, ſince their fathers left Egypt. And inſtances of the like nature are to be obſerved thro' the whole ſpeech. Thus, we know, that the carcaſſes of the men that ſinned at <hi>Kadeſh barnea,</hi> on the return of the ſpies, were all of them fallen in the wilderneſs; and yet he ſpeaks to the preſent generation, who perſonally had no hand in that ſin, as tho' they were the very individual perſons, that had committed it. Ch. 9.23. <hi>Then you rebelled againſt the commandment of the Lord.</hi> See alſo Deut. 1.19—35. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there was not one of thoſe rebels alive; no not ſo much as one. Num. 26.63—65. And this is preciſely the truth of the caſe, with the text under conſideration. For,</p>
                  <p>Moſes brought in no public charges againſt the nation, but for public crimes, not an inſtance can be produced from the beginning of Deuteronomy to the text under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But this new generation, which were grown up, &amp; which were now about to enter into covenant with God, had not been guilty of any public crimes, to give themſelves a bad character. It does not appear from the whole ſtory, that Moſes had any public grounds, for a public charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as being an ungodly generation. Nay, the fact is, that they always behaved ſo well, both before and after, that they were by God himſelf, after they were dead and gone, repreſented as a very religious and godly generation, Jer 2.2, 3. Jud. 2.7. Compared to a <hi>choice vine,</hi> Iſai. 5.2. <hi>Wholly a right ſeed,</hi> Jer. 2.21.</p>
                  <p>To ſuppoſe Moſes charged them in a public manner, as an unregenerate, ungodly generation, unjuſtly, without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mentioning one ſingle fact to the diſadvantage of their
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:011174_0040_0F858002DB7D00A8"/>
character, is very unreaſonable: eſpecially as the ſenſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given to the words under conſideration is an eaſy and natural ſenſe, and removes all difficulties, and renders the ſpeech and conduct of Moſes perfectly conſiſtent. For, as to all the inſtances of public conduct contained in the long narrative, which Moſes had given, from the time they left Egypt, to that very day, which were evidences, of blind eyes, deaf ears, and hard hearts, this preſent generation were not active in them. Thoſe facts, thoſe public crimes, altho' committed by that nation, were not done by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual perſons, which made up the preſent congregation, who entered into covenant with God, but by the old gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whoſe carcaſſes were fallen in the wilderneſs; as any man may ſee that will read all the preceeding chapters of the book, We ought not, by giving a wrong ſenſe to the words of Moſes, to render his public ſpeech and his public conduct inconſiſtent; and then to charge him with acting a diſhoneſt part, in leading that people to enter into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in the manner in which, in fact, he did: or to deny the fact, under a pretence of ſaving his character; when indeed his character cannot be ſaved this way, becauſe the fact is undeniably true.</p>
                  <p>If it ſhould be enquired, why did Moſes ſpeak thus, to this preſent generation, as they had not been perſonally guilty of that courſe of rebellious conduct themſelves; but were themſelves a godly generation?—The anſwer is eaſy. —He did it to give them a clear view and humbling ſenſe of their national ſins, and the juſtice of God in the national judgments which he brought upon them; that they might know, that it was not for their righteouſneſs, that God did bring them into that good land; but merely of his great goodneſs, and becauſe he had promiſed it to Abraham. Deut. 9.5. to the end they might ſo reflect on the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of their own hearts, and be ſo deeply abaſed before God, as to be thereby prepared for that holy and ſolemn tranſaction before them, of entering into covenant with the holy One of Iſrael: that having in view, how their fathers had entered into covenant at Sinai, and had broken cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011174_0041_0F85800381A11D40"/>
ſo that all their carcaſſes had fallen in the wilderneſs, they might take warning thereby, and remember and keep the covenant of the Lord their God; that it might be well with them, and with their children after them.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. We are to diſtinguiſh between the character which the three thouſand converts on the day of pentecoſt, gave of themſelves, in that deep conviction of ſin and guilt which they manifeſted, when they appeared to be <hi>pricked at the heart,</hi> and in that repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt which they openly profeſſed, when they appeared cordially to comply with Peter's exhortation, <hi>Repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus, for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> by <hi>gladly receiving his word,</hi> and offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to baptiſm, and to join with a perſecuted party, whoſe maſter had lately been put to a moſt ſhameful and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous death, in the moſt public manner, on the moſt public occaſion, at the riſque of every thing dear to them in the world:—And the character which men ordinarily give of themſelves, in offering to join with the church, without any ſpecial concern about their ſouls, when it is eſteemed no ſmall honor, to be church members, and enjoy church pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges.—The former, to a judgment of charity, appeared to be true converts, whatever may be thought of the latter.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. We are to diſtinguiſh between what is <hi>viſible,</hi> and what is <hi>real:</hi> Many in the eyes of men are reputed godly, who in the eyes of God as ſearcher of hearts are not ſo. The former have a right in the ſight of the church to enter into the covenant of grace, in a public profeſſion, and to ſeal the covenant: but the latter only have a right in the ſight of God. For the former appear to be godly; but the latter only are really ſo. The former have a viſible, the latter have a real right.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. There is a diſtinction to be made between a right to ſealing ordinances on <hi>our own account,</hi> and a right on the <hi>account of another.</hi> Thus pious parents have a right for ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordinances for themſelves, on their own account, as being themſelves really in covenant with God, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with it: but their infant children have a right to
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:011174_0041_0F85800381A11D40"/>
baptiſm, not on their own account, but ſimply on that of their parents, conſidered as parts of their parents, branches grown out of the old root: and ſo may be baptized with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to any internal qualification, at preſent, inherent in them, either moral or gracious.</p>
                  <p>Object. If, in infant baptiſm, no reſpect is had to any internal qualification in the infant, then the ſeal is ſet to a blank.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. <hi>Then</hi> the ſeal is ſet to a blank, when there is no covenant entered into: but when there is a covenant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into, and ſealed, there is no room for the objection. But in infant-baptiſm there is a covenant entered into. For God ſays to the pious parent, "I will be a God to thee, and to thy ſeed." And the pious parent replies, "I chooſe thee for my God and the God of my child." So that here is a covenant entered into between God and the pious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, in behalf of himſelf and his infant, in the very act of offering it to God in baptiſm. And baptiſm is a ſeal, not to a blank, but to this covenant, which, in fact, takes place between God and the pious parent.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. We are to diſtinguiſh between covenanting with God actively, in a viſible manner, as a pious parent does, when he dedicates his child to God in baptiſm, and promiſes to bring it up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; and being laid under the bonds of the covenant paſſively, as is the caſe with the child. God ſpeaks to the pious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in that ordinance, ſaying, <q>I will be a God to thee, and to thy ſeed, i. e. if they will take heed to walk in my ways.</q> The pious parent anſwers, in the act of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the child to baptiſm, "I chooſe thee for my God, and for the God of my child. And I promiſe to bring up my child for thee. And, Oh, that it might live in thy ſight, be thy child, and walk in thy ways!" The parent is active; but the child is merely paſſive. We may bring our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the bonds of the covenant, by our own act and deed, as the adult did in the plains of Moab when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed covenant there: or we may be brought under the bonds of the covenant, by the act of another, authorized by

God ſo to do. Thus Moſes laid all the infants in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, in the plains of Moab, under the bonds of the covenant. And thus parents, in offering their children to baptiſm, lay them under the bonds of the covenant.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. IF no one is to be baptized, till, by his own act and deed, he enters into covenant with God, be it the covenant of grace or a graceleſs covenant; then no infant is to be baptized on either plan: becauſe no infant, by his own act and deed, enters into any covenant of any ſort; or ſo much as knows, that there is any covenant of any ſort, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into.—If the child has a right to baptiſm, on it's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents account, and not on it's own, infant-baptiſm, can be vindicated, as well on the plan of a gracious covenant, as on the plan of an ungracious one; but if the child's right to baptiſm is founded on it's own perſonal compliance with the covenant, infant-baptiſm muſt be given up on the plan of a covenant of moral ſincerity and a right doctrinal belief; for no infant was ever thus qualified: But ſome infants have been ſanctified from the womb, and ſo in this ſenſe have been in the covenant of grace. Luk. 1.15.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. IT muſt apparently be an unſpeakable advantage, to be under the watch and care of a godly church, who have a real ſpirit of fidelity in them; and, like Abraham, will command all, under their care, to fear the Lord. Gen. 18.19. And it is equally evident, that it can be of no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to be under the watch and care of an ungodly church, who will neither walk in the ways of God themſelves, nor bring up thoſe committed to their care for God. God put confidence in Abraham, <hi>I know him, that he will command his children and his houſhold after him,</hi> &amp;c. But there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to be put in an ungodly man, that he will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God, with reſpect to his own ſoul, or the ſouls of his children.

                  <p>THERE are three things in Mr. M.'s external cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, viz. The conditions required, the privileges promiſed and the ſeals; and his ideas concerning each of theſe, as expreſſed in his book, are inconſiſtent.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes he makes circumciſion the only condition. "For that by which," ſays he, <q>any one was to enter into this covenant, was an external mark in the fleſh. <hi>This is my covenant, which ye ſhall keep between me and you, and thy ſeed after thee; every man-child among you ſhall be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</hi> But that by which any one enters into the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace is <hi>the circumciſion of the heart.</hi>
                     </q> p. 7. <note n="*" place="bottom">"That by which any one enters into the covenant of grace is the circumciſion of the heart:" and yet he is obliged to deny this p. 21; and to affirm that the circumciſion of the heart intends no more then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into his external graceleſs covenant, in order to get rid of that plain text Ezek. 44.9. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, no ſtranger uncircumciſed in heart, &amp;c. ſhall enter into my ſanctuary;</hi> which is a prophecy of the glorious ſtate of the church ſpoken of. Iſai. 2.3, 4, 5, Chap. 11.1—9. and 60.21. When Satan will be bound agreeable to Rev. 20. and when Mr. M.'s external covenant will be no more practiſed upon in the whole earth for a thouſand years. For in that day, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger uncircumciſed in heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

For in that day right doctrine and right diſcipline will uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally take place, and then all will be agreed: <hi>For they ſhall ſee eye to eye.</hi> Iſai. 52.8.</note> So that the circumciſion of the fleſh brings men into the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal covenant, and gives them a covenant right to all it's privileges; juſt as the circumciſion of the heart brings men into the covenant of grace, and gives them a covenant right to all the bleſſings of that. But the circumciſion of the heart as the phraſe is uſed in ſcripture, is a real compliance with the covenant of grace, and is connected with eternal life. Rom. 2.29. And accordingly he ſpeaks of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the fleſh as a compliance with the external co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, p. 8. "This covenant remained to be complied with:—Abraham muſt needs be circumciſed."</p>
                  <p>And, indeed, if Mr. M. was diſpoſed to turn the covenant with Abraham into his external covenant, of neceſſity the circumciſion of the fleſh muſt be the only condition of it; becauſe there was nothing elſe external which took place in that covenant recorded in Gen. 17. to which Mr. M. could with any colour lay claim, for Abraham made no profeſſion,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:011174_0043_0F858004DCDFE820"/>
but a profeſſion of ſaving faith. But this was a viſible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the covenant of grace, and not with the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal covenant. If, therefore, he did any thing at all, by way of compliance with Mr. M.'s external covenant, it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, merely &amp; ſimply making 'an external mark in the fleſh.'</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as Mr. M. thus ſometimes repreſents the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the fleſh, to be a compliance with the external co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Abraham; ſo he ſometimes repreſents baptiſm, as entitling to all the privileges of his external covenant, under the goſpel diſpenſation. For according to him, all who are baptized "are Abraham's children, and heirs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the promiſe." p. 13. "For a child baptized in infancy," he ſays, <q>is thereby as really brought into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as one that is baptized in riper years.—It conveys the ſame privileges to the one as to the other.</q> p. 16. But the adult, having made a profeſſion, were, in the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic age, by baptiſm, received into full communion with the church, in compleat ſtanding, as is evident from Act. 2.37—47.—And in this view, Mr. M. conſiders infant baptiſm, as "a valuable privilege"—"as it entitles to the appointed means of grace," p. 54, 55. that is, to all church privileges. And inſiſts, that thoſe, who are baptized in infancy <q>ſhould be told, that they are really in covenant with God, that they are members of the viſible church, and are entitled to the privileges of it.</q> And as they have a title to the privileges, ſo "they are in duty bound to ſeek the enjoyment of and attend upon theſe privileges." p. 55, 56. For, according to Mr. M. <q>a child dedicated to God in baptiſm, is thereby brought into covenant with God, and has a promiſe left to it, of the means of grace, and the ſtrivings of God's holy Spirit, in order to render them effectual for ſalvation: but an unbaptized child is left in the kingdom of darkneſs.</q> p. 59, 60. And he adds <q>it is but trifling to ſay, that altho' baptized perſons may be ſtiled members of the church univerſal; yet they are not members of any particular church.</q> p. 56.—So that, upon the whole, it appears, that by baptiſm alone, infants are made members of the church, in ſuch ſort, as to
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011174_0043_0F858004DCDFE820"/>
have a divine right and title to all church privileges: which is full as much as can be ſaid of any, who are in full commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in compleat ſtanding.—And thus we ſee what Mr. M's ſcheme is, in this view of it. And here let us ſtop a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or two, and look round, and conſider where we are now. For if theſe things are true, it will follow,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That no internal, mental qualifications are now, or ever were requiſite, in order to a right to all church privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges in the ſight of God; neither moral, nor gracious; neither faith, nor practice, of one ſort, or of the other; no, nothing at all, but only "an external mark in the fleſh," or water baptiſm. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>The land of Canaan was one chief external bleſſing of the Abraha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic covenant. Gen. 17.8. A compliance with that covenant gave a covenant right to a poſſeſſion of it. Num. 32.11, 12. The Iſraelites who came out of Egypt were all circumciſed. Joſh. 5.5. If in circumciſion, they fully complied with that covenant, on their part; then their carcaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes did not fall in the wilderneſs, becauſe they on their part broke cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but becauſe God broke covenant on his part. They on their part fulfilled the only condition on which the land of Canaan was promiſed, but God was not true to the covenant on his part. So the fault was not in them, but in him. And in this view, Lev. 26. and Deut. 28. are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely inconſiſtent with the Abrahamic covenant. And ſo alſo is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine conduct in the expulſion of the Jews out of the land of Canaan by Nebuchadnezzar formerly, as well as in their preſent diſperſion. For they, on their parts, have always kept covenant. For they have always cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed their children, from the time they took poſſeſſion of the land of Canaan to this day. Nor can Pſal 50.16. Iſa. 1, 10—1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>And if baptiſm alone, without reſpect to any mental qualification, gives a covenant right to all the external privileges of the viſible church of Chriſt; then no conſiſtent meaning can be given to theſe texts, Mat. 18.17. Mat. 22.12. Cor. 5.11. and Chap. 11.28, 29. Tit. 3.10.11. Rev. 2.4, 5. &amp;c. &amp;c.—The truth is, by ſealing a covenant we are bound to fulfil it: but it is an actual compliance with a covenant, that entitles us to its bleſſings. Lev. 26. Deut. 28.

                  <p n="2">2. In order to our being ſatisfied, in our own conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that we have a right in the ſight of God to come to the Lord's-table, we are not <q>to examine ourſelves of our knowledge to diſcern the Lord's body, of our faith to feed upon him, of our repentance, love and new obedience</q>
                     <pb n="70" facs="unknown:011174_0044_0F85800723E1AB40"/>
                     <hi>as the aſſembly of divines</hi> imagined an hundred and twenty years ago: Nor are we to examine ourſelves of our doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal knowlege, orthodoxy, moral ſincerity, or of any thing elſe, of an internal, mental nature. For a right to the Lord's-ſupper has no dependance on any thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For, but one thing was needful to ſatisfy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Jew, <hi>viz.</hi> "The external mark in the fleſh," which might eaſily be known. And the chriſtian has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, but to procure and keep by him, a well atteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted certificate of his baptiſm, to give him a full aſſurance of his right to come to the Lord's-table. For,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. No crime, altho' of the moſt ſcandalous nature, could vacate this right, in the ſight of God, or in the ſight of conſcience; becauſe this right was not founded in any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral qualifications whatſoever, but only in "an external mark in the fleſh," or water baptiſm. But the idolatry of the Jew did not at all take away "the external mark in the fleſh;" nor can the open infidelity and debauchery of the chriſtian prove, that the certificate, which he has, of his baptiſm, is not authentick. Let the idolatrous Jew look on "the external mark in the fleſh," and let the infidel and immoral chriſtian look on his certificate, and their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences may be confirmed, in a full aſſurance of their divine right and title to all covenant privileges. <note n="§" place="bottom">
                        <p>This is a ſhort and eaſy method for diſhoneſt, cheating, promiſe-braeking profeſſors to come to the Lord's Table with a good conſcience; and for thoſe who live in the <hi>neglect of family prayer,</hi> and who inſtead of bringing up their children in the <hi>nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> train them up to <hi>live after the fleſh, in chambering and wantonneſs;</hi> while they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves live <hi>in malice and envy</hi> towards their fellow profeſſors.—Mr. M. is of opinion, that it is of very bad and dangerous tendency, for thoſe who are admitted into the church to make a profeſſion of Godlineſs, leſt by their ungodly lives they ſhould diſgrace their profeſſion, and tempt others to turn infidels. p. 53.54. And for the ſame reaſon it is not beſt that any of the profeſſed followers of Chriſt ſhould pretend to be honeſt men, left their diſhoneſt practices ſhould ſink the holy religion of Chriſt into contempt, and promote infidelity in the world. For indeed, it is come to this already, that among the Mohometans, it is a common thing when men are charged with cheating, or ſuſpected of any diſhoneſt trick, to reply with indignation, "what! do you think I am a chriſtian?" —</p>
                        <p>Nor can it be juſtified, in Mr. M.'s way of reaſoning, for the church to require a profeſſion of moral honeſty, of thoſe whom they admit to full communion. For every one of his objections againſt a profeſſion of Godlineſs are of full force againſt a profeſſion of a diſpoſition honeſtly to pay our debts; and act up to our word and promiſe in our dealings with our fellow-men —For (1.) ſuch an honeſt diſpoſition is an inviſible quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and we cannot be certain the men have it in their hearts; and therefore on this plan there can be no viſible church p. 48.—Beſides, (2) according to this, the deſign of God muſt have been to have made a viſible diſtinction between honeſt and diſhoneſt men. But this is contrary to ſcripture, which repreſents the viſible church like a net which catches all ſorts, good and bad. P. 49, 50 — (3.) Admiſſion to full communion on this plan will do hurt to men's ſouls, tend to make them think they are honeſt when they are not, and to blow up pride in their hearts, and to make them ſay with the phariſee, <hi>God I thank thee, I am not as others are, extortioners, unjuſt.</hi> &amp;c. P. 52.53.—And (4.) it will tend greatly to wound religion, when afterwards they neglect to do as they ſay, and are not honeſt to pay their debts. P. 54. Beſides, (5.) This ſcheme makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm a mere nullity. For if moral honeſty is a neceſſary qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſealing ordinances then infants cannot receive the ſeal. For the church can have no poſitive evidence that they have an honeſt diſpoſition. The Anabaptiſts therefore are right in rejecting the baptiſm of infants. P. 54.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are Mr. M.'s "moſt weighty and material objections, an anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to which he has never yet ſeen attempted." P. 48 —But it ſo happens, that they are of equal weight againſt himſelf, unleſs he will ſay, that moral honeſty is not a qualification neceſſary for church-memberſhip.</p>
                     </note> Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="71" facs="unknown:011174_0044_0F85800723E1AB40"/>4. No public profeſſion of any kind, nor freedom from public ſcandal are neceſſary in order to a viſible right to all church privileges, in the ſight of men. For, if our real right, in the ſight of God, does not depend on any internal qualification, either moral, or gracious; no pretence need to be made, to any ſuch qualification, in order to a viſible right. The Jew had nothing to do, in order to prove his right, but only to make it appear, that he had been circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. And the chriſtian has nothing to do, in order to prove his right, but only to make it appear, that he has been baptized. Nor can the church conſiſtently demand any thing farther, on Mr. M's ſcheme. For what he ſays, p. 22. is the plain, ſimple truth: <q>To require more of the perſon to be admitted into the church, than is made neceſſary by the covenant on which it is framed, is really abſurd.</q> But if all theſe things are true, then it will follow,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Mr. M. is inconſiſtent with himſelf, in putting
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:011174_0045_0F858007DA14E140"/>
"an outward profeſſion" along with "an external covenant relation," as he does, in p. 9. and for ſaying as he does, in p. 21. <q>I will allow, that none but ſuch as profeſs the chriſtian religion, and will endeavour to conform his practice to the rules of it, ought to be admitted into the church;</q> and for aſſerting, p. 44. that "the diſorderly and vicious ſhould be debarred." For, if baptiſm alone is all that is neceſſary to a covenant right to all church pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges; then baptiſm alone is all that ought to be required in order to an admiſſion into the church. Nor is a public profeſſion, or freedom from public ſcandal, at all requiſite. If baptiſm alone gives a covenant right to all church pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, if there is "a promiſe left" by God to thoſe who have this; no man, nor any number of men under heaven have a right to require any thing elſe. So that to inſiſt, that "none but ſuch as profeſs the chriſtian religion and will endeavour to conform his practice to the rules of it, ought to be admitted into the church;" and that <q>diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and vicious perſons ought to be debarred:"— And to keep ſuch back from enjoying the privileges and means appointed for the good of their ſouls, is a very ſtrange affair.</q> p. 59. And, therefore, to uſe Mr. M's own words, and to apply them to his own conſcience; p. 58. <q>I would requeſt ſuch as have thought and acted upon this ſcheme, impartially to examine what I have offered. It is ſurely no ſmall matter to ſhut the kingdom of heaven (as the viſible church is often called) againſt men, and not to ſuffer ſuch to enter as would.</q> A horrid crime indeed! And yet the very crime, of which Mr. M. ſtands publickly convicted out of his mouth. For he ſhuts the kingdom of heaven againſt all baptized perſons, and will not admit one of them into the church, <q>but ſuch as profeſs the chriſtian religion, and endeavour to conform their practice to the rules of it:</q> altho', according to his own ſcheme, they are as much in the church as he is, and have as good a right to all church privileges as himſelf. Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Mr. M. may be publickly called to an account, and admoniſhed out of his own mouth, in his own words, for
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:011174_0045_0F858007DA14E140"/>
making infant baptiſm "a meer nullity, a thing of naught." —<q>And what is a baptized infant to be accounted of? Is he a member of the viſible church, or is he not?</q> p. 54. And to be rebuked for his conduct, for practically <q>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting and treating ſuch as are baptized, as if they were not really in covenant,</q> p. 56. by refuſing to admit them to covenant privileges, without a profeſſion, when, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own ſcheme, he ought to tell all baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that <q>they are really in covenant with God; that they are members of the viſible church; and are entitled to the privileges of it,</q> p. 55, 56. merely by their baptiſm, without any profeſſion at all, and without any endeavours at all, even all of them, "old and young, moral and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral." p. 42. For,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſay, that "the diſorderly and vicious ought to be debarred," p. 44. and ſo "to require more than is made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by the covenant, on which the church is framed, is really abſurd." p. 22. For if baptiſm gives a covenant right to the Lord's-ſupper nothing elſe is neceſſary.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To ſay, that "the diſorderly and vicious ought to be debarred," by the church, is to ſay, implicitly, that ſuch ought to debar themſelves; their own conſciences ought to pronounce ſentence upon them. But what if a man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhould happen to be convinced of this plain ſcripture truth, that to riſe in rebellion againſt the great God is one of the moſt "diſorderly" things a creature can be guilty of; and that to continue obſtinate in this rebellion after all the external means which God has uſed to reclaim us, is one of the moſt "vicious"? Muſt not his own conſcience debar him on Mr. M's ſcheme? Or will it do, to tell ſuch a man, <q>had you been guilty of ſtealing but five ſhillings from one of your neighbours, for this ſin if conſidered only as againſt man, your conſcience ought to have debarred you, 'till you had come to repentance and made reſtitution; but your conſcience ought not to debar you for being an obſtinate, impenitent rebel againſt the God of heaven, the great Sovereign of the univerſe?</q> Or might we not for telling a man thus, be in danger of that rebuke in Mat.

And to riſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the great God is doubtleſs more "diſorderly and vicious" than to riſe in rebellion againſt an earthly mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch.—In a word, if baptiſm alone does not entitle to all church privileges, both "young and old, moral and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral," p. 42. without reſpect to any mental qualification whatſoever, it will not be eaſy to find a place where a man may ſet his foot down, and be conſiſtent with himſelf, unleſs we return back to the good old way, to the apoſtolic plan, according to which, not baptiſm, but ſaving faith is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the condition of the covenant, and that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles to all it's bleſſings.

                  <p>Mr. M. ſays, p. 42. <q>as to baptized children, I allow they have a right to the ſacrament of the Lord's-ſupper, but not a right of immediate poſſeſſion; according to the apoſtle's repreſentation in Gal. 4.12. <hi>Now, I ſay, that the heir as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, tho' he be lord of all, but is under tutors and governors, until the time appointed of the father.</hi>
                     </q>—But the child, tho' ever ſo young, eats bread at his father's table, and no one diſputes his right. And when the child is of age, and his father is dead, and the eſtate is to be divided among the heirs, the child has nothing to do, in order to prove his right to a ſhare in his father's eſtate, but to bring a certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate from the town clerk, in order to prove from the town records, that he is the child of the deceaſed. Nor is ſuch a child obliged to make any profeſſion, or to enter into any covenant before <hi>the court of probate,</hi> in order to come to a poſſeſſion of his right. The law gives him his right with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch prerequiſites. For his right is not founded upon any thing of ſuch a nature, but ſimply upon his being the child of ſuch a father. This therefore is the only point to be proved. And juſt the ſame, to be conſiſtent, muſt be
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:011174_0046_0F85800B0F73DF20"/>
the caſe on Mr. M's plan. The only point, which one who was baptized in infancy, has to prove, when he becomes adult, in order to take poſſeſſion of his right, is that he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. Let him therefore produce a well atteſted certificate of this, and nothing farther can be demanded.</p>
                  <p>If it ſhould be ſaid, that all that Mr. M. means is, that baptiſm gives a conditional right to the Lord's Table. i. e. a right upon condition of a profeſſion of religion and freedom from ſcandal; it may be replied, that the unbaptiſed have a right to ſealing ordinances upon theſe conditions, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Mr. M.'s own ſcheme, and therefore, this cannot be his meaning. For this, to uſe his own words, would be to make baptiſm "a meer nullity, a thing of naught."—But this brings us, in the next place, to obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. THAT Mr. M.'s ideas of the peculiar privileges of his external covenant are alſo inconſiſtent.—For, if it ſhould be enquired, what advantage hath Mr. M.'s graceleſs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanter, or what profit is there in baptiſm adminiſtred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a graceleſs covenant? He has no right, upon his ſcheme, to the Apoſtle's anſwer in Rom. 3.1, 2. <hi>Much every way</hi> &amp;c. For.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to <hi>the oracles of God,</hi> which he claims for one of the chief privileges of his external covenant, p. 9. he will grant, that they are common to the unbaptized. i. e. the unbaptized have as good a right to read and hear the word of God, as the baptized have; and as good a right to believe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the goſpel. For, by Chriſt's laſt commiſſion, <hi>the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is to be preached to all nations,</hi> to the uncircumciſed Greek as well as to the circumciſed Jew: yea, to <hi>every creature:</hi> and that, previous to, and in order to prepare men for baptiſm, Mar. 16.15, 16. So that, there is not the leaſt need of being in his external covenant, in order to have as good a right, to hear and believe and be juſtified by the goſpel, as any man on earth has. <hi>For there is no difference.</hi> Rom. 3.22. compare Mat. 10.5, 6. Mar. 28.19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to ſealing ordinances, he is full in it, that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm alone, gives no right to them, for our ſelves, or for our children, which can be enjoyed, without a profeſſion
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:011174_0047_0F85800BE72F76B0"/>
of the chriſtian religion, p. 21, and freedom from ſcandal, p. 44 and one who never was baptiſed, may, on his ſcheme, he admitted to ſealing ordinances, for himſelf, and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, upon the ſame terms; no higher, nor lower, being required. So that there is no advantage, in this reſpect, in being in his external covenant. —And</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As to <hi>the influences of the ſpirit, whereby the means of grace are rendered effectual to the ſalvation of ſinners,</hi> he holds, that no unconverted man has a covenat right to them; but that <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy:</hi> and has been at the pains to publiſh a laboured ſermon on the ſubeject, to prove the point, and to anſwer objections; which was printed but ſix years ago. And if this be true, the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed cannot claim a covenant-right to theſe influences of the ſpirit, any more than the unbaptized. And therefore, altho' in the book now under conſideration, p. 59, 60, he ſays, <q>a child dedicated to God in baptiſm is thereby bro't into covenant with God, and has a promiſe left to it, of the means of grace, and the flrivings of the Spirit, in order to render them effectual for ſalvation: But an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized child is left in the kingdom of darkneſs;</q> yet it is true, on his own ſcheme, that ſuch a baptized child, while in a Chriſtleſs ſtate, is under the wrath of God, the curſe of the law, a child of the devil and an heir of hell, and is dependant on God's ſovereign mercy, as really as any other child. Yea, he declares, in his ſermon on <hi>Divine ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty,</hi> p. 5, 6. that, <q>ſometimes thoſe who to an eye of reaſon are the moſt likely to partake of the bleſſings of the goſpel are paſſed by; and others of whom we have little or no hope, are recovered by Sovereign Grace, and enriched with Saving Mercy. Thus we ſhould have thought, Judas, who was one of Chriſt's diſciples, and his conſtant follower, was more likely to obtain the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſaving mercy than Saul, who was a fierce, zealous and open enemy to Chriſt: but we ſee God ordered it otherwiſe." And he adds, p. 7. "this was not a thing peculiar to that generation: but it is the Sovereign Grace of God, by which, any one, at any time, is brought to obey the truth to the ſaving of his ſoul.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="77" facs="unknown:011174_0047_0F85800BE72F76B0"/>4. As to the advantage of church diſcipline, Mr. M. grants, what every body knows to be too true, that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized are taken no more care of, generally, than the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized. p. 56. Nor will it mend the matter, if we ſhould all embrace Mr. M's ſcheme, and fill up our churches more and more with ungodly men. For goſpel diſcipline never was, and never will be maintained by ungoſpel churches. For ſo long as men are themſelves at heart enemies to the religion of Chriſt, it's doctrines and duties, they will not themſelves be cordially ſubject to it's doctrines and duties; much leſs join heartily to bring <hi>others</hi> to be in ſubjection to them. As it is written, Mat. 7.16, 17. <hi>Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles? Even ſo every good tree bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth corrupt fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. Nor are his ideas of the ſeals of the covenant any more conſiſtent.—For,</p>
                  <p>His notion of a ſeal is, that it is a rite of confirmation, whereby, in a mutual covenant, both parties bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to comply with the covenant contained in the written inſtrument. But he grants, that in the written inſtrument, in the preſent caſe, the covenant of grace is contained, and is the principal thing, and yet, by ſealing this inſtrument, we do not pretend to a compliance with the covenant of grace in our own conſciences, or profeſs any ſuch thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world. Nay, we do not profeſs to have, in the loweſt degree, a heart to comply with it, nor mean that the act of ſealing ſhould have this import; altho' in all other matters execpt thoſe of religion; this is what is meant by ing. But inſtead of a compliance with the covenant of grace, which is the principal thing, according to him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the written inſtrument, we only profeſs a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his graceleſs covenant, and bind ourſelves to ſuch religious exerciſes and endeavours, as are conſiſtent with a total rejection of the covenant of grace in our hearts: even ſuch a total rejection, as God threatens with eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. p. 36, 37. But of this, we have ſpoken before. <hi>Sect.</hi> V.</p>
                  <p>Thus inconſiſtent are Mr. M's notions of his external co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:011174_0048_0F85800DC7645580"/>
it's conditions, it's peculiar privileges and it's ſeals.</p>
                  <p>To mention but one inconſiſtence more in Mr. M's ſcheme: The external covenant, is, according to him, the appointed <hi>means;</hi> and ſaving faith and converſion, or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the covenant of grace is the <hi>end.</hi> p. 10, 11. And yet he ſays, p. 8. <q>Altho' a perſon was in a ſtate of grace, and was conſequently included in the covenant of grace, yet this covenant remained to be complied with: Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was a true believer before, yet he muſt needs be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed.</q> But if Abraham was converted and juſtified before he was circumciſed, then circumciſion was not inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted as a means of his converſion, or as a prerequiſite to his juſtification. Mr. M. adds, p. 12. that his external grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs covenant is alſo to be a means <q>to train up believers in holineſs.</q>—That is, holy Abraham, inſtead of thoſe holy exerciſes in which he had lived above 20 years, even ever ſince he began a holy life, was in Gen. 17. by God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty laid under covenant bonds, to enter into a courſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy religious exerciſes, ſuch as take place in impenitent ſelf-righteous ſinners, to the end that he might "be trained up in holineſs." Gal. 3.3. <hi>Are ye ſo fooliſh? having begun in the ſpirit, are ye now made perfect by the fleſh?</hi> Beſides,</p>
                  <p>That believers ſhould be under the bonds of two cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, of a nature as contrary and inconſiſtent, as ſin and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, is what cannot be made to hang together.—And to ſay, that this external covenant is neither ſinful nor holy, is, either, to ſay, that there is a whole ſyſtem of religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of heart, which are neither conformable nor uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable with the holy law of God: which is to deny, that the law of God is a univerſal rule of life, contrary to the whole tenor of ſcripture. Gal. 3.10. Mat. 22.37—40. 1 Cor. 10.31. Or, which is equally abſurd, to ſay, that no exerciſe of heart is required in his external covenant; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bodily motions, unconnected with the heart.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, the very notion of two rules of duty, a holy, and an unholy one, which is eſſential to his notion of two cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, is an inconſiſtence. For two contrary laws, inſtead of binding, both at once, muſt mutually deſtroy each other,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:011174_0048_0F85800DC7645580"/>
and can, neither of them, bind to any thing.—That law which is <hi>a ſchool maſter to bring us to Chriſt,</hi> requires ſinleſs perfection on pain of eternal damnation. Compare Gal. 3.24. with verſe 10.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have finiſhed the remarks, which I deſign to make on Mr. <hi>Mather</hi>'s book. There are other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it equally exceptionable; but if his external cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which is the foundation of his whole ſcheme is prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be an unſcriptural and inconſiſtent thing, his whole ſcheme is ſufficiently confuted. Beſides, while the whole controverſy is reduced to one ſingle point, the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will be under better advantages to make a judgment for themſelves. But now the only point which the reader has to determine, in order to ſettle the whole Controverſy, in his own mind, is this, viz. <hi>Are baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper ſeals of the covenant of grace, or of a graceleſs covenant?</hi>

                  <p>LET it be remembered, that "the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> confeſſion of faith," which is adopted by the church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the <hi>Savoy</hi> confeſſion of faith," which is adopted by the churches in the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> and in <hi>Connecticut;</hi> declare that "ſacraments are holy ſigns &amp; ſeals of the covenant of grace." And let it be remembered, that theſe confeſſions of faith know nothing of Mr. M's <hi>external graceleſs covenant,</hi> either name or thing. And let it alſo be remembered, that "the heads of agreement" which were aſſented to in <hi>England</hi> in the laſt century, by thoſe called <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> &amp; <hi>Congregationaliſts,</hi> and which are adopted by the churches in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> declare, <q>that none ſhall be admitted as members, in order to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in all the ſpecial ordinances of the goſpel, but ſuch perſons, as are knowing and ſound in the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal doctrine of the chriſtian religion, without ſcandal in their lives; and to a judgment regulated by the word of God, are perſons of viſible holineſs and honeſty, <hi>credibly profeſſing cordial ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the queſtion is, whether this plan is agreeable to the word of God, or not.
