            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>FROM the various converſations that we have had on the ſubject of taxation, and ſtill more from the abſurd notions that many of your neighbours have entertained on this matter, in imagining that the income of their farms would ſcarcely be ſufficient to defray the certain annual demand to pay the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and intereſt of the foreign foederal and internal debt, as well as the abſolute and neceſſary expence of government, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to offer a Scheme whereby it will appear, that a ſum far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding whatever poſſibly could be imagined would be required, might be raiſed without oppreſſing the inhabitants of Town or Country; and that too, in ſo ſimple and intelligible a manner, that every perſon, even of the meaneſt capacity, may comprehend and digeſt the whole: but as the ſum ſpecified can never be wanted nor required by the State, one quarter part of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

            <p>BUT in order to prevent ſmuggling, which might greatly leſſen the amount of duties, let us ſuppoſe the above ſum of £. 300,000, was to be levied on the individuals by a tax, called the <hi>Equivalent of Duties,</hi> in much the ſame proportion as houſes are taxed; that is to ſay, from one ſhilling to forty ſhillings each perſon, according to the reſpective ability of the inhabitant; and let all duties, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts, and every other rate be done away: ſo that the country ſhall be free and open to receive goods from the whole world, without payment of any cuſtom, toll, or aſſeſsment whatever.</p>
            <p>SINCE nothing can be more deſtructive to the morals of a people, than the encouragement which ſeems to be given to perjury by the common forms of a Cuſtom-Houſe, and <hi>even</hi> with that infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous clog, it would be impoſſible to prevent ſmuggling on ſo extenſive a ſhore, unleſs ſuch a number of Coſtom-Houſe Officers were employed as might become dangerous to the conſtitution, as well as diſguſting and oppreſſive to the inhabitants, no good man could have, nor ought to make any reaſonable reſiſtance to this mode of levying the duties.</p>

BESIDES a tax of this kind might be made exceedingly uſeful, in as much as on any emergency it could be <hi>even</hi> doubled without being greatly felt; whereas that upon houſes would be oppreſſive if it greatly exceeded what is here propoſed.</p>
            <p>ON the contrary, as ſoon as the internal and federal State debt was paid, the tax on houſes in the Country, Towns and Cities, ought to be reduced in proportion to the terms ſtated, and the wants of the State.</p>
            <p>AND whereas the number of houſes that might be erected yearly, from henceforward, would greatly encreaſe the revenue, the ſame ſhould be regulated in ſuch a manner, that the ſurplus be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably deducted from next year's tax on houſes, or appropriated towards the eſtabliſhment of a ſinking fund, which might be made the baſis of a ſolid State Bank and Loan Office, whoſe profits ariſing from monies lent on lands, and bills or notes diſcounted, would in a few years be altogether ſufficient for the ſupport of our civil government, and be the means of abrogating and doing away all taxes, as well as duties whatſoever.</p>

            <p>THEREFORE the foregoing is the moſt exact computation that could be made without introducing fractional parts of a penny, which has been purpoſely avoided: and it is to be obſerved alſo, that merely to form a calculation, each family has been reckoned
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018436_0011_0FA76AE085C399E8"/>to conſiſt of ſeven ſouls, that is to ſay the maſter, miſtreſs, and five children, or ſervants; but let the number be more or leſs, the houſeholder has only to pay the equivalent tax in proportion to that of which his family conſiſts.</p>
            <p>NO one can doubt but that thoſe who have hitherto had the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of aſſeſſing for a County and Poor rate, are capable to make a proper diſtribution, or arrange the different claſſes here propoſed: for it is only required to divide the number of houſeholders by thirteen, and let all who formerly paid the leaſt, amounting in number to one thirteenth part of the whole, come into No. I. or the loweſt claſs; and thoſe who contributed the moſt or greateſt ſum, into No. XIII. or the higheſt claſs: the medium and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent gradations can therefore be eaſily aſcertained, a due reſpect being had to the ſuppoſed worth of a man's real or perſonal eſtate in the country, and to the rent at which the houſe lets in the City and Towns.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS AND REFLECTIONS ON THE FOREGOING PLAN OF TAXATION, HUMBLY SUBMITTED TO THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THIS STATE OF NEW-YORK.</head>
            <p>THE ſimplicity of the Tax is perhaps one of the principal points of view in which it can be recommended to public notice: it cannot be difficult for the Aſſeſſors appointed by government,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018436_0013_0FA76AE202C94990"/>or choſe by the unanimous voice of the people, to arrange the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of each County, Diſtrict, or Town, into the propoſed or a greater number of claſſes, without giving the leaſt diſguſt or ſhowing any partiality in the manner; and when that is done, every member of the community will exactly know the <hi>quota</hi> aſſigned to him, and cheerfully ſubmit to ſhare in the public burthen: whilſt it may prevent altercation in reſpect to one man's farm or eſtate being rated beyond what the due proportion will bear to another, the natural deſire of being placed in a better light than perhaps a nice ſcrutiny into his ſituation would admit, will cauſe a laudable emulation of every houſeholder to prefer a higher rather than a lower claſs, and make every one pleaſed with that which may be allotted him.</p>
            <p>IT is well known that the moſt diſagreeable part of all taxes, is the anxious uncertainty in which it leaves the minds of the taxed; therefore it muſt be a conſolation to every citizen, to know and be able to calculate for himſelf, the ſum he owes to his country, as ſoon as he is made acquainted with the general demand of the State, and that his ſhare thereof will not depend on the erroneous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Aſſeſſor. The burthen of ſuch a tax, if it may be called by that name, becomes much lighter in conſequence of its ſimplicity, and every citizen of the State may be truly ſaid to be his own Aſſeſſor; an advantage hitherto unknown to be enjoyed either in Europe or America.</p>
            <p>THE unity and eaſe of collecting the tax is ſo obvious, that a preference muſt be given to it in oppoſition to the intricate and uncertain methods practiſed in a neighbouring State, as well as in Europe: It is required only to know the propoſed medium in order
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018436_0014_0FA76AE62CEFCCA8"/>to aſſign the loweſt and higheſt tax, and proportion with mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical exactneſs, the ſum that each intermediate claſs muſt pay: and what enhances the value of the mode is, that the tax may be raiſed or diminiſhed without trouble, without alteration in the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principle, and without an addition to the number of officers or collectors appointed to receive the ſame.</p>
            <p>THIS mode of taxation will unite the greateſt and moſt valuable advantages; a preciſe and impartial equity in its diſtribution; an inconſiderable weight on each individual founded on that very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; and it will convey to each maſter of a houſe the clear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what he has to pay: this moſt uſeful knowledge will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently baniſh from his mind all dread, and in ſhort become to the moſt uninformed citizen, a ſource of perpetual tranquility and peace of mind on that delicate head. If then this tax in all its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations, can be leſſened or raiſed without its being ſcarcely felt, and with an expence ſo trifling and well aſcertained; it muſt be confeſſed that thoſe advantages will undoubtedly be derived from the unity in the plan, as well as from the extreme ſimplicity in the execution.</p>
            <p>THE burthen chiefly, it may be ſaid, will fall on the middle claſſes of the people; but who more able to bear it? Will they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at the ſmall ſum allotted in the ſpecimen to each man's ſhare, when they perceive that the very poor indeed pay ſuch a trifle? Surely no?</p>
            <p>THE richeſt citizen of New-York, will only have to contribute ſixteen pounds per annum, for his houſe and equivalent tax, whilſt a perſon inhabiting a houſe of forty pounds yearly rent, pays two
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018436_0015_0FA76AE7337A3130"/>pounds eleven ſhillings and nine-pence, a gentleman of the largeſt landed eſtate in the country, nine pounds fifteen ſhillings, and the pooreſt houſeholder no more than ſix ſhillings and nine-pence, as has been fully ſhewn; the principal perſon in Albany, and the various Towns throughout the State, ſix pounds, and the pooreſt mechanic in them, eleven ſhillings and nine-pence only.</p>
            <p>WHO can therefore complain of the burthen or heavy load of taxes, when it is conſidered that the duties which might be laid on wines and other luxuries, would amount, on the conſumption of the rich, to perhaps as much as he is taxed on the whole?</p>
            <p>AS it has been before obſerved, that the chief burthen might be thought to fall on the middle claſſes of the people, it becomes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to remark, that the middle claſſes are by far the moſt nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, the moſt-thriving, and thoſe on whoſe labour principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the ſtrength, the aggrandizement, and in ſhort the popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the State: far happier in that as well as in many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are we than the Europeans, whoſe government hardly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits but of two extremes, and know not that reſpectable claſs we here denominate middling! That claſs of true American freehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, equally removed from the danger of poſſeſſing riches and the meaneſs of poverty; who, independent and free, till the ſoil which belongs to them, embelliſh the earth, convert the hideous ſwamp into pleaſing meadows; and in the purity of their manners as well as in their unbiaſſed, unprejudiced turn of mind, become and are in fact the nurſery of our moſt valuable claſs of citizens induſtrious and neat at home, brave in the field, ſagacious and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018436_0016_0FA76AE74EBE6618"/>proper to fill the different municipal ſtations of government which may be confered on them.</p>
            <p>WE have only to add that the expence of collecting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed tax, is trifling in compariſon to any other mode that can be deviſed: For let us ſuppoſe that the aſſeſſors would chearfully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to make the arrangement without fee or reward, will not any man be glad to collect, in his particular town or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict, the whole tax for two and a half per cent. on the whole amount? Which of courſe would bring in ſo much clear money to government, free from every other charge.</p>
            <p>SINCE therefore it is evident that a ſufficiency for the exigencies of the State may in this manner be raiſed without taxing the land; will it not be of infinite ſervice to the community in general to adopt the plan? Will it not be the means of drawing from all parts of Europe the moſt valuable ſubjects and citizens for an infant State, men of induſtry, acquainted with agriculture and the arts, and who, having groaned under oppreſſion in their own country, would taſte in a ſuperior degree the ſweets of liberty in this? And who, from a deſire to obtain the luxuries as well as the neceſſaries of life, would be preſſed on, by natural impulſe, to the utmoſt exertions of ſkill in their various profeſſions.</p>
            <p>WILL not the lands within this State being excuſed from paying any tax, prove equal, if not ſuperior to a bounty granted on the exportation of grain, which in another country has produced ſo wonderful an effect? And in a State occupied chiefly by farmers or improvers of the land, would put it on a much more excellent footing than its neighbours; and enable the merchant to export
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018436_0017_0FA76AE803361908"/>the produce on ſuch reaſonable terms as might greatly affect the imports both in price and quantity, to the no ſmall emolument and advantage of every individual of the community.</p>
            <p>LET us on the other hand conſider the high and diſtinguiſhed character which this State will thereby obtain among the nations in Europe, or wherever it ſhall be known throughout the world, that the arable, woodland and meadows, are exempt from taxes; that the manufactures and various productions of the univerſe may be admitted into it, without payment of any duties; and that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants liberally provide for their own internal demands without burthening the foreigner. What idea then muſt foreigners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of ſuch a country, where beſides all thoſe advantages, they are protected both in their civil and religious rights? We are loſt in contemplation, and ready, to declare, that no one who is unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with freedom, and that liberality of mind which naturally accompanies it, can conceive or underſtand ſo excellent a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution!</p>
            <p>ANOTHER very important matter for the conſideration of the good people of this State is, that were the mode of taxation, here propoſed, to take place, the value of land throughout the whole, would certainly increaſe, and be enhanced by the free enjoyment of it, without burthen or load on the cultivator; whilſt at the ſame time the tax itſelf would moſt certainly gradually diminiſh, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of houſes that might be erected and raiſed by the new comers, as well as the former poſſeſſors; whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny, being chiefly brought up in the ſame line and manner of life, would require of courſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>arate habitations as they grew up: far from repining at ſuch <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> tax, the farmer will on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018436_0018_0FA76AE8C60E2BC0"/>rejoice in the conſideration that if his dwelling pays ſo much a year towards the ſupport of a juſt and mild government, that very houſe is his caſtle, the ſacred aſylum wherein reſides his family, unexpoſed to the prying eye of an Exciſeman, and freed from all obtruſion inconſiſtent with civil liberty; that the produce of his fields may circulate free from all impoſts until ſhipped for foreign markets, and that his lands, vaſt and fertile as they may be, will owe nothing to any Potentate, King, or Lord on earth, ſave only gratitude to the Lord God of all lands.</p>
            <p>IT is well known by thoſe who have travelled in Europe, that it is not ſo much the real burthen of the tax which oppreſſes, as the mode of collecting it, the amazing expence attending the collection, and the particular objects on which taxes are laid: theſe are the great evils which kill young induſtry, bring on deſpair and diſcouragement, open wide the pernicious door of contraband, which leads to an infinity of falſe oaths and frauds an evil which finally ruins the morals of the people.</p>
            <p>ON the contrary, this ſimple tax leaving every effort of the human genius uncontrouled and free, (an object of the utmoſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this young country) damping no ſchemes whatever, either rural or commercial, but offering to man's induſtry an unreſtrained career, could be truly ſaid to operate as no taxes ever operated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that it would abundantly enable government to act with becoming dignity, without exhauſting any of the vital juices of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, impeding any branch of commerce, or diſcouraging any advantageous ſcheme whatever.</p>
            <p>IN the City, the inhabitants whether Merchants or Mechanics <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, no matter what goods I import, what channel of trade
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018436_0019_0FA76AE98DA539A0"/>I purſue; no matter what is my craft, or the induſtry of my hands, I may trade on and work, find out new openings in commerce, invent new powers in mechaniſm; Government like an indulgent parent, will not lay a burthen on this or that article, this or that branch of induſtry; it will not eſtabliſh monopolies which enrich ſome, whilſt they condemn others to dearth and penury: my hands, my genius, my faculties, my experience, all, all is free.</p>
            <p>WHILST ploughing his furrow, the honeſt huſbandman will ſay, praiſe and long duration to that government which marks my dwelling place only, for a juſt, equal, and unavoidable tax, and leaves at the ſame time my lands, my meadows, my cattle, my crops, unincumbered and free: ought not I to purchaſe by ſome conſideration the undiſturbed ſweet repoſe which this very houſe affords me and mine! It has been the place of my nativity, the ſubſtantial and neat ſhelter which my father erected againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities of winter, and the ſcorching heats of the ſummer; it is the roof under which dwells all that is dear to me; it is that which gives me a rank amongſt men, and makes me to be called an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of ſuch a diſtrict: bleſſed be that mode of taxation, which inſures us a new branch of civil happineſs! Since it produces the neceſſary ſupplies; ſince it is either leſſened or raiſed by the ſingle ſtroke of a pen; ſince every citizen pays but in a due proportion to what he poſſeſſes; ſince no part of it goes to feed rich and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling Financiers, and a numerous train of Officers, who in ſo many parts of the world conſume a quarter part of the taxes raiſed, and fatten with impunity on the very blood of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:018436_0020_0FA76AEA45E15348"/>
IF then the Merchant, the Mechanic, the Artificer, the Farmer find in this mode of taxation nothing which can require any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary exertions of induſtry to pay the ſum demanded, there will be no dread or apprehenſion of the hour of aſſeſsment, nor in that of the collection.</p>
            <p>AND ſince the different claſſes in which the citizens of this State may be divided, can equally partake of the obvious advantages here propoſed, reſulting from this new mode of taxation, as well from the ſimplicity of its execution, as the preciſion of its diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let not the novelty of the ſcheme create prejudice or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its being adopted; for although ſuch be the unhappy effects of the firſt appearance of things altogether new and ſtriking, yet the many and great good conſequences ariſing, it is to be hoped, will baniſh from the mind every pre-conceived opinion on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and procure the attentively reading as well as maturely weighing ſo important a matter before the good people of this State gives it a negative: let not the plan be diſregarded and looked on as chimerical, or romantic, before their minds have given it that due ſhare of attention and ſerious conſideration, which ſo intereſting a ſubject requires: let it be ſaid for the firſt time, and perhaps the only inſtance in the world, that in this State of New-York, we have LANDS WITHOUT TAXES, AND CITIES WITHOUT CUSTOM-HOUSES.</p>
            <p>WHAT a train of complicated and perhaps envious thoughts will not this ſhort phraſe raiſe, not only in the minds of our neighbours but even in that of the Europeans who are attentively attending to our new polity: this is the important moment, when our Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators, the new Fathers of this new State, muſt in all the extent
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018436_0021_0FA76AEE2AE9CB48"/>of their underſtandings, in the multiplicity of ideas already known, ſearch for the ſimpleſt and leaſt burthenſome manner of taxing <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s.</p>
            <p>LET then the City Merchant, the Mechanic, and the honeſt Huſbandman, ſeriouſly revolve in his mind the different obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions herein contained: if the pomp of eloquence and the beauties of ſtile be baniſhed from this ſmall pamphlet, it is becauſe the few ſimple truths on which the ſcheme is built, and here propoſed for the inſpection of the Public, ſhould, in being leſs adorned, become more ſtriking and convincing.</p>
            <p>SHOULD this plan ſucceed or give birth to any other as ſimple and as eaſy to be executed for the public good, the Writer will have reaſon to bleſs the hour which brought firſt the idea to his mind, and gave him an opportunity to ſhew his good will towards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing <hi>his poor mite</hi> to the general welfare and happineſs of a State, wherein he has the honour to be</p>
