            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ABove you have a Copy of mine, <hi>February</hi> 21ſt per <hi>Skinner.</hi> I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly glad, that I can ſend you ſo ſoon, the Anſwer of the Board, as the Directors of this <hi>Combination,</hi> or <hi>Bubble,</hi> call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to that Letter.</p>
            <p>I imagine, that when you have peruſed what they have printed in our News-Papers, and in their incloſed Anſwer, you may be apt to think, that without any Interpoſition of the Government, this <hi>Bubble</hi> would have died a natural Death: <hi>The Managers appearing too weak, and too little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the World, to carry on an Affair, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under ſo many Difficulties and Diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:004800_0002_100DF188260FCA28"/>
The Subſtance of the following Lines, is in it ſelf obvious to a Gentleman of your Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but for the Benefit of the blinded and deluded Multitude, I am obliged to be plain and particular.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more popular than a <hi>pretended Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm,</hi> to cover the moſt <hi>iniquitous Schemes.</hi> It grieves good People to find ſome who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, leſs at Heart than the publick Good of the Province, to ſet up for Patriots, by hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Harangues to the Multitude upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; ſuch who have formerly been very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious: Witneſs, the <hi>miſchievous</hi> and <hi>chargeable Differences,</hi> between Governour <hi>Shute,</hi> and our Aſſemblies; Governour <hi>Shute's Six Complaints</hi> againſt the Province, and a conſequential <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planatory curtailing Charter:</hi> Such who at preſent, as if reſolute, <hi>in provinciae perniciem</hi> are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the good People, (<hi>naturally and ever Loyal</hi> but when debauch'd by evil-minded Men) to run counter to <hi>Reſolves of Parliament,</hi> to <hi>Reports of the proper Boards,</hi> to <hi>King's Inſtructions,</hi> and to <hi>repeated Proclamations of our Provincial Government:</hi> Such, who in expectation of a little ill acquired Self-Intereſt, are willing to forfeit the Remains of our Charter, and all other Priviledges; <hi>having little or nothing to loſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can it be imagined, by any impartial ſober thinking Man, if <hi>ſuch Schemes</hi> were for the general Good of the Country, that Gentlemen whoſe larges Intereſts here oblige them to ſtudy &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Good of the Country, ſhould ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly oppoſe it: This in not a Difference from Humour, Caprice, or blind civil or eccleſiaſtick party Rage: It is Self Preſervation; <hi>that We may not be defrauded of our Properties, by a Combination or Band of—.</hi> In ſhort, the Struggle is generally
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004800_0003_100DF189B3170A60"/>
between the <hi>Creditor</hi> and <hi>Debtor</hi> part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. The <hi>Debtors</hi> ſay, in effect, We have had a Meeting, and are combined and reſolved, to pay only ſo much in the Pound, at a long For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, by a bare-faced, fraudulent Contrivance; The Creditors to prevent this, are laudably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving to diſſolve this Combination.</p>
            <p>How undutifully, and unnaturally, do they expoſe this Country, by ſtraining a Point in their own Favour. Thus, the <hi>lower Houſe</hi> of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly acted not againſt it, therefore their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of it is neceſſarily implied, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>Combination</hi> is juſt and legal; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the moſt explicit Reſolves and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and Proclamations here againſt it. They give a long and particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of a Tranſaction, which the real Well-wiſhers to the Province wiſh buried in Oblivion. The Members of all Bodies Politick, as well as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, are ſubject to flight Indiſpoſitions, without any Danger to the Conſtitution. It is true, ſay they, the <hi>Governor and Council</hi> deemed the Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation irregular and iſſued their Proclamations againſt the Currency of their ſham Money; but ſome thought otherwiſe, and took it: In ſhort, they ſeem to intimate, that ſince they have put their Hands to the Plough, &amp;c—. They give out that the <hi>Governor and Council are no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> properly ſo called; are we in a State of Nature, or Anarchy, when the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly is not ſitting?</p>
            <p>I beg Leave to produce ſome <hi>authentick Inſtances of our Provincial Governments Vigilancy,</hi> in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of the greateſt Conſequence: The <hi>late Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly</hi> in their Seſſions <hi>March</hi> laſt, reſolved, <q>That theſe Notes are upon ſo <hi>ſlender a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that the Circulation of them, among the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004800_0004_100DF18B41AC5458"/>
People of this Province, may have a great Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to <hi>depreciate</hi> the Bills of Credit already circulating, and conſequently to <hi>endamage</hi> his Majeſty's good Subjects as to their <hi>Properties.</hi>
               </q>—The <hi>Governor and Council,</hi> by a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 17th <hi>July</hi> laſt, <q>Tending to <hi>defraud</hi> Men of their Subſtance, and to <hi>diſturb</hi> the Peace and good Order of the People, and to give great <hi>Interruption,</hi> and bring much <hi>Confuſion</hi> into their Buſineſs.</q>—The Governor in his Speech to our Aſſembly, 22d <hi>November</hi> laſt, <q>This Scheme appears, to the Governor and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, <hi>big with ſo many Miſchiefs</hi> to the People—to take Notes for Money, which have <hi>no honeſt or ſolid Foundation</hi>—and in the End <hi>ruinous to the Poſſeſſors.</hi>
               </q>—Mr. <hi>Belcher</hi> in his late Speech to the Aſſembly of his other Government, <hi>New Hampſhire, </hi> 
               <q>A <hi>Combination</hi> of Perſons to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a large Quantity of STAMPT PAPER, (an Expreſſion of good Propriety) to paſs in Lieu of Money, upon a <hi>baſe and fraudulent Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

            <p>People may, by the by, obſerve, that the <hi>Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilities,</hi> as they call them, of our Letter, are only the ſame <hi>Epithets</hi> uſed by the Government here, and by the Boards at Home. The Board of Trade by way of Complaint, ſay, "That the <hi>Governor</hi> had ſent a Meſſage to the Houſe of <hi>Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> and they refuſed to pay any Regard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to—The <hi>Illegality</hi> of the Scheme, and the great <hi>Confuſion</hi> that muſt attend it—a <hi>pernicious</hi> Scheme of <hi>dangerous</hi> Tendency, and muſt create great <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption</hi> and <hi>Confuſion</hi> in Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Truth</hi> is the only <hi>Author</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> which we own. Becauſe the Peice ſent you was wrote in an <hi>epiſtolary Manner,</hi> they aſcribe to one Perſon, <hi>the joint Sentiments</hi> of many of the moſt conſiderable
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004800_0005_100DF18D5F45EBA0"/>
Gentlemen, Merchants, and others, of this Province, <hi>ſtudious of its Welfare;</hi> and do in a moſt unmannerly, vulgar, mean and falſe Way calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate a Gentleman of his Majeſty's Council here: Their Expreſſions are too groſs to bear a Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</p>
            <p>I.<hi>Theſe Directors, in their Anſwer, cannot help ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Bubble.</hi> The proper Attributes or Marks of a Bubble, are to be found in every Page.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In the Title Page, they call it <hi>the Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Undertaking.</hi> They have ſet up no Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory of any Kind, they have not ſo much as projected any, except the <hi>manufacturing of baſe Bills,</hi> or Money, from Plates, Paper and Ink. In all Nations, and their Provinces, there are three Branches of Buſineſs, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Trade,</hi> the moſt profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; <hi>Manufactures;</hi> and <hi>Produce;</hi> the leaſt lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crative, but the moſt neceſſary.</p>
            <p>They firſt ſet out upon the Footing of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce or Land, and called themſelves the <hi>Land Bank.</hi> Afterwards upon more mature Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they called it the <hi>Manufactory Undertaking,</hi> (the Words of the Title Page) as being a better <hi>bubbling</hi> Name: And lately having ſent ſome ſmall Ventures, BILKT <hi>from the Graziers, and Hog Drivers,</hi> to Sea, upon the Partners Riſque. The Directors may now call themſelves, a <hi>Board of Trade and Navigation:</hi> Or rather the <hi>Combination</hi> may aſſume this Name, <hi>The Grand Company of Maſſachuſetts Bay in New England for Land, for Manufacture, and for Trade and Navigation,</hi> with a Power of ſetting &amp; fixing the Rate of Intereſt; and letting Money at ſaid Intereſt.</p>
            <p>This is a ſhort Hiſtory of the <hi>Farce,</hi> which of it ſelf is <hi>ridiculous and contemptible;</hi> but their
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004800_0006_100DF18F45A8BB00"/>
Numbers require the <hi>Circumſpection</hi> of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to prevent Mutiny, Sedition and Riots.</p>
            <p>If we could ſuppoſe their Bills to obtain a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, the Conſequence would be ruinous.</p>
            <p>Their Bills are founded, as they ſay, upon the beſt Security, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Land Security: But by their Articles, this Security <hi>leſſens five per Cent. per Ann.</hi> and after 20 Years entirely vaniſhes; the 600,000 in Bills being ſtill current, (for by their fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, tho' weakly contrived Scheme, their Bills are never to be cancelled) hath <hi>loſt its Land Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and is no more a Land Bank, but a <hi>Bank of inſolvent Directors:</hi> that is, a Bankruptcy enſues, and the poor Poſſeſſors of their Bills will be the inextricable Sufferers; for the Rich, and Men of Experience in Buſineſs, are in no Danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cheated, where the Fraud is ſo obvious.</p>
            <p>The 8 <hi>per Cent. per Ann.</hi> including the 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> at Intereſt, if it could be ſuppoſed, paid in punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually by the Subſcribers; the <hi>Directors</hi> in the Space of 12 or 13 Years, would have the whole or full <hi>Value</hi> of the 600,000 <hi>l.</hi> in their own Hands, to be improved, if they pleaſe, <hi>for their own ſole Benefit;</hi> becauſe in the Nature of the Scheme no Part of it is ever to be cancelled, but to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in Trade, or by Bonds at Intereſt.</p>
            <p>They frankly acknowledge their <hi>Incapacity, as to Trade,</hi> and that Banks, legally conſtituted, ought not to Trade; but they being under no legal Reſtrictions, the <hi>Directors</hi> think that by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving the Partnerſhip in Trade, they will have a greater Latitude of Ch—</p>
            <p>N. B. <hi>Theſe initial Letters are no deſigned Pun, upon the Name of One of the Directors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2dly, All Notes, publick or private, which are not a ready-money Tender in Law, ought to be, and are, according to the Cuſtom of Merchants
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004800_0007_100DF192381D4BA0"/>
and Tradeſmen, received in pay, at a Diſcount, according to the Diſtance of Payment, or effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Demand in Law. Theſe Notes are for 20 Years, therefore they are ſo many Years Intereſt at 6 <hi>per Cent. worſe than ready Money;</hi> but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, exceeding the Principal, theſe Land Bank Notes or Bills are in ready Money worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, with an additional <hi>Cheat.</hi> The <hi>Infatuation</hi> of receiving, and paying away ſuch Notes, may obtain among the Deluded for a ſhort time; but in the Nature of Things cannot ſubſiſt long: And the <hi>Poſſeſſors will ſuffer the entire Loſs,</hi> except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what may be recovered from the ſmall Eſtates of the Signers: Then the Projectors and Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who at this Time excite the Populace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Well-wiſhers and beſt Friends, will themſelves become the Objects of the <hi>popular Rage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Signers are not capable to make good to the Poſſeſſors but a very ſmall Part of the Value. As to the main pretended Security of <hi>Covenants and </hi> JUGGLES <hi>among the Partnerſhip and Directors,</hi> they may indulge or releaſe one another at Pleaſure: Actions of Covenant broken, can only be among the GANG, without Regard to the Poſſeſſor. There is nothing, in the Face of the Bill, aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to the Poſſeſſor, but <hi>Goods of an arbitrary Aſſortment and Price; not effectually demandable till after Twenty Years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have a freſh and publickly well vouched Inſtance in Mr. <hi>Samuel Allen of Mancheſter, a Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, refuſing to accept in Payment their own Bank Bills.</hi> The Directors, by a publick Advertiſement, do not deny the Fact; but with a Quibble or Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion do affirm, That a few of the Partners refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, is not properly the Partnerſhip refuſing it. Every Individual of them being under Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004800_0008_100DF1945038C948"/>
to receive it, and their not publiſhing at the ſame time their Intention of ſuing him for <hi>Covenant broken,</hi> is a notorious Inſtance of their indulging or releaſing one another at Pleaſure. In theſe Times of a Scarcity of <hi>Medium,</hi> good Money is readily embraced by every Body. Where a Perſon by Quibbles refuſes Money, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I chuſe not to receive it now, but at another Time; I will not receive it by the Hands of ſuch a one, but by the Hands of ſuch a one; tho' both equally authentick: I will not receive it in ſuch a Manner, but after ſome other Manner, &amp;c. Such Triflings in the common Way of Dealing would neceſſarily infer, that the Money, or this Sort of Pay, was not agreeable or good. Not only <hi>private Perſons</hi> of the Partnerſhip, but their <hi>Board of Directors refuſe their own Bills.</hi> The moſt eſſential Clauſe in the Face of their Bills, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them a current Credit is, That <hi>they ſhall be received for any Stock in their Treaſury.</hi> There are to be found there at preſent, a few Things EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEIGLED from ſome weak, unthinking Perſons. When People bring their own Bank Bills to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe any of theſe Commodities, they <hi>refuſe theſe Bills by ſundry flat, bare-faced Evaſions:</hi> Such as, We are not at Leiſure, We have no ſuch Goods. If Proviſions, for Inſtance, are called for, their Anſwer is, that they are to be ſhip'd off, but not to be ſold here: Deal Boards being demanded, they ſay, that they are to be ſold for Rum, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes, Sugar, &amp;c. as having Occaſion for ſuch Things; but not for Land Bank Money, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Occaſion for any Money at preſent, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Partners to expect Dividends of 3 per Cent. per Aun. on the Principal;</hi> whereas the Charge of Management will ſink 2 per Cent. of this, the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004800_0009_100DF195ECDFBB60"/>
Directors giving 1 <hi>per Cent</hi> more than the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Price, for Produce and Manufactures, and ſelling 1 <hi>per Cent</hi> under the Market Price, is in all 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> that is, inſtead of a Dividend there muſt be a Call or <hi>Loſs of one per Cent amongſt the Partners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Having chalkt out a <hi>Phantom,</hi> or built a Caſtle in the Air, they endeavour to perſwade the Credulous, that the Scheme is real, good, and in every Reſpect will finiſhed. <hi>The firſt Year there will be a vaſt Stock of 46,000 <hi>l,</hi> in their Treaſury.</hi> If they expected their Bubble to live longer than one Year, they ſhould have carried ſo groſs a Deception further forward. Of the Principal 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> paid in is 30,000 <hi>l.</hi> one Years Intereſt of 600,000 <hi>l.</hi> at 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> is 18,000 <hi>l.</hi> in all 48,000 <hi>l</hi> out of this 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> on the Principal of 600,000 <hi>l.</hi> is sunk, as above, remains 24,000 <hi>l.</hi> from this deduct Deficiencies of a generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent Partnerſhip ( if they pay their former Debts) there will remain a very ſmall Stock to circulate a large Sum of 600,000 <hi>l.</hi> a ſlender Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for ſo large a Structure; but Caſtles in the Air require no Foundation.</p>
            <p>We ſhall encreaſe our Produce (this would have been Banter from any but themſelves) in a ſhort Time, ſo as to Ballance all Accompts with <hi>Europe,</hi> conſequently there will be no demand for Silver; Silver, that irreconcilable Enemy to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Money and Bubbles. When poor People can have preſent Money (tho' only nominal) on ſo eaſy Terms, and not effectually payable until after 20 Years, can it be ſuppoſed that they will be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduous in Labour to increaſe our Produce and Manufacture? No, they will become <hi>Idlers</hi> and <hi>Extravagant,</hi> that is, they will increaſe our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, (it is the Conſumers finally, not the Venders
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004800_0010_100DF1984C7A1398"/>
or Merchants who increaſe our Impoſts; and in fact, <hi>where ſumptuary Laws</hi> take Place, they are <hi>levelled againſt the Conſumers or Wearers)</hi> and entail their Debts upon Poſterity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>In their Treaſury will be Choice of Variety of Goods; therefore their Bills are better than Caſh Notes or Bonds, which are reſtricted to one Specie,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz</abbr> Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. This is an Argument ſcarce to be uſed with a Fool or a Child; it is in favour of Shop Notes, which Tradeſmen &amp; Artificers well know to their Sorrow to be 25 to 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> worſe than Caſh; and at preſent their Bills ſuffer a greater Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count than do Shop Notes. The <hi>Nova Scotia Wheat,</hi> the beginning of <hi>January</hi> laſt; and the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors Logwood,</hi> the beginning of this current <hi>March,</hi> bought and ſold by the Directors, at a <hi>great Diſcount upon their Land Bank Bills,</hi> is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>They value themſelves upon their Bills being a Currency which will not be hoarded up.</hi> This Argument holds alſo good in the Caſe of Counterfeits and refuſe Bills; if a worſe or leſs valuable Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency could be contrived, they alſo would be hoarded; but in this Reſpect they are ſafe. Where there are ſeveral concomitant Currencies, that which is generally commercial, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Silver, will be ſhipt off; and of the local, or provincial Currencies, the moſt valuable will be hoarded up; and the baſer only, if in ſufficient Quantities, will be SHUFFLED from Hand to Hand, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Currency. Thus if this bubbling Money ſhould take place, publick Bills will be hoarded,</p>
            <p n="7">7. In General they ſay, <hi>It has many good Effects of a Currency, and particularly mention, only its paying off ſmall Debts, in an Inſtance of ten Actions in all to the Value of 20 l prevented thereby.</hi> No Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ventures to take it for large Debts, a few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004800_0011_100DF19AA33EDB90"/>
of Colluſion excepted. A parallel Caſe happened in the Province of <hi>Main,</hi> about two Years ſince, ſome Thouſands of Pounds, in <hi>Webb's Counterfeit</hi> five Pound <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Bills, were paid away and received for a conſiderable Time, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they were generally known to be Counterfeits.</p>
            <p>I cannot avoid, by the by, mentioning their <hi>Indiſcretion in bringing the late</hi> New-Hampſhire <hi>Paper Money Bubble upon the Stage,</hi> which tho upon a better Footing, died a natural Death in its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; the Signers and Undertakers refuſing to take it in Payments. Our preſent Bubble lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes in the ſame Malady, ſome of the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and others of the Partnerſhip, refuſing it, as may be ſeen in our News Papers.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To prevent the apprehended Confuſions, they modeſtly propoſe, <hi>that Authority ſhould give this Undertaking a Sanction.</hi> An <hi>Act of Indemnity</hi> is more than they may expect. This would be giving a Sanction to Confuſion, to prevent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; to eſtabliſh Robbery to prevent the Crime of Robbery; to eſtabliſh Iniquity by Law, for the Benefit of a few evil-minded Men, to the great Damage of this Country, and of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Merchants trading to <hi>New England,</hi> and to entail Miſery upon our Poſterity.</p>
            <p>The moſt odious and obnoxious Qualification of a Combination, is the <hi>Formidableneſs of their Number:</hi> Inſtead of uſing any Policy to palliate their Numbers, they boldly aſſert, that they are ten times more than we imagine, with a vaſt Number of Military Officers, and Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. The <hi>Directors,</hi> perhaps little acquainted with the Propriety of Words, and Decency of Things, <hi>aſſume the Stile of the King in Council, and other Boards in Great Britain,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> At a Board, &amp;c. Preſent, <hi>R. A. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:004800_0012_100DEE369E4B9D80"/>
II. <hi>Their ſpecifick Anſwers to ſundry Particulars in our Letter, are ſilly, weak Quibbles, Subterfuges Evaſions, or deſigned</hi> (I ſhall not uſe the groſs vulgar Word Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities) <hi>Miſtakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſay, 1ſt, <hi>Our various Paper Currencies occaſion no more Confuſion here, than Variety of Coins do in</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; not conſidering, that the various expreſſed Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues in the Faces of the Bills, differ by various fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Diſcounts, from their actual current Values. As to the <hi>new Projections of private Currencies,</hi> if every Perſon were to be in a State of Nature as to Currencies, to receive and pay away at what Rate he pleaſes, and ſhould have no Reaſon to complain, becauſe it is his own free Act; what inexpreſſible Confuſion would this make in a Community.</p>
            <p>If our <hi>Townſhips</hi> are ſuch independent lawleſs Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to vote <hi>Land-Bank Bubbles,</hi> Tobacco-Papers, or any Thing they pleaſe for <hi>Town-Rates;</hi> an Act of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly would be very ſeaſonable for their better Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>2dly, <hi>It was not the Merchants, but the Officers and Servants of the Government, who gave the publick Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Notes a Currency.</hi> It was the Merchants, Tradeſmen, and Ar<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>cers, who received them from the Servants of the Government, made them current. The Partners in this Combination, receiving their Quotas of Land-Bank Bills from the Directors, is not giving them a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, (for thus there would be no Doubt of their Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency) It is the People who receive them from the Partners that give them a Currency.</p>
            <p>3dly, <hi>Too great a Proportion of our Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men going to Sea, is the Reaſon why our Country is ſo poor.</hi> In <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> many going to Sea, is the Reaſon of theſe Countries being ſo rich: Hands in Trade earn more than by common Labour. It is one of their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes,</hi> That too many Hands are employed at Sea: Trade in all Countries is more profitable than Produce: Moreover, a Nurſery of Seamen is what the Britiſh Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are obliged to have always at Heart.</p>
            <p>4thly, <hi>Regiments of veteran Officers reſigning rather than obey the Governour's Proclamations, is a publick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity.</hi> Where Officers, civil or military, deny the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004800_0013_100DF19ED1164C50"/>
of their Conſtituents, their Superiors in diſcharge of their Duty, and Truſt, cannot avoid ſuſpending or diſmiſſing of them. I ſhall not play the Pedant, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, That <hi>Veteran</hi> is applicable to Troops, not to Officers; the proper Expreſſion is, old experienced Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, which is never applied to militia Officers. Their whole Piece is full of Improprieties in Diction.</p>
            <p>The Managers ſpiriting the People to Mutiny, Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Riots; they call ſome Strokes on the Merchant, by Abuſe extorted.</p>
            <p>5thly, <hi>In anſwer to the Vaſtneſs of the unlimited Sum of their Bills,</hi> They ſay, All Stateſmen agree, That Money can never be too plenty, while it does not rent under Six per Cent. per Annum; but we have made a Rule, not to let it under Six per Cent. therefore we can never make too much of it. This from a viſionary Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamite would deſerve Compaſſion, but from a BARE-FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CED CHEAT, the higheſt Indignation: As if they could procure an Act of Aſſembly, that no Money ſhall be let at Intereſt but by this Combination, and with the above imaginary engroſſing of Produce, Manufactures, Trade and Navigation; would perſwade the Populace, That they have alſo engroſſed the Affair of letting Money at Intereſt.</p>
            <p>6thly, <hi>The large Quantity of their Land-Bank Bills cannot depreciate our Province Bills, becauſe after one Year there will be none of theſe exiſtant.</hi> This is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable <hi>Evaſion</hi> in ſome of the Directors, who muſt know that there are conſiderably more than 100,000<hi>l.</hi> of Province Bills extant, not aſſeſſed in the Emiſſion Acts, and may, as formerly be poſtponed at Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>They (tho' inconſiſtently with themſelves) well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in another Place, That the large and frequent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of Paper Money, ſick their own Credit, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Neceſſity of making more, by continued increaſing Quantities to make good the continued depreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Qualities of the ſame: And thus by a continued Progreſſion, render the Quantity vaſtly great, and the Quality or Value contemptibly ſmall; This is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable Argument againſt increaſing Paper Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:004800_0014_100DF1A1128AB440"/>
7thly, The Objection of their emitting any enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Quantity of theſe Bills, and of more MONEY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAKING Companies ſetting up, ſo as to render them too plenty, and conſequently a Drug, or too cheap; they ſay that a Law may be made to prevent this Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This Anſwer implies, a Condemnation from their own Mouths, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That until ſuch a Law is made, their Combination is irregular and miſchievous.</p>
            <p>8thly, <hi>The wicked corrupt Principle alledged, muſt be in the Projectors,</hi> J. C. <hi>and Others, but not in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Managers, the Directors, the Conſtitution being ſetled before their Management commenced.</hi> A bad Memory is of bad Implication: In another Place they tell us, It is not the ſame Scheme with the firſt projected, which was found Fault with by the former General Aſſembly; but a new Model contrived by the preſent Directors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any general Meeting.</p>
            <p>9thly, <hi>The Managers had not given proper Security for their good Management and Quota of Bills, becauſe very buſy: They cannot be more particular in an Anſwer to the alledged Irregularities and other Difficulties in their Scheme, becauſe their Leiſure does not permit.</hi> This feigned Hurry of Mind, is no good Symptom in their Favour. <hi>It is a moſt flagrant,</hi> ABANDON'D <hi>Impoſition,</hi> to tell the World, that Securities for moſt of the Quotas of the Directors, are to be found upon Record, 21ſt <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> laſt, the Date of our Letter. In the County of <hi>Suffolk</hi> are Five of the Nine Directors: Upon Enquiry, None of their Mortgages were then upon P<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ord; but being alarm'd, <hi>Samuel Watts</hi> enters his Mortgages 23d <hi>February, Peter Chardon</hi> 5th of <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Adams</hi> 7th of <hi>March;</hi> the others, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Judge <hi>Auchmuty's</hi> (CHAIRMAN) and <hi>William Stoddard's</hi> not yet entered.</p>
            <p>10thly, <hi>The Directors are not in Pepetuity, becauſe removable for Miſdemeanor: And when thus turned out, they have no Part in the Negative; therefore the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have no Negative in Reſolves of a general Meeting.</hi> Such ſilly Quibbles are an Argument againſt the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking with Men of Senſe. A Patentee in Office, tho' liable to be turned out for Miſdemeanour, is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding called a Patentee for Life. Can the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of a Province be ſaid to have no Negative in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004800_0015_100DF1A29E5526E8"/>
their General Aſſemblies, becauſe he may be ſuperſed or diſmiſs'd? Such childiſh Quibbles are unbecoming a BOARD.</p>
            <p>11thly, <hi>That the Bills bear no Intereſt to the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors is notoriouſly falſe; becauſe the Mortgagers pay to the Partnerſhip,</hi> that is, to themſelves, 3 <hi>per Cent. per Ann.</hi> This is trifling to an unpardonable Degree. The Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of the Bills have no Benefit from this: The Partnerſhip itſelf, notwithſtanding of this 3 per Cent, run yearly One per Cent. in Debt, as is before demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>12thly, <hi>The Partners have received a valuable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration</hi> for their Mortgages, becauſe the Signers, as I ſaid, may perhaps be able to pay Two Shillings in the Pound, which they, in their blundering Manner, call <hi>Two per Cent;</hi> they mean, that in an Acquittance, theſe Words, Five Shillings in full of all Accounts, is as good as Five hundred Pounds, or Five thouſand Pounds, in Ballance of all Accompts: ſuch ſilly Evaſions require no ſerious Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Of a Piece with this is their Aſſertion, That the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal South-Sea Allowance of one twelfth of one per Cent. of their principal Stock, is proportionably four Times as much as two per Cent. per Annum of the Principal of this Bubble. By adducing ſuch Blunders, they ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expoſe themſelves, without any further Notice of ours.</p>
            <p>13thly, <hi>As for the Oppulency of the Signers of the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Money Notes, and of the Signers of the Land-Bank Notes;</hi> they dare venture the Iſſue of the Caſe upon it. A particular Anſwer would give room to expoſe the mean Circumſtances of moſt of the Signers or Directors; but this we chuſe to avoid.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with this Obſervation, concerning the Cauſe of Paper-Money, publick, or private, depreciating from Time to Time. It is a received, but artful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, inſtill'd by deſigning Men, into the Minds of the Vulgar; That Merchants, and money'd Men, giving an advanced Price for Silver is the Occaſion of it: If we reflect ſeriouſly, Can it be ſuppoſed, that theſe Men in general would thus depreciate their own outſtanding Book-Debts and Bonds, which at all Times are of vaſtly greater Sums than the Silver they may purchaſe from Time to Time: This would alſo riſe the Price of all other Returns upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:004800_0016_100DF1A42ABE1BB0"/>
               <hi>Merchants Notes</hi> equal to Silver, at a determined Value, paid away, received, or bonded, they call <hi>Uſury.</hi> I am no Friend to private Currencies of any Kind; but upon this Occaſion, muſt remind the Land-Bank A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors, that to ſerve their Cauſe, they allow of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies in themſelves, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> not long ſince they told us, that ſeeing Specialties, are not forbid in the Law; private People muſt blame themſelves, Orphans muſt blame their Guardians, and Widows their Adviſers, if they loſe by Contracts made in depreciating Bills.</p>
            <p>Writing upon this Subject, <hi>Sir,</hi> by ſetting the Affair in a clear Light, may be of ſome Uſe to the proper Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at Home; I wiſh it could have the ſame good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the deluded Multitude in this Province who receive it for no other Reaſon, but that they can paſs it again. People of clear Eſtates and who value themſelves upon the Character of honeſt Men, deſpiſe and abhor it as a barefaced popular Fraud. Inſolvent Debtors catch hold of any Thing for a preſent Reprieve. Some Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, void of Honeſty readily embrace Bubbles to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coy and make a Prey of the weak unthinking Multitude, ſuch will no more hearken to Reaſon than an incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thief will to the eighth Commandment.</p>
