            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Moreover, <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> is deſcrib'd in his own primitive <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>external Beauty</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> being vindicated from all thoſe foul Calumnies and Reproaches caſt upon him in this and former Ages; with his ſad Lamentation, in reſpect of the prevailing Power of <hi>Vice, Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Papiſtry,</hi> and other Enemies at home and abroad; alſo the Uſefulneſs of <hi>Conſideration,</hi> and of the Creatures utmoſt <hi>Improvement</hi> of the Means, in order to Union with <hi>CHRIST</hi> and <hi>True Converſion,</hi> is clearly opened; together with the Cauſe and diſmal Conſequences of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy.</hi>

            <p>In this Treatiſe you may ſee the little Cauſe the Godly have to mourn in the worſt of Times, or the Ungodly to rejoice in the beſt Times, or in what Times ſoever they live. I hope none will be offended becauſe <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> is here preſented in an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory,</hi> ſince the holy Scriptures abound with them, and ſo fully juſtify our Eſſay herein; but ſince it has been abroad for near twenty Years, and hath found ſuch kind Acceptance amongſt People of all Perſwaſions, I need not ſay any thing farther as to that, yet know, the Times being quite changed to what they were when firſt it was publiſhed; the <hi>Ninth Edition</hi> I have corrected, and made great <hi>Additions</hi> unto it, ſo that it is much different from the former <hi>Editions.</hi>

                  <hi>Morality</hi> for him; and others out of Ignorance, (to ſay no worſe) rail, and ignominiouſly call and abuſe him by the Names of <hi>Singularity, Stubborneſs, Pride,</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> as if he were not fit to live or have a being in the World, he being render'd a make-bait, a ſeditious and common diſturber of all Kingdoms, Cities Towns, and Villages, whereſoever he comes and is entertained: Yea, ſuch a factious and quarrelſome companion, that he is indeed the only cauſe and ſtirrer up of all thoſe unhappy differences, diviſions, troubles, and miſeries in the World. This being ſo, I conclude nothing is more neceſſary, than to take off that ugly Maſs or Vizard, which his implacable Enemies have put upon him, and clear him of all thoſe foul and unjuſt ſlanders, and curſed reproaches of the Sons of <hi>Belial;</hi> that ſo he may appear in his original, primitive and ſpotleſs innocency, that none may be afraid of him, or be unwilling to entertain him, nor aſhamed to own him, and make him their Boſom-Companion.</p>
               <p>Know ye therefore in the firſt place,<note place="margin">Godlineſs deſcribed.</note> that <hi>Godlineſs</hi> conſiſts in the true and right knowledge of divine truths, or fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal principles of the Goſpel; which all Men ought to know and be eſtabliſhed in, that would be ſaved, <hi>Without controverſy great is the myſtery of Godlineſs: God was manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit, ſeen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived up to Glory.</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. Theſe great truths of the Chriſtian Religion are called GODLINESS; many Men conclude 'tis no matter what principles they hold and cleave to, provided they do but live a ſober and honeſt Life, <hi>doing to all Men as they would be done into,</hi> ſuppoſing that the whole of Religion and Godlineſs conſiſts in theſe things; but alas they are greatly miſtaken; Godlineſs is another kind of thing than they imagine; it is impoſſible
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:040363_0004_10163E955D546858"/>to receive or entertain <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> whilſt we ſhut out of Doors the eſſentials of the Chriſtian Religion; and inſtead thereof embrace Superſtition, Error, and Hereſy; there being damning Principles as well a damning Practices, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2, 3.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. That this GOD, out of his great Love and Goodneſs, hath beſtowed upon, and given to his People, one ſure, certain and infallible Rule of Faith and Practice, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> by which they may know, not only, that there is a GOD and Creator, but of the Manner of the Creation of the World, and of all Things in Heaven and Earth, in Six Days: Together of his Deſign, End, and Purpoſe, or Reaſon, or Cauſe whereof he made all Things; and alſo to ſhew them how Sin came into the World, and what Righteouſneſs it is which GOD's holy Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, to their Juſtification or Diſcharge from the Guilt of all Sin, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> By a Redeemer, his own Son, whom he ſent into the World; and that there is no other Rule or Way to know theſe things, ſo as for Men to be ſaved but by Revelation, or the ſacred Records of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures only.</p>

               <p n="4">4. That Juſtification and Pardon of Sin is alone by that full Satisfaction the LORD JESUS CHRIST made to GOD's Juſtice; and that his perfect Obedience (in doing what the Law required, and in his Suffering what we for our Sins deſerved) is imputed as that compleat Righteouſneſs to all that believe in him; which Righteouſneſs is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by Faith alone, thro' the holy Spirit, by which a Sinner is firſt apprehended by Chriſt, before he can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and receive him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That all Men muſt be Renewed, Regenerated, and Sanctified by the holy Spirit, which are, or can be ſaved.</p>

Moreover, the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after <hi>Joſeph</hi> was dead, were, through that Love they bore to him, grievouſly oppreſſed by the mighty King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but it proved his own utter Ruin in the End. <hi>David,</hi> for the Love he bare to him, was for many Years together greatly perſecuted, but afterwards <hi>Godlineſs</hi> raiſed him to great Honour, and made him very rich, and ſet a Crown upon his Head; all along I might ſhew you in ancient Days he was very much hated and perſecuted; nay, and ſome of his true Friends and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, were for his ſake, caſt into a fiery Fumace, and another into a Lion's Den, yet they never loſt any thing by him, nor did they ever repent the Entertainment they gave him.

With many other of like Quality, too tedious here to reckon up; but by mentioning the Names of theſe, you may eaſily diſcern who and what the others are, who, with their Attendants are all implacable Enemies to true Godlineſs, and as much as lies in them, endeavour to hinder his being entertained whereſoever he comes, as you will find in the enſuing Hiſtory of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels. Now the Reaſon why True Godlineſs hath ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Enemies, I had thought to have ſhewed in this Place, but becauſe I will not hinder you from the main Scope and Deſign of this Treatiſe, I ſhall reſerve them for a more convenient Place.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Shewing how <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> having received a Commiſſion to <hi>travel,</hi> and viſit the Children of Men, comes to a certain Town on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Babylon,</hi> where one <hi>Riches</hi> dwelt, and of his uſage and evil Treatment there.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE great and mighty JEHOVAH, the God and Father of true Grace and Godlineſs, out of his great Mercy and infinite Goodneſs to Mankind, graciouſly was pleaſed to ſend them a Saviour; yea, a great and mighty Saviour, or one <hi>able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to God by him,</hi> Heb. 7.25. And to the end, that they might have the Knowledge of this bleſſed Saviour, he hath ſent the Goſpel amongſt them, but in his eternal Wiſdom hath ſo Decreed and Ordained it, that no Man ſhould have any ſaving Benefit by this glorious Saviour, but he who doth Receive, Entertain, and kindly Embrace True Godlineſs whenſoever he is ſent to Viſit them; and to the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they might not miſs of ſo great a Bleſſing which Godlineſs brings along with him: I may ſafely adventure to ſay, according to my preſent Method, and to purſue my Allegorical Diſcourſe; Godlineſs hath received Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the King of Heaven and Earth to Travel, to ſee who would Embrace and Entertain him. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it appears his Commiſſion was very large, he was not limited to the ſmall confines of <hi>Jury,</hi> nor to Travel only in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but to go into all the World, or to Travel into all Nations, Countries and Kingdoms of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:040363_0011_10163ED2B7BAAD88"/>the Earth, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. and to Viſit the Rich and poor, the Old and Young, as well the King on the Throne, as the Beggar on the Dunghill; even all Bond and Free, Male and Female; nor was he ſent to Travel alone, but had a very rich and glorious Retinue always with him; neither did he come to any Man's Houſe empty handed, but brought along with him moſt rich and glorious Preſents of the choiceſt Things of Heaven, the worth of which is infinite, or beyond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. But ſince I perceive he is come to a certain Town, where one <hi>Riches</hi> dwells, and is now at his Door, let us ſee what Entertainment he meets with at this Place.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Godlineſs</hi> knock'd very hard and often before any within would give an Anſwer,<note place="margin">Godlineſs knocks at Riches door.</note> 
                  <hi>Riches</hi> being full of Buſineſs; for either he was telling of his Money, or caſting up his Accompts, to ſee what his Neighbours ow'd him, or elſe conſulting new Projects to encreaſe his Store, for I perceive he is a Perſon never ſatisfied; beſides, the Times being very perilous, his Mind was filled with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing and vexatious Thoughts, how to ſave and keep what he had already gotten; ſo that he had no Leiſure nor Time to liſten to the continual knocking of True Godlineſs at his Door, inſomuch that Godlineſs was forced to ſtay there a long Time, and that which griev'd this high-born Prince moſt of all, was this, <hi>(viz.)</hi> be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that no ſooner than ſome other Gueſts came to his Door, (who were Perſons much inferior, as to Birth and Quality, to him, and indeed not worthy of the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and not having Buſineſs of that great Weight and Moment with him as Godlineſs had) yet he opened his Door immediately to them; but before this renowned Hero and darling of Heaven could get in, <hi>Riches</hi> had ſo many baſe and ill-bred ſervants in his houſe, that they
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:040363_0012_10163EA3549A9CC8"/>clapp'd too the Door, ſo that he could not get ſo much as one Foot in. Now, the Gueſts he ſo readily opened the Door unto, were (as I take them) theſe following, <hi>(viz.) The luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life,</hi> John 2.16. Theſe he took much delight in, and kept Company with continually; ſometimes they had him to the Tavern, ſometimes to the Play-Houſe, and ſometimes to Recreate him at Bowls, Cards, and Dice, with divers other ſenſual Sports and Pleaſures; but at laſt it ſo fell out, that he was taken very ſick, and Godlineſs ſtill waiting at his Door, it happen'd at this Time one was in his Houſe, who forced him to liſten to this earneſt and continual knocking, his Name was Mr. <hi>Fearful;</hi> he is one that <hi>Riches</hi> doth not at all love; but when Sickneſs comes, he is grievouſly troubled with him; and he made him at this Seaſon to cry out, <hi>Who is there? Who is at the Door?</hi>

                  <p>Upon this the whole Houſe was in an Uproar, for he had) as I told you before) divers looſe, ill bread, or rather Hell-bred Servants, all bitter Enemies to True Godlineſs, their Names were <hi>Preſumption, Pride, Unbelief, Ignorance, Malice, Vain-hope, Covetouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:040363_0012_10163EA3549A9CC8"/>up, and a long Time cheriſhed in his Houſe) ſeemed mightily concerned, that the leaſt heed or attention ſhould be given to True Godlineſs; they alſo enquired who was the Cauſe of it; at laſt they underſtood it was Mr. <hi>Fearful,</hi> then they preſently joined together to fall upon <hi>Fearful,</hi> and turn him out of the Houſe. <hi>Preſumption</hi> ſtruck the firſt blow, and ſpoke alſo to this Purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>Truly Sir, I ſeeing him very Sick, thought he might die in his Sins.</p>

                  <p>Thou Fool, what and if he ſhould, did not Jeſus Chriſt die for Sinners? God is merciful, and will forgive Men their Sins at any Time, even at the very laſt Hour, if they do but call upon him. Beſides, <hi>Fearful,</hi> are you mad to give way, much more to force him to open to True Godlineſs; for if once he is let into the Houſe, you will be immediately turned out, and hardly, if ever, have one Meals-Meat more, nor the leaſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>

                  <p>'Twas the Steward of the Houſe, who keeps the Records, or an Account of all that is done, whoſe Name is <hi>Conſcience;</hi> he finding much Guilt lying upon him through his Cruelty, Hard-Heartedneſs and debauched Life, ſtirred me up to do what I have done; nay, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience told him he had been ſuch a vile and graceleſs Wretch, that if he died, he would go immediately to Hell; therefore you cannot blame me for diſquieting of him.</p>

                  <p>Come, ceaſe this Noiſe, all is well enough yet, Godlineſs is not let in, and our Maſter is much better than he was; and tho' Conſcience incline to embrace this our Enemy, yet you will find he will not be regarded e're a little while: Pray let us all agree at preſent, to ſtir up <hi>Riches</hi> eldeſt Son, whoſe Name is <hi>Honour,</hi> the Father's Darling, and the hopes of all the Family, to ſee what he can do, in order to keep our Enemy Godlineſs out.

Beſides all this, you do not think what a deal of Money he will tell you is your Duty to give to Paſtors and Miniſters of the Goſpel, who are his great Inſtruments and Promoters in the World; nay, Sir, he poſitively Affirms, you ought not only to give to them juſt ſo much as will ſupply their Neceſſities, but that 'tis your Duty to give, and their right <hi>jure divino,</hi> to have a plentiful Allowance, ſo that they may be freed from all the perplexing Cares of this Life; and not only ſo, but alſo may put them into a Capacity to provide for their Wives and Children, that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:040363_0015_10163EAEED901000"/>they may not be expoſed to Want and Neceſſities after they themſelves are Dead, and to have ſo much out of your Eſtate, as to be able to give to others alſo, that ſo they may be Examples of Charity, (and indeed I cannot deny but that the Scriptures do ſay they ought to be Men given to Hoſpitality, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.8.) and many of them are Poor, and therefore how they ſhould do this Godlineſs ſays it is impoſſible, unleſs they are capacitated ſo to do by Riches. Moreover, I will tell you more, (now I am about it) this Godlineſs is ſo unhappy, and in truth hath always been, that he hath many great and potent Enemies, ſo that they who receive and entertain him have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to great Troubles and Perſecutions in the World.</p>

                  <p>Gentlemen, you have both great Learning and Experience in the Laws, both divine and humane; I pray be pleaſed to give me a little of your Counſel, my Caſe is this: There is one who calls himſelf <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> at my Door, and preſſes hard for Entertainment, but by means of a Deſcription I have lately had of his Manners and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, I perceive it will be dangerous at this Time for me to receive him, or ſhew him the leaſt kindneſs. But I have a troubleſome Steward in the Houſe, whom I cannot be rid of, who here of late too much adheres to him, and is ready too often to give way to open the Door, ſo that by his means and one Mr. <hi>Fearful,</hi> a timorous Fellow, whom he ſtirs up, I have of late had but very little quiet: Now, what will you Adviſe me to do in this ſad Condition.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>You muſt not give way to him, for I know him well enough, his Name is Conſcience. Sir, if you follow his Dictates, and embrace this Godlineſs, you will be undone, and your Wife and Children ſoon will be brought to a piece of Bread, notwithſtanding your great Eſtate: But alas, he is grown old, and is in his Dotage, and for want of good Eye-ſight errs exceedingly; nay, is ſo erroneous, that you do well to adviſe with us; come, doubt not but we ſhall inform him better. Sir, your great Fault hath been this, (I perceive it clearly) you have read too much of late, why ſhould you concern your ſelf with the Bible? I think it had been well if it had never been tranſlated into our Mother-Tongue, this hath given him opportunity to diſturb your Mind; come, give over
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:040363_0016_10163EB0E43CD330"/>this in the firſt place: The cauſe you know, of a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, muſt be firſt removed, or no effectual Cure can be expected, 'tis enough for you to mind your ſecular Affairs, things of Religion belong to religious Men; and when Conſcience for any Sin gripes you, divert your ſelf amongſt the brave Heroes you uſed to keep Company with, get to the Tavern, or to ſome Play-Houſe; but be ſure at no Time you read any Book beſides your Books of Accompts and Romances, or ſuch like: And for Religion, let me tell you, that natural Religion is ſufficient, and that what this Traveller ſaith, is but myſterious Nonſence, enough to make Men mad. I do not ſay you ſhould not be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious at all, no, God forbid I ſhould give you ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; but there is no need to entertain ſtrict Godlineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you may be ſaved without it, elſe, Lord, what will become of the greateſt part of the World! go to Church and hear Prayers, but beſure forbear to go to ſuch Churches where any bawling Preacher endeavours to reach your Conſcience. Can any Man perſwade me his Soul cannot be ſaved, unleſs he <hi>ſell all he hath, and give it to the poor,</hi> and ſo become a Fool, that he may be wiſe, who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that another's Righteouſneſs can make me Righteous before God.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Riches,</hi> the Counſel which my Brother hath given is very good, beſure you are never led by the dictates of your Steward Conſcience, to expoſe your ſelf to any loſs or reproach for Religion; you hear you may be, nay, ought to be Religious; and what is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but to live an honeſt and ſober Life, to fear God, honour the King, ſay our Prayers, and pay our Debts: But I have juſt now tho't of a way that will do, you having a great Eſtate, pray get another Servant into your Houſe, keep a Chaplain in your Family; this done, you will find all will be well, and you will hear no more
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:040363_0016_10163EB0E43CD330"/>Complaints from within or without, for you will be taken by all your Servants, and others too, for a godly Man; neither believe nor regard what ſuch Bablers ſay, who talk of ſuch Things that lie above all humane Reaſon, as Mr. <hi>Self-love</hi> noted; can <hi>three</hi> be <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>one</hi> be <hi>three?</hi> Or a Woman bear a Son, that never knew a Man? Or can a Man be that God that made the World? Or can his Righteouſneſs be yours? No, no, your own good deeds juſtify you; this Godlineſs is but fooliſhneſs, regard him not.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Riches</speaker>
                  <p>having thanked them for their good Counſel, with a great deal of Joy, retires himſelf, being very well ſatisfied with the Advice Dr. <hi>Self-love</hi> &amp; Sir <hi>Worldly Wiſdom</hi> had given him. And indeed, this is the miſery of moſt Rich Men <hi>(viz)</hi> if they lie under any Conviction of Sin, from that little light Conſcience hath at any time got, then preſently (being ſtirred up thereto by Covetouſneſs;) they conſult with Fleſh and Blood, and then Dr. <hi>Self-love</hi> and Sir <hi>Worldly Wiſdom</hi> are their great Counſellors.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, <hi>Riches</hi> got now a Chaplain, and inſtead of opening to True Godlineſs, he opens to Counterfeit Godlineſs, which was occaſioned thro' Ignorance, and thoſe other fooliſh Counſellors he hearkened to. Now, this Man, as it appears, proved a ſad Fellow, for though he was a Scholar, being brought up in ſome Univerſity, yet he never cared to read the Bible, but as ſome ſay, would now and then curſe it, love to read Romances and Song-Books. But poor Conſcience being ſtifled, in a little time he gave Content to the whole Family, in that he could mumble over a few Prayers out of a Book: And that in the ſecond place, he could Bowl, drink Healths, be Drunk, and cry Damn him with any of them; and there was indeed never a one in all the Family that hated True Godlineſs more than he; for he made Songs of him, and Scoffed, Jeered
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:040363_0017_10163EB29EB534C0"/>and Derided him, continually calling him a Myſterious and Nonſenſical Fellow, talking of Things againſt all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Reaſon, and above all belief, of three that are but one; and he made himſelf and others Merry with his mean, low and diſtreſſed Condition, and alſo ſtirr'd up all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, to find Fault and Quarrel with all thoſe who were Friends and true Lovers of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Godlineſs</hi> now perceived he was like to have but cool Entertainment at his Houſe, having waited at <hi>Riches</hi> Gate till his Patience was almoſt worn out, began to think of a Removal, and to Travel to ſome other Place; but before he took his final Farewel, he was reſolved to ſpeak his Mind freely to him, thereby to leave him without any kind of Excuſe whatſoever, and therefore Addreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him after this Manner, being at the Door ready to depart.</p>

                  <speaker>Godlineſs.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, <hi>Riches,</hi> I ſee now very plainly, you did but flatter me when you began to hearken to your poor Steward Conſcience, in order to the letting me into your Houſe; for evident it is, you are grown far worſe than before, and have blinded his Eyes, by entertaining another, who calls himſelf by my Name inſtead of me; but before I do depart, I will ſhew you the great danger you are in, and the Cauſe of it; the Truth is, you have got ſuch a Crew of looſe, baſe and deceitful Servants, that they will utterly undo you, and bring upon you the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ruin of your poor Soul, which I deſign'd by my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to you, to ſave and make happy for ever; for indeed (whether you believe it or no) there was never any who entertained theſe graceleſs Villains and Enemies of God, but were for ever ruin'd by them at laſt; nay, not only eternally hereafter in the World to come, but many times externally here in this World; therefore I adviſe you to do what you can to get rid of them, and I will help you
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:040363_0017_10163EB29EB534C0"/>to far better Servants in their ſtead. For firſt of all, can you think it will be ſafe for you to keep <hi>Preſumption</hi> ſtill in your Houſe, ſince there is ſcarce a more deceitful and bloody Wretch in the World? How many thouſands of poor Souls hath he impudently deſtroy'd, by cauſing them to preſume on the Mercy of God, and the death of Chriſt, and yet live in Sin, Pride, and Covetouſneſs, and in a vile Manner hating and contemning me, that is to ſay, True Godlineſs? Doth not God ſay, <hi>It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven,</hi> and yet you are perſwaded by him, to think it is an eaſy thing? And doth not the Scriptures ſay, <hi>Except your righteouſneſs do exceed the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the kingdom of God?</hi> Mat. 5.20. And yet he tells you that by doing a few good Deeds, or by giving a little of your great abundance to the Poor, your State is good enough; whereas many of the Phariſees did as to acts of Charity, exceedingly out do you; nay, doth not St <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>though he gave all his goods to feed the poor, and his body to be burned, yet without Charity,</hi> (that is to ſay, true love to Godlineſs) <hi>he was nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.3. and yet you, tho' you flight and contemn God and Godlineſs, are taught to preſume on God's Mercy, who hath notwithſtanding poſitively ſaid concerning you, and ſuch as you are; <hi>He that made them will not ſave them; and he that formed them, will ſhew them no favour,</hi> Iſa. 27.11.</p>
                  <p>As touching what <hi>Self-love</hi> ſaith, it is abominable; do you not find the Lord Jeſus ſaying, <hi>that unleſs a man deny himſelf he cannot be my diſciple,</hi> Mat. 16.22. Now this Fellow is one of the reſt there meant, even Self-love and Self-righteouſneſs, as well as Sinful-ſelf and Natural ſelf. Sir, you muſt get rid of them all, or periſh for ever.</p>
                  <p>Will you love your ſelf more than Chriſt? Self-love muſt die, he is a Traitor to the Lord of Life and Glory;
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:040363_0018_10163EB5B4410B70"/>and an utter Enemy to your own Soul; if you make him your Counſellor, you are an undone Man.</p>
                  <p>And then as to Worldly Wiſdom, he is the Devil's Attorney-General, that ever gives Counſel to all that hearken to him againſt God and Chriſt, and all revealed Religion; this is he that Satan hath ſtirred up (ſince Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience hath been eſtabliſhed, and Popery hath been vanquiſhed) to deceive and ruin the Souls of Men; 'tis he that ridicules all ſupernatural diſcoveries of God, or revealed Religion, and would indeed rob the whole Kingdom of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and ſo Paganize this Iſle again. Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>the world by wiſdom knew not God?</hi> He would have you believe nothing to be a Truth or Principle of Religion that lies above your own humane Reaſon; and therefore he ſays there is nothing myſterious in Chriſtianity; by which he gives the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Lie, that ſays <hi>without controverſy great is the myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16.</p>
                  <p>He will not ſuffer ſuch that hearken to him, to believe the Trinity of Perſons in the ſacred Godhead, nor that Chriſt is the moſt high God, and yet very Man in one Perſon, becauſe it lies above Man's Wiſdom, or human Underſtanding to comprehend it; nor that ſinners can be juſtified by an imputed Righteouſneſs, or by the active and paſſive obedience of Chriſt, tho' 'tis poſitively aſſerted to be thus, by the Spirit of God in the Word.</p>
                  <p>This Worldly Wiſdom and Sir Humane Reaſon taught the Greeks (in the Apoſtles time) to contemn the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt crucified, and Salvation by him, as a fooliſh Notion, or idle Dream; and ſo they ſtrive to perſwade People to think now, and ſo to trample the chief Principles of the Chriſtian Faith under their Feet.</p>
                  <p>Alas! 'tis evident, that there are many earthly Things, or Things in Nature, which no Man can comprehend nor
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:040363_0018_10163EB5B4410B70"/>give Reaſon of; and is it any marvel then, that the Myſteries of the Goſpel, or the deep things of God, are above Man's humane Reaſon to conceive of them, ſo as to comprehend them?</p>
                  <p>Yet know, tho' theſe Myſteries are above humane Reaſon, they are not againſt Reaſon to believe them: Is it not reaſonable that Men believe what the God of Truth affirms, and the eternal Father, Son and Spirit bear Record unto? Theſe Wretches would not have you to <hi>ſell all you have, and give it to the poor,</hi> yet you know the Lord Jeſus Chriſt gave that Counſel to a Rich Man; and if you do not part with all in your Love and Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and actually when God calls for it, you can be no true Chriſtian, becauſe you do not love God with all your Heart, nor above your Gold and Silver, or earthly Riches.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if you will not chuſe to become a fool in the Eſteem of carnal Men, you can never be truly wiſe; ſee 1 Cor. 3.18. <hi>If any man among you ſeemeth to be wiſe in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wiſe:</hi> Let the wiſe Men of Reaſon account you a fool, if you are ſpiritually wiſe, wiſe unto Salvation, matter not how you are called and cenſured by ſuch whom Satan has blinded: Doth not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>that the world by wiſdom knew not God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then, as touching your Servant <hi>Unbelief,</hi> he is ſuch a bloody and devouring Monſter, that he hath ſent Millions to Hell, by hindering them from believing what God hath ſaid in his Word, touching his Grace and Clemency to true Believers, and his Wrath and Vengeance to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and unbelieving Soul; he will not ſuffer you to Believe nor give Credit to that Word, <hi>If any man loves the world, the love of the father is not in him,</hi> 1 John 2.15. Nor to that Word, <hi>Except a man be born again he cannot ſee the kingdom of God,</hi> John 3.3. <hi>And he that believeth not,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:040363_0019_10163EB94A24CD40"/>ſhall be damned;</hi> Mark 16.16. And many like dreadful Sentences, which he will not ſuffer you to regard, nor give the leaſt credit to; and thus he teaches you to make God a liar, for he hath ſaid, <hi>You ſhall without true faith, be damned, and periſh in your ſins;</hi> but he ſays, <hi>ye ſhall be ſaved though ye live in your ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to what <hi>Ignorance</hi> ſays, <hi>that you may purchaſe or merit peace of conſcience, by giving more liberally to the poor, and that may alſo make you friends of the mammon of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> he makes you think that God and Jeſus Chriſt will that way become your friends, and ſave your Soul when you fail, or come to die.</p>
                  <p>Sir, if you give all your Goods to feed the Poor, or give all you have to them (which you are far from doing) yet you would be miſerable, nothing that you can do can change your State or procure God's acceptance of your Perſon; no, you muſt obtain union with Chriſt, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me, or periſh in your Sins for ever. If Money co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then alſo it might be very eaſy <hi>for a rich men to enter into the kingdom of heaven,</hi> which the Lord Chriſt ſays is not an eaſy thing. Sir, while the World is in your Heart, in your Love and Affection, <hi>the love of the father is not in you,</hi> tho' ye give much to the Poor.</p>
                  <p>As the young Man, who was very Rich, wanted one Thing, ſo do you, that is, true Faith, and an Intereſt in Chriſt: You muſt be born again, or you cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; and that you can never be, until you receive the holy Spirit, and let in True Godlineſs: Whoſoever receives me, receives the Spirit, and true and right Principles; ſuch as theſe, that <hi>all your own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is as filthy rags;</hi> and that all Works before Grace are dead Works, and profit Men nothing.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>As concerning <hi>Pride,</hi> whom you entertain and hug in your Boſom as a ſweet and beloved Friend, he hath been the ruin of many Souls likewiſe; nay, and not only Men, but Angels alſo, for 'tis tho't he was the principal one who wrought their eternal Deſtruction, and from Heaven caſt them down to Hell, and of Angels of light made them Devils. But, Sir, pray remember that Word, <hi>Pride goes before deſtruction, and an haughty ſpirit before a fall.</hi> What became of the great King of <hi>Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> for entertaining this Fellow? Was it not Pride that brought him down with a Vengeance, and turned him a Grazing, to eat Straw like Oxen? <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.4.

He hath taught many to play the Thief, others to commit Treaſon, and others to Murder Innocents for their Inheritance; he is guilty of Bribery, Uſury, Extortion, and Oppreſſion: It was he that made poor <hi>Achan</hi> loſe his ſweet Life, he alſo contrived the death of <hi>Naboth</hi> and his Sons; and more than all, he tempted <hi>Judas</hi> to ſell, and baſely betray my dear Lord and Maſter JESUS CHRIST, for thirty pieces of Silver: Do not blame me therefore, if I bear ſo hard againſt him: Moreover, I can ſcarcely ever get one Foot into any Rich Man's Houſe through his Means; 'tis he and his Companions who keep me out; he hath through his hard-heartedneſs, almoſt famiſhed to Death all the Poor, both in City and Country, and hath alſo of late very near betrayed my whole Intereſt that I have in the World, into the Enemies hands; he hath alſo grievouſly corrupted many who profeſs kindneſs to me, by incumbring their Minds ſo with the Affairs of this Life, that they cannot find the Way to the Church; when they ſhould be hearing of God's Word, he forces them to abide in their Shops; nor will he ſuffer many of them to take a little Time to Pray in their Families, nor in their Cloſets: He has alſo expoſed many of my poor Miniſters to many great Straits and Neceſſities, by which means their Heads have been ſo filled with the Cares of this Life, that they
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:040363_0020_10162271064AA050"/>have been cut of Capacity to preach the Goſpel as they ought to preach it, nor can they get ſuch helps that are neceſſary, and all along of him: Nay, he hath almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done every Nation, Kingdom and common-wealth; firſt, by corrupting the Law, and ſubverting Juſtice, cauſing Judges to judge for Reward, and Lawyers to plead more for Fees than Equity. And then ſecondly, by ſpoiling Commerce, for he hath Monopolized Trades and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities ſo into his own hands, and inhanced the Prices of Things, that many Men have been undone by him. I cannot Sir, reckon up all his horrible Crimes, and is this him you ſo dearly love? and muſt I be ſlighted and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by you through the love you bear to him? Alas, he will bring your Soul if you follow him, to Deſtruction. Pray what became of <hi>Achan</hi> who harboured him (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before) alſo what became of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> whom he forced to tell a lie to the Holy Ghoſt? <hi>Acts.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. Who was it that cauſed the young Man in the Goſpel, to fall ſhort of Heaven, and to go away from Jeſus Chriſt very ſorrowful, and <hi>Demas</hi> to turn Apoſtate, and to embrace this preſent evil World? Was it not <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteouſneſs?</hi> Ah, Sir, take heed of this abominable Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant, for tho' ſome wicked ones of the Earth may bleſs you, yet he cauſeth God to hate you. See what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The wicked boaſteth of his heart's deſire, and bleſſeth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth,</hi> Pſal. 10.3. Conſider of theſe Things, and be perſwaded to put away all theſe deceitful and hell-bred Companions, which you have a long time nouriſhed in your Houſe, or it will be worſe with you I do aſſure you. O that you would now at laſt, before I leave you, hearken to my Counſel, and receive me into your Houſe, and renounce that Monſter you have lately embraced, who calls himſelf by my Name!

                  <p>Why then I will tell you your Duty: You muſt believe in Chriſt, and very fervently read the Holy Bible, and every Lord's Day with great reverence and ſeriouſneſs hear God's bleſſed Word, and Pray at leaſt twice a Day; nay, and I ſhall teach you to be more painful and laborious in your Trade and worldly Buſineſs: But this I know cannot be done, unleſs you put away that Crew of looſe and naughty Fellows in your Houſe.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Poverty</hi> had it ſeems, divers baſe and lazy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who were all grand Enemies to True Godlineſs; alſo ſome of them 'tis ſaid, were his own Children, or natural Off-ſpring; there Names were theſe, <hi>(viz) Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, Ignorance, Sloth</hi> alias <hi>Idleneſs, Waſtful, Light fingers,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:040363_0025_10163EC7C65162C8"/>Faint-heart, Carping cares</hi> and <hi>Fear-man,</hi> together with ſome others: Now when he began to open to Godlineſs, theſe hindred him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Idleneſs</hi> would not ſuffer him to riſe out of his Bed of Security to call upon God, nor take pains to pull up the Briars and Thorns that grew in his Heart; by which Means his Field lay barren and untill'd, nothing growing therein, but what the Ground brought forth naturally: Nay theſe made him of ſuch a Sluggiſh Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſuch a lover of Reſt, that he complained many times becauſe he could not go without Motion: Nay, he was unwilling to be at the Trouble of Feeding himſelf, and therefore would wiſh that Men might live as Trees and Plants do: I remember a very wiſe Man told me, <hi>that he hides his hand in his boſom, and it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth,</hi> Prov. 26.15. by the means of theſe two lazy Fellows, <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Idleneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ignorance</hi> told him he had received True Godlineſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and that he had dwelt in his Houſe ever ſince he was a Child, and that Baptiſm brought him in; and that the chief Buſineſs which God required of him, was to get Bread and Cloaths for his Family.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Unbelief</hi> told him, that thoſe Things which Godlineſs talked of, were meer Fictions. But when he queſtion'd the Truth of what Unbelief ſpoke upon this account, then the Wretch told him, however they were Things far out of his reach, neither could they (if it was poſſible to obtain them) anſwer his preſent Neceſſities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Light-fingers</hi> told him he had been for a great while his beſt Friend, and if it had not been for him, he had been ſtarved to Death long before now.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſtruſtful</hi> ſell into Diſcourſe with his thieving Brother, and poſitively ſaid, if he turned Light-fingers out of his Houſe (as he knew he muſt if Godlineſs came in) he

                  <p>
                     <hi>Waſteful</hi> told him, that True Godlineſs, if entertained, would not ſuffer him to buy ſuch good pieces of Beef, Mutton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he was uſed to do on truſt, unleſs he knew he was able to pay for 'em; and that he would not ſuffer him to go any more to merry Meetings, and carouſe it amongſt good Fellows at the Ale-Houſe, nor recreate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at Cards, Nine-Pins, and other Sports, for Money on Holidays, and that he muſt be content with ſuch mean Cloaths and Fare he had got, and never loſe a Day's Work to gratify the Luſts of the Fleſh; and that alſo he muſt change his Company; which particularly was grievous to Poverty to bear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Carping-cares</hi> filled his Head ſo full of diſtracting Tho'ts, that he had not time to think of God, Chriſt, nor his own Soul, from one Week's end to another; but his great Study was either to think where to borrow Money, and ſo get more in Debt, or elſe how to Pay what he ow'd, to get out of Debt, or what he ſhould do for Work, Trade being grown (by the badneſs of the Times) very dead; by this Means he was filled with ſad Tho'ts, not knowing how he ſhould get more Bread, when that he had was gone, and more Cloaths, when them he had, would hang on no longer; beſides, it could not go out of his Mind, but that at one Time or other he ſhould be Arreſted, and thrown into a Gaol, having many Times moſt fearfully broke his Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faint-heart</hi> and <hi>Fear-man</hi> preſented to him the Danger he would be in upon many conſiderations, if True Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were entertained:</p>
                  <p>For, firſt, they told him how contemptible Real-God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs was grown at this preſent Time, being of very little eſteem amongſt any degrees of Men in the World, by reaſon of <hi>Vice,</hi> which was never more rampant; inſomuch
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:040363_0026_10163EC95A67DB70"/>that True Godlineſs was like to be driven out of the World, and forced to fly into ſome hole or corner of the Earth, to hide himſelf. Mr. <hi>Riches,</hi> who is Lord of the Manor, hath beat him away from his Door, and hateth him with a perfect hatred; now, if you entertain him, he will ſoon hear of it, and ſo will become your deadly Enemy, and pull down your Cottage, or warn you out, or be ſure not to let you have a Farthing of the Poors Money, nor never ſet you to Work any more; and what will become then of thy poor Wife and Children? Nay, ſaid they, we will tell you more; do you not hear what cruel Edict the Prince of the ancient Gauls Country hath made againſt True Godlineſs?<note place="margin">The French King.</note> And how many of the Proteſtant Churches he hath pulled down, and utterly demoliſhed? And now he is perſecuted almoſt every where: come ſay they, 'tis that pleaſant and lovely form of Counterfeit Godlineſs, that will in a little Time be generally embraced and thoſe who entertain True Godlineſs,<note place="margin">Papiſtry.</note> muſt expect to be reproached and reviled, nay mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Beſides, do you not hear how many thouſands in <hi>France,</hi> and in other places, who have for a long Time entertained him, have turned him out of Doors? They are weary of him, or afraid to own him: And is this a time for you to think of embracing him? <hi>Poverty!</hi> (ſaid they) pity your ſelf, and have more Wit, you are poor enough already, and this is the way to make you more miſerable: If <hi>Riches</hi> will not entertain him, who hath many Advantages to help himſelf in diſtreſſed Times, over what <hi>Poverty</hi> hath, or can promiſe himſelf, there is no ground of encouragement for you to open to him.</p>
                  <p>Upon this poor <hi>Poverty</hi> reſolved not to let True God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs have a Lodging in his Houſe, but rather, inſtead thereof, to put ſtronger Bolts and Bars on his Doors.

                     <hi>Godlineſs</hi> having waited all this while to hear what theſe curſed Enemies of his would ſay, and perceiving they had now done, he broke Silence, and began to ſpeak after this Manner.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to thoſe lazy Companions, <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> who will not ſuffer you to labour for the good, neither of Body or Soul, they have in part brought you into this poor and miſerable Condition you are in. Oh how many have they bro't to beg their Bread from Door to Door! and ſtirred up others to Rob, and commit horrible Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for to uphold them in their lazy and ungodly Lives; by which Means they have brought, and daily do bring Numbers to the Gallows: But the greateſt Miſchief they do is to the Souls of Men; for they have caſt thouſands into ſuch a deep Sleep, that they will never awake till they lift up their Eyes in Hell; they will not ſuffer Men to Labour to find out their Danger, till it is too late; and others, when they do perceive their woful Condition, are hindred by them from endeavouring timely to get out; they many times cry <hi>Lord help us,</hi> and <hi>Lord have mercy upon us;</hi> but never ſtrive to take hold of the offers of his Grace and Mercy by cleaving to Chriſt, and leaving their Wickedneſs. 'Tis the <hi>idle ſoul that ſuffers hunger,</hi> who ſhall <hi>beg at harveſt, and have nothing,</hi> though there is Bread enough and to ſpare for you in God's Houſe, yet they will not ſuffer you to ſeek out for it, but cauſe you to cry, <hi>yet a little ſleep, yet a little ſlumber, yet a little folding of the hands to ſleep,</hi> Prov. 24.33. O remember that Word,

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Waſteful</hi> his Brother, for all his Huſſing is almoſt as bad as he; 'twas this vain Fellow that brought the poor Prodigal <hi>to eat Husks with the Swine,</hi> Luke 15. 'Tis he not only cauſes you to fooliſhly ſpend your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, (when you have got a little) but alſo your precious Time, which ſhould be improved for the Good of your periſhing Soul. <hi>Poverty,</hi> can it do you any Harm to be taught to be a better Husband, and not to conſume the little you ſometimes get, amongſt riotous Company, which might be a great Comfort to your poor Wife and Children? Alſo I will appeal to my neighbour <hi>Morality,</hi> whether there is any Ground for you to refuſe to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain me, becauſe I teach you to be content with mean Things, hard Fare, and do put you upon hard Labour, and not run in Debt, unleſs you knew how to pay it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ignorance</hi> is a Murderer, and hath deſtroyed Millions of Souls, though there was a time indeed when God ſeemed to wink at him, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. <hi>i. e.</hi> Did not lay, (as it were) his Hands immediately upon him; but now he is left altogether inexcuſable, becauſe God hath afforded him a Sufficiency of Light, to bring you to the true Knowledge of Salvation, the Neceſſity of Faith and True Godlineſs, if you would eſcape the Damnation of Hell. <hi>Unbelief</hi> I found the other Day with <hi>Riches,</hi> and indeed, I can come to no Door but I find him within; I gave a plain Character of him then, to which I refer you, if you
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:040363_0028_10163ECE9D7A3808"/>have a Mind to know what a dangerous Perſon he is; but however, take one Word or two in anſwer to what he ſays to you againſt me; he affirms that all my Promiſes are Fictions, being unſeen Things, that have no Reality in them, or Things that you can never attain to, and if you could, yet they could not anſwer your preſent Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. If you will give Credit to ſuch a notorious Liar, Murtherer and Blaſphemer, who in a ſly and treacherous Manner ſeeks to ſtab you at the Heart, who can help it? Are Chriſt's Promiſes of Grace and Peace here, and Glory hereafter, becauſe not ſeen with external Eyes, Fictions? He will tell you alſo, ere long, if you will believe me, there is no God, nor Devil, Heaven nor Hell, becauſe not ſeen with viſible Eyes; he may ſuggeſt the one to you as well as the other. Come, <hi>Poverty,</hi> Thouſands of my Children, by bleſſed Experience, have found my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes no Fictions nor idle Fancies, but Things full of Reality, Marrow and Fatneſs: <hi>O taſte and ſee, how good the Lord is!</hi> And why may not you obtain theſe glorious good Things, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Union and Communion with God, Pardon of Sin, Peace of Conſcience, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, as well as others? They were commonly given in the Time of the Goſpel to the Poor: Come, <hi>Poverty,</hi> theſe Things are thine, (as ſure as God is in Heaven, if thou wilt but let me in) poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> underſtood them, and experienced the Sweetneſs of them, and ſhall to all Eternity. And then laſtly, have you no need of theſe good Things of mine, becauſe they may not ſo directly anſwer your outward Neceſſities? Are not the Neceſſities of your Soul more to be minded, than to get Store of Meat, Drink, Cloaths, Silver and Gold? What are all theſe Things to the Love and Favour of God, an Intereſt in Chriſt, and to have a Right to the Kingdom of Heaven? How ſoon, alas, may your Life be gone? And what
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:040363_0028_10163ECE9D7A3808"/>Good will thoſe Things do you? Do you not ſee they periſh in the uſing? And as you are corruptible, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they can never ſatisfy nor fill the Deſires of your Soul, nor do they ſuit the Neceſſities thereof. Conſider, Can any of theſe Things make thy Soul happy? Can Gold and Silver enrich it? Or the rareſt worldly Dainties feed it? Or Wine cheer it? No, <hi>Poverty,</hi> if thou hadſt the Things of the World in never ſo great Abundance, yet till thou letteſt me in, and makeſt me thy chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, thy Soul will be miſerable. What is it to have Plenty of all good Things, and no GOD, no Chriſt, no Pardon, no Peace, but contrary-wiſe, the curſe of God, horror of Conſcience, and Hell at laſt? Thou wilt, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,</hi> become more happy if thou doſt open the Door to me, and thou and I dwell together, than the proudeſt and haughtieſt Monarch in the World; thy Comforts, inward Peace, and Joy will excell their's, and thy Riches be more abundant in Quantity, beſides the rare and excellent Quality of them; nay, and thy Glory will be far more tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; and beſides will abide with thee to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Carping-care,</hi> he hath almoſt broke thy Heart already; he will not let thee Sleep in the Night; but by telling thee thy Wants and neceſſities, ſadly diſturbs thy Mind, but never helps thee to a Farthing, and why ſhould'ſt thou hearken to him any longer, he is thy utter Enemy, as well as mine: Hear what the Lord Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Who by taking thought can add one cubit unto his ſtature?</hi> Mat. 6.27.</p>
                  <p>He has even eaten up thy very Spirits, and weakned thy Body, marr'd thy Senſes, eſpecially the Spiritual Senſes of thy Soul, ſo that thou canſt not think one ſerious Thought for him; nay, when Sloth and Idleneſs will let thee go to hear God's Word, he follows thee thither too, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds thy Mind with wandring Tho'ts, that all thy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is ſpoiled, and you can profit nothing: Therefore I beſeech you do what you can to thruſt him out.</p>

Come Poverty, they are a pack of curſed Villains, ſet on by their great Maſter Apolyon, to bring thee to ſhame, as if there was no way to live, but by breaking of God's Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal;</hi> and is he not a Wretch that ſhall call into queſtion the Care and Faithfulneſs of God, whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are to feed and cloath thee, and to ſupply all thy Neceſſities in the Way of thy Duty, ſo that thou ſhalt not <hi>want any good thing,</hi> Pſal. 34.9, 10.</p>
                  <p>And now in the laſt place, let me ſpeak a few Words to thoſe cowardly fellows, <hi>Faint-heart,</hi> and <hi>Fear-man,</hi> Iſa. 51.12. theſe are they that would have you fear Man more than God; and yet I am ready to believe ſome of their Words take as much place upon your Heart, as any thing you heard from the other.</p>
                  <p>But for what reaſon then, we will come now to conſider.</p>

                  <p>To this I anſwer, <hi>firſt,</hi> I never had much eſteem amongſt great Men; nay, in every age of the World very few gave Credit to me, and now being come (almoſt to the end of my Travels) in the laſt and worſt Age, I could expect no other uſage than what I met withal. How ſhould I have any to admire and fall in love with me, when the Text poſitively ſays, <hi>All the world wanders after the beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13.3. That is, they are in love with, and admire Counterfeit Godlineſs; and the truth is, I marvel not at it, becauſe all along the falſe Prophets were more

Alas don't you ſee how Counterfeit Godlineſs gives Liberty to Men to pleaſe their brutiſh Luſts, teaching an eaſier way to Heaven, than ever I did, or can, for I always taught, as at this Day, the Doctrine of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> Mark 8.34. the neceſſity of Faith in Chriſt, <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Mortification</hi> of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> John 3.5.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="unknown:040363_0030_101666C260263598"/>Day of Diſtreſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.9. What doſt thou ſay, <hi>Poverty?</hi> Shall I come in? But notwithſtanding all that Godlineſs could ſay, <hi>Poverty,</hi> would not give way to him, but began to give him reviling Words, ſaying, he was born a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, tho' he was fallen to Decay; and that he would not ſuffer ſuch Tumults at his Door; (for it ſeems, while Godlineſs was praying and preſſing for Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, one <hi>Perſecution,</hi> the Off-ſpring of <hi>Adam's</hi> eldeſt Son <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4.8. had raiſed abundance of lewd Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows together, to drive Godlineſs away from <hi>Poverty</hi>'s Door:) So by the Oppoſition within Doors, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, Godlineſs found no Lodging there neither; yea, and eſcaped not without many bitter Threatnings, Execrations, and Blaſphemous Words. Now one Reaſon why <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Poverty</hi> did not receive True Godlineſs was, becauſe <hi>Conſideration</hi> dwelt with neither of them, who being a grave Counſellor, would have given them better Advice, than to deny Entertainment to ſo ſweet a Friend. Godlineſs, after this, began for to be at a ſtand which Way to Travel next; but hearing of one <hi>Youth,</hi> who lived not far off, he reſolved to ſee whether he might not get a dwelling with him, becauſe he was one that his Commiſſion particularly directed him to viſit.</p>

               <p>ONE might think, by this Time, 'twas in vain for True Godlineſs to travel any farther, not being like to find Entertainment any where, ſince Riches and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty both had refuſed to receive him; yet he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to purſue his Journey, not being without Hopes of finding his dear Friend at laſt called <hi>Conſideration,</hi> whom he ſought for; and coming into a famous City where one <hi>Youth</hi> dwelt, could not tell but he might meet with him at his Houſe, calling to Mind what Kindneſs young <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, Moſes, Samuel, David, Obadiah, Joſias, John</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> of Old, and many others, had ſhewed him, and therefore came boldly to his Door, and deſired Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.

<pb n="56" facs="unknown:040363_0031_1016662633E700A8"/>and lived in a Place where the Goſpel was powerfully preached, yet he was very ignorant as touching the beſt Things, tho' very complaiſant. And after Godlineſs had in a grave and ſober Manner, deſired a Lodging with him, and asked him what he was, as alſo his Name, he ſpake thus:</p>

               </argument>
               <p>TRUE Godlineſs having travelled up and down in the World for many Years, and ſuffered divers Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and grand Affronts, at laſt came, by the gracious Providence of God into a ſmall Iſle, neither did he travel alone, but like a high-born Prince, (tho' in a ſtate of exile for many Years paſt) he had ſome Servants to attend and wait upon him, who loved him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his great Maſters as their own Souls, and above their natural Lives: their

Now, after he had been there, and was in great eſteem &amp; honour for divers years, yet about Forty Years ago, lo, on a ſudden, a black Cloud came over him, and a new War was raiſed upon him, and upon all his real Friends, Servants and Favourites, which God permitted, to fulfill an ancient Prophecy, for the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the two Witneſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. and ſo if poſſible, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſuppreſs, root out, and deſtroy true Godlineſs; and in order to the accompliſhing of this, there were let into the ſaid Iſle a multitude of out-landiſh Men, called <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> being Natives of a great City, called by that Name; ſo that the ſaid Iſland, by this means, was called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where alſo our Lord was ſpiritually Crucified.</p>

               <p>And now, one would think, the Sorrows, Troubles and Sufferings of true Godlineſs were near ended, and joy fill'd the Hearts of all that loved him: But alas, alas, it appeared otherwiſe, for this glorious Deliverance and Revolution hath not had thoſe deſired effects as might have been hoped, for altho' outward Peace and Proſperity ſeemed to favour the Iſle, and true Godlineſs alſo, yet there were (and ſtill continue) many Cauſes of great Sorrow and Grief to true Godlineſs, and all godly Perſons, ſo that at this very Time, behold and ſee true Godlineſs hath put on Mourning Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and is in a whithering and declining Condition, and crys out, O it was better with me and my Children in Times paſt when in Egypt, under Servitude and Bondage.

               <p>Can theſe Things be ſaid of juſtified and pardon'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? And is not Chriſt to be offered to Sinners, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Perſons, to condemned Perſons, as ſuch? Or, are juſtified and pardoned Men and Women without God, without Chriſt, condemn'd or ungodly, and unbelieving Perſons? And becauſe the Elect were repreſentatively virtually juſtified in the actual Juſtification of Chriſt, when he was raiſed from the dead, were they therefore then all perſonally and really juſtified, even before they perſonally did exiſt? Such Notions as theſe are raiſed and cried up, which caſt Contempt upon True Godlineſs.</p>
               <p>Others alſo deny the <hi>Deity of Chriſt,</hi> and his Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeking hereby utterly to eclipſe his Glory; and others deny his Humanity; ſome, who pretend to love True Godlineſs, affirm he is not God of the Eſſence of his Father, nor Man of the Subſtance of the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, being worſe Hereticks than the <hi>Arians:</hi> Others affirm, that the <hi>true Chriſt</hi> is nothing elſe but that inward Quality or Light that is in the Hearts of all Men; and theſe Hereticks (as one that is come off from them ſays) have deluded an hundred thouſand Souls in this Iſle, who hardly hold one ſound Principle of true Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another Cauſe is from that great Decay of the Power of Religion, and ſtrange Witherings, and Want of Love to one another, amongſt them that pretend to be the chief Lovers of True Godlineſs; together with thoſe
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:040363_0039_101666A7AD761F60"/>ſad Contentions, Strife and Diviſions that are among them; for inſtead of loving, they do even ſeem to hate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach one another; and becauſe they are not all of one Judgment, in ſome leſſer Points of Religion, they are ſtrangely alienated from each other, in their Love and Affections.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The diſorderly Walking of Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as in not keeping their Places in thoſe reſpective Congregations to which they belong, is no ſmall Injury, Reproach and Scandal to True Godlineſs: Members act as if they were under no Government, nor Covenant to God, one to another, and unto the Church, and go aſtray from the Fold, by which they caſt Contempt upon the Miniſtry where they are Members, and ſeem to charge God with Cruelty to them, in bringing them into a Church where they cannot Profit; whereas the Cauſe may lie in themſelves, and by Reaſon of an evil Itch they have upon them; and by this Means God, no Lord's Day, hath a compleat Church Sacrifice or Oblation, but a Part, or but a few Perſons; and that which adds to his Reproach, is that unaccountable Practice of one or two Congregations, in the great City, who countenance Rents and Schiſm, and contemn the Authority of other Churches, by an irregular Reception of their Members.</p>
               <p>Now, from the Senſe of theſe Things, True Godlineſs broke forth into this bitter Lamentation here following.</p>
               <p>Godlineſs's <hi>Lamentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HOW ſhall I expreſs my Grief, or utter my Complaint? Oh, the Sorrow that ſeizes on my Soul! I that am the noble Off-ſpring of the univerſal Monarch, of the whole World, the true Favourite of Heaven, the true Intereſt of all Nations, Kingdoms and Common-Wealths;
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:040363_0039_101666A7AD761F60"/>a fit Companion for Princes, and all the Noble ones of the Earth; the only Benefactor of all Mortals, that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeek the Good and eternal Felicity of their Souls, who ſtrive to deliver them from Wrath and Judgment, and to ſtop the deſtroying Angel from executing Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: Should this Day be thus ſlighted, villified, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured and ſtigmatized, and have all Manner of curſed and deteſtable Evils and Abominations laid to my Charge.</p>
               <p>For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am charged with Hereſy, an horrible Crime indeed, but 'tis no other than I was of old Times accuſed with. But what is the Hereſy? What my Doctrine is, is ſhewed in the firſt Chapter of this Book, to which I refer the Reader; but I may ſay with St. <hi>Paul, after that Way which they call Hereſy, ſo I teach Men to worſhip the God of the Fathers,</hi> Acts 24.14. and not to believe any Thing but what is written in the old and new Teſtaments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I am accuſed to be a common Diſturber, a meer Make-bait, ſetting one Man againſt another, the Father againſt the Son, and the Son againſt the Father; the Mother-in-Law againſt the Daughter-in-Law, and the Daughter-in-Law againſt the Mother-in-Law; divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Cities, Towns and Villages, ſetting Neighbour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Neighbour. O, how doth this wound my Heart! Was ever any dealt with as I am? Shall ſuch Things as theſe be father'd upon me? I do this Day proteſt and declare before God and all the World, I am abuſed and unjuſtly charged; for I am for Peace, Unity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and always do teach it; I abhor Strife and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and every evil Work, and have endeavoured to bring all Men to live in Love one with another; but if it fall out at any Time where I am received, that the Father is ſet againſt the Son, and the Son againſt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or one Neighbour againſt another, 'tis not I that
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:040363_0040_101666AAE3686078"/>am the Cauſe of it, but that curſed Enemy Pride, Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Senſuality, that is in the Hearts of the adverſe Party, they having eſpouſed the Intereſt of <hi>Apollyon,</hi> my grand Enemy; but can it be ſuppoſed, that Vertue ſhould wink at, or ſide with filthy Vice; or True Godlineſs allow of and indulge Men in Ungodlineſs, or Truth join or cloſe in with Error? Alas! Should I do thus, I ſhould loſe my very Being, and be no more what I am: For as 'tis impoſſible for Light to have Fellowſhip with Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Chriſt to have Concord with Belial, ſo it is for me to allow of, or bear with any of the evil Enormities of the Children of Men; therefore let all the World bear me Witneſs this Day, that I clear my ſelf of thoſe ſoul Crimes and Calumnies that I am charged with. And farther to vindicate my ſelf, I call in my old Friend St. <hi>James,</hi> pray hear what he hath to ſay about the horrible Charge brought againſt me. St. <hi>James,</hi> pray ſpeak to this great Caſe, from whence comes that Strife, Wars and Contention that is in the World? Am I the Cauſe of it?</p>
               <p>James. <hi>From whence come Wars and Fighting among Men? Come they not hence, even of their Luſts, that war in their Members? Ye luſt, and have not, ye kill, and deſire to have, and cannot obtain,</hi> &amp;c. Jam. 4.1. <hi>If you have bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Envyings and Strife in your Hearts, glory not, lie not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth;</hi> (mark that) <hi>this Wiſdom deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh,</hi> Jam. 3.14.15.</p>
               <p>O bleſſed St. <hi>James,</hi> thou haſt cleared me, ford, True Godlineſs, am the Truth, whoſoever receives me, receives the Truth, the Doctrine of Truth, and the Truth of Grace. But pray St <hi>James</hi> go on.</p>
               <p>James. <hi>Where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion, and every evil work. But the Wiſdom that is from above is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without wrangling, and without hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:040363_0040_101666AAE3686078"/>
                  <hi>Godli.</hi> It is enough, I always teach Men and Women, who embrace me, to be holy, peaceable, gentle and eaſy to be entreated, full of mercy, to hate hypocriſy, and all the deeds of the Fleſh. Therefore take notice, if any, who are called by my Name, or profeſs love to me, are unholy, quarrelſome, given to ſtrife, debate and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, falling out with their Neighbours, making cauſeleſs Diſturbance in the Town, Place or Houſe where they dwell, and Churches alſo, I do this Day diſown them; and indeed, 'tis they, who have in part expoſed me to Reproach and Contempt in theſe eveil Days.</p>
               <p>I am accuſed alſo with Sedition and Faction, and for being the chief Ring-leader of Sects, &amp;c. But I may well ſay, with my old friend St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (who was accuſed by <hi>Tertullian</hi> in like ſort) being called <hi>a peſtilent fellow, a mover of ſedition, &amp;c.</hi> Acts 24.5. I am clear from this evil Charge, neither can they prove this Accuſation againſt me, I have been travelling up and down in moſt parts of the Earth, for almoſt Six thouſand Years, and 'tis ſtrange, were I really guilty, that none ſhould come forth and prove it againſt me. Therefore know ye, that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of true Godlineſs, the Off-ſpring of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the darling of Heaven, do, and ever did teach upon this Account, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That Huſbands ought to love their Wives, Wives to obey their Huſbands, Children to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their Parents, and Parents to carry it wiſely towards their Children, and to bring them up in the fear and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Lord. Servants to obey their Maſters, and Maſters to carry it well towards their Servants; and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to live in love with one another. Church-members to love one another as their own Souls, and obey their Rulers; and Subjects to obey their Prince. Did I not ever teach this Doctrine, viz. <hi>That all men ought to be ſubject to principalities, to obey magiſtrates, and to be ready to
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:040363_0041_101666AE910690F8"/>every good work?</hi> Tit. 3.1. And if Chriſtians, at any time, are, by their Superiours, required to do ſuch things that they conceive are contrary to the Word and Will of God, then I bid them patiently to ſuffer, and not to reſiſt, but to learn of my bleſſed Maſter, who when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, reviled not again, and when he ſuffered, he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not.</p>
               <p>But theſe Things are not the whole Cauſe of my Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but there are many other Reaſons. For,</p>
               <p>Alas, alas, what Ignorance, Blindneſs and Superſtition is in the Land; the Iſle was once famous, and ſpewed out thoſe nautious Abominations, which too many have lick'd up again: Some ſay there is no great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Service of great Babylon, and that which is in this Iſle; and that which troubles me moſt, is this, 'tis called by my Name, as if it appertained to my ancient Form, which is a great abuſe of me.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What peſtilent and poiſonous Errors and Hereſies are here, the great City ſeems like a Peſt-Houſe, where many have not only the Plague-ſores upon them, but alſo are full of the Tokens, ſad preſages of eternal Death and Wrath in Hell.</p>
               <p>How is the glory of my great Prince eclipſed, and the light of the Goſpel darkned? How is Light taken for Darkneſs, and Darkneſs for Light, Truth called Error, and Error called Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How doth Ungodlineſs vaunt himſelf, and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ride Rampant? What multitudes ſtand ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Enemy Ungodlineſs in all his travels, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he comes? the mighty bow down unto him, and nobles kindly ſalute him; both old &amp; young, rich &amp; poor adore and hug him in their Boſoms, and make him their love and chiefeſt delight; no Laws of Nature, Nations, nor of Grace, will or can deter them; nor the hopes of
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:040363_0041_101666AE910690F8"/>Heaven, nor fear of Hell, whilſt I am contemn'd, ſlighted, and trodden under their Feet.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And O! how are my friends and deareſt favourites Oppreſſed and Perſecuted abroad? Alas, alas, how low is my Prince's Intereſt brought in <hi>France,</hi> in the Vallies of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> and <hi>Saxony,</hi> and almoſt thro'-out all Nations of Europe? What diſmal Sufferings do my Nations endure under the laſt great <hi>Nimrod</hi> and bloody <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and none ſay, <hi>deliver them!</hi> Nor can they ſee an end of their Sorrows.</p>
               <p>But in the midſt of my Lamentation, the Thoughts of thoſe glorious Promiſes of God, concerning what he hath ſaid of me in the latter Days, do revive my Heart; for tho' I have few to plead my Cauſe, or to clear my Innocency, and am like to be run down by Apollyon and his ſpurious Off-ſpring; Luſt and Ungodlineſs, yet I ſee my Day is a coming <hi>when ſin ſhall be aſhamed, and iniquity ſtop her mouth,</hi> Pſal. 107.42. <hi>When the holy of the Lord ſhall be eſtemed honourable,</hi> and it ſhall be a Reproach to the Wicked. Though I am now ſlighted, I ſhall then be priſed; <hi>Jehovah</hi> will make my glory to ſhine forth in the midſt of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and my Children ſhall flouriſh in every Place; and in that Day none ſhall dare to open their Mouths againſt me, nor ſhall I need to travel up and down for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>For the knowledge of the glory of the Lord ſhall cover the earth as the waters do the ſea. In that day there ſhall be upon the bells of the horſes, holineſs unto the Lord; and the pots in the Lord's houſe ſhall be like the bowls before the altar. Yea, every pot in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall be holineſs unto the Lord of hoſts, and all they that ſacrifice ſhall come and take of them, and ſeethe therein; and in that day there ſhall be no more the Canaanite in the houſe of the Lord of hoſts,</hi> Zach. 14.20, 21. Nay, and this alſo adds to my Joy in the midſt of my Sorrow; this long'd for Day is near, and
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:040363_0042_101666B042D49C00"/>haſtens greatly; 'tis but a little while, there will be an alteration in the World, the Angel who enlightens the Earth with Glory, will ſuddenly cry, <hi>Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen,</hi> Rev. 18.2.</p>

                  <p>Sir, you err exceedingly; 'tis not your perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Righteouſneſs, no, not thro' Chriſt's Merits, that does juſtify, but the perſonal Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, received by Faith alone. Alas, now you diſcover indeed what a great Stranger you are to me; you are one of thoſe juſt Men, it ſeems, that never went aſtray; or righteous Ones, that Chriſt came not to call. Alas, I always do declare and teſtify, that all Men muſt periſh without Faith in Chriſt. Doth not the Scripture poſitively ſay, <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark 16.16. <hi>He that hath the Son, hath Life; and he that hath not the Son, ſhall not ſee Life; but the Wrath of God abides upon him,</hi> John 3.36.

                  <p>Friend, 'tis true, ſometimes when they are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as they relate to Men, they ſo ſignify; but they
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:040363_0047_1016662424B74EA8"/>are not ſo taken when attributed unto God, but do always hold forth a tranſiſtent Act, and not an immanent Act as <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.15. <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Pſal</hi> 106.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. nor can any Place be produced, relating to God, as his Act, where it is ſo taken; for it will otherwiſe aſcribe a fallible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto God, to ſay, that he imputeth not Sin to a juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Perſon; that is to ſay, he judgeth and eſteemeth them not to have ſinned, for God's Judgment is according to Truth; and therefore ſuch as have ſinned, he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as ſuch as have ſinned, and he cannot eſteem them ſuch as never did ſin, tho' if he will juſtify and pardon them, and deal with them as with ſuch as have not ſinned; and in this ſenſe he imputeth it not to them whom he juſtifies, and actually pardoneth; to juſtify or acquit a Sinner, implies he was before guilty and condemned; and that thus it was with all the Elect, before they were united to Chriſt. The Word of God teſtifieth, and ſo doth the Holy Ghoſt, alſo by Convictions, when he firſt works upon the Hearts and Conſciences of Sinners; therefore your Notion charges the Holy Ghoſt to be a liar.</p>

                  <p>That which doth ſecure Men from Wrath, and whereby they are diſcharged and acquitted from their Sins is Juſtification; and by this immanent act of God all the Elect are diſcharged and acquitted from their Sins, and ſecure from Wrath and Hell.</p>

                  <p>You do not argue well, I ſhall diſtinguiſh upon your firſt Propoſition, <hi>i. e.</hi> that which doth ſecure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, actually, fully, and formerly from Wrath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other cauſe intervening, is Juſtification; but I deny that Election doth preſently, (as an immanent Act in God) actually fully and formerly diſcharge the Elect from Sin, Guilt and Wrath; no, it is but a purpoſe in God ſo to do, were they not really guilty or charged from
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:040363_0048_101666C5599FDC38"/>eternity, or did not God as much decree to charge his Elect with Sin, as he decreed alſo in and thro' Chriſt, to acquit, juſtify or pronounce them diſcharged and free from Guilt, Sin and Wrath. Sir, the Elect are born in Sin, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath by Nature, which they could not be, if their Perſons were juſtified from eternity, and ſo continue until Effectual Calling: Alſo was not the Death of Chriſt a neceſſary cauſe intervening between this Degree and their Diſcharge, for which they are diſcharged, and without which they could not ſo be? and doth not the Work of the Spirit, in uniting them to Chriſt, intervene alſo? You muſt therefore diſtinguiſh betwixt God's Decree and the execution of them.</p>
                  <p>Election &amp; the Death of Chriſt, 'tis true, ſecures them from the execution of God's Wrath, but it did not ſecure them from falling under the Sentence of his vindictive Wrath and Juſtice, and 'tis true, Sin ſhall not be imputed to them, to their Damnation in Hell; Election ſecures them from that, therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?</hi> Rom. 8.34. he ſpeaks of ſuch of them that are in Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. or are effectually called, <hi>ver.</hi> 29, 30. namely Elect Believers; for you dare not deny but the Law of God doth lay heavy things to their Charge before, and what the Law of God doth, God himſelf doth.</p>

                  <p>I will forbear to ſhew the great Abſurdities of your Notion; 'tis well known what vile Effects it hath had on ſome Perſons of late.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friend,</hi> I deny Faith to be any Cauſe or Condition of Juſtification to be performed by the Creature, and ſuch as do aſſert it is, I diſlike, as much as I diſlike you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="unknown:040363_0048_101666C5599FDC38"/>
Faith is the Inſtrument I do own, by which (when the Spirit is inſufed into the Soul) the Creature receives Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, yet the Spirit (or rather Chriſt by the Spirit) I affirm does apprehend the Sinner, before the Sinner can, by Faith apprehend Chriſt, tho' the Union is not mutual or compleat, until the Soul is reconciled to God, as well as God is reconciled unto the Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friend,</hi> dare you ſay, that actual Juſtification of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is without Faith? you may (ſhould you ſo ſay) affirm Men have life in them, who never eat Chriſt's Fleſh, nor drink his Blood, which the Lord Chriſt ſays poſitively they have not, nor can have. Friend, were the Iſraelites who were ſtung with fiery Serpents, heal'd before they look'd up to the Brazen Serpent, and were they to look up unto it, only to know they were healed, for ſo your Notion teacheth Men to believe.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Doth not a vital Union with Chriſt make a relative Change, as well as a real Change?</p>
                  <p>Or, Are the Elect no otherwiſe dead in Sin and Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes by Nature, and Children of Wrath, but in their own Conſciences? How then is it ſaid, they were ſo as others are, by Nature <hi>Children of Wrath?</hi> And muſt not Miniſters preach the Goſpel to all, as undone, naked and miſerable Sinners; and affirm they are condemn'd, and the Wrath of God abides upon them, and on all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not in Chriſt: Or, Sir, are juſtified Perſons naked? or do you ſee your Error?</p>

                  <p>You are ſuch, who expoſe me and my Friends to Reproach, your Doctrine, alas, tends to Looſeneſs and
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:040363_0049_101666C895040CF8"/>Ungodlineſs. I alſo hear that your Preachers never pray for Pardon of Sin, and alſo tollerate ignorant People to rend themſelves from the true Churches of Chriſt, and will hardly allow any to be true Miniſters but themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of your Communion I ſee are juſt like the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> i. e. encreaſed in goods and have need of nothing in their own ſight, not poor in Spirit; for it doth not appear 'tis ſo, when your haughty Preachers are ſo full, that they need not confeſs their Sins, nor aſk Pardon of God? for it ſeems ſome of them never do this.</p>
                  <p>What tho' Believers, as to vindictive Wrath and Juſtice, are pardoned for ever, as to all Sins paſt, preſent and to come, muſt they not therefore beg Forgiveneſs? may they not deſire God to impute Chriſt's Righteoſneſs to them, becauſe they believe God doth do it? and may they not alſo pray that God would paſs by their common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, as a tender Father, and chaſten them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Friend, is not that an evil Notion, that renders Sin in the Elect, a ſmall and trivial Thing in the Sight of God? Nay, that he ſees no Sin in them, nor doth regard it at all; and this becauſe he doth not ſee it, as to let out his vindictive Juſtice againſt them for it, or doth not require ſatisfaction for it at their Hands, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them in the Righteouſneſs of his Son.</p>
                  <p>But doth it from hence follow he is not offended with them for their Sins, and as a diſpleaſed and grieved Father, will not chaſtiſe them? Certainly your Notion opens a Door to Looſeneſs and Licentiouſneſs, which is againſt my Nature and very Being; Friend, I know, what your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions are; but I will leave you, and at this time talk no more with you.</p>

                     <hi>Conſcience</hi> I thank you, you ſpeak like an honeſt Man, and indeed I have always found you impartial, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Light. I will then give you ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this ſubtil and deceitful Enemy of mine, that you cannot well miſtake; and this I ſhall do, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding a few Queſtions to you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sir, Was he ever thoroughly wounded in the Senſe of Sin, as 'tis Sin, being convinced of the ugly and abominable Nature thereof; there being nothing in all the World more hateful to God than that, not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Evil which does attend it, or is the Fruit of it, but alſo of that curſed Evil there is in it, it being utterly contrary to the holy and pure Nature of God, a Breach of his Law, and that which hath made a Breach between God and Man, and baſety defaced the Image of God if him, and is the abſolute Cauſe of all that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Enmity that is in his Heart againſt God and me his bleſſed Off-ſpring; and alſo makes Man in love with the
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:040363_0052_101666D253FA0F38"/>Ways of the Devil, nay, to be like the Devil, conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, and to do his Will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Is there no one Sin that he ſecretly loves and lives in, (the evil Habits never being broken?) Have you found him now and then telling a Lie for his Advantage Sake, or in telling of Tales or Stories, adding to them, to pleaſe the Company, or to excuſe himſelf when accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of this or that, that ſo he may gain Credit? Is he not ſometimes overtaken by Drunkenneſs? Is he not proud, minding more the Honour, Praiſe, and Applauſe of Men in what he doth in Religion, than the Praiſe of God? Is he not Covetous? Doth he give according to his Ability to the Poor? Doth he not rob God to ſerve the World? I mean neglect hearing of God's Word, and other indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Duties, for worldly Profit Sake, and ſo prefer the World above the Word? Doth he never in Trading offend you, in ſpeaking better of his Commodities than they deſerve? Is not the World more in his Love and Affections than God and Jeſus Chriſt? Does he always give good and juſt Weight and Meaſure, and not take unlawful Profit? Doth he not make Gain of Godlineſs, and uſe Religion as a Cloak, to cover his ſecret Sins; doth he concern himſelf for the Intereſt of the Goſpel, and his open-heartedneſs ſhew upon that account he loves Chriſt above Son or Daughter? Is he reſolved to part with all rather than to ſin againſt God &amp; to offend his Conſcience Doth he ſee more evil in the leaſt Sin, than in the greateſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Sufferings?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Doth he deſire as much to have his Sins mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified as pardoned? To be made holy here, as well as happy hereafter? is he as much in love with the Work of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as with the Wages of holineſs? Doth he love the Word of God becauſe of the purity of it? Is he willing to bear the Croſs as well as wear the Crown? To be with
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:040363_0052_101666D253FA0F38"/>Chriſt in his Exaltations hereafter? To live to God on Earth, as well as to live with God in Heaven?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Is he the ſame in private as in publick? Doth he not reſt ſatisfied upon the bare performance of Duty, not minding whether he hath met with God or not? Doth he Pray in publick, as if Men ſaw him, and in private, as knowing God ſees him? Doth not his ſatisfaction more lie in his aſking of God; than in his receiving from God? Does he not ſeek more for ſuitable Words in Prayer, than for a ſuitable Heart? Doth he not ſtudy more for acute expreſſions to affect the Hearts of others, than to meet with powerful Impreſſions upon his own? Doth he not lengthen his Prayers before others, and hurry them over in private? Doth he as much endeavour after what he needs from God, as that which he needs of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Can he bear Reproofs kindly for his Faults, and take them patiently? Nay, and eſteem him his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Friend, who deals moſt cordially with him? Is he ready to take ſhame to himſelf, and give glory to God? Can he be contented in the Ways of God, though he meets with little ſenſible comfort from God, nor outward reſpect from Saints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Doth he as much deſire to have his Heart filled with Grace, as his Head with Knowledge? Doth he take as much care to make the Glory of God his end in what he hath, as the Command of God his ground in what he doth?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly;</hi> Is he not more ſevere in preſſing the leſſer concerns of Religion, than in urging the greater? Doth he not require thoſe Duties of others, which he himſelf is loth to practice? Is he not more curious to know other Men's Conditions than his own?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Hath he received a whole Chriſt with a whole Heart? <hi>Firſt,</hi> A whole Chriſt comprehends all his Offices,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:040363_0053_101666D56C1654C8"/>and a whole Heart comprehends all his Faculties? Hath he received Chriſt, not only as a Prieſt, to die for him, but alſo as a Prince, to rule over him? Doth he obey all God's Precepts, as well as believe all God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes? <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to his Faculties, his Underſtanding may be ſomewhat enlightened, but his Affections may be Carnal, and his Will oppoſe me, being averſe to true Godlineſs? Is not his Heart divided? Come Conſcience, I do now command you, in the preſence of the great and dreadful GOD, who ſearches all Hearts, to make a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Deciſion; tell me plainly, is my Enemy <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> here or no? By theſe brief Hints you may eaſily know him.</p>

He loves the face of Holineſs, but is without the Grace of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; his greateſt Care hath been to Waſh the out-ſide of his Platter: If he can but keep his Name from being reproached by Men, he cares not tho' his Heart be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly defiled before God. Should I tell you of all thoſe Luſts which he harbours in his Heart, and what Favour he ſhews to that old Man, (you mentioned before) I ſhould quite ſhame him; he is a Saint indeed abroad, but a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then (to ſay no worſe) at home, he Prays, Hears and Reads, but 'tis to keep up his Credit. Name and Eſteem amongſt many Chriſtian Men of this Town; for I have often found him very weary of theſe Duties, God knows as well as I; nay, Sir, he would ſeldom Pray at all, were it not to quiet me, for he doth not love my Laſhes; beſides, he performs them with a ſad, cold, dead, carnal and lifeleſs Spirit; he is much for the leſſer Things of Religion, (as you minded) he keeps a mighty ſtir about <hi>Mint, Aniſe</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> but quite neglects the greater and more weighty Things; nay, there is one thing more I will tell you, as he does not love
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:040363_0053_101666D56C1654C8"/>ſtrict Godlineſs himſelf, ſo his Heart is ready to riſe againſt all ſuch, who out-do him. Sir, he is a meer Diſſembler, yet he would be tho't as religious a Man as any in Town: I find him alſo much abroad, finding of Faults of others, or eſpying the Mote that is in his Brother's Eye, but never minds the Beam that is in his own; nay, and he is ready to fall out with many good Chriſtians, becauſe they will not follow him in Habit, Mode and Geſture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a Word, moſt of all thoſe black marks of this deceitful Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> you hinted at, I find in him.</p>

                     <hi>Conſcience,</hi> ſay no more, I ſee I was not miſtaken; but now <hi>Formaliſt,</hi> are not you a Wretch, to pretend kindneſs to me, and ſecretly thus to entertain one of my worſt Enemies? Sir, 'tis you who have brought ſo great a Reproach upon this poor Town Religion, and on all its Inhabitants; nay, and 'tis through your means I am ſo baſely vilified &amp; condemned by that blind fellow <hi>Ignorance,</hi> for he is ready to conclude, that all my friends and true favourites are ſuch as your ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> meer looſe and formal Hypocrites, beſides, you are like to be undone, and periſh for ever, unleſs you do the ſooner turn this vile Enemy of mine out of Doors; for I expect no other but that you will in a little time fall into Apoſtacy: But ſhould you die firſt, yet aſſure your ſelf you will be damned; for Hell is indeed prepared for ſuch as you are; you are, poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! in the worſt Condition of all Men: For the wicked hate you becauſe you pretend ſo much love to Religion and Godlineſs; God alſo, becauſe you are not real, but only pretend love to them, being not ſincere and upright in your Profeſſion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Formaliſt</hi> at this began to be very angry, being greatly offended at true Godlineſs, for he could not endure to ſee his State ript open, nor did he like to hear of his preſent nor future Miſery; being perſwaded by Mr. Vain-hope.
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:040363_0054_101666D7038104B8"/>Unbelief and Good-opinion, to think his Condition, but for this, might be ſafe enough; however Vain-hope told him, though at preſent his State might be doubtful, yet he ſhould have many Days on Earth, and that he might Repent, and ſet all Things right before he died; whoſe Word and Promiſe he adventured to take; and ſo bid true Godlineſs adieu, and no Man's State in all his travels, he did indeed more lament, and his Soul being almoſt overwhelmed with Sorrow, he broke out to this purpoſe, and departed.</p>

                  <l>Thou ſuffer'ſt here, and yet muſt go to Hell.</l>

               <argument>
                  <p>Shewing how <hi>Godlineſs</hi> travelling farther into the Town, (called <hi>Religion</hi>) ſaw abundance of People, who had been great Profeſſors, getting away out of the Town as faſt as they could. Shewing alſo what Diſcourſe he had with one of them; wherein the Nature and Danger of <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> is plainly opened.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>GOdlineſs</hi> had no ſooner left <hi>Formaliſt</hi>'s Door, and gone a little further into the Town <hi>Religion,</hi> but he eſpied a great Number of People haſtning out as faſt as they could go; nay, he obſerved ſome of them ran, though others of them went very ſoftly: At firſt he wonder'd what the Matter was, becauſe the Town was a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look'd upon to be a very ſafe and honourable Place to dwell in, as any in all the Country, and had as great and glorious Privileges belonging to it; but upon Enquiry, he was told there was a Number of Lions, ravening Wolves, and other evil Beaſts, (who had for a long Time been ſhut up in their Dens) a getting out, and they having a great while been kept without Prey, they were afraid they ſhould be torn in Pieces: But he obſerving which Way they went,<note place="margin">Babylon's <hi>Fall</hi> very nigh.</note> was the more amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for he perceived plainly they all ſteer'd their Courſe directly towards the great City <hi>Babylon,</hi> which he ſaw likewiſe a falling and was ſure would ſuddenly in one Hour be utterly deſtroy'd.</p>

                  <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> at this ſeemed ſo mightily concerned, that he could not let them all paſs without ſpeaking to them; and minding one of them to look like a ſober Man, tho' he hung down his Head as if he had been aſhamed, reſolved to have a little Diſcourſe with him, (whoſe Name it ſeems was <hi>Apoſtate</hi>) to whom he ſpake after this Manner.</p>

Beſides, your flying mightily encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages the Adverſaries; for by this means they may think to frighten all out, and then with much eaſe take the Town, and utterly deſtroy it: Alſo you weaken the Hands, and ſadly grieve the Hearts of all true Proteſtants, whoſe chief Treaſure lies in the Town, and cannot be removed out; and it being alſo their ſpiritual Native Place, they reſolve to abide in it to the laſt, let what will come. You ſay you intend to return again when the Danger is over. What Dangers you ſee above others, to move you to quit the Town, I know not; but let me tell you, few who leave this Town, out of fear of human Loſs or Danger, do Return again.</p>

                  <p>Poor Wretch, you own the Principles of the true Religion, and yet cleave to Idolatry and Superſtition.

               <argument>
                  <p>Shewing how <hi>Godlineſs</hi> coming to one <hi>Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>'s Houſe, found there his Friend <hi>Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> whom he had a long Time ſought for; alſo the great Oppoſition <hi>Conſideration</hi> met withal.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>GOdlineſs</hi> being not without Hopes of finding ſerious Conſideration (for ſo ſometimes he is called) in or near this Place, chanc'd to knock (as you heard before) at a Man's Door, who was newly come to dwell in the Town Religion. Now, this Perſon formerly (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears): had been a very great Enemy to true Godlineſs, having liv'd a grievous looſe and profuſe Life, and like the poor Prodigal, waſted all his chiefeſt Subſtance. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs had not long knock'd and call'd at his Door before he liſtned to him, and ſpake within himſelf to this purpoſe. Who is this that is come to my Door? ſure, ſaid he, this is a Voice different from any I ever heard in my Life; and he doth not knock alſo as others uſe to do: At laſt he cried out, who is there? ho is it that is at my Door? your Name Sir?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Godli.</hi> Soul, Chriſt is at thy Door, and I his noble and renowned Off-ſpring, True Godlineſs. Doſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Word, <hi>Behold I ſtand at the Door, and knock,</hi> Rev. 3.20. Sir, now I will aſk you the like Queſtion, pray what is your Name? I hope I am come to the right Door.</p>
               <p>He told him his Name might very well be called looſe and ungodly <hi>Prodigal;</hi> for (ſaid he) I have hitherto liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:040363_0058_1016682FD9F6ED48"/>a very wicked Life: But ſome call me of late <hi>Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> becauſe I am (bleſſed be God) newly come to my ſelf, by thinking upon my latter End, and the Evil of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Godli.</hi> But why doſt thou chooſe to take up thy Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in this Village now, when ſo many are going out?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoughtful.</hi> Sir, 'tis becauſe I hear it is the beſt Town in all the Country to ſecure a Man from Danger in evil Times, provided I can but get a Place in one of its ſtrong Holds in the Heart of the Town: For I hear there is no ſafe dwelling at the Town's End, no, nor any where in the Suburbs.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I was told lately, that <hi>Babylon,</hi> where I have dwelt 'till of late, will ſuddenly be deſtroyed: I do it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to ſave my own Soul; I am, Sir, deſirous to find out (if it may be) where true Peace, Happineſs, and eternal Felicity is to be had; For I ſee they are not to be found in thoſe Paths in which I formerly walked; I mean in the Ways of Riches, Honour, and the Pleaſures of this World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Godli.</hi> I commend thee, honeſt <hi>Thoughtful;</hi> thou haſt done wiſely, and like a conſiderate Man; prithee let me come in and dwell with thee, and thou wilt find this poor Town the moſt ſafe and moſt ſecure Place in theſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Times, in all the World. Sir, I have wandered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a long Time, travelling from Place to Place, to ſeek for one whom I bear much Good-Will to, but hitherto I have not found him; his Name is <hi>Conſideration;</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Things more he ſaid, to make him in Love with <hi>True Godlineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this, <hi>Conſideration,</hi> who it ſeems was within, whiſpers <hi>Thoughtful</hi> in his Ear, and ſaid, This is he that can alone make thee happy, if he be readily, ſincerely, and heartily embraced and entertained. Is it not good for thee to muſe upon the Worth and excellent Nature of
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:040363_0059_101668324FFACA30"/>thy Soul? Thou art made a Man, &amp; therefore for a nobler and higher End and Imployment (ſure) than eating and drinking, ſleeping and playing, and wholly to mind thy Trade and ſecular Affairs, and to enjoy ſenſual Pleaſures, (a Happineſs which Beaſts arrive to as well as thee) for this glorious Soul which lies in thy Boſom, is capable of knowing God, and of enjoying Union and Communion with him for ever; ſo that all thoſe who ſuffer the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Profits, and Pleaſures of the World, to take up and engroſs their Hearts, go aſtray, and err from the great End of their Creation. Alas, there is nothing that can fill the Deſires of thy Soul, or be its Summum Bonum, but God himſelf: Thou haſt hitherto ſuffered thy Affections and Deſires to run after whatſoever thou couldeſt think might yield thee true Felicity; but it is evident there is nothing thou canſt find here below, that can ſatisfy thy thirſty and ever craving Soul.</p>

                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then as to what he was a doing, he bid him ſee if he did not neglect that one Thing needful. Have you, ſaid Conſideration, made Religion your chief Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſince you came to live in this Place? Have you not rather ſpent too much of your Time about Notions and airy Speculations?</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whither are you a going? ſaid he: Are you fit (being well prepared) to die? Are you going the Way to Heaven? Sure that cannot be, unleſs you receive True Godlineſs: For I have heard that it conſiſts in a right Faith, as well as a holy Life. Oh what Coſt, Labour, Pains, Means, Motives, and Arguments, hath God uſed to make Men ſenſible of the everlaſting Intereſt of their Souls, and to engage them to a ſerious Preparation for another World.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And this ſerious Preparation muſt neceſſarily be a thoro' Work of Regeneration, Faith and ſpotleſs Converſation; for the Nature of the Means (ſaith he) muſt ever be ſuitable and agreeable to the nature of the end. And Heaven being a holy place, nothing but perfect Holineſs reigning there, ſo it will be impoſſible to enter into it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, without a conſiderable Progreſs was made in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here; and that it was not to be tho't a Man could reach to the higheſt ſtep of a Ladder without aſcending the lowermoſt firſt. Who (ſaid he) ever hoped for a Crop of Corn without Sowing any? or expected to Reap Wheat and ſowed nothing but Tares?</p>
               <p>He laid alſo before him the Nature and Holineſs of God, his infinite Hatred of Sin, and great Severity againſt all
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:040363_0060_10166835519A64B8"/>unbelieving and impenitent Souls, together with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Knowledge he had of the Hearts, Thoughts and Ways of the Children of Men; likewiſe his dreadful Judgments, Commands, Threats, and precious Promiſes.</p>
               <p>He brought to his Mind alſo the Evil of Sin, ſhewing him what an abominable Thing it was for Man to ſeek to pleaſe, obey, and do the Will of the Devil, and offend, diſobey, and croſs the Will of God. Nay, and he began to ſpeak of the Excellency of True Godlineſs alſo, and what he ſhould gain by embracing him, and letting Chriſt and the Spirit of Chriſt, Chriſt and the Grace of Chriſt, Chriſt and True Godlineſs reign in his Heart. Nay he had ſo much to ſay, that had he not been oppoſed and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſtructed (with ſome other Help) <hi>Thoughtful</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently opened the Door to <hi>True Godlineſs:</hi> But, alas, on a ſudden there was great Diſturbance in the Houſe, and poor <hi>Conſideration</hi> went to the Walls, and was almoſt utterly expell'd his Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>Now the Enemies he met with were theſe; <hi>Difficulty, Sloth, Deficiency, Security, Danger, Worldly-Cares</hi> and <hi>Carnal Company:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The chiefeſt Enemies to <hi>Conſideration.</hi>
                  </note> Theſe and many other Enemies appeared to obſtruct and hinder Conſideration about this important Buſineſs of opening to True Godlineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, Difficulty</hi> ſpoke after this Manner: Sir, Do not trouble your ſelf to find out theſe great Myſteries of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Godlineſs, for it is a Work too hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for you to underſtand, there is nothing in the World more abſtruſe and myſterious; therefore to muſe upon them, would be loſt Labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sloth</hi> told him, it was laborious and toilſome Work, and it would be great Weariſomneſs to him, if the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty did not make it impoſſible.</p>

                  <pb n="115" facs="unknown:040363_0060_10166835519A64B8"/>
                  <hi>Deficiency</hi> ſaid, he was a Man of a weak Underſtanding, and thoſe Things were Matters for the Learned and moſt knowing Men of all to Study, nay, and that many of them too, notwithſtanding all their profound Learning, profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and ſkill in the Tongues, could hardly attain to the right Knowledge of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Security</hi> endeavoured to make it appear his Condition was very good and ſafe now, and that he had Religion and Godlineſs enough, without troubling himſelf farther, and that he exceeded in Holineſs many Men that had lived long in the Town. Moreover, he told him, that he had followed the Counſel of Conſideration too much already.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Danger</hi> too ſpoke ſeveral Things. 1. That to give place to him, would let in his Enemy <hi>Melancholly,</hi> which might endanger his Life. Do not you ſee (ſaith he) how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable this Fellow <hi>Conſideration</hi> has made many brave Men, cauſing them, by thinking on their latter Ends, to hang down their Heads like a Bull-ruſh, fold their Arms and ſpend their Days in Tears and Weeping; hearken not to him, for he will certainly infuſe ſad Thoughts into your Mind, and give you nothing but Gall and Vinegar to Drink. 2. He ſaid moreover, <hi>Conſideration</hi> had made many Men go beſides themſelves; and if he did adhere to him, about this Affair, he would be diſtracted. 3. He infinuated alſo, that if he did ſeriouſly muſe upon this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or give Place to Conſideration, ſo that Godlineſs came to be let in, he would be undone, and utterly ruin'd, the Times are ſuch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Worldly-Cares</hi> proved as great an Enemy to <hi>Conſideration</hi> as any of them, for he could not ſeriouſly muſe, nor think upon Eternity, or the preſent Condition his poor Soul was in; he was ſo hurried in his Mind about the Affairs of this Life: Nay, no ſooner at any Seaſon that he ſet himſelf to ruminate or ponder them in his Mind, but worldly Cares would expell and drive ſuch Thoughts away.</p>

               <p>Jollities are, as one obſerves, much like <hi>Attila</hi>'s Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, whoſe Wedding-Day proved his Funeral. Who would hazard an Eternity of Joy for a Moments Time of vain and empty Pleaſures? None can rejoice ſo heartily as he that hath God for his Portion, and hath his Name written in Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſideration</hi> will let thee ſee, that whatſoever vain Men may ſay, prate and boaſt of, touching Joy and Pleaſures, yet there is no Delight and Felicity like that which is found in the Ways of true Virtue; that Godlineſs is the beſt Security, and that the Joy of the whole Earth is Mount <hi>Sion;</hi> that in this Garden are the ſweeteſt Roſes, the moſt oderiferous Flowers, the moſt fragrant Plants, Roſes which have no Prickles underneath, (nor like carnal Delights) whoſe Flowers fade and wither away; nor like the frothy Mirth, which the Laughter of Fools affords.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſideration</hi> would let thee ſee, that thoſe ſerious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who look dejected and melancholly to a carnal Eye, have Joy within, which no Stranger intermeddles with; and as little as they make of Chearfulneſs, yet they carry in their Breaſt that which can make their Life a perpetual Jubilee.</p>

                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> As to what thy old Companions lay before thee to render me odious, if thou mind or regard then, adieu for ever: They that hate Seriouſneſs themſelves, muſt needs diſlike it in others: Theſe are the Devil's Agents, whom he ſends abroad into the World to deflower Virtue, theſe are his Factors, by whom he draws Men into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Chains of Darkneſs; theſe ſtrive to put me <hi>(True God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs)</hi> into a Wolf's Skin, that they may ſet all the Dogs in the Town upon me. This Age hath bred more Monſters of Wickedneſs than many Ages before it. Shun keeping Company with theſe Scoffers and Contemners of true God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, for the Lord's ſake. As thou art come into the Town of Religion, ſo let the truly Religious be thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who will, inſtead of hindring, help ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. What Ground is there to think a Man will mind the true Intereſt of his Soul, that keeps Company with Perſons who make a Sport and May-game of ſerious Conſideration? He that would keep his Garden and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Flowers ſecurely, muſt be ſure, whatever he does, to keep out the Hogs: What is he that keeps Company with Sinners, but a Companion of Sinners? And Society in Sin ſtrangely takes off the Mind from the Heinouſneſs of it: Alſo Men may judge of a Perſon by the Company he keeps; as is a Man's Company, ſuch is the Man; and as is his Company here, ſuch it is like to be hereafter.

Nay, in a Word, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God is made to him, <hi>If you follow on to know the Lord, then you ſhall know him.</hi> 'Tis this diligent, painful Perſon that makes Men (with God's Bleſſing) rich, I mean ſpiritually rich: And this I muſt tell thee too, he can do nothing of himſelf; do not think that he can open the

Upon this he became very diligent in attending upon all the Means of Grace.

If you be found in your own Righteouſneſs, you will be loſt by your own Unrighteouſneſs. Duties can never have too much of your Diligence, nor too little of your Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; 'tis not the ſalt Seas of thy own Tears, but the red Sea of Chriſt's Blood muſt waſh away thy Sins.

If you have no better Righteouſneſs than what is of your own providing, you will meet with no higher Happineſs than what is of your own deſerving; you muſt take up Duties in Point of Performance, but lay them all down again in Point of Dependance.

                  <p>Upon this a melancholly and very dangerous Fellow (called <hi>Deſpond</hi>) fell upon him, and almoſt knock'd him down; nay, I perceived he broke ſome of his Bones, wounding him ſo grievouſly, that he was left bleeding in ſuch a Manner, that he concluded there was no Hope of Life.

                  <p>Poor <hi>Thoughtful,</hi> do not give Way to <hi>Apollyon,</hi> that curſed Prince of Darkneſs, for 'tis he who hath ſtirred up that cruel Enemy <hi>Deſpond</hi> to take away thy Life; that bloody Villain hath ſent many thouſand Souls to Hell. Come, though thy own Righteouſneſs is worth nothing, but like filthy Rags, yet Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is ſufficient to cover thee, and his Blood to heal all thy Wounds. Your great Buſineſs is to believe, <hi>viz.</hi> Wholly to get out of your ſelf, and rely upon Chriſt's bleſſed Merits; and know aſſuredly, that that very Moment you caſt your ſelf, by a lively Act of Faith upon Jeſus Chriſt, I ſhall come into your Houſe.</p>

O know poor <hi>Thoughtful,</hi> that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs hath more worth in it to ſave you, and raiſe you up to Heaven, than your own unrighteouſneſs has weight to caſt you down to Hell. You ſay you are a great, a black, and bloody Sinner, but you can be but a Sinner; and Chriſt died for Sinners; and never any threw themſelves by an Act of true Faith upon him, but were ſaved by him; alas, he died for the chiefeſt of Sinners; and do you not hear him ſay, <hi>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt,</hi> Mat. 11.28. Sir, <hi>He that believes not, make God a Liar,</hi> for he hath ſaid in his Son, <hi>There is Life and Salvation for</hi> you, <hi>and all that come to God by him.</hi>

                  <p>No ſooner had <hi>Godlineſs</hi> ſhewed him what it was to open the Door, and laid before him the Neceſſity of Union with Chriſt, and of Faith in him, but <hi>Apollyon,</hi> with the <hi>Old-Man,</hi> and other curſed Enemies, began to cauſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Combuſtions in his Houſe; for nothing doth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil fear more than true Faith; and <hi>Thoughtful</hi> found it very hard to believe, <hi>Wilful-Will</hi> being ſuch a ſtubborn, crooked and perverſe Fellow; alſo <hi>Apollyon</hi> tryed his Skill many other Ways to undo him, ſo that he was hard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet; but when <hi>Apollyon</hi> ſaw none of thoſe Ways were like to do, he laid before him the outward Danger he would be in, if <hi>true Godlineſs</hi> was embraced; he told him, he was like to ſuffer great Perſecution, it being the Portion of all who entertain <hi>true Godlineſs,</hi> inſomuch that his very Life might be in Danger; but Godlineſs comforted him ſweetly, with many precious Promiſes, telling him alſo he had ſuch a glorious Retinue to attend him, which he would bring into his Houſe with him, that he need not fear any Difficulty, provided that he would but let him in; but
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:040363_0072_1016686102859D58"/>he ſeeing he was not able to open the Door, his Enemies being too ſtrong for him, notwithſtanding his own Strength, to his Joy he told him, there was one Friend of his, whom, if he could prevail with to come to his Aſſiſtance, he would ſoon make the Way clear, and open the Door. Who is that, ſaid <hi>Thoughtful? Godlineſs</hi> then diſcovered immediately the Excellency of his Perſon, and the Nature of his Operation, by which he ſoon underſtood it was the Holy Ghoſt; upon this he was not a little glad, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently cried out as one whoſe Life is in Danger, to God to ſend the Holy Spirit to aſſiſt him, O Lord, the Spirit, the Holy Spirit, now Lord! Thus he cried, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there was ſtrange Strugglings indeed, (the Holy Spirit working upon all the Faculties of his Soul) yea, ſuch a Conflict that he never met with in all his Life; <hi>Judgment</hi> in the Combat behaved himſelf bravely; <hi>Conſideration</hi> was not wanting; <hi>Conſcience</hi> laid on home Blows, being back'd with <hi>Endeavour,</hi> alias <hi>Labourious:</hi> In the Beginning of the Battle, the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> came in, and with him <hi>Faith,</hi> and other of <hi>Godlineſs</hi>'s Attendants, and the Door flew open, and <hi>Old-Man</hi> immediately went to the Wall, crying out for Quarter, pleading his great Age, but had no Mercy ſhewed him. <hi>Wilful Will</hi> ſtrait-way ſubjected himſelf (that Scripture being made good, <hi>My People ſhall be willing in the Day of my Power</hi>) and became <hi>Thoughtful</hi>'s very good Servants. <hi>Carnal-Affections</hi> chang'd their Mind, and were made heavenly; and ſo they abode, to his great Joy, until his dying Day.</p>
                  <p>True Godlineſs being now entred into his Houſe, with his Attendants, <hi>Thoughtful</hi> was not a little comforted. Now Godlineſs's Retinue, who came in with him, were theſe following, (ſome of which you had an Account of before) <hi>viz.

<pb n="145" facs="unknown:040363_0075_10166868B408D0E8"/>Riches and Honour he had arrived at, by his late embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing True Godlineſs, remained very ſad and melancholly, being attended with many deſponding Cogitations, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving not only the great Diſtreſſes and Troubles which his Wife and Children were like to meet with in this World, but alſo what ſad, unſettled, and unhappy Days he was fallen into, and of the abounding Evils and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Blaſphemies which ſtar'd him in the Face where-ever he came; together with the low and deplorable Condition the Church of Chriſt and true Religion was in, in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Hour; which Godlineſs perceiving, told him of one <hi>Contentment,</hi> whom he ſaw he had not yet found; and that if he could but obtain that Favour, to perſwade him to dwell with him, his Mind would remain ſweetly ſettled and compoſed, and that he would enjoy all the Calmneſs and Serenity of Soul imaginable, being delivered from all anxious Thoughts, about the preſent and ſuture Events of Things, and undergo all Croſſes and harſheſt Accidents with Equanimity and Acquieſcence of Spirit, wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting unto, and being fully ſatisfied with the divine Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. Now, this glorious, noble and renowned Prince <hi>Contentment</hi> had been, it ſeems, travelling from Place to Place, like a poor Pilgrim, as True Godlineſs had done, ſeeking a fit reſting Place, but could find none; for he had been to viſit Riches, but no Dwelling there; and Poverty alſo, but found no Lodging there; with Youth he could find no abode; and Old-Age was a Stranger to him; Pleaſure could give him no Entertainment; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours were forced to ſay, I know thee not; he was not lodged in the Prince's Palace, nor in the Peaſant's Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; the unmarried ſought him, but could not find him; and the married wiſh'd for him, but there was no abiding for him there neither; for none of all theſe States and ſimple Conditions of Men could yield perfect Peace, Content
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:040363_0076_1016686B91C19010"/>and Sincerity of Mind; but <hi>Thoughtful</hi> hearing Godlineſs ſpeaking of him, that he was uſed to dwell with him, or where he took up his Lodging, ſent preſently his old Friend Conſideration to ſeek out for him, and by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, it was not long before he found him; yet for the Information of my thinking Reader, I ſhall ſhew thee a Way how Conſideration, by the Aſſiſtance of Faith, met with him, and brought him home to his dear Maſter <hi>Thoughtful Chriſtian,</hi> and made him his fixt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſideration led him forth to ponder upon the divine Attributes, Providences, and Promiſes of God; he cauſed him to conſult infinite Power, Wiſdom, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſciency, Holineſs, Mercy, Goodneſs, Truth, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> He alſo ſtirred him up to ſeek for Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by pondering upon his preſent State and Condition. What (ſaith he) hath God done for thee? Thou waſt in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and Bond of Iniquity, and God hath brought thee out, and yet not content! Thou waſt a Child of Wrath, and now art a Child of God, yet not content! Haſt thou God for thy God, Chriſt for thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the Holy Spirit for thy Comforter, and yet not content! Nay, Doth God, Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit dwell with thee, and yet not content! Haſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived True Godlineſs's glorious Retinue into thy Houſe, to abide with thee, to enrich thee, to ſtrengthen thee, to comfort thee, and make thy Life ſweet to thee, and yet not content! Are thy Sins pardoned, thy Soul juſtified, haſt thou Union and Communion with the Father and Son, and yet not content! Is thy Name writ in the Book of Life? Shalt thou dwell with God and Chriſt for ever? Is Heaven thy Inheritance? Art thou an Heir of the Crown and Kingdom that fadeth not away, and yet not
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:040363_0076_1016686B91C19010"/>content? Nay, let me tell thee, all theſe Things, and many more are abſolutely thine with contentment. Come art thou willing to poſſeſs them, to make them thine own, and enjoy them for ever, yea or no? If thou wouldeſt be ſure of them, then get contentment to dwell with thee? For <hi>Godlineſs with contentment is great gain,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.6. It doth not ſay Godlineſs without contentment, but with contentment. 'Tis this glorious Prince it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, who puts thee into the preſent Poſſeſſion of all true Happineſs, and yet not content.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Ponder, ſaith Conſideration upon the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Contentment; for a Saint never looks like himſelf, acts like himſelf, acts like a Perſon of ſuch Rank and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, a Perſon who hath received ſo many glorious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Graces and Priviledges, but when in all Conditions he is therewith content.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Ponder, ſaith Conſideration, upon the Evils of Diſcontent; Oh what Diſhonour doth it bring unto God! What Reproach to true Godlineſs? And what great Wrong to thy own Soul?</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> 'Tis below thy Chriſtian Relation, ſaith Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to be Diſcontent: It was the Speech of <hi>Jonadab</hi> to <hi>Amon, Why art thou, being a King's Son, lean from Day to Day?</hi> But that was (as one obſerves) for a wicked Cauſe? He ſaw his Spirit was troubled, for otherwiſe he was fat enough. 'Tis below thy Relation to God, who is thy Portion, thy Shield, thy Sanctuary, thy Father. <hi>David</hi> thought it no ſmall matter to be a Son-in-law to an earthly King: And art thou the King's Son of Heaven and Earth, and yet not content? 'Tis below thy Relation to Jeſus Chriſt: What art thou the Spouſe of Chriſt, a Member of Chriſt, the Brother and Friend of Chriſt, an Heir with Chriſt, and yet not content? 'Tis below thy Relation to the Holy Ghoſt, is he Comforter, Guide, Witneſs, Strength,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:040363_0077_1016686FFAB50D80"/>and art not content! 'Tis below thy Relation to holy Angels, who are thy Guard, thy Attendance, thy Friends, thy Watchmen; haſt thou thoſe Millions of glorious Spirits to miniſter to thee, to fight for thee, keep thee in all thy Ways, and yet not content? 'Tis below thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Saints and heavenly Family: Art thou bro't home to ſit down with them, to partake of all the ſacred Priviledges of God's Houſe with them, and to have a ſhare in all their Prayers, and yet not content? 'Tis below the high and ſovereign Dignity thou art raiſed to: Art thou born from above, a Prince, a Favourite of Heaven, an Heir of both Worlds, and yet not content?</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> 'Tis below thoſe Graces, divine Helps and Endowments thou haſt received. Art thou in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God? Has God tyed and bound himſelf by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and holy Oaths to help thee, uphold thee, and keep thee from falling, and yet not content? Is thy eternal Eſtate ſecur'd, art thou made ſure of Heaven, and yet diſcontented?</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Conſider all thy Afflictions, Troubles and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows are nothing, in Compariſon of what other Saints have met with, nay, to thoſe Jeſus Chriſt met with himſelf for thy ſake, and art not thou content? Beſides, are they not leſs than thy Sins deſerve? And yet not content? Nay, and all thoſe hard Things thou meeteſt with, God will cauſe to work for thy Good, and yet not content? All the bitter Things thou art like to meet with, in this World, will be nothing but Sweet hereafter, and yet not content? All thy Troubles will be ſoon gone, they are but for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; beſides, they are intermixt with much Sweet, and yet not content? Nay, and all thy Sorrows will be turned into Joy, and all Tears will be wiped away from thine Eyes, and yet not content?

<pb n="149" facs="unknown:040363_0077_1016686FFAB50D80"/>him, but lo, to his eternal Joy, <hi>Contentment</hi> came in, and was immediately gloriouſly welcomed by <hi>Godlineſs</hi>'s hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Retinue; yea, it cannot be imagined, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing now there was in poor <hi>Thoughtful</hi>'s Houſe; it would do one's Heart good to ſee how the ſcattered Powers of the Enemy were forced to fly into Holes. <hi>Apollyon</hi> himſelf was fain to pull in his Horns. <hi>Deſpond</hi> was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, curſed <hi>Diſquiet</hi> and <hi>Murmur</hi> could find no more Place in his Houſe: O this to him was the Day of Days.</p>
               <p>Upon this, perceiving glorious <hi>Content</hi> with Triumph was entred into his Houſe, to dwell with the reſt of <hi>True Godlineſs</hi>'s heavenly Retinue, and that there was nothing wanting to make his Life comfortable here, and happy hereafter, he fell a ſinging of ſweet Hymns of Praiſe and Thankſgiving to God.</p>
