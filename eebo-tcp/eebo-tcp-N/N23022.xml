            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS the doctrine of a future ≈øtate of retribution is the principal ≈øupport of piety and virtue, the great and univer≈øal importance of it mu≈øt be obvious. And that this is a doctrine "worthy of all acceptation," we have the concurrent te≈øtimonies of natural and revealed religion.</p>
            <p>Our text leads us to con≈øider‚ÄîThe certainty of a future judgment‚ÄîSome of the peculiarities of this judgment, as revealed in the go≈øpel‚ÄîAnd the purpo≈øes for which God hath appointed it.</p>
            <p>In regard to the certainty of a future ≈øtate of ret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribution, let it be ob≈øerved,</p>
            <p>That the judgment we pa≈øs upon our own actions, or that faculty by which we di≈øcover the difference between good and evil, is the foundation of many of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030424_0004_0FE6D0F3984A0098"/>
our mo≈øt plea≈øing hopes, and of our mo≈øt di≈øquieting fears. The ≈øatisfactions which accompany a life of innocence, are greatly increa≈øed by the expectation of a future recompence; and the terrors of a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience as greatly enhanced.</p>
            <p>And we ≈øee, in many in≈øtances, that the di≈øpen≈øations of Providence in the pre≈øent ≈øtate, are promi≈øcuous and unequal. No certain conclu≈øions can be drawn from them, in regard to the virtue or the vice of men. The righteous often ≈øuffer, and for being righteous: And the wicked pro≈øper, and pro≈øper through their wickedne≈øs.</p>
            <p>And although the wi≈øe and con≈øiderate in all ages, from a conviction that virtue was excellent in it≈øelf, and that vice was pernicious in its own nature, have endeavored to reward the former, and to puni≈øh the latter, according to their re≈øpective merits; yet no human laws have ever been able to effect the≈øe mo≈øt de≈øirable purpo≈øes. No human tribunal can inve≈øtigate the ≈øecret emotions of the heart, the ≈øource from which all our actions proceed; and in proportion to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which they bear to this fountain, they de≈øerve either cen≈øure, or prai≈øe. The ≈øpecious hypocrite may come forward, and challenge the ≈øevere≈øt ≈øcrutiny, while the fear of a di≈øcovery has led him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his vile enormities in the dark. But, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial ju≈øtice may be di≈øpen≈øed, the motives and intentions of the agent mu≈øt be known. The rich, who, of their abundance ca≈øt much into the trea≈øury, will undoubtedly receive their reward; and yet, the poor widow's two mites may entitle her to a much greater recompence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:030424_0005_0FE6D0FC6E42E928"/>Should the internal ≈øatisfactions which accompany a virtuous life, and the mi≈øeries which commonly overtake the wicked, be urged, as an adequate reward to the former, and a ≈øufficient puni≈øhment to the latter; it may be a≈øked, whether any degree of external afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in addition to the plea≈øures which flow from a good con≈øcience, ≈øeparate from the views of eternity, would be deemed by a wi≈øe man, an adequate recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the exqui≈øite ≈øufferings with which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibly virtuous are ≈øometimes called to ≈øtruggle?</p>
            <p>As the≈øe inequalities have been from the beginning of the world, we have all rea≈øon to ≈øuppo≈øe, that they will continue unto the end of it. And from this ≈øtate of things, it is natural to conclude, that there will be a future ≈øtate of retribution, in which all the≈øe inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will be rectified, and impartial ju≈øtice di≈øpen≈øed to every man.</p>
            <p>And this has been the prevailing opinion, in every age, and in every nation. It is true, that one ≈øect of philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers among the heathen, and ≈øome among the Jews, denied the re≈øurrection of the dead; but tho≈øe charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were not very numerous; they bore ≈øcarce any kind of proportion to the body of the people, the great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, who received the doctrine of a future judgment. On no other principle can we account for the wor≈øhip of the dead; and for the animated de≈øcriptions which the poets have given of the Ely≈øian fields: In which all the virtuous are repre≈øented in a ≈øtate of happine≈øs, and in the enjoyment of the fruits of their pa≈øt labors: While the wicked are excluded tho≈øe happy abodes, and con≈øigned to the regions of wo and mi≈øery forever. And although the rewards and puni≈øhments a≈ø≈øigned
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030424_0006_0FE6D0FC79C74668"/>
to the≈øe characters, in the future world, are very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in their nature, from tho≈øe which revelation has taught <hi>us</hi> to expect hereafter, and fall infinitely below them; yet they are ≈øtrongly expre≈ø≈øive of the general opinion concerning the doctrine before us. The Apo≈øtle, in his addre≈øs to the Gentiles, ob≈øerves, that, "the invi≈øible things of him," (God) "from the creation of the world, are clearly ≈øeen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood by the things which are made, even his eternal power and Godhead. So that they are without excu≈øe, becau≈øe that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God."</p>
            <p>But, although the religion of nature taught men to expect a future ≈øtate of retribution, in which they would be rewarded and puni≈øhed, according to their re≈øpective de≈øerts, (and the evidences of this great doctrine have been confirmed by every revelation which God has given of him≈øelf), yet, it gave no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations of the circum≈øtances which would attend it. For the≈øe mo≈øt ≈øolemn and intere≈øting di≈øcoveries, we are indebted to the revelation of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; through whom, "life and immortality" are "brought to light:" i. e. more fully and clearly revealed.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt of the≈øe peculiar and important di≈øcoveries which I ≈øhall mention, is this,‚ÄîThat there will be a DAY, on which all the generations of men, will be gathered together, in one great and general a≈ø≈øembly, to receive the re≈øpective rewards of their pa≈øt behavior.</p>
            <p>"When the Son of man ≈øhall come in his glory, then ≈øhall be gathered before him all nations‚ÄîGod hath appointed a DAY, in which he will judge the world in righteou≈øne≈øs‚ÄîBut of that DAY and hour,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030424_0007_0FE6D0FD8B375A68"/>
knoweth no man, not even the Son." This is one of tho≈øe "≈øecret things" which "belong to God." But we are informed, that this judgment will take place "at the end of the world," an indefinite period; and which may be much nearer than we apprehend! And when it ≈øhall commence, we are a≈ø≈øured, that it will be accompanied by a univer≈øal re≈øurrection‚Äîof all who in this world have ever ta≈øted death.</p>
            <p>"We mu≈øt all appear before the judgment ≈øeat of Chri≈øt," &amp;c. "Verily, verily, I ≈øay unto you, the hour is coming, and even now is, when the dead ≈øhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear him ≈øhall live."‚Äî"Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves ≈øhall hear his voice, and ≈øhall come forth, they that have done good, unto the re≈øurrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the re≈øurrection of damnation."</p>
            <p>And immediately after this general re≈øurrection, we are informed, the world which we now inhabit will appear all in flames, and be utterly de≈øtroyed by fire.</p>
            <p>"The Lord Je≈øus ≈øhall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them who know not God, and who obey not the go≈øpel of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt." "The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens ≈øhall pa≈øs away in a great noi≈øe, and the elements ≈øhall melt with fervent heat. The earth al≈øo, and all that therein is, ≈øhall be burned up. Seeing then, that all the≈øe things are to be di≈ø≈øolved, what manner of per≈øons ought we to be, in all holy conver≈øation and godline≈øs!"</p>
            <p>Another circum≈øtance concerning this future judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, revealed in the go≈øpel, re≈øpects the per≈øon, to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030424_0008_0FE6D0FD980D49A0"/>
whom the judiciary powers of that great and ≈øolemn day are committed. And this is the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt him≈øelf. The per≈øon who once appeared in this world, in the form of a ≈øervant, and to ≈øave ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, although "the Lord of life and glory"‚Äî"who went about doing good"‚Äîand after a life of the pure≈øt benevolence, and of un≈øpotted innocence, "was taken, and by wicked hands, crucified and ≈ølain. But God rai≈øed him up."</p>
            <p>"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son.‚ÄîIt is Je≈øus that is ordained of God to be the judge of quick and dead‚ÄîGod will judge the world in righteou≈øne≈øs, by that man Je≈øus Chri≈øt, whom he hath appointed."</p>
            <p>In ≈øome pa≈ø≈øages of ≈øcripture, God him≈øelf is ≈øaid to be the judge of all the earth, and who will do right‚Äî and that he will reward every man according to his deeds; "To them who by patient continuance in well doing, ≈øeek for glory, and honor, and immortality, eternal life; but unto them that are contentious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and wrath, tribulation and angui≈øh upon every ≈øoul of man that doeth evil." But the≈øe texts may be reconciled with the former, when we con≈øider, that the future judgment will commence on the day appointed by God; and that all the tran≈øactions of it will be managed by his Son; to whom he has dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated his authority and power; and who will perform all the duties of that great and ≈øolemn office, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to the will of his Father.</p>
            <p>Another peculiarity, and which de≈øerves our mo≈øt ≈øerious attention, is the <hi>manner</hi> in which he will appear upon that ≈øolemn occa≈øion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:030424_0009_0FE6D1053B182898"/>"He ≈øhall come in his own glory, in the glory of God, and in the glory of his holy angels‚Äîhe ≈øhall ≈øit upon the throne of his glory, and all nations ≈øhall be gathered before him. And he ≈øhall ≈øeparate them, one from the other, as a ≈øhepherd divideth his ≈øheep from the goats. The Lord him≈øelf ≈øhall de≈øcend from heaven with a ≈øhout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God. The dead in Chri≈øt ≈øhall ri≈øe fir≈øt, and they that are alive ≈øhall be changed, and caught up to meet the Lord in the air."</p>
            <p>Further, the go≈øpel of Je≈øus Chri≈øt di≈øclo≈øes the purpo≈øes of God, in the appointment of this future judgment: namely, That his wi≈ødom, ju≈øtice, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and mercy, may be univer≈øally acknowledged and magnified‚ÄîThat all the ungodly may be convinced "of all their hard ≈øpeeches ≈øpoken again≈øt him"‚Äî And that the glory of the great Judge may be mo≈øt illu≈øtriou≈øly di≈øplayed‚Äî"That all men ≈øhould honor the Son, even as they honor the Father"‚ÄîBecau≈øe "thou ha≈øt loved righteou≈øne≈øs and hated iniquity, therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladne≈øs above thy fellows"‚Äîbe≈øtowed the highe≈øt and mo≈øt di≈øtingui≈øhed honors upon him, as a peculiar mark of his approbation‚Äîand appointed him to the important office of Judge, both of quick and dead, "becau≈øe he was the ≈øon of man"‚ÄîTo quiet our fears and apprehen≈øions on that great day, when we ≈øhall behold, in the per≈øon of our Judge, the greate≈øt benefactor and friend of the human race‚Äîone made like unto our≈øelves‚Äîacquainted with all the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of our nature, and di≈øpo≈øed to pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øionate our weakne≈øs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:030424_0010_0FE6D1054AF45240"/>"It behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High Prie≈øt. For we have not an High Prie≈øt, which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities."</p>
            <p>And here, it may be ob≈øerved, that there is nothing in any of the≈øe peculiar di≈øcoveries of the go≈øpel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a future judgment, incon≈øi≈øtent with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of natural religion. A Being po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power can gather together all nations on that great day, as ea≈øily as di≈øpo≈øe the individuals of which this numerous a≈ø≈øembly is compo≈øed to meet together on the pre≈øent very melancholy occa≈øion.</p>
            <p>And there can be no ab≈øurdity in believing, that the Being who fir≈øt gave us life can reanimate the bodies which we now po≈ø≈øe≈øs, and clothe them with fre≈øh powers of life and ≈øen≈øibility, after they have laid ever ≈øo long a period in the graves.</p>
            <p>And that the unexampled obedience and ≈øufferings of our ble≈ø≈øed Lord and Savior ≈øhould be mo≈øt openly acknowledged, and rewarded by the Deity, who has declared him≈øelf to be the "rewarder of all them that diligently ≈øeek him," is mo≈øt agreeable to all our notions of ju≈øtice.</p>
            <p>And does it not appear to be a merciful di≈øpen≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the human race ≈øhould be judged by one in their own likene≈øs?</p>
            <p>And is it not proper and right, that the mo≈øt public and expre≈ø≈øive marks of approbation ≈øhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon the righteous; and that the wicked ≈øhould be as openly expo≈øed to di≈øgrace and puni≈øhment?</p>
            <p>Let us now attend to a few reflections, which ari≈øe from this mo≈øt intere≈øting and important of all ≈øubjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:030424_0011_0FE6D107813CB620"/>And Fir≈øt,</p>
            <p>Allowing that we know not the nature, nor the proportion of the rewards and puni≈øhments to be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øed in a future ≈øtate; yet, this is certain, the go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel has repre≈øented them, and the ≈øolemnities of a future judgment, in the ≈øtronge≈øt light: and in ≈øuch a manner, as to excite the mo≈øt plea≈øing hopes in the virtuous; and the mo≈øt awful apprehen≈øions in the wicked.</p>
            <p>"Then ≈øhall the King ≈øay unto them on his right hand, come ye ble≈ø≈øed of my Father, inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.‚ÄîThen ≈øhall he ≈øay unto them on his left hand, depart from me, ye cur≈øed, into everla≈øting fire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the devil and his angels."</p>
            <p>Again. From the certainty and circum≈øtances of a future judgment, how great mu≈øt be the ab≈øurdity of di≈ø≈øimulation! On that day, "when the ≈øecrets of all hearts ≈øhall be di≈øclo≈øed," the hope of the hypocrite will peri≈øh. None of tho≈øe arts and ≈øubtilties which he once practi≈øed in the world, and with ≈øucce≈øs, will then avail him. He will find no friend to ca≈øt the mantle of charity over his deceptions; nor any corner in which to hide his guilty face. He will appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fellow creatures, and before the holy angels, in his true character, and be filled with ≈øhame and remor≈øe. The greater his duplicity may have been, the greater will be his confu≈øion and di≈øtre≈øs. He will then reflect on the value and importance of a good con≈øcience: and be ready to acknowledge, that there are no plea≈øures comparable to tho≈øe which flow from a faithful performance of our re≈øpective duties, and from an heart which cannot reproach us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:030424_0012_0FE6D1078DB1A168"/>Again. As the hopes given us in the go≈øpel of Chri≈øt are mo≈øt glorious, and its promi≈øes, re≈øpecting a future world, "exceeding great and precious;" not to extend our principal views towards futurity mu≈øt be the greate≈øt folly. More e≈øpecially, as our own feelings, and the circum≈øtances of all things about us, are continually ≈øugge≈øting the infinite importance of it. This is the "one thing needful," and the greate≈øt concern we can po≈ø≈øibly attend to. So great is the di≈øproportion between things ≈øpiritual and things temporal, that we mu≈øt ≈øee where our intere≈øt lies, and cannot be ignorant of the part we ≈øhould prefer. As we acknowledge, that the plea≈øures of this world are precarious, inadequate to our expectations, and only for a ≈øea≈øon, it becomes us to "≈øet our affections on things above, not on things on the earth."</p>
            <p>Further. Although the certainty and circum≈øtances of a future judgment mu≈øt ≈øtrike the wicked, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they reflect upon them, with the utmo≈øt terror; they afford the greate≈øt comfort and con≈øolation to the righteous. There are ≈øo many contending intere≈øts in the pre≈øent world, and the pa≈ø≈øions and appetites of men are ≈øo ≈øtrong and violent, that the virtuous are often reproached, and cruelly treated: and ≈øometimes per≈øecuted unto death. This was the ca≈øe with many of the primitive chri≈øtians in particular; and who endured the greate≈øt afflictions, and ≈øuffered the mo≈øt grievous puni≈øhments, having "re≈øpect unto the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ompence of the reward." They comforted and ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported one another with the ble≈ø≈øed hope of everla≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life‚Äîa future ≈øtate of exi≈øtence, in which their integrity would be completely rewarded. "Our light
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030424_0013_0FE6D11116CCCAC0"/>
affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. For we mu≈øt all appear before the Judgment ≈øeat of Chri≈øt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad."</p>
            <p>The ≈øubject leads to many more very u≈øeful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections; but they cannot be pur≈øued at pre≈øent: And I ≈øhall clo≈øe this di≈øcour≈øe, with an addre≈øs to the audience,‚Äîand to the criminal.</p>
            <p>MY BRETHREN,</p>
            <p>In the unhappy pri≈øoner now before you, ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the executive officers of ju≈øtice, and fa≈øt bound in the chains of death, you behold a mi≈øerable ≈øinner; covered with ≈øhame and ≈øtung with remor≈øe: the u≈øual and ju≈øt effects of a wicked and profligate life!</p>
            <p>One end of the law, in ordering him to ≈øuffer, in this public and ignominious manner, is to alarm and deter others‚Äîle≈øt they ≈øhould come into the ≈øame condemnation. And if the ≈øolemn tran≈øactions of this day ≈øhould not touch, and powerfully affect your hearts, they mu≈øt be in≈øen≈øible indeed!</p>
            <p>And here, permit me to caution you, in great ≈øeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs, again≈øt tho≈øe vices in particular which lead more immediately to the crime for which this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy man is now to ≈øuffer.</p>
            <p>Among others, we may mention a barbarous and cruel temper. It mu≈øt be evident to tho≈øe who are acquainted with the human heart, that every <hi>kind,</hi> and every <hi>degree</hi> of cruelty practi≈øed upon man or bea≈øt,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030424_0014_0FE6D111223AEC98"/>
le≈ø≈øens the influence of tho≈øe tender ≈øen≈øibilities im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in our nature for the mo≈øt benevolent purpo≈øes, and leaves impre≈ø≈øions on the mind unfavourable to the intere≈øts of humanity. The per≈øon who can wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly wound and torture a brute, and take delight in his ≈øufferings, will ≈øoon become callous to the feelings of his fellow creatures. And ≈øociety can never be too ≈øecurely guarded again≈øt this brutal in≈øen≈øibility of temper.</p>
            <p>Further. All violent and head-≈øtrong pa≈ø≈øions lead to this mon≈øtrous crime: more e≈øpecially when they have acquired, which is often the ca≈øe, an irre≈øi≈øtible authority. A man thus en≈ølaved is every moment liable to the mo≈øt ≈øerious and affecting misfortunes.</p>
            <p>And revenge, or a di≈øpo≈øition to redre≈øs our own wrongs, leads on to the mo≈øt fatal extremes. Every emotion of this pa≈ø≈øion, is pregnant with danger: and victims without number have been ≈øacrificed to its ra≈øh and precipitate purpo≈øes.</p>
            <p>But, the mo≈øt awful effects may be expected from a fixed rancor and malevolence of heart. This is the mo≈øt un≈øociable and wicked temper that can po≈ø≈øibly po≈ø≈øe≈øs a man. It is the temper of that degraded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "who was a murderer from the beginning." And "every <hi>man,</hi> who hateth his brother, is a murderer" al≈øo.</p>
            <p>To the≈øe we may add avarice, gaming and di≈ø≈øipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which excite contentions and quarrels; expo≈øe per≈øons to the ≈øevere≈øt temptations; and tend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy all ≈øen≈øe of moral obligations.</p>
            <p>There is another vice extremely prejudicial and dangerous, as it leads to the heinous crime of perjury;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030424_0015_0FE6D112498E6940"/>
viz. ra≈øh and profane ≈øwearing; which has a tendency to lower the Divine Being in our minds, and to take off that reverential awe which is our natural duty to our Creator.</p>
            <p>And if we may credit the confe≈ø≈øions of many who have ≈øuffered for the crime of murder, a di≈øregard to the ≈øabbath, and to the public wor≈øhip of God, may be con≈øidered as ruinous to individuals, and highly injurious to the peace and welfare of ≈øociety. And this, I think, will hardly admit of a doubt, when we reflect, that the public exerci≈øes of our religion are calculated to keep up a lively and con≈øtant ≈øen≈øe of God, and his providence, upon our minds; to impre≈øs our hearts with benevolent ≈øentiments; and to e≈øtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh the principles of ≈øelf-government, by motives of pre≈øent, and eternal happine≈øs.</p>
            <p>And now let me intreat you, in the mo≈øt ≈øerious and affectionate manner, to guard your≈øelves not only again≈øt the≈øe great and mo≈øt pernicious vices, but again≈øt every <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> of immorality.</p>
            <p>If you believe in the exi≈øtence of a God, who governs the world in wi≈ødom and equity, and that you are accountable to him for your conduct, you have the ≈øtronge≈øt motives to a religious and virtuous behavior that can po≈ø≈øibly be laid before you. But, as you ≈øee that the≈øe motives, great and powerful as they are, are often ≈øuper≈øeded by the ≈øolicitations of the tempter, attend to the fir≈øt advances of vice, which approaches ≈øtep by ≈øtep: "Fir≈øt the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear." Look upon every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from the path of duty, however ≈ømall, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øtifiable and wrong. Con≈øider, that every irregular
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030424_0016_0FE6D11257166A68"/>
indulgence leaves an impre≈ø≈øion on the mind unfavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the intere≈øts of virtue. It le≈ø≈øens the fear of ≈øhame, that innate mode≈øty which is the natural guard of innocence, and weakens the power of con≈øcience. Be per≈øuaded, that your duty and happine≈øs are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeparably connected; and avoid even "the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of evil."</p>
            <p>And, may the in≈øpiration of the Almighty govern your hearts!</p>
            <p>I now turn to the criminal.</p>
            <p>You, HENRY BLACKBURN, are this day to ≈øuffer the pains and penalties of an ignominious death; for the unnatural and atrocious crime of MURDER: A crime of the highe≈øt nature; to which the law of God, and the laws of nations, have annexed this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, though awful puni≈øhment, "he that ≈øheddeth man's blood, by man ≈øhall his blood be ≈øhed."</p>
            <p>You have repeatedly prote≈øted, and in the mo≈øt ≈øolemn manner, by immediate appeals to heaven, that neither revenge, nor hatred, nor any other malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant pa≈ø≈øion, moved you to take away the life of the per≈øon who died in con≈øequence of the wound you gave him. But your country, after a mo≈øt deliberate, ≈øolemn and impartial inquiry, has pronounced you <hi>guilty</hi>‚Äîand guilty of wilful murder. The matter re≈øts with God and your own ≈øoul; that God who cannot be deceived, and "who will not be mocked."</p>
            <p>But, allowing that you had no de≈øign again≈øt the life of the unfortunate ≈øtranger, who fell a victim to your ra≈øhne≈øs and folly, this will not wipe away, although
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030424_0017_0FE6D119CC84E138"/>
it may greatly extenuate your guilt. Life is a gift too ≈øacred to be ≈øported with; and the weapons of death are not to be u≈øed lightly and wantonly. And, although you may not have incurred the fearful guilt of <hi>wilful</hi> murder, this is certain, you have ≈øhed the blood of a fellow creature; and in ≈øuch a manner as cannot be ju≈øtified in the ≈øight of God, nor in the opinion of man.</p>
            <p>During your confinement, which has been long and tedious, you have had time for the mo≈øt ≈øerious and deliberate reflections: And you have been encouraged and a≈ø≈øi≈øted in the great duty of repentance. You have been per≈øuaded, "by the mercies of God, and by the terrors of the Lord," to repent, to for≈øake your ≈øins, and to turn mo≈øt heartily unto God. And from the ≈øolicitude which you early di≈øcovered for in≈øtruction, and from the apparently open and candid acknowledgments which you have made of the errors of your pa≈øt life, we have rea≈øon to hope, that ≈øome good fruits have been produced in your heart: but, if you have impo≈øed on your ≈øincere≈øt friends, and deceived your≈øelf, let me exhort you, in the mo≈øt ≈øerious and pathetic manner, by the mercies of God, and by the affection which you bear to your own ≈øoul, to renounce your hypocri≈øy this in≈øtant; to acknowledge your multiplied tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions with the deepe≈øt humility; and to turn unto God with your whole heart.</p>
            <p>Within a few moments, you will be taken from the hou≈øe of God, carried to the place of execution, and "appear before the judgment-≈øeat of Chri≈øt, to receive the deeds done in your body, whether they be good
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030424_0018_0FE6D119D7F99A90"/>
or bad." You have ju≈øt heard the certainty, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances, and de≈øign of this judgment; and the pa≈ø≈øing interval before you mu≈øt awaken all the powers of your ≈øoul! It is enough to overpower your ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibility, unaccompanied and alone; and much more ≈øo, attended by the habiliments of death, and by thou≈øands of ≈øurrounding ≈øpectators.</p>
            <p>O, my brother! thus encompa≈ø≈øed with the ≈øorrows of the grave, and the ≈ønares of death, you ≈øtand in need of every con≈øolation. And, to a≈ø≈øi≈øt and ≈øupport you in this mo≈øt di≈øtre≈ø≈øing hour, and to ≈øhew the part which it becomes you to perform, "look unto Je≈øus, the author and fini≈øher of our faith." It is true, the difference in point of character is infinite: For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he died the death of a malefactor, he died perfectly innocent of every crime. <hi>He</hi> died to ≈øupport the cau≈øe of piety and virtue, and to ≈øave ≈øinners: but <hi>you</hi> will die a malefactor indeed‚Äîfor your atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious crimes‚Äîbecau≈øe you have di≈øregarded the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion, and ≈øhed the blood of one, whom he died to redeem.</p>
            <p>Our ble≈ø≈øed Lord and Ma≈øter endured the cro≈øs, de≈øpi≈øing the ≈øhame. And he ≈øuffered that ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and painful death with the mo≈øt perfect ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to the will of his Father, with the mo≈øt heroic forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and equanimity of mind, and in the exerci≈øe of a mo≈øt charitable and forgiving temper, even towards his enemies, and tho≈øe who per≈øecuted him unto death, and who in≈øulted him in his la≈øt agonies.</p>
            <p>And you have the example of one, who was a great ≈øinner, and who ≈øuffered with him; and who≈øe faith was not to be ≈øhaken by all the terrors of a lingering,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030424_0019_0FE6D11C7018E1A8"/>
≈øhameful death. Although he ≈øaw the Savior of the world nailed to the cro≈øs, and knew that he would expire within a few hours; yet he believed on him, and died entirely re≈øigned to the will of God. He died with chri≈øtian fortitude and ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion; he died a ≈øincere penitent; and he died in prayer‚Äî"Lord, remember me, when thou come≈øt into thy kingdom." And as a reward of his faith, penitence and obedience, Chri≈øt an≈øwered him, and ≈øaid, "To-day ≈øhalt thou be with me in paradi≈øe." And O that you, my brother, may di≈øcover this believing, re≈øigned and heavenly temper, at the hour of your departure, and be admitted into the kingdom of the Great Redeemer!</p>
            <p>Now, "unto God's gracious mercy and protection we commit thee; the Lord ble≈øs thee, and keep thee; the Lord make his face to ≈øhine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace, both now and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more."</p>
            <p>Let us pray, &amp;c.</p>
