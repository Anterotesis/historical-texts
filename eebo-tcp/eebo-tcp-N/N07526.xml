            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE true <hi>Quaker,</hi> is loving, kind and reſpectful to all his Fellow Mortals, the falſe ones, or them that would be call'd <hi>Quakers</hi> and are not ſo: Are proud and high minded, greedy after Gain, fond of Places of Profit and Honour; —and when they are got therein, they are very apt to begin to Lord it over their Fellow Creatures: Nay! and to blame them without a juſt Cauſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie them alſo I think.</p>

               <p>I have often conſidered the End and Tendency of Talebearing, Wiſpering and Backbiting, and have obſerved the evil Fruits and Effects thereof among Friends Neighbours and Relations.</p>
               <p>IT is not poſſible for Neighbours, Friends and Relations, nor for any Society of People to live together in Unity, Friendſhip and good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, while there goeth up and down a Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer among them, a Wiſperer among them; they are Numbered by <hi>St. Paul</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtle, Romans</hi> chap. the firſt verſe the 29, 30.

               <head>Touching my Reputation.</head>
               <p>THOUGH I have loved my Reputation and have been vigilant, not to loſe or impair it by my own default or neglect; yet I have looked upon it as a pritty Thing, a Thing that the Devil aims to hit in a ſpecial Manner.—A Thing that is much in the Power of a falſe Report, a miſtake.—Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all my Care I am at the Mercy of others, without GOD'S wonderful Overruling Providence. And as my Reputation is the Eſteem that others have of me; ſo that Eſteem may be blemiſhed without my default.—I have therefore always taken this Care, not to ſet my heart upon my Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I will uſe all Fidelity and honeſty and take care it ſhall not be loſt by my Default. And if notwithſtanding all this my Repution be ſoiled by evil or envious Men or Angels; I will patiently bear it and content myſelf with the Serenity of my own Conſcience.</p>

Buffins</hi> ANSWER, Yes: But my Controverſy is with them that is for healing or Skinning a Wound over and not ſearch it to the Bottom; the which I can't no ways conſent unto; for I think they are Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of no Value, ſo I am forced to contend with them.</p>
               <p>I could give you a large Account, how there are ſome that are going to make Uſe of that knoty hollow deceitful Tree that I mentioned in my firſt Book, for all Pillar in a great Houſe or Church. But I think, they that chooſe that have no better Judgement then I had formerly, when I ſaw but one Side of it, or it is a Sign that good Stuff is ſcarce.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth to me by KING SALOMON ſayings, there are two Sorts of Fools. I think them, that are proud lorded over their Fellow Creatures and belie them, are one Sort</p>
               <p>And as ſome in our Soceity hath gone wide from that humble meek Spirit, that our former Friends were in the Practice off. I find it my Duty to reprove ſuch; and I hope it will be of ſome Service or Benefit to them, that are unborn, as well as to ſome now adays. And as the great Man from Town, ſaid to me, that I was of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and malicious Spirit; and <hi>Peter Harvey</hi> ſent me Word, that if I was in a Strait for Money to go on with printing, he would help me to ſome. So both of them was Encouragement for me to go on with Printing; as for my being of a malicious Spirit, I ſay ſo far as I know myſelf I, am not</p>

them, that hath encroached on my Land, done their utmoſt endeavour to defame my Reputation, and belie me alſo.</p>
               <p>EXPLANATION of my being a Surgeon; is that ſome hath been very urgent in perſwading of me to burn all my Writings and Printings, the which is a Thing I cannot anyways conſent unto: untill ſome that hath blamed me without a Cauſe, and charged me falſely; are brought to own their Fault, or make out their Charge againſt me to be true; that which I compare to healing a Wound over, and not ſearch, or cleanſe it at the bottom.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>William Jones</hi> and his Children, they not ſaying what Part of my Book they could not underſtand; ſo I cannot Explain it to them: But I am able to Explain all to Men of Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>My Friends I here think proper to mention ſome few Verſes out of the Hiſtory of the Devil:—And are as followeth:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>When the Devil for weighty diſpatches,</l>
                  <l>Wanted Meſſenges cunning and bold</l>
                  <l>He paſed by the beautiful Faces,</l>
                  <l>And picked out the ugly and old.</l>
                  <l>Of theſe he made Warlicks and Witches,</l>
                  <l>To run of his Errands by Night;</l>
                  <l>'Till the over-wrought hag-ridden wretches,</l>
                  <l>Were as fit as the Devil to fright.</l>
                  <l>But whoever has been his adviſer,</l>
                  <l>As his Kingdom increaſes in Growth;</l>
                  <l>He now takes his Meaſures much wiſer</l>
                  <l>And Traficks with beauty and Youth.</l>
                  <l>Diſguiſed in the wanton and witty,</l>
                  <l>He haunts both the Church and the Court;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="10" facs="unknown:009609_0010_0F76F5DD7131AC78"/>
And ſometimes he viſits the City,</l>
                  <l>Where all the beſt Chriſtians Reſort.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thus dreſſed up in full Maſquarade,</l>
                  <l>He the bolder can range up and down;</l>
                  <l>For he better can drive on his Trade,</l>
                  <l>In any ones Name than his own.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>My Lucrebations concerning S. S.</l>
                  <l>He liveth about <hi>North-Eaſt</hi> from me, ſo you may gueſs.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>To wit, for ſeveral Years paſt I have been very Converſent with him, and thought he was my real Friend. But alas! He was ſo much inclin'd to hold with the ſtrongeſt Side, (as he thought) or rather with the Multitude:—Though the Truth is always the ſtrongeſt.</p>
               <p>I will praiſe and extole the moſt High, who hath fed me with food convenient; and preſerved me out of many Dangers: Who hath favoured me with a good Underſtanding, down to this very Day.</p>
               <p>I deſire to leave ſomething as a Caution to the next Age, that they may be careful how they Lord it over their Fellow Creatures: Leaſt they ſhould be as badly off as they that hath ſtrove to degrade my Reputation.</p>
               <p>It is a Comfort now in old Age, that I have not been fond, or proud of Places of Honour, or Profit; though I have been in ſeveral Offices, both in Church and State,—or Town duties: And ſo far as I know myſelf I have not been lifted up in my Mind,—when I had them, but zealouſly concern'd that I might be faithful therein. I remember when the Meeting requeſted of my Brother in-Law <hi>John Harvey</hi> to take the Office of Overſeer of our little
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009609_0011_0F76F5DFEEE0EA60"/>
Meeting, that he was very loath, and ſaid that he was not a quarter fit or it.—I think his Son is not half a quarter fit for that weighty Affair.—I ſoon ſpoke from his proud hectering and falſe Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to me, and concerning me ſoon after that he was put in the Office of Overſeer.</p>
               <p>My Friends,—I here acquaint you of ſome few of <hi>Peter Harvey's</hi> quibbling Anſwers to ſome of my 13—Queries that I requeſted him to Anſwer, being moſtly Subjects that he had blam'd me.—The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of them, I omit now for Brevity, they may be ſeen at my Houſe in Writing. After a conſiderable deal of Pains taken by me, to bring him, he came, and ſaid he came, becauſe he had ſaid that he would meet me, and not on any other Account.</p>
               <p>My firſt <hi>Query,</hi> why I may not ask a reaſonable Price for my Bricks without being blam'd by thee, and at the ſame Time blam'd me for not telling of a Lye.</p>
               <p>His Anſwer to the firſt <hi>Query</hi> was, if evil or wicked Men ask an unreaſonable price of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for a Thing that he wanteth? he would leave it to any but Knaves or Fools to be Judge whether it was right or no, twice ſaid over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second Query,</hi> why I may not leave a Smith that I look on no better then a Thief without being blam'd by thee?</p>
               <p>His <hi>Anſwer.</hi> As the Smith was a poor Man, I ought not to leave him, my Cuſtom might be of Service or Benefit to him, and my leaving of him, might be a Hurt to his Reputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query the 5th.</hi> What Reaſon can thou give, for
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009609_0012_0F76F5E0C9BF50C8"/>
Charging me of being hard hearted one <hi>Firſt Day,</hi> juſt after we came out of Meeting, in the Hearing of other People?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer the 5th.</hi> It might be as well if he had not ſaid it: His Reaſon Was he ſaw, I looked angry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>7th. Query,</hi> What Reaſon can thou give for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring me to a dum Devil, and ſay at the ſame Time, that you had been too ſlack or you had turn'd me off before now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſeventh Anſwer.</hi> His Reaſon, that I would not ſpeak to him once, with an Account of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Middleton</hi> and his Son in Laws differing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query the 8th.</hi> What Reaſon can thou give for ſaying another Time that I was no better then a dum Devil.</p>
               <p>His Reaſon, that I was of a dark, dark, dark Spirit; no other Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Tenth Ouery,</hi> I deſire to know whether thou hath done thy endeavour to bring <hi>Edward Catril,</hi> to make out his falſe Charge againſt me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> He had asked him to come, but he refuſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Twelfth Query,</hi> Pleaſe to make appear wherein I have ever wronged Man, Woman or Child in my Life, if thou can.</p>
               <p>He and his Friend ſaid, they did not Charge me of wronging any Body.</p>
               <p>The foregoing, are ſome of <hi>Peter Harveys</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocating quibbling Anſwers to ſome of my <hi>Queries</hi> on the 30th. of the 10th. <hi>Month,</hi> 1762.</p>
               <p>How glad could I have been, to live in Peace and Love with all my Fellow Mortals. But I could not, by being blam'd ſo often without a Cauſe, and denounced alſo.</p>
               <lg>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:009609_0013_0F76F5E1987D7860"/>
                  <l>Though wicked Men doth thrive and floriſh,</l>
                  <l>Sin will confound them which they nouriſh.</l>
                  <l>An Hipocrite without all Mockings,</l>
                  <l>Is like ſore Legs within ſilk Stockings.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>It is ſaid in the Hiſtory, that the Devil doth not know what is to come, (I think ſo too) or at leaſt he did not let <hi>Edward Catril</hi> know, that I would print his and others Falſehoods, though ſome of his Servants makes great Pretence thereunto, as Fortunetelling, &amp;c. &amp;c. And I think he deceived <hi>Peter Harvey,</hi> when he cauſed him to ſay, that I was of a dark, dark, dark Spirit, and that he ſaw by my Countenance that I was no Friend, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen <hi>Edward Catril</hi> loitering about the Street ſeveral Times, it is ſaid, if the Devil findeth a Man idle, he will ſet him on Work: I think he ſet <hi>Catril</hi> at Work, when he ſaid that which was falſe of me; <hi>Tattler,</hi> why don't thou tell <hi>Peter Harvey</hi> of it: <hi>Buffin</hi> he heard him ſay it, and did nor blame him for it.</p>
               <p>A ſhort diſcourſe between S—S. and P—H—S ſaid <hi>Buffin</hi> had advertiſed for printing the third Time P.—If he doth print he muſt he diſowned ſpedily. S—that wont do, for he hath charged one in your Meeting with Lying, let them be brought Face to Face firſt; and clear up that firſt, before you complain to the Meeting againſt him again.</p>
               <p>It was enough formerly in <hi>New-England,</hi> if one ſaid thee to on Perſon, to ſend him to Priſon and whip him alſo: It was enough in old <hi>England</hi> formerly, if one would not pull off his Hat nor take the Oath, to ſend him to Priſon and puniſh them alſo: And now in Degree, it is allmoſt as bad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009609_0014_0F76F5E1FAD18690"/>
ſome of us, or I ſhould not have been blam'd for asking a reaſonable Price for what I had to tell, nor for Leaving a Smith I miſliked nor complaint made againſt me to the Meeting, for hindering one for Encroaching on my Land, nor have been compared to a dum Devil, nor have been threatned to be dackt of my Portion if it was in his Power ſo to do, nor be judged by my Countenance that I was no Friend.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, in addreſing a Perſon hold not thy Mouth ſo near him as to bedew him with thy Breath: Yet <hi>Edward Catril</hi> had no more Manners the firſt Time he came to my Houſe, as to hold his Mouth ſo near mine, that his Breath was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable to be boren by me, and ſeveral others almoſt as bad; eſpecially, when that Word dum Devil came out againſt me.</p>
               <p>It can't be reaſonably expected that I ſhould have much edifying or doctrinal Work, I being called chiefly to reprove Talebearers, Whiſperers, Backbiters and Lyars.</p>
               <p>I look on it, that there is a Diſſcretionary Power to be made uſe of in Diſcipline; but I heard a Friend preach, that ſome would ſtick to Diſcipline ſo cloſe, that they would merely ſplit a Hair: But none hath ever made it appear to me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I hath ever made a Breach in Diſcipline, though I think myſelf able to make it appear wherein ſeveral hath falſely accuſed me, or at leaſt I know it to be ſo.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>The true Chriſtians, their Minds are lowly, humble, mild, meek and wiſe,</l>
                  <l>They will not Lye, nor pride exalt their Eyes.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="15" facs="unknown:009609_0015_0F76F5E2B9A15390"/>
Their Conduct is prudent mixt with Love,</l>
                  <l>Good Words and Works fullfil their Day,</l>
                  <l>They join the Serpent with the Dove.</l>
                  <l>But Caſt the Sting away.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Conformity is in high account now adays, but let our Zeal for Conformity be never ſo great; it is he, that ordereth his Converſation a right that ſhall ſee the Salvation of GOD, and not to pin our Faith on others Sleeves as compared to.</p>
               <p>A ſhort Diſcourſe between a Doctor and a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer. Doctor, I think <hi>Peter Harvey</hi> and <hi>Catril,</hi> are got Purs proud, if I had them to phyſick and purge, I would endeavour to Remedy that. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,</hi> it <hi>Buffin</hi> would employ me, I would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to drean them both; eſpecially for calling his Writings Libels, and defaming the Tittle of his Land. <hi>Tattler,</hi> I think <hi>Buffin</hi> will have a Writ on <hi>Catrils</hi> Back if they turn him off as <hi>Harvey</hi> hath it. And as for <hi>Harvey,</hi> I think he hath paid him pritty well for his Falſhoods, <hi>to wit,</hi> in his Printing. As <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Buffin</hi> that the <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia</hi> Friends thought <hi>Catril</hi> and <hi>Noble</hi> were as notable Friends as any we had amongſt us. I think if there is no notabler Friends among us, then they are, I think the Lord will not ſpare us long, if they conduct to others as they have done to <hi>Buffin,</hi> O! that I could find ſome faithful up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right zealous honeſt Men, that would do their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Endeavour to find out the Lying deceitfull Men, and bring them to Juſtice that keep ſnarling at me, becauſe I oppoſe them in their Lying.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>But I think of late ſuch Men are almoſt as rare,</l>
                  <l>As black Swans, with Stream white Crows in Air.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Or at leaſt what I find of them, I never yet
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009609_0016_0F76F5E3747F0A88"/>
could find out the Reaſon of their Defaming my Reputation, the Tittle of my Land and belying me alſo.</p>
               <p>I was a Man formerly that entertained a many notable publick Friends and others at my Houſe, and was willing to ſpend and be ſpent: And now I am as willing to ſpent and be ſpent, in Reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of this new falſe Generation that hath belyed me.</p>
               <p>I have been obraided of having one Foot in the Grave ſome Years ago; I now acquaint you, he that ſaid ſo, hath got one Eye in the Grave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>I underſtand that <hi>Peter Harvey</hi> would have ſent to the Monthly Meeting in Writing, that all was well at our ſmall Meeting, only ſome received <hi>John Buffins</hi> Books. But ſome that had a little more Senſe would not alow of it.</p>
               <p>So my Friends, I knowing Time is ſhort to all of us on this teriſtical Globe, I am willing to leave ſome Thing after in my Days are over in this World, that People may be careful and not to lord it over theſe Fellow Mortals.</p>
               <p>My Friends, I had ſome Seeds of a fine Fruit, as reported, that came from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that was extoled for healing new or old Wounds or Sores; but alas my Friends! I found no more help or benefit by them, then I did by the two extoled Friends that came from thence, though that Fruit did me no Harm, though I think the other hath or would if they could. One asked me whether I did not preach ſometimes? and another, why I did not preach? I think I do of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009609_0017_0F76F5E44139DBA8"/>
late by Books. But my Lot is moſtly in the way of Reproof to them in our Society, as hath been the Lot of publick Friends formerly as well as of late.</p>
               <p>My Friends, I here acquaint you that I was a married Man 38 Year and Nine Months, I don't remember that my Wife gave me a croſs or angry Word in any of that Time; and ſhe was a han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom notable and induſtrious Woman, and could talk as well as others, though ſome Women thought ſhe could not by Reaſon, ſhe did not ſcold ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Peter Harvey</hi> ſaid to me, that my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſhowed I was no Friend, I think that there was ſomebody ſaw as far into him, or he ought not to have wrote on his Gate; this is the Way to <hi>Judas</hi> his Houſe, nor to have wrote on the other Side of the Road: This is the Way to <hi>Peter Harveys</hi> braſon GODS.</p>
               <p>My Scholars are not come to their Speech again, neither have they turn'd me out of the School as yet. So no more Account of them, until the next.</p>
