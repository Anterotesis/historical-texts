            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PRESENT POLITICAL STATE, OF THE PROVINCE OF MASSACHUSETTS-BAY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHEN a people, by what means ſoever, are reduced to ſuch a ſituation, that every thing they hold dear, as men and citizens, is at ſtake, it is not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, but even praiſeworthy for an individual to offer to the public any thing that he may think has a tendency to ward off the impending dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor ſhould he be reſtrained, from an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that what he may offer will be unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, any more than a phyſician ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from preſcribing a ſalutary medicine through fear it might be unpalatable to his patient.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:014158_0004_0F932F5D49644818"/>The preſs, when open to all parties, influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by none, is a ſalutary engine in a free ſtate, perhaps a neceſſary one to preſerve the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of that ſtate; but, when a party has gained the aſcendency ſo far as to become the licenſers of the preſs, either by an act of government, or by playing off the reſentment of the populace, againſt printers and authors, the preſs itſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an engine of oppreſſion and licentiouſneſs, and is as pernicious to ſociety, as otherwiſe it would be beneficial. It is too true to be denied that ſince our controverſy with Great-Britain, the preſs in this town has been much devoted to the partizans of liberty, they have been indulged in publiſhing what they pleaſed, <hi>fas vel nefas,</hi> while little has been publiſhed on the part of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the effect this muſt have had upon the minds of the people in general is obvious; they muſt have formed their opinion upon a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial view of the ſubject, and of courſe it muſt have been in ſome degree erroneous; in ſhort the changes have been rung ſo often upon oppreſſion, tyranny and ſlavery, that whether ſleeping or waking, they are continually vibrating in our ears, and it is now high time to aſk ourſelves whether we have not been deluded by ſound only.</p>
            <p>My dear countrymen, let us diveſt ourſelves of prejudice, take a view of our preſent wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſituation, contraſt it with our former happy one, carefully inveſtigate the cauſe, and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly ſeek ſome means to eſcape the evils we now feel, and prevent thoſe that we have reaſon to expect.</p>
            <p>We have been ſo long advancing to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014158_0005_0F932FBA645BB570"/>
ſtate, and by ſuch gradations, that perhaps many of us are inſenſible of our true ſtate and real danger. Should you be told that acts of high treaſon are flagrant through the country, that a great part of the province is in actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, would you believe it true? Should you not deem the perſon aſſerting of it an enemy to the province? Nay ſhould you not ſpurn him from you with indignation? Be calm, my friends, it is neceſſary to know the worſt of a diſeaſe, to enable us to provide an effectual remedy. Are not the bonds of ſociety cut aſunder, and the ſanctions, that hold man to man trampled upon? Can any of us recover a debt, or obtain compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for an injury, by law? Are not many perſons who once we reſpected and revered, forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fly from their homes and families, to the army for protection, for no other reaſon but their having accepted commiſſions under our King? Is not civil government diſſolved? Some have been made to believe that nothing ſhort of attempting the life of the King, or fighting his troops can amount to high treaſon, or rebellion. If, reader, you are one of thoſe, apply to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt lawyer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (if ſuch a one can be found) and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what kind of offence it is for a number of men to aſſemble armed, and forceably obſtruct the courts of juſtice, even to prevent the King's courts from being held at the ſtated terms; for a body of people to ſeize upon the King's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial revenue: I mean the monies collected by virtue of grants made by the General Court, to his Majeſty, for the ſupport of his government with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this province; for a body of men to aſſemble without being called by authority, and to paſs
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014158_0006_0F932FBB13AE3928"/>
governmental acts, or for a number of people to take the militia out of the hands of the King's Repreſentative, or to form a new militia, or to raiſe men and appoint officers, for a public pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, without the order or permiſſion of the King, or his repreſentative; or for a number of men to take to their arms, and march, with a profeſſed deſign of oppoſing the King's troops; aſk, reader, of ſuch a lawyer what is the crime, and what the puniſhment, and if per chance thou art one that haſt been active in thoſe things, and art not inſenſibility itſelf; his anſwer will harrow up thy ſoul.</p>
            <p>I aſſure you, my friends, I would not that this conduct ſhould be told beyond the borders of this province, I wiſh it were conſigned to perpetual oblivion: but alas, it is too notorious ſo to be concealed, our news-papers have already publiſhed it to the world, we can neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent nor conceal it, the ſhaft is already ſped, and the utmoſt exertion is neceſſary to prevent the blow. We already feel the effects of anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, mutual confidence, affection and tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thoſe ſweetners of human life, are ſucceeded by diſtruſt, hatred and wild uproar; the uſeful arts of agriculture and commerce are neglected for caballing, mobbing this or the other man, becauſe he acts, ſpeaks, or is ſuſpected of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing different from the prevailing ſentiment of the times, in purchaſing arms, and forming a militia. O height of madneſs! with a profeſſed deſign of oppoſing Great-Britain.—I ſuſpect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us have been induced to join in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or but faintly to oppoſe them, from an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that Great-Britain would not, or could
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014158_0007_0F932FBD6FF8DE58"/>
not exert herſelf ſufficiently to ſubdue America. Let us conſider this matter. However cloſe we may hug ourſelves in the opinion that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament has no right to tax or legiſlate for us, the people of England hold the contrary opinion as firmly; they tell us we are a part of the Britiſh empire, that every ſtate, from the nature of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, muſt have a ſupreme uncontroulable power, co-exiſtent with the empire itſelf, and that that power is veſted in parliament; it is as unpopular to deny this doctrine in Great-Britain as it is to aſſert it in the colonies, ſo there is but little probability of ſerving ourſelves at this day by our ingenious diſtinctions between external and internal taxes, between a right of legiſlation for one purpoſe and not for another. We have bid them defiance, and the longeſt ſword muſt carry it, unleſs we change our meaſures. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are the ſame in all parts of the world, the ſame fondneſs for dominion that preſides in the breaſt of an American, rules in the breaſt of an European. If the colonies are not a part of the Britiſh empire already, and ſubject to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority of the ſtate, Great-Britain will make them ſo. Had we been prudent enough to confine our oppoſition within certain limits, we might have ſtood ſome chance of ſucceeding once more, but alas, we have paſſed the Rubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con. It is now univerſally ſaid and believed in England, that if this opportunity of reclaiming the colonies, and reducing them to a ſenſe of their duty, is loſt, they, in truth, will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered from the empire, and become as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct a ſtate from Great-Britain as Hanover; that is, although they may continue their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014158_0008_0F932FBE5588D910"/>
to the perſon of the King, they will own none to the imperial crown of Great-Britain, nor yield obedience to any of her laws, but ſuch as they ſhall think proper to adopt. Can you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the thought for one moment, that Great- Britain will conſent to this? For what has ſhe protected and defended the colonies againſt the maritime powers of Europe, from the firſt Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſettlement to this day? For what did ſhe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe New-York of the Dutch? For what was ſhe ſo laviſh of her beſt blood and treaſure in the conqueſt of Canada, and other territories in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica? Was it to raiſe up a rival ſtate, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large her own empire? Or if the conſideration of an empire was out of the queſtion, what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity can ſhe have of our trade, when once ſhe has loſt our obedience? I mention theſe things, my friends, that you may know how people rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon the ſubject in England, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you that you are much deceived if you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Great-Britain will accede to the claims of the colonies; ſhe will as ſoon conquer New- England, as Ireland or Canada, if either of them revolted, and by arms, if the milder influences of government prove ineffectual? Perhaps you are as fatally miſtaken in another reſpect, I mean as to the power of Great-Britain to conquer, but can any of you that think ſoberly upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, be ſo deluded as to believe that Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who ſo lately carried her arms with ſucceſs to every part of the globe, triumphed over the united powers of France and Spain, and whoſe fleets gave law to the ocean, is unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer us?</p>
            <p>Should the colonies unite in a war againſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014158_0009_0F932FC045F94048"/>
Great-Britain (which by the way is not a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeable caſe) the colonies ſouth of Pennſylvania would be unable to furniſh any men; they have not more than is neceſſary to govern their nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſlaves, and defend themſelves againſt the Indians. I will ſuppoſe that the northern colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies can furniſh as many, and indeed more men than can be uſed to advantage, but have you arms fit for a campaign? If you have arms, have you military ſtores, or can you procure them? When this war is proclaimed, all ſupplies from foreign parts will be cut off. Have you money to maintain the war? Or had you all thoſe things, ſome others are ſtill wanting, which are abſolutely neceſſary to encounter regular troops, that is diſcipline, and that ſubordination where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by each can command all below him, from a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral officer to the loweſt ſubaltern, theſe you neither have nor can have in ſuch a war. It is well known that the provincials in the late war were never brought to a proper diſcipline, though they had the example of the regular troops to encourage, and the martial law to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it. We all know, notwithſtanding the province law for regulating the militia, it was under little more command than what the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers could obtain from treating and humouring the common ſoldiers; what then can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſuch an army as you will bring into the field, if you bring any, each one a politician, puffed up with his own opinion, and feeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſecond to none? Can any of you command forty-thouſand ſuch men? Can you puniſh the diſobedient? Can all your wiſdom direct their ſtrength, courage, or activity to any given point?
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014158_0010_0F932FC07A54FFA8"/>
Would not the leaſt diſappointment, or unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable aſpect cauſe a general dereliction of the ſervice? Your new-fangled militia have already given us a ſpecimen of their future conduct, in ſome of their companies; they have already cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen two, in others three ſetts of officers, and are as diſſatisfied with the laſt choice as the firſt. I do not doubt the natural bravery of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, all men would act the ſame part in the ſame ſituation; ſuch is the army with which you are to oppoſe the moſt powerful nation upon the globe.</p>
            <p>An experienced officer would rather take his chance with five thouſand Britiſh troops, than with fifty-thouſand ſuch militia. I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to confined my obſervations to the war within the interior parts of the colonies, let us now turn our eyes to our extenſive ſea coaſts; and that we find wholly at the mercy of Great-Britain; our trade, fiſhery, navigation and maritime towns taken from us the very day that war is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, inconceivably ſhocking the ſcene; if we turn our views to the wilderneſs, our back ſettlements a prey to our ancient enemy, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadians, whoſe wounds received from us, in the late war, will bleed afreſh at the proſpect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and to the numerous tribes of ſavages, whoſe tender mercies are cruelties; thus with the Britiſh navy in the front, Canadians and ſavages in the rear, a regular army in the midſt, we muſt be certain that whenever the ſword of civil war is unſheathed, deſolation will paſs through our land like a whirlwind, our houſes be burnt to aſhes, our fair poſſeſſions laid waſte, and he that

               </gap> by the ſword will be happy in eſcaping a more ignominious death.</p>
            <p>I have hitherto gone upon a ſuppoſition, that all the colonies from Nova-Scotia, to Georgia, would unite in the war againſt Great-Britain; but I believe, if we conſider cooly upon the matter, we ſhall find no reaſon to expect any aſſiſtance out of New-England; if ſo, there will be no arm ſtretched out to ſave us, New-England, or perhaps this ſelf-devoted province will fall alone the unpitied victim of its own folly, and furniſh the world with one more inſtance of the fatal conſequences of rebellion.</p>
            <p>I have, as yet, ſaid nothing of the different ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents among ourſelves; upon a ſuperficial view we might imagine that this province was nearly unanimous, but the caſe is far different; a very conſiderable part of the men of property in this province, are at this day firmly attached to the cauſe of government; bodies of men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling perſons to diſavow their ſentiments, to reſign commiſſions, or to ſubſcribe leagues and covenants, has wrought no change in their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, it has only attached them more cloſely to government, and cauſed them to wiſh more ſervently, and to pray more devoutly for its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration; theſe, and thouſands beſide, if they fight at all, will fight under the banner of loyalty.</p>
            <p>I can aſſure you that aſſociations are now form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſeveral parts of this province, for the ſupport of his Majeſty's government and mutual defence; and let me tell you whenever the royal ſtandard ſhall be ſet up, there will be ſuch a flocking to it, as will aſtoniſh the moſt obdurate. And now, in God's name, what is it that has brought us
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014158_0012_0F932FC454F86C68"/>
to this brink of deſtruction? Has not the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Great-Britain been as mild and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the colonies, as in any part of her exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive dominions? Has not ſhe been a nurſing mother to us from the day of our infancy to this time? has ſhe not been indulged almoſt to a fault? Might not each of us at this day have ſat quietly under his own vine and fig-tree, and there have been none to make us afraid, were it not for our own folly? Will not poſterity be amazed when they are told that the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction took its riſe from the parliament's taking off a ſhilling duty on a pound of tea, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing three pence, and call it a more unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able phrenzy, and more diſgraceful to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of America, than that of the witchcraft? I will attempt in the next paper to re-trace the ſteps, and mark the progreſſions that led us to this ſtate.</p>
            <p>I promiſe to do it with fidelity, and if any thing ſhould look like reflecting on individuals, or bodies of men, it muſt be ſet down to my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality, and not to a deſire of cenſuring.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured, laſt week, to convince you of your real danger, not to render you deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, but to induce you to ſeek immediately ſome effectual remedy. Our caſe is not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs, as we have to deal with a nation not leſs generous and humane, than powerful and brave, juſt indeed; but not vindictive.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, in this and ſucceſſive papers, trace this yet growing diſtemper, through its ſeveral ſtages, from its firſt riſe to the preſent hour, point out the cauſes, mark the effects, ſhew the madneſs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014158_0013_0F932FC6542B6038"/>
of perſevering in our preſent line of conduct, and recommend what, I have been long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, is our only remedy. I confeſs myſelf to be one of thoſe that think our preſent calamity is in a great meaſure to be attributed to the bad policy of a popular party in this province, and that their meaſures, for ſeveral years paſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may have been their intention, have been diametrically oppoſite to their proſeſſion, the public good; and cannot, at preſent, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their leaders to a guide that having led a benighted traveller, through many mazes and windings, in a thick wood, finds himſelf at length on the brink of a horrid precipice, and to ſave himſelf ſeizes faſt hold of his follower, to the utmoſt hazard of plunging both head-long down the ſteep, and being daſhed in pieces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in the rocks below.</p>
            <p>In ordinary caſes we may talk in the meaſured language of a courtier; but when ſuch a weight of vengeance is ſuſpended, over our heads by a ſingle thread, and threatens every moment to cruſh us to atoms, delicacy itſelf would be ill-t<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed; I will declare the plain truth wherever I find it, and claim as a right to canvaſs popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar meaſures, and expoſe their errors, and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tendency as freely, as governmental mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are canvaſſed, ſo long as I confine myſelf within the limits of the law.</p>
            <p>At the concluſion of the late war, Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain found, that though ſhe had humbled her enemies, and greatly enlarged her own empire, that the national debt amounted to no leſs than one hundred and fifty millions, and that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual expence of keeping her extended dominions
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014158_0014_0F932FCB815E20D0"/>
in a ſtate of defence, which good policy dictates no leſs in a time of peace than war, was increaſed in proportion to the new acquiſitions. Heavy taxes and duties were already laid, not only upon the luxuries and conveniencies, but even the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life in Great-Britain and Ireland. She knew that her colonies were as much benefited by the conqueſt, in the late war, as any part of the empire; and indeed more ſo, as their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental foes were ſubdued, and they might now extend their ſettlements, not only to Canada, but even to the weſtern ocean. The greateſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was given to agriculture, the natural liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the country, that ever was known in the hiſtory of the world, and their trade pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the Britiſh navy. The revenue to the crown, from America, amounts to but little more than the charges of collecting it. She thought it as reaſonable that the colonies ſhould bear a part of the national burden, as that they ſhould ſhare in the national benefit. For this, purpoſe the ſtamp-act was paſſed. The colonies ſoon found that the duties impoſed by the ſtamp-act would be grievous, and as they were laid upon cuſtom-houſe paper, law proceedings, convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancing, and indeed extended to all their internal trade and dealings. It was generally believed through the colonies, that this was a tax not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceeding our proportion, but beyond our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ability to pay. This idea united the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies generally in oppoſing it. At firſt we did not dream of denying the <hi>authority</hi> of parliament to tax us, much leſs to legiſlate for us. We knew that by our firſt charter, our excluſive right of taxation was to continue but twenty
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014158_0015_0F932FCBBAED4038"/>
years. We had always conſidered ourſelves as a part of the Britiſh empire, and the parliament as the ſupreme legiſlature of the whole. Acts of parliament for regulating internal policy were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar. We had paid poſtage agreeable to act of parliament, for eſtabliſhing a poſt-office, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties impoſed for regulating trade, and even for raiſing a revenue to the crown, without queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the right, though we cloſely adverted to the rate, or quantum. We know that in all thoſe acts of government, the good of the whole had been conſulted, and whenever through want of information, any thing grievous had been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, we were ſure of obtaining redreſs by a proper repreſentation of it. We were happy in our ſubordination; but in an evil hour, under the influence of ſome malignant planet, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was formed of oppoſing the ſtamp-act, by a denial of the right of parliament to make it.</p>
            <p>The love of empire is ſo predominant in the human breaſt, that we rarely find an individual content with relinquiſhing a power that he is able to retain, over a body of men. Some few months after it was known that the ſtamp-act was paſſed, ſome reſolves of the Houſe of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes in Virginia, denying the right of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to tax the colonies, made their appearance. We read them with wonder—they ſavoured of independence, they flattered the human paſſions —the reaſoning was ſpecious—we wiſhed it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive. The tranſition, to believing it ſo, was eaſy—and we, and almoſt all America, followed their example, in reſolving that the parliament had no ſuch right. It now became unpopular to ſuggeſt the contrary; his life would be in danger
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014158_0016_0F932FCC567632C8"/>
that aſſerted it. The news-papers were open to but one ſide of the queſtion, and the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory pieces that iſſued weekly from the preſs, worked the populace to a fit temper to commit the outrage that enſued. A non-importation was agreed upon, which alarmed the merchants and manufacturers in England. It was novel, and the people in England then ſuppoſed that the love of liberty was ſo powerful in an American merchant, as to ſtifle his love of gain, and that the agreement would be religiouſly adhered to. It has been ſaid, that ſeveral thouſands were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in England, to foment the diſturbances there. However that may be, oppoſition to the miniſtry was then gaining ground, from circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances foreign to this. The miniſtry was chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ſtamp-act repealed. The repealing ſtatute paſſed with difficulty however through the Houſe of Lords, forty at leaſt proteſted againſt giving way to ſuch an oppoſition, and foretold what has ſince literally come to paſs in conſequence of it. When the ſtatute was made, impoſing duties upon glaſs, paper, India teas, &amp;c. imported into the colonies, it was ſaid, that this was another inſtance of taxation, for ſome of the dutied comodities were neceſſaries, we had them not within ourſelves, were prohibited from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them from any place, except Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and conſequently were obliged to pay the duties. Accordingly news-paper publications, pamphlets, reſolves, non-importation agreements, and the whole ſyſtem of American oppoſition was again put in motion. We obtained a partial repeal of this ſtatute, which took off the duties from all the articles except teas. This was the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014158_0017_0F932FCD0C5CFE48"/>
lucky moment to have cloſed the diſpute. We might have made a ſafe and honourable retreat. We had gained much, perhaps more than we expected. If the parliament had paſſed an act declarative of their right to tax us, our aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies had reſolved, ten times, that they had no ſuch right. We could not complain of the three penny duty on tea, as burdenſome, for a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling which had been laid upon it, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of regulating the trade, and therefore was allowed to be conſtitutional, was taken off; ſo that we were in fact gainers, nine pence in a pound, by the new regulation. If the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation of the revenue, ariſing, from this ſtatute, was diſreliſhed, it was only our ſtriking off one article of luxury from our manner of living, an article too, which, if we may believe the reſolves of moſt of the towns in this province, or rely on its collected wiſdom in a reſolve of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, was to the laſt degree ruinous to health. It was futile to urge its being a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, as a reaſon for keeping up the ball of contention; for, allowing the ſupreme legiſlature ever to want a precedent, they had many for laying duties on commodities imported into the colonies; one of which I will mention, the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute commonly called the molaſſes act, by which a duty is laid upon molaſſes imported into theſe colonies, and the purpoſe of raiſing a revenue, is expreſsly mentioned: And beſides, we had great reaſon to believe that the remaining part of the ſtatute would be repealed, as ſoon as the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould ſuppoſe it could be done with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to themſelves, as the incidental revenue ariſing from the former regulation, was three-fold
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014158_0018_0F932FCDD879AFA0"/>
to the revenue ariſing from the latter. A claim of the right, could work no injury, ſo long as there was no grievous exerciſe of it, eſpecially as we had proteſted againſt it, through the whole, and could not be ſaid to have departed from our claims in the leaſt. We might now upon good terms have dropped the diſpute, and been happy in the affections of our mother country; but that is yet to come. Party is inſeparable from a free ſtate. The ſeveral diſtributions of power as they are limited by, ſo they create perpetual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions between each other, about their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive boundaries; but the greateſt ſource is the competition of individuals for preferment in the ſtate. Popularity is the ladder by which the partizans uſually climb. Accordingly the ſtrugg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le is, who ſhall have the greateſt ſhare of it. Each party profeſſes diſintereſted patriotiſm, though ſome cynical writers have ventured to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that ſelf-love is the ruling paſſion of the whole. There were two parties in this province of pretty long ſtanding, known by the names of Whig and Tory, which at this time were not a little imbittered againſt each other. Men of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and acknowledged probity were on both ſides. It is not for me to determine which was the real, and which the falſe patriot. If the Tories were ſuſpected of purſuing their private intereſt through the medium of court favour, there was equal reaſon to ſuſpect the Whigs of purſuing their private intereſt by means of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity. Indeed ſome of them owed all their importance to it, and muſt in a little time have ſunk into obſcurity, had theſe turbulent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions then ſubſided.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:014158_0019_0F932FCE88FBD9B8"/>The Tories and Whigs took different routs, as uſual. The Tories were for cloſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy with Great-Britain, the Whigs for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing it; the Tories were for reſtoring govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the province, which had become greatly relaxed by theſe convulſions, to its former tone; the Whigs were averſe to it; they even refuſed to revive a temporary riot act, which expired about this time. Perhaps they thought that mobs were a neceſſary ingredient in their ſyſtem of oppoſition: However, the Whigs had great advantages in the unequal combat, that ſcheme flattered the people with the idea of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; the Tories plan ſuppoſed a degree of ſubordination, which is rather an humiliating idea; beſides, there is a propenſity in men to believe themſelves injured and oppreſſed when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are told ſo: the ferment raiſed in their minds, in the time of the ſtamp-act, was not yet allayed, and the leaders of the Whigs had gained the confidence of the people by their ſucceſs in their former ſtruggles, ſo that they had nothing to do but to keep up the ſpirit among the peop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, and they were ſure of commanding this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. It required ſome pains to prevent their minds ſettling into that calm which is ordinarily the effect of a mild government: the Whigs were ſenſible that there was no oppreſſion that could be either ſeen or felt; if any thing was in reality amiſs in government; it was its being too lax. So far was it from the innocent being in danger of ſuffering, that the moſt attrocious offender eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped with impunity. They accordingly applied themſelves to work upon the imagination, and to inflame the paſſions: for this work they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014158_0020_0F932FCF4AD57000"/>
great talents; I will do juſtice to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity; they were intimately acquainted with the feelings of man, and knew all the avenues of the human heart: Effigies, paintings, and other imagery were exhibited; the fourteenth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt was celebrated annually, as a feſtival in commemoration of a mob's deſtroying a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, owned by the late Lieutenant-Governor, which was ſuppoſed to have been erected for a ſtamp-office, and compelling him to reſign his office of ſtamp-maſter, under liberty-tree; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual orations were delivered, in the Old South Meeting-Houſe, on the fifth of March, the day when ſome perſons were unfortunately killed, by a party of the twenty-ninth regiment; liſts of imaginary grievances were continually publiſhed; the people were told weekly, that the miniſtry had formed a plan to enſlave them; that the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon tea was only a prelude to a window-tax, hearth-tax, land-tax, and poll-tax; and theſe were only paving the way for reducing the country to lordſhips; this laſt bait was the more eaſily ſwallowed; as there ſeems to be an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of that kind hereditary to the people of New-England; and were conjured by the duty they owed themſelves, their country, and their GOD, by the reverence due to the ſacred me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of their anceſtors, and all their toils and ſufferings, in this once inhoſpitable wilderneſs, and by their affection for unborn millions, to rouſe and exert themſelves in the common cauſe. This perpetual incantation kept the people in continual alarm. We were further ſtimulated by being told that the people of England were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, the parliament venal, and the miniſtry
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014158_0021_0F932FD014E209F0"/>
corrupt; nor were attempts wanting to traduce Majeſty itſelf. The kingdom of Great-Britain was depictured as an antient ſtructure, once the admiration of the world, now ſliding from its baſe, and ruſhing to its fall. At the ſame time we were called upon to mark out our own rapid growth, and behold the certain evidence, that America was upon the eve of independant em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>When we conſider what effects a well-wrote tragedy, or novel, has on the human paſſions, though we know it all to be ficticious, what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect muſt all this have had upon thoſe that have believed all theſe high wrought images to be realities?</p>
            <p>The Tories have been cenſured for remiſſneſs in not having exerted themſelves ſufficiently at this period: The truth of the caſe is this, they ſaw, and ſhuddered at the gathering ſtorm, but durſt not attempt to diſpel it, leſt it ſhould burſt on their own heads. Printers were threatened with the loſs of their bread, for publiſhing freely on the Tory ſide. One Mein was forced to fly the country for perſiſting in it.</p>
            <p>All our diſſenting miniſters were not inactive on this occaſion. When the clergy engage in a political warfare, they become a moſt powerful engine, either to ſupport or overthrow the ſtate. What effect muſt it have had upon the audience, to hear the ſame ſentiments and principles, which they had before read in a news-paper, delivered on Sundays from the ſacred deſk, with a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious awe, and the moſt ſolemn appeals to Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, from lips which they had been taught, from their cradles, to believe could utter nothing but
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014158_0022_0F932FD0CC5205B0"/>
eternal truths? What, was it natural to expect from a people bred under a free conſtitution, jealous of their liberty, credulous even to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, when told their privileges were in danger, thus wrought up in the extreme? I anſwer:— Outrage diſgraceful to humanity itſelf. What miſchief was not an artful man who had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the confidence and guidance of ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged multitude capable of doing? He had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to point out this or the other man as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of his country, and no character, ſtation, or merit could protect the proſcribed, from their fury. Happy was it for him if he could ſecret his perſon, and ſubject his property only to their lawleſs ravages. By ſuch means, many people, naturally brave and humane, have been wrought upon to commit ſuch acts of private miſchief, and public violence, as will blacken many a page in the hiſtory of our country.</p>
            <p>I ſhall next trace the effects of this ſpirit which the Whigs had infuſed into the body of the people, through the courts of common law, and the General Aſſembly, and mark the ways and means whereby they availed themſelves of it to the ſubverſion of our charter conſtitution, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to the late act of Parliament, and erected a provincial democracy, or rather republic upon its ruins, though the form and ſemblance of the monarchial and ariſtocratical parts ſtill remained.</p>
            <p>To undertake to convince a perſon of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, is the indiſpenſable duty, the certain, tho' dangerous teſt of friendſhip. He that could ſee his friend perſevering in a fatal error, without reminding him of it, and ſtriving to reclaim him, through fear that he might thereby incur
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014158_0023_0F932FD1892AA248"/>
his diſpleaſure, would little deſerve the ſacred name himſelf. Such delicacy is not only falſe, but criminal. Were I not fully convinced, upon the moſt mature deliberation that I am capable of, the temporal ſalvation of this province de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon an entire and ſpeedy change of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which muſt depend upon a change of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, reſpecting our own conduct, and the juſtice of the Britiſh nation, I never ſhould have obtruded myſelf on the public. I repeat my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to avoid perſonal reflection as much as the nature of the taſk will admit of; but will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue faithfully to expoſe the wretched policy of the Whigs, though I may be obliged to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the arcana, and diſcover ſuch things as, were there not a neceſſity for it, I ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely happier in drawing a veil over, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them with a mantle. Should I be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate as to incur your diſpleaſure, I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs think myſelf happy if I can but ſnatch one of my fellow ſubjects, as a brand, out of the burning.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome may imagine that I have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented too many of my countrymen, as well as the leading Whigs, in an unjuſt point of light, by ſuppoſing them ſo wicked as to miſlead, or thoſe ſo little circumſpect as to be miſled, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the laſt importance. Whoever has been converſant with the hiſtory of man, muſt know that it abounds with ſuch inſtances. The ſame game, and with the ſame ſucceſs, has been play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all ages, and all countries.</p>
            <p>The bulk of the people are generally but little verſed in matters of ſtate. Want of inclination or opportunity to figure in public life, makes
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014158_0024_0F932FD24869B3A8"/>
them content to reſt the affairs of government in the hands where accident, or merit, has placed them. Their views and employments are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the humbler walks of buſineſs or retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There is a latent ſpark however in their breaſts, capable of being kindled into a flame; to do this has always been the employment of the diſaffected. They begin by reminding the people of the elevated rank they hold in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, as men; that all men by nature are equal; that Kings are but the miniſters of the people; that their authority is delegated to them by the people, for their good, and they have a right to reſume it, and place it in other hands, or keep it themſelves, whenever it is made uſe of to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs them. Doubtleſs there have been inſtances where theſe principles have been inculcated to obtain a redreſs of real grievances; but they have been much oftener perverted to the worſt of purpoſes.—No government, however perfect in theory, is adminiſtered in perfection, the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of man does not admit of it. A ſmall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in point of policy, often furniſhes a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to libel government, and perſuade the people that their rulers are tyrants, and the whole government a ſyſtem of oppreſſion. Thus the ſeeds of ſedition are uſually ſown, and the people are led to ſacrifice real liberty to licentiouſneſs, which gradually ripens into rebellion and civil war. And what is ſtill more to be lamented, the generality of the people, who are thus made the dupes of artifice, and the mere ſtilts of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are ſure to be looſers in the end. The beſt they can expect is to be thrown neglected by, when they are no longer wanted; but they are
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014158_0025_0F932FD31DE482F8"/>
ſeldom ſo happy; if they are ſubdued, confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eſtate, and an ignominious death are their portion; if they conquer, their own army is often turned upon them, to ſubjugate them to a more tyrannical government than they had rebelled againſt. Hiſtory is replete with inſtances of this kind. We can trace them in remote antiquity, we find them in modern times, and have a very remarkable one in the very country from which we were derived. It is an univerſal truth, that he that would excite a rebellion, whatever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of philantrophy he may make when he is inſinuating and worming himſelf into the good graces of the people, is at heart as great a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as ever wielded the iron rod of oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I ſhall have occaſion hereafter to conſider this matter more fully, when I ſhall endeavour to convince you how little we can gain, and how much we may looſe, by this unequal, unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and deſperate conteſt. My preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to trace the ſpirit of oppoſition to Great- Britain through the general court, and the courts of common law. In moderate times, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative that votes for an unpopular meaſure, or oppoſes a popular one, is in danger of looſing his election the next year, and when party runs high, he is ſure to do it. It was the policy of the Whigs to have their queſtions upon high matters determined by yea and nay votes, which were publiſhed with the repreſentatives names in the next Gazette. This was commonly followed by ſevere ſtrictures, and the moſt illeberal invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives upon the diſſentients; ſometimes they were held up as objects of reſentment and contempt, at others the abuſe was in proportion to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014158_0026_0F932FD3CCD0CEB8"/>
of the meaſure they oppoſed. This may ſeem not worth notice, but its conſequences were important. The ſcurrillity made its way into the diſſentient's town, it furniſhed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor with means to ſupplant them, and he took care to ſhun the rock his predeceſſor had ſplit upon. In this temper of the times, it was enough to know who voted with Caſſius, and who with Lucius, to determine who was a friend, and who was an enemy to the country, without once adverting to the queſtion before the houſe. The loſs of a ſeat in the houſe was not of ſo much conſequence, but when once he became ſtigmatized as an enemy to his country, he was expoſed to inſult, and if his profeſſion, or buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was ſuch, that his livelihood depended much on the good graces of his fellow citizens, he was in danger of looſing his bread, and involving his whole family into ruin.</p>
            <p>One particular ſet of members in committee, always prepared the reſolves, and other ſpirited meaſures: at firſt they were canvaſſed freely, at length would, ſlide through the houſe without meeting any obſtacle, the lips of the diſſentients were ſealed up; they ſat in ſilence, and beheld with infinite regret the meaſures they durſt not oppoſe. Many were borne down againſt their wills, by the violence of the current; upon no other principle can we reconcile their oſtenſible conduct in the houſe to their declarations in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate circles. The apparent unanimity in the houſe encouraged the oppoſition out of doors, and that in its turn ſtrengthened the party in the houſe. Thus they went on mutually ſupporting and up-lifting each other. Aſſemblies and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014158_0027_0F932FD48B7E3708"/>
towns reſolved alternately, ſome of them only omitted reſolving to ſnatch the ſceptre out of the hands of our Sovereign, and to ſtrike the imperial crown from his ſacred head.</p>
            <p>A maſter-ſtroke in polities, reſpecting the agent, ought not to be neglected. Each colony has uſually an agent reſiding at the court of Great-Britain. Theſe agents are appointed by the three branches of their ſeveral aſſemblies, and indeed there cannot be a provincial agent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch appointment. The Whigs ſoon found that they could not have ſuch ſervices rendered them from a provincial agent, as would anſwer their purpoſes. The houſe therefore refuſed to join with the other two branches of the general court in the appointment. The houſe choſe an agent for themſelves, and the council appointed theirs. Thus we had two agents for private purpoſes, and the expence of agency doubled, and with equal reaſon a third might have been added as agent for the governor, and the charges have been trebled.</p>
            <p>The additional expence was of little conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, compared with another inconveniency that attended this new mode of agency. The perſon appointed by the houſe was the oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible agent of the province, though in fact he was only the agent of a few individuals that had got the art of wielding the houſe at their pleaſure. He knew his continuing in office depended upon them. An office that yielded ſeveral thouſand pounds ſterling annually; the buſineſs of which conſiſted in little more than attending the levees of the great, and writing letters to America, was worth-preſerving. Thus he was under a
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014158_0028_0F932FD54A01D808"/>
ſtrong temptation to ſacrifice the province to a party; and echo back the ſentiments of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons.</p>
            <p>The advice continually received from one of the perſons, that was thus appointed agent, had great influence upon the members of the houſe of moderate principles. He had puſhed his reſearches deep into nature, and made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant diſcoveries; they thought he had done the ſame in politicks, and did not admire him leſs as a politician than as a philoſopher. His intelligence as to the diſpoſition of his Majeſty, the miniſtry, the parliament, and the nation in general, was deemed the moſt authentic. He adviſed us to keep up our opposition, to reſolve, and re-reſolve, to cheriſh a military ſpirit, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly holding up this idea, that if we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued firm we had nothing to fear from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in England. He even propoſed ſome modes of oppoſition himſelf. The ſpirited mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were always uſhered into the houſe with a letter from him. I have been ſometimes almoſt ready to ſuſpect him of being the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> and to think, that like the man behind the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at a puppet ſhow, he was playing off the figures here with his own ſecret wires. If he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to theſe meaſures, contrary to his better knowledge, from ſiniſter views, and to ſerve a private purpoſe, he has wilfully done the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince an irreparable injury.—However, I will do him juſtice, he enjoined upon us to refrain from violence, as that would unite the nation againſt us; and I am the rather inclined to think that he was deceived himſelf with reſpect to the meaſures he recommended, as he has already
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014158_0029_0F932FD612827EB0"/>
felt the reſentment of that very government which he told us there was nothing to fear from. This diſpoſition of the houſe could not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſuch fatal conſequences, had the other two branches of the legiſlature retained their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional freedom and influence. They might have been a ſufficient check.</p>
            <p>The counſellors depended upon the general aſſembly for the political exiſtence, the Whigs reminded the council of their mortality, if a counſellor oppoſed the violent meaſures of the Whigs with any ſpirit, he loſt his election the next May. The council conſiſted of twenty- eight. From this principle near half that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, moſtly men of the firſt families, firſt note, abilities, with every poſſible attachment to their native country, and as far from temptation as wealth, and independence, could remove them, were tumbled from their ſeats in diſgrace. Thus the board which was intended to moderate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two extremes of prerogative and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, loſt its weight in the ſcale, and the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical balance of the province was deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Had the chair been able to retain its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional influence, the loſs of the board would have been leſs felt, but no longer ſupported by the board that fell likewiſe. The governor by the charter could do little, or nothing, without the council. If he called upon a military officer to raiſe the militia, he was anſwered, they were there already. If called upon the council for their aſſiſtance, they muſt firſt enquire into the cauſe. If he wrote to government at home to ſtrengthen his hands, ſome officious perſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and ſent back his letters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:014158_0030_0F932FD6CF4CC750"/>It was not the perſon of a Bernard or Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinſon that made them obnoxious, any other perſon would have met with the ſame fate, had they diſcharged their duty with equal fidelity; that is, had they ſtrenuouſly oppoſed the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and practices of the Whigs; and when they found the government here could not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port itſelf, and ſent home for aid ſufficient to do it. And let me tell you, had the intimations in thoſe letters which you are taught to execrate, been tamely attended to, we had now been as happy a people as good government could make us. Governor Bernard came here recommended by the affections of the province, over which he had preſided. His abilities are acknowledged. His true Britiſh honeſty, and punctuality, are traits in his character too ſtrongly marked, to eſcape the eye of prejudice itſelf. We knew Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Hutchinſon to be amiable and exemplary in private life; his great abilities, integrity and humanity are conſpicuous in the ſeveral impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant departments that he filled, before his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to the chair, and reflect honour upon his native country. But his abilities and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, added to his thorough knowledge of the province, in all its intereſts and connections, were inſufficient in this caſe. The conſtitution itſelf was gone, though the ancient form re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained; the ſpirit was truly republican. He endeavoured to reclaim us by gentle means. He ſtrove to convince us by arguments, drawn from the firſt principles of government, our ſeveral charters, and the expreſs acknowledgement of our anceſtors, that our claims were inconſiſtent with the ſubordination due to Great-Britain; and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:014158_0031_0F932FD793028BF0"/>
if perſiſted in, would work the deſtruction of thoſe that we were intitled to. For this he was called an enemy to this country, and ſet up as a mark for the envenomed arrows of malice and party rage. Had I entertained a doubt about its being the governor, and not the man that was aimed at, the admirable facility with which the news-paper abuſe was tranſmitted from gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Hutchinſon, to his amiable ſucceſſor, almoſt as ſoon as he ſet foot on our ſhores, would have removed it.</p>
            <p>Thus, diſaffection to Great-Britain being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into the body of the people, the ſubtle poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſtole through all the veins and arteries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated the blood, and deſtroyed the very ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina of the conſtitution. Had not the courts of juſtice been tainted in the early ſtages, our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment might have expelled the virus, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered its former vigour by its own ſtrength. The judges of the ſuperior court were dependent upon the annual grants of the General court, for their ſupport. Their ſalaries were ſmall in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the ſalaries of other officers in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of leſs importance.</p>
            <p>They had often petitioned the aſſembly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large them, without ſucceſs. They were at this time reminded of their dependance. However, it is but juſtice to ſay, that the Judges remained unſhaken amidſt the raging tempeſts, which is to be attributed rather to their firmneſs than ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the ſpirit of the times was very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in the juries. The grand jurors were elective, and in ſuch places where libels, riots and inſurrections were the moſt frequent, the high Whigs got themſelves choſen. The Judges
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:014158_0032_0F932FD84E6FFBE0"/>
pointed out to them the ſeditious libels on Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, Magiſtrates, and the whole government, to no effect. They were enjoined to preſent riots and inſurrections, of which there was ample evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with as little ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to account for ſo many of the firſt-rate Whigs being returned to ſerve on the petit jury at the term next after extraordinary inſurrection, without ſuppoſing ſome legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in drawing their names out of the box. It is certain that notwithſtanding ſwarms of the moſt virulent libels infected the province, and there were ſo many riots and inſurrections, ſcarce one offender was indicted, and, I think, not one convicted. Cauſes of <hi>meum et tuum</hi> were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exempt from party influence. The mere circumſtance of the Whigs gaining the aſcenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy over the Tories is trifling. Had the Whigs divided the province between them, as they once flattered themſelves they ſhould be able to do, it would have been of little conſequence to the community, had they not cut aſunder the very ſinews of government, and broke in pieces the ligaments of ſocial life in the attempt. I will mention two inſtances which I have ſelected out of many, of the weakneſs of our government, as they are recent and unconnected with acts of parliament. One Malcolm, a loyal ſubject, and as ſuch intitled to protection, the evening before the laſt winter ſeſſions of the general court, was dragged out of his houſe, ſtript, tarred and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and carted ſeveral hours in the ſevereſt froſt of that winter, to the utmoſt hazard of his life. He was carried to the gallows with a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about his neck, and in his paſſage to and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:014158_0033_0F932FD90D6AB140"/>
from the gallows, was beaten with as cruel ſtripes as ever were adminiſtered by the hands of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage. The whipping, however, kept up the circulation of his blood, and ſaved the poor man's life. When they had ſaciated their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, they diſperſed in good order. This was tranſacted in the preſence of thouſands of ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, ſome of whom were members of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral court. Malcom's life was deſpaired of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days, but he ſurvived, and preſented a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial to the general aſſembly, praying their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition. The petition was read, and all he obtained was leave to withdraw it. So that he was deſtitute of protection every hour, until he left the country, as were thouſands beſides, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the arrival of the King's troops. This origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from a ſmall fracas in the ſtreet, wherein Malcom ſtruck, or threatened to ſtrike a perſon that inſulted him, with a cutlaſs, and had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the quarrel of the times, unleſs his ſuſtaining a ſmall poſt in the cuſtoms made it.</p>
            <p>The other inſtance is much ſtronger than this, as it was totally detached from politics. It had been ſuſpected that infection had been commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from an hoſpital, lately erected at Marble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, for the purpoſe of inoculating ſmall-pox, to the town's people.</p>
            <p>This cauſed a great inſurrection, the inſurgents burnt the hoſpital, not content with that, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the proprietors and many others, ſome of the firſt fortunes and characters in the town, with burning their houſes over their heads, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued parading the ſtreets, to the utmoſt terror of the inhabitants, ſeveral days.</p>
            <p>A maſſacre and general devaſtation was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:014158_0034_0F932FD9D0A8C158"/>
The perſons threatened, armed themſelves, and petitioned the general aſſembly, which was then ſitting, for aſſiſtance, as there was little or no civil authority in the place. A committee was ordered to repair to Marblehead, report the facts, and enquire into the cauſe. The committee reported the facts nearly as ſtated in the petition; the report was accepted, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further done by the aſſembly. Such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the weakneſs of government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many perſons to join the Whigs, to ſeek from them that protection which the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional authority of the province was unable to afford.</p>
            <p>Government at home, early in the day, made an effort to check us in our career, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to recover from anarchy, without her being driven to the neceſſity of altering our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial conſtitution, knowing the predeliction that people always have for an ancient form of government. The judges of the ſuperior court had not been ſtaggered, though their feet ſtood in ſlippery places, they depended upon the leading Whigs for their ſupport. To keep them ſteady, they were made independent of the grants of the general aſſembly. But it was not a remedy any way adequate to the diſeaſe. The Whigs now turned their artillery againſt them, and it played briſkly. The Chief Juſtice, for accepting the crown grant, was accuſed of receiving a royal bribe. Thus, my friends, thoſe very perſons that had made you believe that every attempt to ſtrengthen government and ſave our charter, was an infringement of your privileges; by little and little deſtroyed your real liberty, ſubverted your
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014158_0035_0F932FDAA6C49368"/>
charter conſtitution, abridged the freedom of the houſe, annihilated the freedom of the board, and rendered the governor a mere Doge of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice. They ingroſſed all the power of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince into their own hands. A democracy or republic I once called it, but it does not deſerve the name of either; it was however, a deſpotiſm, cruelly carried into execution by mobs and riots, and more incompatible with the rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, than the enormous monarchies of the eaſt. The abſolute neceſſity of the interpoſition of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is apparent. The good policy of the act for regulating the government in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, will be the ſubject of ſome future paper. A particular enquiry into the deſpotiſm of the Whigs will be deferred for a chapter on congreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. I ſhall next aſk your attention to a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action as important in its conſequences, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more ſo, than any I have yet mentioned, I mean the deſtruction of the tea, belonging to the Eaſt India Company. I am ſenſible of the difficulty of the taſk, in combating general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinions. It is hard work to eradicate deep-rooted prejudices. But I will perſevere.

I will tell you; it is a native of this province, that knew it before many that are now baſking in the rays of political ſun-ſhine, had a being. He was favoured not by Whigs or Tories, but the people, with ſuch a ſtand in the community, as that he could diſtinctly ſee all the political ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeuvres of the province. He ſaw ſome with pleaſure, others with pain. If he condemns the conduct of Whigs, he does not always approve of the conduct of the Tories. He dwells upon the miſconduct of the former, becauſe that has been the means of bringing us into this wretched ſtate, unleſs the ſupineſs of the latter, at ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, and ſome impolitic efforts, to check the Whigs in their carreer, at others, that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">

               </gap> like adding fuel to fire, ought to be added to the account. He is now repaying your favours, if he knows his own heart, from the pureſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and the moſt undiſſembled patriotiſm, which will one day be acknowledged. I ſaw the ſmall ſeed of ſedition, when it was implanted, it was as a grain of muſtard. I have watched the plant, till it has become a great tree, the vileſt reptiles that crawl upon the earth, are concealed at the root, the fouleſt birds of the air reſt upon its branches. I now would induce you to go to work immediately with axes and hatchets, and cut it down; for a two-fold reaſon, becauſe it is a peſt to ſociety, and leſt it be felled ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a ſtronger arm, and cruſh its thouſands in its fall.</p>
            <p>An apprehenſion of injuſtice in the conduct of Great-Britain towards us, I have already told
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014158_0037_0F932FDC26DD0150"/>
you was the ſource of our miſery. Laſt week I endeavoured to convince you of the neceſſity of her regulating, or rather eſtabliſhing ſome go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment amongſt us. I am now to point out the principles and motives upon which the blockade act was made. It was the violent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack upon the property of the Eaſt-India Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, in the deſtruction of their tea. In order to form a right judgement of that tranſaction, it is neceſſary to go back, and view the cauſe of its being ſent here. As the government of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is mixed, ſo the ſpirit or genius of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is at once monarchical, ariſtocratical, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical, martial and commercial. It is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to determine which is the moſt predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant principle; but it is worthy of remark, that to injure the Britiſh nation upon either of theſe points, is like injuring a Frenchman in the point of honour. Commerce is the great ſource of national wealth, for this reaſon it is cheriſhed by all orders of men, from the palace to the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. In ſome countries a merchant is held in contempt by the nobles, in England they reſpect him. He riſes to high honours in the ſtate, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten contracts alliances with the firſt families in the kingdom, and noble blood flows in the veins of his poſterity. Trade is founded upon perſons, or countries, mutually ſupplying each other with their redundancies. Thus none are empoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all enriched, the aſperities of human life worn away, and mankind made happier by it. Huſbandry, manufacture and merchandiſe are its treple ſupport, deprived of either of theſe, it would ceaſe.</p>
            <p>Agriculture is the natural livelihood of a
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:014158_0038_0F932FDCCC574570"/>
country but thinly inhabited, as arts and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures are of a opulous one. The high price of labour prevents manufactures being carried on to advantage in the firſt, ſcarcity of ſoil obliges the inhabitants to purſue them in the latter. Upon theſe, and conſiderations ariſing from the fertility, and produce of different clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, and ſuch like principles, the grand ſyſtem of the Britiſh trade is founded. The collected wiſdom of the nation has always been attentive to this great point of policy, that the national trade might be ſo balanced and poiſed, as that each part of her extended dominions, might be benefited, and the whole concentre to the good of the empire. This evinces the neceſſity of acts for regulating trade.</p>
            <p>To prevent one part of the empire being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched at the expence and impoveriſhing of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, checks, reſtrictions, and ſometimes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute prohibitions are neceſſary. Theſe are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or taken off as circumſtances vary. To carry the acts of trade into execution many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers are neceſſity. Thus we ſee a number of cuſtom-houſe officers ſo conſtituted as to be checks and controuls upon each other, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their ſwerving from their duty, ſhould they be tempted, and a board of commiſſioners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſupperintend the whole, like the board of trade in England. Hence alſo ariſes the neceſſity of courts of admiralty.</p>
            <p>The laws and regulations of trade are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in England, ſacred. And an eſtate made by ſmuggling, or purſuing an illicit trade, is there looked upon as filthy lucre, as monies amaſſed by gaming, and upon the ſame principle, becauſe
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:014158_0039_0F932FDD883F5018"/>
it is obtained at the expence, and often ruin, of others. The ſmuggler not only injures the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, but often ruins the fair trader.</p>
            <p>The great extent of ſea-coaſt, many harbours, the variety of iſlands, the numerous creeks, and navigable rivers, afford the greateſt opportunity to drive an illicit trade in theſe colonies without detection. This advantage has not been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked by the avaricious, and many perſons ſeem to have ſet the laws of trade at defiance; this accounts ſo far for many new regulations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, new officers being appointed, and ſhips of war from time to time ſtationed along the continent. The way to Holland and back again is well known, and by much the greateſt part of tea that has been drank in America, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years, has been imported from thence, and other places, in direct violation of law. By this the ſmugglers have amaſſed great eſtates, to the prejudice of the fair trader. It was ſenſibly felt at the India Houſe, the Eaſt India company were prohibited from exporting their teas to America, they were obliged to ſell it by auction in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; the London merchant purchaſed it, and put a profit upon it, when he ſhipped it for Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; the American merchant, in his turn, put a profit upon it and after him, the ſhop-keeper; ſo that it came to the conſumer's hands at a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advanced price. Such quantities of tea were annually ſmuggled that it was ſcarcely worth while for the American merchant to import tea from England at all, not becauſe the Dutch was uſually ſold at a lower rate to the conſumer, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general were no gainers by it, but becauſe it leſſened the demand for that article.

the principal trading towns in America were wholly ſupplied with this commodity by ſmugg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; Boſton however continued to import it, until advice was received that parliament had it in contemplation to permit the Eaſt-India com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to ſend their teas directly to America: the Boſton merchants then ſent their orders condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally to their correſpondents in England, to have tea ſhipt for them in caſe the Eaſt-India company's did not come out; one merchant, a great Whig, had ſuch an order lying in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, for ſixty cheſts, on his own account, when the company's tea was ſent. An act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made to enable the Eaſt-India compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to ſend their tea directly to America, and ſell it at auction there, not with a view of raiſing a revenue from the three-penny duty, but to put it out of the power of the ſmugglers to injure them by their infamous trade.</p>
            <p>We have it from good authority, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue was not the conſideration before parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe it, for had that been the point in view, it was only to reſtore the former regulation, which was then allowed to be the conſtitutional, and the revenue would have been reſpectable. Had this new regulation taken effect, the people in America would have been great gainers. The wholeſale merchant might have been deprived of ſome of his gains; but the retailer would have ſupplied himſelf with this article, directly from the auction, and the conſumer reap the benefit, as tea would have been ſold under the price that had been uſual, by near one half. Thus the country in general would have been great gainers, the Eaſt-India

company ſecured in ſupplying the American market with this article, which they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to by the laws of trade, and ſmuggling ſuppreſſed, at leaſt as to tea. A ſmuggler and a Whig are couſin Germans, the offspring of two ſiſters, avarice and ambition. They had been playing into each others hands a long time. The ſmuggler reeeived protection from the Whig, and he in his turn received ſupport from the ſmuggler. The illicit trader now demands protection from his kinſman, and it would have been unnatural in him to have refuſed it, and beſides, an opportunity preſented of ſtrengthening his own intereſt. The conſignees were connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Tories, and that was a further ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus.—Accordingly the preſs was again ſet to work, and the old ſtory repeated with addition about monopolies, and many infatuated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons once more wrought up to a proper pitch to carry into execution any violent meaſures that their leaders ſhould propoſe. A bold ſtroke was reſolved upon. The Whigs, though they had got the art of managing the people, had too much ſenſe to be ignorant that it was all a meer fineſſe, not only without, but directly repugnant to law, conſtitution and government, and could not laſt always. They determined to put all at hazard, and to be <hi>aut Caeſar, aut nullus</hi> The conſignees ſaw the approaching ſtorm, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the firſt ſhip that arrived with the tea at Caſtle William, a body meeting was aſſembled at the Old South Meeting-Houſe, and a body meeting has great advantages over a town-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as no law has yet aſcertained a qualification of the voters; each perſon preſent, of whatever
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:014158_0042_0F932FE090C18148"/>
age, eſtate or country, may take the liberty to ſpeak or vote at ſuch an aſſembly; and that might ſerve as a ſcreen to the town where it ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated, in caſe of any diſaſtrous conſequence. The body meeting conſiſting of ſeveral thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, being thus aſſembled, with the leading Whigs at its head, in the firſt place ſent for the owner of the tea ſhip, and required of him to bring her to the wharf, upon pain of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; the ſhip was accordingly brought up, and the maſter was obliged to enter at the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-houſe: He reported the tea, after which twenty days are allowed for landing it, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duty.</p>
            <p>The next ſtep was to reſolve.— They reſolved, that the tea ſhould not be landed, nor the duty paid, that it ſhould go home in the ſame bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom that it came in, &amp;c. &amp;c. This was the ſame as reſolving to deſtroy it, for as the ſhip had been compelled to come to the wharf, and was entered at the cuſtom-houſe, it could not, by law, be cleared out, without the duties being firſt paid, nor could the governor grant a permit for the veſſel to paſs Caſtle-William, without a certificate from the cuſtom-houſe of ſuch clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, conſiſtent with his duty. The body ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, ordered a military guard to watch the ſhip every night until further orders. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignees had been applied to, by the ſelectmen, to ſend the tea to England, they anſwered they could not, for if they did, it would be forfeited by the acts of trade, and they ſhould be liable to make good the loſs to the Eaſt-India company. Some of the conſignees were mobbed, and all were obliged to fly to the caſtle, and there im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:014158_0043_0F932FE14E367168"/>
themſelves. They petitioned the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Council to take the property of the Eaſt-India company under their protection. The Council declined being concerned in it. The conſignees then offered the body to ſtore the tea under the care of the ſelectmen, or a committee of the town of Boſton, and to have no further concern in the matter until they could ſend to England, and receive further inſtructions from their principals. This was refuſed with diſdain. The military guard was regularly kept in rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till the eve of the twentieth day, when the duties muſt have been paid, the tea landed, or become forfeit; then the military guard was withdrawn, or rather omitted being poſted, and a number of perſons in diſguiſe, forceably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the ſhips (three being by this time arrived) ſplit open the cheſts, and emptied all the tea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ten thouſand pounds ſterling value, into the dock, and perfumed the whole town with its fragrance. Another circumſtance ought not to be omitted, the afternoon before the deſtruction of the tea, the body ſent the owner of one of the ſhips to the Governor, to demand a paſs, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he would as ſoon give a paſs for that as any other veſſel, if he had the proper cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate from the cuſtom-houſe, without which he could not give a paſs for any, conſiſtent with his duty. It was known that this would be the anſwer, when the meſſage was ſent, and it was with the utmoſt difficulty that the body was kept together till the meſſenger returned. When the report was made, a ſhout was ſet up in the galleries and at the door, and the meeting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſperſed. The governor had, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:014158_0044_0F932FE2089ED150"/>
to this, ſent a proclamation by the ſheriff, commanding the body to diſperſe; they permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to be read, and anſwered it with a general hiſs. Theſe are the facts as truly and fairly ſtated, as I am able to ſtate them. The oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible reaſon for this conduct, was the tea's being ſubject to the three penny duty. Let us take the advocates for this tranſaction upon their own principle, and admit the duty to be unconſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and ſee how the argument ſtands.</p>
            <p>Here is a cargo of tea, ſubject upon its being entered and landed, to a duty of three-pence per pound, which is paid by the Eaſt-India compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or their factors, which amounts to the ſame thing. Unleſs we purchaſe the tea, we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pay the duty, if we purchaſe it, we pay the three pence included in the price; therefore, leſt we purchaſe it, we have no right to deſtroy it. A flimſy pretext! and either ſuppoſes the people deſtitute of virtue, or that their purchaſing the tea was a matter of no importance to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; but even this gauſe covering is ſo ſtript off, when we conſider that the Boſton mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and ſome who were active at the body meeting, were every day importing from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> large quantities of tea, ſubject to the ſame duty, and vending it unmoleſted; and at this time had orders lying in their correſpondents hands, to ſend them conſiderable quantities of tea, in caſe the Eaſt-India company ſhould not ſend it themſelves.</p>
            <p>When the news of this tranſaction arrived in England, and it was conſidered in what manner almoſt every other regulation of trade had been evaded by artifice, and when artifice could no
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:014158_0045_0F932FE5288BAF38"/>
longer ſerve, recourſe was had to violence, the Britiſh lion was rouſed. The crown lawyers were called upon for the law, they anſwered high treaſon. Had a Cromwell, whom ſome amongſt us deify, and imitate in all his imitable perfections, had the guidance of the national ire, unleſs compenſation had been made to the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers immediately, upon its being demanded, your proud capital would have been levelled with the duſt, not content with that, rivers of blood would have been ſhed to make atonement for the injured honour of the nation. It was debated, whether to attaint the principals of treaſon. We have a gracious King upon the throne, he felt the reſentment of a man, ſoftened by the relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a parent. The bowels of our mother country yearned towards her refractory, obſtinate child.</p>
            <p>It was determined to conſider the offence in a milder light; and to compel an indemnification for the ſufferers, and prevent the like for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by ſuch means as would be mild, compared with the inſult to the nation, or ſevere as our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conduct ſhould be; that was to depend upon us. Accordingly the blockade act was paſſed, and had an act of juſtice been done in indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the ſufferers, and an act of loyalty in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſtop to ſeditious practices, our port had long ſince been opened. This act has been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unjuſt, becauſe it involves the innocent in the ſame predicament with the guilty, but it ought to be conſidered that our news papers had announced to the world, that ſeveral thouſands attended thoſe body meetings, and it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that there was one diſſentient, or any proteſt
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:014158_0046_0F932FE60C8C18E0"/>
entered. I do not know how a perſon could expect diſtinction in ſuch a caſe, if he neglected to diſtinguiſh himſelf. When the noble Lord propoſed in the houſe of commons, he called upon all the members preſent, to mention a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter method of obtaining juſtice in this caſe, ſcarce one denied the neceſſity of doing ſomething, but none could mention a more eligible way. Even miniſterial oppoſition was abaſhed. If any part of the act ſtrikes us like the ſeverity of a maſter, let us cooly advert to the aggravated inſult, and perhaps we ſhall wonder at the lenity of a parent. After this tranſaction all parties ſeem to have laid upon their oars, waiting to ſee what parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would do. When the blockade act arrived many and many were deſirous of paying for the tea immediately, and ſome who were guiltleſs of the crime, offered to contribute to the compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, but our leading Whigs muſt ſtill rule the roaſt, and that inauſpicious influence that had brought us hitherto, plunged us ſtill deeper into miſery. The Whigs ſaw their ruin connected with a compliance with the terms of opening the port, as it would furniſh a convincing proof of the wretchedneſs of their policy, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the tea, and they might juſtly been expected to pay the money demanded themſelves, and ſet themſelves induſtriouſly to work to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, and engage other colonies to eſpouſe their cauſe. This was a criſis too important and alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the province to be neglected by its friends. A number of as reſpectable perſons as any in this province, belonging to Boſton, Cambridge, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and Marblehead, now came forward, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to diſavow the proceedings of the Whigs,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:014158_0047_0F932FE7FAD55720"/>
to do juſtice to the much injured character of Mr. Hutchinſon, and ſtrengthening his influence at the court of Great-Britain, where he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receive the well deſerved plaudit of his Sovereign, that he might be able to obtain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, or ſome mitigation of that act, the terms of which they foreſaw, the perverſeneſs of the Whigs would prevent a compliance with. This was done by ſeveral addreſſes, which were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by upwards of two hundred perſons, and would have been by many more, had not the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den embarkation of Mr. Hutchinſon prevented it. The juſtices of the court of common pleas and general ſeſſions of the peace for the county of Plymouth, ſent their addreſs to him in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. There were ſome of all orders of men among theſe addreſſers. But they conſiſted prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally of men of property, large family connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſeveral were independant in their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and lived wholy upon the income of their eſtates. Some indeed might be called party-men, but a very conſiderable proportion were perſons that had of choice kept themſelves at a diſtance from the political vortex, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the competition of the Whigs and Tories without any commotion, while the community remained ſafe, had looked down on the political dance in its various mazes and intricacies, and ſaw one falling, another riſing, rather as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of amuſement; but when they ſaw the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the province upon the point of being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed by political cunning, it called up all their feelings.</p>
            <p>Their motives were truly patriotic. Let us now attend to the ways and means by which the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:014158_0048_0F932FE831FE04F8"/>
Whigs prevented theſe exertions producing ſuch effects. Previous to this, a new, and till lately, unheard of, mode of oppoſition had been deviſed, ſaid to be the invention of the fertile brain of one of our party agents, called a committee of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence. This is the fouleſt, ſubtleſt, and moſt venomous ſerpent that ever iſſued from the eggs of ſedition. Theſe committees generally conſiſt of the higheſt Whigs, or at leaſt there are Whigs among them, that is the ruling ſpirit of the whole.</p>
            <p>They are commonly appointed at thin town meetings, or if the meetings happen to be full, the moderate men ſeldom ſpeak, or act at all, when this ſort of buſineſs comes on. They have been by much too modeſt. Thus the meeting is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten prefaced with "At a full meeting," and the ſeveral reſolves headed with nem. con. with ſtrict truth, when in fact, but a ſmall proportion of the town have had a hand in the matter. It is ſaid that the committee of the town of Boſton was appointed for a ſpecial purpoſe, and that their commiſſions long ſince expired. However that may be, theſe committees, when once eſtabliſhed, think themſelves amenable to none, they aſſume a dictatorial ſtile, and have an opportunity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the apparent ſanction of their ſeveral towns, of clandeſtinely wreaking private revenge on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, by traducing their characters, and holding them up as enemies to their country wherever they go, as alſo, of miſrepreſenting facts, and propagating ſedition through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Thus a man of principle and property in travelling through the country, would be inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by perſons whoſe faces he had never before
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:014158_0049_0F932FE8C97B0C38"/>
ſeen, he would often feel the ſmart without ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the hand that adminiſtered the blow. Theſe committees as they are not known in law, and can derive no authority from thence, leaſt they ſhould not get their ſhare of power, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times engroſs it all; they frequently erect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a tribunal, where the ſame perſons are at once legiſlator, accuſers, witneſſes, judges and jurors, and the mob the executioners. The accuſed has no day in court, and the execution of the ſentence is the firſt notice he receives. This is the channel through which liberty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have been chiefly conducted the ſummer and fall paſt. This accounts for the ſame diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers breaking out in different parts of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince at one and the ſame time, which might be attributed to ſomething ſupernatural, by thoſe that were unacquainted with the ſecret conduct of the infection. It is chiefly owing to theſe committees, that ſo many reſpectable perſons have been abuſed, and forced to ſign recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reſignations: That ſo many perſons, to avoid ſuch reiterated inſults, as are more to be deprecated by a man of ſentiment than death itſelf, have been obliged to quit their houſes, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and buſineſs, and fly to the army for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection that huſband has been ſeparated from wife, father from ſon, brother from brother, the ſweet intercourſe of conjugal and natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection interrupted, and the unfortunate refugee forced to abandon all the comforts of domeſtic life.</p>
            <p>My countrymen, I beg to pauſe and reflect on this conduct, have not theſe people that are thus inſulted, as good right to think and act for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:014158_0050_0F932FEBEFE23978"/>
in matters of the laſt importance as the Whigs? Do not their former lives and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appear to have been regulated by principle as much as thoſe of the Whigs? You muſt anſwer yes. Why then do you ſuffer them to be ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly treated for differing in ſentiment from you? Is it conſiſtent with the liberty you profeſs? Let us wave the conſideration of right and liberty, and ſee it this conduct can be reconciled to good policy. Do you expect to make converts by it?</p>
            <p>Perſecution has the ſame effect in politics that it has in religion, it confirms the ſectary. Do you wiſh to ſilence them, that the inhabitants of the province may appear unanimous? The mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatment they receive for differing from you is undeniable evidence that we are not unanimous. It may not be amiſs to conſider, that this is a changeable world, and times rolling wheel may 'eer long bring them uppermoſt; in that caſe I am ſure you would not wiſh to have them fraught with reſentment It is aſtoniſhing, my friends, that thoſe who are in purſuit of liberty, ſhould ever ſuffer arbitrary power in ſuch an hideous form and ſqualid hue, to get a footing among them. I appeal to your good ſenſe, I know you have it, and hope to penetrate to it, before I have finiſhed my publications, notwithſtanding the thick atmoſphere that now invelopes it. But to return from my digreſſion; the committee of correſpondence repreſented the deſtruction of the tea in their own way: They repreſented thoſe that addreſſed Governor Hutchinſon, as perſons of no note or property, as mean, baſe wretches, and ſeekers that had been ſacrificing their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in adulation of him. Whole nations have
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:014158_0051_0F932FF10C046E68"/>
worſhipped the riſing, but if this be an inſtance, it is the only one of peoples worſhipping the ſetting ſun. By this means the humane and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent in various parts of the continent, were induced to adviſe us not to comply with the terms for opening our port, and engage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us with their charities, from the diſtreſs that muſt otherwiſe fall upon the poor. Their charitable intentions aſcend to heaven, like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe from the altar, in ſweet memorial before the throne of God; but their donations came near proving fatal to the province: It encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Whigs to perſevere in injuſtice, and has been the means of ſeducing many an honeſt man into the commiſſion of a crime that he did not ſuſpect himſelf capable of being guilty of. What I have told you, is not the meer ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a ſpeculatiſt; there are ſome miſtakes as to numbers, and there may be ſome as to time and place, partly owing to miſ-copying, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to my not always having had the books and papers neceſſary to greater accuracy, at hand; but the relation of facts is in ſubſtance true, I had almoſt ſaid as holy writ. I do not aſk you to take the truths of them from an anonymous ſcribbler in a news-paper: The evidence of moſt of them is within your reach, examine for yourſelves:—I promiſe that the benefit you will reap there from will abundantly pay you for the trouble of the reſearch, you will find I have faithfully unriddled the whole myſtery of our political enquiry: I do not addreſs myſelf to Whigs or Tories, but to the whole people. I know you well; you are loyal at heart, friends to good order, and do violence to yourſelves, in
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:014158_0052_0F932FF1CC8CEBD0"/>
harbouring one moment diſreſpectful ſentiments towards Great-Britain, the land of our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nativity, the ſacred repoſitory of their bones; but they have been moſt inſidiouſly induced to believe, that Great Britain is rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, cruel and vindictive, and envies us the inheritance purchaſed by the ſweat and blood of our anceſtors. Could that thick miſt that hov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers over the land, and involves it in more than Egyptian darkneſs, be but once diſpelled, that you might ſee our ſovereign, the provident fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all his people, and Great-Britain, a nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mother to theſe colonies, as they really are; long live our gracious King, and happineſs to Britain, would reſound from one end of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to the other. I have yet many things to ſay, but have already treſpaſſed on the printer's patience, perhaps the readers, and promiſe to be ſhorter in my future publications.</p>
            <p>Some of you may perhaps ſuſpect that I have been wantonly ſcattering firebrands, arrows and death, to gratify a moſt depraved, malicious and revengeful diſpoſition: The truth is this, I had ſeen many excellent detached pieces, but could ſee no pen at work to trace our calamities from their ſource, and point out the many adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious aids, that conſpired to raiſe to its preſent height, though I impatiently expected it, being fully convinced that you wait only to know the true ſtate of facts, to rectify whatever is amiſs in the province, without any foreign aſſiſtance. Others may be induced to think that I grudge the induſtrious poor of Boſton their ſcantlings of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. I will iſſue a brief in their favour. The opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, be their political ſentiments what they may,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:014158_0053_0F932FF2AF8D2050"/>
ought to relieve them from their ſufferings, and thoſe who by former donations have been the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent cauſe of protracting their ſufferings, are under a tenfold obligation to aſſiſt them now; and at the ſame time to make the moſt explicit decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that they did not intend to promote, nor ever will join in rebellion. Great allowances are to be made for the croſſings, windings and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giverſations of a politician; he is a cunning ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and as government is ſaid to be founded in opinion, his tricks may be part of the <hi>arcana im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perandi.</hi> Had our politicians confined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within any reaſonable bounds, I never ſhould have moleſted them; but when I became ſatisfied, that many innocent, unſuſpecting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, were in danger of being ſeduced, to their utter ruin, and the province of Maſſachuſetts-Bay in danger of being drenched with blood and carnage, I could reſtrain my emotions no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and having once broken the bonds of my natural reſerve, was determined to probe the ſore to the bottom, though I was ſure to touch the quick. It is very foreign from my intentions to draw down the vengance of Great-Britain upon the Whigs; they are too valuable a part of the community to loſe, if they will permit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſaved; I wiſh nothing worſe to the higheſt of them, than that they may be deprived of their influence, till ſuch time as they ſhall have changed their ſentiments, principles and meaſures. Sedition has already been marked through its zigzag path, to the preſent times. When the ſtatute for regulating the government arrived, a match was put to the train, and the mine that had been long forming, ſprung, and
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:014158_0054_0F932FF349BC4F40"/>
threw the whole province into confuſion and anarchy. The occurrences of the ſummer and autumn paſt are ſo recent and notorious, that a particular hiſtory of them is unneceſſary. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it to ſay, that every barrier that civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had erected for the ſecurity of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, liberty and life, was broken down, and law, conſtitution and government, trampled under foot, by the rudeſt invaders. I ſhall not dwell upon theſe harſh notes much longer. I ſhall yet become an advocate for the leading Whigs; much muſt be allowed to men in their ſituation, forcibly actuated by the chagrin of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the fear of puniſhment, and the faſcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hope at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the whole ſtory of empire does not furniſh another inſtance of forcible oppoſition to government with ſo much apparent and little real cauſe, with ſuch apparent probability with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any poſſibility of ſucceſs. The ſtamp-act gave the alarm. The inſtability of the public councils from the Grenvillian adminiſtration, to the appointment of the Earl of Hillſborough, to the American department, afforded as great a proſpect of ſucceſs, as the heavy duties im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the ſtamp-act, did a colour for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. It was neceſſary to give the hiſtory of this matter in its courſe, offend who it would, becauſe thoſe acts of government that are called the greateſt grievances, became proper and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, through the miſconduct of our politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and the juſtice of Great-Britain towards us, could not be made apparent without firſt pointing out that. I intend to conſider the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral acts of the Britiſh government, which are
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:014158_0055_0F932FF416414400"/>
held up as grievances, and enquire whether Great-Britain is chargeable with injuſtice in any of them; but muſt firſt aſk your attention to the authority of parliament. I ſuſpect many of our politicians are wrong in their firſt principle, in denying that the conſtitutional authority of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament extends to the colonies; if ſo it muſt not be wondered at, that their whole fabric is ſo rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous: I ſhall not travel through all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that have been adduced, for and againſt this queſtion, but attempt to reduce the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them to a narrow compaſs, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken a curſory view of the Britiſh conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſecurity of the people from internal rapacity and violence, and from foreign inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions is the end and deſign of government. The ſimple forms of government are monarchy, ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy and democracy, that is, where the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the ſtate is veſted in one, a few, or the many. Each of theſe ſpecies of government has advantages peculiar to itſelf, and would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ends of government, where the perſons intruſted with the authority of the ſtate always guided themſelves by unerring wiſdom and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic virtue; but rulers are not always exempt from the weakneſs and depravity which make go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment neceſſary to ſociety. Thus monarchy is apt to ruſh headlong into tyranny, ariſtocracy to beget faction and multiplied uſurpations, and democracy to degenerate into tumult, violence and anarchy. A government formed upon theſe three principles in due proportion, is the beſt calculated to anſwer the ends of government, and to endure. Such a government is the Britiſh conſtitution, conſiſting of King, Lords, and
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:014158_0056_0F932FF501779858"/>
Commons, which at once includes the principal excellencies, and excludes the principal defects of the other kinds of government. It is allowed, both by Engliſhmen and foreigners to be the moſt perfect ſyſtem that the wiſdom of ages has produced. The diſtributions of power are ſo juſt, and the proportions ſo exact, as at once to ſupport and controul each other. An Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man glories in being ſubject to, and protected by, ſuch a government. The colonies are a part of the Britiſh empire. The beſt writers upon the law of nations, tell us, that when a nation takes poſſeſſion of a diſtant country, and ſettles there, that country though ſeparated from the principal eſtabliſhment, or mother country, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally becomes a part of the ſtate, equal with its ancient poſſeſſions. Two ſupreme or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant authorities cannot exiſt in the ſame ſtate. It would be what is called <hi>imperium in imperio,</hi> the heighth of political abſurdity. The analogy between the political and human bodies is great. Two independant authorities in a ſtate would be like two diſtinct principles of volition and action in the human body, diſſenting, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and deſtroying each other. If then we are a part of the Britiſh empire, we muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſupreme power of the ſtate which is veſted in the eſtates of parliament, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each of the colonies have legiſlative and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive powers of their own, delegated or granted to them, for the purpoſes of regulating their own internal police, which are ſubordinate to, and muſt neceſſarily be ſubject to the checks, controul and regulation of the ſupreme authority of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:014158_0057_0F932FF5AA82EB58"/>This doctrine is not new, but the denial of it is. It is beyond a doubt that it was the ſenſe both of the parent country, and our anceſtors, that they were to remain ſubject to parliament. It is evident from the charter itſelf, and this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority has been exerciſed by parliament, from time to time, almoſt ever ſince the firſt ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the country, and has been expreſsly acknowledged by our provincial legiſlatures. It is not leſs our intereſt than our duty to continue ſubject to the authority of parliament, which will be more fully conſidered hereafter. The principal argument againſt the authority of parliament, is this, the Americans are entitled to all the privileges of an Engliſhman, it is the privilege of an Engliſhman to be exempt from all laws that he does not conſent to in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or by repreſentative; the Americans are not repreſented in parliament, and therefore are exempt from acts of parliament, or in other words, not ſubject to its authority. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſpecious; but leads to ſuch abſurdities as demonſtrate its fallacy. If the colonies are not ſubject to the authority of parliament, Great-Britain and the colonies muſt be diſtinct ſtates, as compleatly ſo as England and Scotland were before the union, or as Great-Britain and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover are now: The colonies in that caſe will owe no allegiance to the imperial crown, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not to the perſon of the King, as the title to the crown is derived from an act of parliament, made ſince the ſettlement of this province, which act reſpects the imperial crown only. Let us wave this difficulty, and ſuppoſe allegiance due from the colonies to the perſon of the King of Great-Britain, he then appears in a new capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:014158_0058_0F932FF6570EE888"/>
of King of America, or rather in ſeveral new capacities of King of Maſſachuſetts, King of Rhode-Iſland, King of Connecticut, &amp;c. &amp;c. For if our connexion with Great-Britain by the parliament be diſſolved, we ſhall have none among ourſelves, but each colony become as diſtinct from the others, as England was from Scotland before the Union. Some have ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that each ſtate having one and the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for its Sovereign, is a ſufficient connection; where the Sovereign is an abſolute Monarch it might be, but in a mixed government, it is no union at all: For as the King muſt govern each ſtate by its parliament, thoſe ſeveral parliaments would purſue the particular intereſt of its own ſtate, and however well diſpoſed the King might be to purſue a line of intereſt that was common to all, the checks and controul that he would meet with, would render it impoſſible. If the King of Great-Britain has really theſe new ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, they ought to be added to his titles; and another difficulty will ariſe, the prerogatives of theſe new crowns have never been defined or limited. Is the monarchical part of the ſeveral provincial conſtitutions to be nearer or more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from abſolute monarchy, in an inverted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio to each one's approaching to, or receding from a republic. But let us ſuppoſe the ſame prerogatives inherent in the ſeveral American crowns, as are in the imperial crown of Great-Britain, where ſhall we find the Britiſh conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we all agree we are entitled to. We ſhall ſeek for it in vain in our provincial aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. They are but faint ſketches of the eſtates of parliament. The houſes of repreſentatives,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:014158_0059_0F932FF70E39A1D0"/>
or Burgeſſes, have not all the powers of the Houſe of Commons, in the charter govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they have no more than what is expreſsly granted by their ſeveral charters. The firſt charter granted to this province did not impower the aſſembly to tax the people at all. Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Boards are as deſtitute of the conſtitutional authority of the Houſe of Lords, as their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral members are of the noble independance and ſplendid appendages of Peerage. The Houſe of Peers is the bulwark of the Britiſh conſtitution, and through ſucceſſive ages, has withſtood the ſhocks of monarchy, and the ſappings of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy, and the conſtitution gained ſtrength by the conflict. Thus the ſuppoſition of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing independent ſtates, or exempt from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of parliament, deſtroys the very idea of our having a Britiſh conſtitution. The provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial conſtitutions, conſidered as ſubordinate, are generally well adapted to thoſe purpoſes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for which they were intended, that is, to regulate the internal police of the ſeveral co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; but have no principle of ſtability within themſelves, they may ſupport themſelves in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate times, but would be merged by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of turbulent ones, and the ſeveral colonies become wholy monarchical, or wholly republican, were it not for the checks, controuls, regulations and ſupports of the ſupreme authority of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Thus the argument that is drawn from their firſt principle of our being entitled to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh liberties, deſtroys the principle itſelf, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives us of the Bill of Rights, and all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits reſulting from the revolution, of Engliſh laws, and of the Britiſh conſtitution. Our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:014158_0060_0F932FF7CDEA83E8"/>
have been ſo intent upon building up Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican rights, that they have overlooked the rights of Great-Britain, and our own intereſt. Inſtead of proving that we are entitled to privileges that our fathers knew our ſituation would not admit us to enjoy, they have been arguing away our moſt eſſential rights. If there be any grievance it does not conſiſt in our being ſubject to the authority of Parliament, but in our not having an actual repreſentation in it. Were it poſſible for the colonies to have an equal repreſentation in Parliament, and were refuſed it upon proper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, I confeſs I ſhould think it a grievance; but at preſent it ſeems to be allowed by all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to be impracticable, conſidering the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are diſtant from Great-Britain a thouſand tranſmarine leagues. If that be the caſe, the right or privilege that we complain of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of, is not witheld by Britain, but the firſt principle of government, and the immutable laws of nature, render it impoſſible for us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it. This is apparently the meaning of that celebrated paſſage in Governor Hutchinſon's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that rang through the continent, viz. There muſt be an abridgment of what is called Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh liberties. He ſubjoins that he had never yet ſeen the projection, whereby a colony three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miles diſtant from the parent ſtate, might enjoy all the privileges of the parent ſtate, and remain ſubject to it, or in words to that effect. The obnoxious ſentence taken detached from the letter, appears very unfriendly to the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; but conſidered in connexion with the other parts of the letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is but a neceſſary reſult from our ſituation. Allegiance and protection
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:014158_0061_0F932FF889A71D78"/>
are reciprocal. It is our higheſt intereſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a part of the Britiſh empire, and equally our duty to remain ſubject to the authority of parliament. Our own internal police may gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be regulated by our provincial legiſlatures, but in national concerns, or where our own aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies do not anſwer the ends of government with reſpect to ourſelves, the ordinances or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of the great council of the nation is neceſſary. In this caſe the major muſt rule the minor. After many more centuries ſhall have rolled away, long after we, who are now buſtling upon the ſtage of life, ſhall have been received to the boſom of mother earth, and our names are forgotten, the colonies may be ſo far increaſed as to have the balance of wealth, numbers, and power in their favour, the good of the empire make it neceſſary to fix the ſeat of government here; and ſome future GEORGE, equally the friend of mankind with him that now ſways the Britiſh ſceptre, may croſs the Atlantic, and rule Great-Britain by an American Parliament.</p>
            <p>Had a perſon, ſome fifteen years ago, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to prove that the colonies were annexed to the realm, were a part of the Britiſh empire or dominion, and as ſuch ſubject to the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Britiſh parliament, he would have acted as ridiculous a part, as to have undertaken to prove a ſelf evident propoſition:—Had any perſon denied it, he would have been called a fool or madman. At this wiſe period, individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and bodies of men deny it, notwithſtanding in doing it they ſubvert the fundamentals of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, deprive us of Britiſh liberties, and build up an abſolute monarchy in the colonies;
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:014158_0062_0F932FFA85848D48"/>
for our charters ſuppoſe regal authority in the grantor, if that authority be derived from the Britiſh crown, it pre-ſuppoſes this territory to have been a part of the Britiſh dominion, and as ſuch ſubject to the Imperial Sovereign; if that authority was veſted in the perſon of the King in a different capacity, the Britiſh conſtitution and laws are out of the queſtion, and the King muſt be abſolute as to us, as his prerogatives have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been limited. Such muſt have been the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign authority of the ſeveral Kings, who have granted American charters, previous to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral grants, there is nothing to detract from it, at this time in thoſe colonies that are deſtitute of charters, and the charter governments muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally revert to abſolute monarchy, as their charters may happen to be forfeited by the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, not fulfilling the conditions of them, as every charter contains an expreſs or implied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>It is curious indeed to trace the denial and oppugnation to the ſupreme authority of the ſtate. When the ſtamp-act was made, the authority of parliament to impoſe internal taxes was denied, but their right to impoſe external ones; or in other words, to lay duties upon goods and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe was admitted. When the act was made impoſing duties upon tea, &amp;c. a new diſtinction was ſet up, that the parliament had a right to lay duties upon merchandiſe for the purpoſe of regulating trade, but not for the purpoſe of raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a revenue: That is, the parliament had good right and lawful authority, to lay the former du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a ſhilling on the pound, but had none to lay the preſent duty of three pence. Having got
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:014158_0063_0F932FFAD8C6E540"/>
thus far ſafe, it was only taking one ſtep more to extricate ourſelves entirely from their fangs, and become independant ſtates; that our patriots moſt heroically reſolved upon, and flatly denied that parliament had a right to make any laws whatever, that ſhould be binding upon the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies. There is no poſſible medium between abſolute independance and ſubjection to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of parliament. He muſt be blind indeed that cannot ſee our deareſt intereſt in the latter notwithſtanding many pant after the former, miſguided men! Could they once overtake their wiſh, they would be convinced of the madneſs of the purſuit. My dear countrymen, it is of the laſt importance that we ſettle this point clearly in our minds; it will ſerve as a ſure teſt, certain criterion and invariable ſtandard 10 diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the friends from the enemies of our country, patriotiſm from ſedition, loyalty from rebellion. To deny the ſupreme authority of the ſtate is a high miſdemeanor, to ſay no worſe of it; to oppoſe it by force is an overt act of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, puniſhable by confiſcation of eſtate, and moſt ignominious death. The realm of England is an appropriate term for the antient realm of England, in contradiction to Wales and other territories that have been annexed to it. Theſe as they have been ſeverally annexed, whether by conqueſt or otherwiſe, become a part of the Britiſh dominions, and ſubject to the authority of Parliament, whether they ſend members to Parliament or not, and whether they have legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative powers of their own or not.</p>
            <p>Thus Ireland, who has perhaps the greateſt poſſible ſubordinate legiſlature, and ſends no
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:014158_0064_0F932FFB91057F88"/>
members to the Britiſh parliament, is bound by its acts, when expreſsly named, Guernſey and Jerſey are no part of the realm of England, nor are they repreſented in parliament, but are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to its authority: And, in the ſame predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are the American colonies, and all the other diſperſions of the empire. Permit me to requeſt your attention to this ſubject a little longer; I aſſure you it is as intereſting and important as it is dry and unentertaining. Let us now recur to the firſt charter of this province, and we ſhall find irreſiſtible evidence, that our being a part of the empire, ſubject to the ſupreme authority of the ſtate, bound by its laws and ſubject to its protection, was the very terms and conditions by which our anceſtors held their lands and ſett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the province. Our charter, like all other American charters, are in the royal ſtile, and under the great ſeal of England; the grants are named by the King, for his heirs and <hi>ſucceſſors,</hi> the ſeveral tenures to be of the King, his heirs and <hi>ſucceſſors,</hi> in like manner are the reſervations. It is apparent the King acted in his royal capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as King of England, which neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the territory granted to be a part of the Engliſh dominions, holden of the crown of England</p>
            <p>The charter after receiving the ſeveral grants of the territory to Sir Henry Roſwell and others, proceed to incorporation in theſe words:
<q>And for as much as the good and proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the plantations of the ſaid parts of New-England aforeſaid intended by the ſaid Sir Henry Roſwell and others, to be ſpeedily ſet upon, cannot but chiefly depend, next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the bleſſing of Almighty God, and the ſupport of our royal authority, upon the good government of the ſame, to the end that the <hi>affairs of buſineſs,</hi> which from time to time ſhall happen and ariſe concerning the ſaid lands, and the plantations of the ſame may be the better managed and ordered, We have further hereby, of our eſpecial grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion given, granted and confirmed, and for us, our heirs and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, do give, grant and confirm unto our ſaid truſty and well beloved ſubjects, Sir Henry Roſwell; &amp;c. and all ſuch others as ſhall hereafter be admitted and made free of <hi>the company and ſociety hereafter mentioned,</hi> ſhall from time to time and all times, forever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, be by virtue of theſe preſents, <hi>one body corporate politic, in fact and name, by the name of the Governor and company of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, in New-England</hi>; and them by the name of the Governor and company of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts-Bay, in New-England, one body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic and corporate in deed, fact and name.

            <p>I would beg have to aſk one ſimple queſtion, whether this looks like a diſtinct ſtate, or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant empire? Proviſion is then made for electing a governor, deputy governor, and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen aſſiſtants. After which is this clauſe;
<q>we do for us, our heirs and ſucceſſors, give and grant to the ſaid governor and company, and their ſucceſſors, that the governor, or in his abſence the deputy governor, of the ſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for the time being, and ſuch of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants, or freemen of the ſaid company, as ſhall be preſent, or the greater number of them ſo aſſembled, whereof the governor, or deputy governor, and ſix of the aſſiſtants, at the leaſt to be ſeven, ſhall have full power and authority to chooſe, nominate and appoint ſuch, and ſo many others, as they ſhall think fit, and ſhall be willing to accept the ſame, to be free of the ſaid company and body, and them into the ſame to admit, and to elect and conſtitute ſuch officers, as they ſhall think fit and requiſite for the ordering, managing and diſpatching of the affairs of the ſaid gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and company and their ſucceſſors, and to make <hi>laws and ordinances for the good and welfare of the ſaid company,</hi> and for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ordering of the ſaid lands and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and the people inhabiting and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit the ſame, as to them from time to time ſhall be thought me<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

ordinances be not contrary or repugnant to the laws and ſtatutes of this our realm of England.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Another clauſe is this,
<q>And for their further encouragement, of our eſpecial grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, we do by theſe preſents, for us, our heirs and ſucceſſors, yield and grant to the ſaid governor and company, and their ſucceſſors, and every of them, their factors and aſſigns, that they and every of them ſhall be free and quit from all takes, ſubſidies and cuſtoms in New-England, for the ſpace of ſeven years, and from all taxes and impoſitions for the ſpace of twenty-one years, upon all goods and merchandiſe, at any time or times hereafter, either upon importation thither, or exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from thence into our realm of England, or into other of our dominions, by the ſaid governor and company, and their ſucceſſors, their deputies, factors and aſſigns, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The exception of twenty-one years, plainly indicates, that after their expiration, goods and merchandize imported or exported, would be liable to taxes and impoſitions, which is rather an unfavourable circumſtance for thoſe who call the three-penny duty on tea unconſtitutional. It is true that this charter has been vacated by a decree in chancery, for the governor and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aſſuming powers which they were not inveſted with by it; but it is evidence nevertheleſs of the terms ſtipulated between the crown and our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, at the firſt ſettlement of the country. If the province was then ſubject to the authority of parliament, it muſt be now, unleſs it can be ſhewn, by ſome act of the whole legiſlature, that right has been renounced; for it is not in the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:014158_0068_0F932FFE924CBCF8"/>
prerogatives of the crown to alienate a part of its dominions, excepting the ceding of conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed countries, to obtain a more advantageous peace. I am no advocate for internal taxation, let the right in theory be where it may. It is impracticable in many caſes, perhaps inexpedient in all. The right of parliament to lay duties upon trade, is ſo intervowen with the right of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation, that it is impoſſible to diſcriminate them, and it is prepoſterous to the laſt degree, to buoy ourſelves up with a falſe principle, that muſt fail us in the end, and ſink us the deeper for having depended upon it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall recite but one more clauſe of this char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is this,
<q>And further our will and pleaſure is, and we do hereby for us, our heirs and ſucceſſors, ordain, declare and grant to the ſaid Governor and company, and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, that all and every of the ſubjects of us, our heirs and ſucceſſors, which ſhall go to, and inhabit within the ſaid lands and premiſes hereby mentioned to be granted, and every of their children which ſhall happen to be born there, or on the ſeas in going thither, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from thence, ſhall have and enjoy <hi>all liberties and immunities of free and natural ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, within any of the dominions</hi> of us, our heirs or ſucceſſors, to all intents, conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and purpoſes whatſoever, as if they and every of them were born within the realm of England.</q>
It is upon this, or a ſimilar clauſe in the charter of William and Mary that our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots have built up the ſtupenduous fabric of American independance. They argue from it a
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:014158_0069_0F932FFF4A8BD440"/>
total exemption from Parliamentary authority, becauſe we are not repreſented in parliament.</p>
            <p>I have already ſhewn that the ſuppoſition of our being exempt from the authority of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is pregnant with the groſſeſt abſurdities. Let us now conſider this clauſe in connexion with the other parts of the charter. It is a rule of law, founded in reaſon and common ſenſe, to conſtrue each part, of an inſtrument, ſo as the whole may hang together, and be conſiſtent with itſelf. If we ſuppoſe this clauſe to exempt us from the authority of parliament, we muſt throw away all the reſt of the charter, for every other part indicates the contrary, as plainly as words can do it; and what is ſtill worſe, this clauſe becomes <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> and deſtroys itſelf, for if we are not annexed to the realm, we are aliens, and no charter, grant, or other act of the crown, can naturalize, or entitle us to the liberties and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of Engliſhmen. It can be done only by act of parliament. An alien is one born in a ſtrange country, out of the allegiance of the King, and is under many diſabilities, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in the realm; as Wales, Jerſey, Guernſey, Ireland, the foreign plantations, &amp;c. were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally added, or annexed, to the antient realm, they became parts of one and the ſame empire, the natives of which are equally free as though they had been born in that territory which was the ancient realm. As our patriots depend upon this clauſe, detached from the charter, let us view it in that light. If a perſon born in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land removes to Ireland, and ſettles there, he is then no longer repreſented in the Britiſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but he and his poſterity are and will ever
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:014158_0070_0F9330002E8DD4D8"/>
be ſubject to the authority of the Britiſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: If he removes to Jerſey, Guernſey, or any other parts of the Britiſh dominions, that ſend no members to parliament, he will ſtill be in the ſame predicament. So that the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the American colonies do in fact enjoy all the liberties and immunities of natural born ſubjects. We are entitled to no greater privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges than thoſe that are born within the realm, and they can enjoy no other than we do, when they reſide out of it. Thus it is evident that this clauſe amounts to no more than the royal aſſurance, that we are a part of the Britiſh em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, are not aliens, but natural born ſubjects; and as ſuch bound to obey the ſupreme power of the ſtate, and entitled to protection from it. To avoid prolixity I ſhall not remark particularly upon other parts of this charter, but obſerve in general, that whoever reads it with attention will meet with irreſiſtible evidence in every part of it, that our being a part of the Engliſh dominions, ſubject to the Engliſh crown, and within the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of parliament, were the terms upon which our anceſtors ſettled this colony, and the very tenures by which they held their eſtates.</p>
            <p>No lands within the Britiſh dominions are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly allodial; they are held mediately or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately of the king, and upon forfeiture, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to the crown.</p>
            <p>My dear countrymen, you have many of you, been moſt falſly and wickedly told, by our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, that Great-Britain was meditating a land tax, and ſeeking to deprive us of our inheritance; but had all the malice and ſubtilty of men and devils been united, a readier method to effect it
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:014158_0071_0F933000D6C7D538"/>
could not have been deviſed, than the late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials of the authority of parliament, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible oppoſitions to its acts: Yet, this has been done, planned and executed chiefly by perſons of deſperate fortunes.</p>
            <p>If we carry our reſearches further back than the emigration of our anceſtors, we ſhall find many things that reflect light upon the object we are in queſt of. It is immaterial when America was firſt diſcovered or taken poſſeſſion of by the Engliſh. In 1602 one Goſnold landed upon one of the iſlands, called Elizabeth-Iſlands, which were ſo named in honour of Queen Elizabeth, built a fort and projected a ſettlement, his men were diſcouraged, and the project failed. In 1606 King James granted all the continent from 34 to 45 degrees, which he divided into two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, viz. the ſouthern, or Virginia, to certain merchants at London, the northern, or New-England, to certain merchants at Plymouth, in England. In 1607 ſome of the patentees of the northern colony began a ſettlement at Sogadahoc, but the emigrants were diſheartened after the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of one winter, and that attempt failed of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Thus this territory has not only been granted by the crown for purpoſes of coloniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are to enlarge the empire, or domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, of the parent ſtate, and to open new ſources of national wealth, but actual poſſeſſion had been taken by the grantees, previous to the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of our anceſtors, or any grant to them. In 1620 a patent was granted to the adventurers for the northern colony, incorporating them by the name of <hi>the council for the affairs of New-Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi> From this company of merchants in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:014158_0072_0F933001911BEDB8"/>
our anceſtors derived their title to this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory. The tract of land called Maſſachuſetts was purchaſed of this Company, by Sir Henry Roſwell and aſſociates, their deed bearing date, March 19th, 1627. In 1628 they obtained a charter of incorporation, which I have already remarked upon. The liberties, privileges and franchiſes, granted by this charter, do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps exceed thoſe granted to the city of London, and other corporations within the realm. The legiſlative power was very confined; it did not even extend to the levying of taxes of any kind, that power was however aſſumed under this char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which by law worked a forfeiture, and for this, among other things, in the reign of Charles the Second, the charter was adjudged forfeited, and the franchiſes ſeized into the King's hands. This judgment did not affect our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors title to their lands that was not derived originally from the charter, though confirmed by it, but by purchaſe from the council at Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, who held immediately under the crown. Beſides our anceſtors had now reduced what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was a naked right to poſſeſſion and by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering through unequal toils, hardſhips and dangers, at the approach of which other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants had fainted, rendered New-England a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry valuable acquiſition, both to the crown and nation. This was highly meritorious, and ought not to be overlooked in adjuſting the preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy diſpute, but our patriots would deprive us of all the merit, both to the crown and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by ſevering us from both. After the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, our anceſtors petitioned the parliament to reſtore the charter. A bill for that purpoſe
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:014158_0073_0F9330025B126798"/>
paſſed the houſe of commons, but went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In conſequence of another petition King William and Queen Mary granted our preſent charter, for uniting and incorporating the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, New-Plymouth, and ſeveral other ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories into one province. More extenſive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of legiſlation than thoſe contained in the firſt charter were become neceſſary, and were granted. And the form of the legiſlature made to approach nearer to the form of the ſupreme legiſlature. The powers of legiſlation are confined to local or provincial purpoſes, and further reſtricted by theſe words, viz. <hi>So as the ſame be not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or contrary to the laws of this our realm of England.</hi> Our patriots have made many nice diſtinctions and curious refinements, to evade the force of theſe words, but after all, it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to reconcile them to the idea of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant ſtate, as it is to reconcile diſability to omnipotence. The provincial power of taxation is alſo reſtricted to provincial purpoſes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be exerciſed over ſuch only as are inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, or proprietors, within the province. I would obſerve here, that the granting ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate powers of legiſlation, does not abridge or diminiſh the powers of the higher legiſlatures: thus we ſee corporations in England, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral towns in this province, veſted with greater or leſſer powers of legiſlation, without the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in one caſe, or the general court in the other being reſtrained, from enacting thoſe very laws, that fall within the juriſdiction of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral corporations. Had our preſent charter been conceived in ſuch equivocal terms as that it might be conſtrued as reſtraining the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:014158_0074_0F933003097E9290"/>
of parliament, the uniform uſage ever ſince it paſſed the ſeal, would ſatisfy us that its intents was different. The parliament in the reign when it was granted, and in every reign ſince, has been making ſtatutes to extend to the colonies, and thoſe ſtatutes have been as uniformly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to as authoritative, by the colonies, till within ten, or a dozen years. Sometimes acts of parliament have been made, and ſometimes have been repealed in conſequence of petitions from the colonies. The provincial aſſemblies often refer to acts of parliament in their own, and have ſometimes made acts to aid their execution. It is evident that it was the intention of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties, to grant ſubordinate powers of legiſlation, without impairing or diminiſhing the authority of the ſupreme legiſlature. Had there been any words in the charter, that precluded that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, or did the whole taken together, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it, lawyers would tell us, that their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties were deceived in their grant, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees took no eſtate by it, becauſe the crown can neither alienate a part of the Britiſh domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, nor impair the ſupreme power of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. I have dwelt longer on this ſubject than I at firſt intended, and not by any means done it juſtice, as to avoid prolix narratives, and tedious deduction, I have omitted perhaps more than I have adduced, that evinces the truth of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that we are a part of the Britiſh domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and ſubject to the authority of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The novelty of the contrary tenets, will appear by extracting a part of a pamphlet, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in 1764, by a Boſton gentleman, who was then the oracle of the Whigs, and whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:014158_0075_0F933003C95E7BB8"/>
knowledge in the law and conſtitution is equaled but by few.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I alſo lay it down as one of the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from whence I intend to deduce the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil rights of the Britiſh colonies, that all of them are ſubject to, and dependant on Great-Britain; and that therefore as over ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate governments, the parliament of Great-Britain has an undoubted power, and lawful authority to make acts for the general good, that by naming them, ſhall and ought to be equally binding, as upon the ſubjects of Great-Britain within the realm. Is there the leaſt difference, as to the conſent of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, whether taxes and impoſitions are laid on their trade, and other property by the crown alone, or by the parliament. As it is agreed on all hands, the crown alone cannot impoſe them, we ſhould be juſtifiable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to pay them, <hi>but muſt and ought to yield obedience to an act of parliament, though erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, till repealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a maxim, that the King can do no wrong; and every good ſubject is bound to believe his King is not inclined to do any. We are bleſſed with a prince who has given abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant demonſtrations, that in all his actions, he ſtudies the good of his people, and the true glory of his crown, which are inſeparable. It would therefore be the higheſt degree of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and diſloyalty, to imagine that the King, at the head of his parliament, could have any but the moſt pure and perfect intentions of juſtice, goodneſs and truth, that human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is cap<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="76" facs="unknown:014158_0076_0F93300489650780"/>
of the King and parliament, in all their acts; even in that which ſo nearly affects the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the coloniſts; and that a moſt perfect and ready obedience is to be yielded to it, while it remains in force. The power of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is uncontroulable but by themſelves, and we muſt obey. They only can repeal their own acts. There would be an end of all government, if one or a number of ſubjects, or ſubordinate provinces ſhould take upon them ſo far to judge of the juſtice of an act of parliament, as to refuſe obedience to it. If there was nothing elſe to reſtrain ſuch a ſtep, prudence ought to do it, for forceably reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the parliament and the King's laws is high treaſon. Therefore let the parliament lay what burdens they pleaſe on us, we muſt, it is our duty to ſubmit and patiently bear them, till they will be pleaſed to relieve us.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Pennſylvania Farmer, who took the lead in explaining away the right of parliament, to raiſe a revenue in America, ſpeaking of regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trade, tells us that
<q>He who conſiders theſe provinces as <hi>ſtates diſtinct from the Britiſh empire</hi> has very ſlender notions of <hi>juſtice,</hi> or of their <hi>intereſt</hi>; we are but <hi>parts of the whole,</hi> and therefore there muſt exiſt a power ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to <hi>preſide and preſerve the connection in due order.</hi> This power is lodged in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and we are as much <hi>dependant on Great-Britain</hi> as a <hi>perfectly free people can be on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi>
               </q>
He ſuppoſes that we are dependant in ſome conſiderable degree upon Great-Britain; and that, that dependance is nevertheleſs conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with perfect freedom.</p>

               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:014158_0077_0F93300553545188"/>Having ſettled this point, let us reflect upon the reſolves and proceedings of our patriots. We often read reſolves denying the authority of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which is the imperial Sovereign, gilded over with profeſſions of loyalty to the King; but the golden leaf is too thin to conceal the treaſon: It either argues profound ignorance, or hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical cunning.</p>
            <p>We find many unſuſpecting perſons prevailed on openly to oppoſe the execution of acts of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament with force and arms. My friends! ſome of the perſons that beguiled you, could have turned to the chapter, page and ſection, where ſuch inſurrections are pronounced rebellion, by the law of the land; and had not their hearts been dead to a ſenſe of juſtice, and ſteeled againſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry feeling of humanity, they would have timely warned you of your danger. Our patriots have ſent us in purſuit of a mere <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> a faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating glare, devoid of ſubſtance; and now, when we find ourſelves bewildered, with ſcarce one ray of hope to raiſe our ſinking ſpirits, or ſtay our fainting ſouls, they conjure up phantoms more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive and fleeting, if poſſible, than that which firſt led us aſtray. They tell us we are a match for Great-Britain:—The twentieth part of the ſtrength that Great-Britain could exert, were it neceſſary, is more than ſufficient to cruſh this defenceleſs province to atoms, notwithſtanding all the vapouring of the diſaffected here and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. They tell us the army is diſaffected to the ſervice: What pains have our wretched po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians not taken to attach them to it? The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers conceive no very favourable opinion of the cauſe of the Whigs, from the obloquy with
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:014158_0078_0F9330061F38AD00"/>
which the general hath been treated, in return for his humanity, nor from the infamous attempts to ſeduce the ſoldiers from his Majeſty's ſervice. The policy of ſome of our patriots has been as weak and contemptible as their motives are ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and malevolent, for when they found their ſucceſs, in corrupting the ſoldiery, did not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their expectations, they took pains to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach them firmer to the cauſe they adhered to, by preventing the erecting of barracks for their winter quarters, by which means many contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſeaſes, and ſome lives were loſt, from the unwholeſome buildings they were obliged to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy; and, as though ſome ſtimulus was ſtill wanting, ſome provocation to prevent human nature revolting in the hour of battle, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived the ſoldiers of a gratification never denied to the brute creation,—ſtraw to lie on. I do not mention this conduct to raiſe the reſentment of the troops, it has had its effect already, and it is proper you ſhould know it; nor ſhould I have blotted paper in relating facts ſo mortifying to the pride of man, had it not been baſely ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted that there would be a defection ſhould the army take the field. Thoſe are matters of ſmall moment compared to another, which is the cauſe they are engaged in. It is no longer a ſtruggle between Whigs and Tories, whether theſe or thoſe ſhall occupy poſts of honour, or enjoy the emoluments of office, nor is it now whether this or the other act of parliament ſhall be repealed. The army is ſent here to decide a queſtion, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected with the honour and intereſt of the nation, no leſs than whether the colonies ſhall continue a part of, or be forever diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:014158_0079_0F933006C7D1D0D8"/>
from the Britiſh empire. It is a cauſe in which no honeſt American, can wiſh our politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians ſucceſs, though it is devoutly to be wiſhed, that their diſcomfiture may be effected without recourſe being had to the <hi>ultima ratio</hi>—the ſword. This our wretched ſituation is but the natural conſequence of denying the authority of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and forcibly oppoſing its acts.</p>
            <p>Sometimes we are amuſed with intimations that Holland, France or Spain will make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in our favour.—Theſe, equally with the others, are ſuggeſtions of deſpair. Theſe powers have colonies of their own, and might not chooſe to ſet a bad example, by encouraging the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of any other ſtate to revolt. The Dutch have too much money in the Engliſh funds, and are too much attached to their money to eſpouſe our quarrel. The French and Spaniards have not yet forgot the drubbing they received from Great-Britain laſt war; and all three fear to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that power which our politicians would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us to deſpiſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, they tell us that the people in England will take our part, and prevent matters from coming to extremity. This is their fort, where, when driven from every other poſt, they fly for refuge.</p>
            <p>Alas! my friends, our congreſſes have ſtopt up every avenue that leads to that ſanctuary. We hear by every arrival from England, that it is no longer a miniſterial (if ever it was) but a natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe. My dear countrymen, I deal plainly with you; I never ſhould forgive myſelf if I did not. Are there not eleven regiments in Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton? A reſpectable fleet in the harbour? Men
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:014158_0080_0F9330078B5AAD60"/>
of war ſtationed at every conſiderable port along the continent? Are not three ſhips of the line ſent here, notwithſtanding the danger of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter coaſt, with more than the uſual compliment of marines? Have not our congreſſes, county, provincial and continental, inſtead of making advances for an accommodation, bid defiance to Great-Britain?—<hi>He that runs may read.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If our politicians will not be perſuaded from running againſt the thick boſſes of the buckler, it is time for us to leave them to their fate, and provide for the ſafety of ourſelves, our wives, our children, our friends and our country.</p>
            <p>I have many things to add, but muſt now take my leave for this week, by ſubmitting to your judgment whether there be not an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of immediately proteſting againſt all trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous reſolves, leagues and aſſociations, of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men that appear to have acted in a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative capacity. Had our congreſſes been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental or ſpontaneous meetings, the whole blame might have reſted upon the individuals that compoſed them, but as they appear in the character of the peoples delegates, is there not the utmoſt danger of the innocent being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the guilty, unleſs they take care timely to diſtinguiſh themſelves?</p>
            <p>As the oppugnation to the King in parliament tends manifeſtly to independance, and the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies would ſoon arrive at that point, did not Great Britain check them in their carreer; let us indulge the idea, however extravagant and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic, and ſuppoſe ourſelves for ever ſeparated from the parent ſtate. Let us ſuppoſe Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſinking under the violence of the ſhock, and
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:014158_0081_0F93300849FE6538"/>
overwhelmed by her ancient hereditary enemies; or what is more probable, opening new ſources of national wealth, to ſupply the deficiency of that which uſed to flow to her through Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can channels, and perhaps planting more loyal colonies in the new diſcovered regions of the ſouth, ſtill retaining her preeminence among the nations, though regardleſs of America.</p>
            <p>Let us now advert to our own ſituation. Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of Britiſh protection, that impervious bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, behind which in perfect ſecurity, we have encreaſed to a degree almoſt exceeding the bounds of probability, what other Britain could we look to when in diſtreſs? What ſuccedaneum does the world afford to make good the loſs? Would not our trade, navigation and fiſhery, which no nation in Europe dares violate or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade, when diſtinguiſhed by the Britiſh colours, become the ſport and prey of the maritime pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Europe? Would not our maritime towns be expoſed to the pillaging of every piratical en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize? Are the colonies able to maintain a fleet, ſufficient to afford one idea of ſecurity to ſuch an extenſive ſea-coaſt? Before they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves againſt foreign invaſions, they muſt unite into one empire, otherwiſe the jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring intereſts, and oppoſite propenſities, would render the many headed monſter in politics, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy and inactive. Neither the form or ſeat of government would be readily agreed upon; more difficult ſtill would it be to fix upon the perſon or perſons, to be inveſted with the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial authority. There is perhaps as great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity between the tempers and habits of the inhabitants of this province, and the tempers
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:014158_0082_0F9330092E54CF30"/>
and habits of the Carolinians, as there ſubſiſt between ſome different nations; nor need we travel ſo far, the Rhode-Iſlanders are as diverſe from the people of the adjoining colony of Connecticut, as thoſe mentioned before. Moſt of the colonies are rivals to each other in trade. Between others there ſubſiſt deep animoſities, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting their boundaries, which have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore produced violent altercations, and the ſword of civil war has been more than once unſheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without bringing theſe diſputes to a deciſion. It is apparent that ſo many diſcordant, hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius particles could not ſuddenly unite and conſolidate into one body: It is moſt probable, that if ever they were united, the union would be effected by ſome aſpiring genius, putting himſelf at the head of the coloniſts army (for we muſt ſuppoſe a very reſpectable one indeed before we are ſevered from Britain) and taking advantage of the enfeebled, bleeding and diſtracted ſtate of the colonies, ſubjugate the whole to the yoke of deſpotiſm. Human nature is every where the ſame, and this has often been the iſſue of thoſe rebellions that the rightful Prince was unable to ſubdue. We need not travel through the ſtates of ancient Greece and Rome, or the more modern ones in Europe, to pick up the inſtances, with which the way is ſtrewed; we have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table one in our own. So odious and arbitrary was the protectorate of Cromwell, that when death had delivered them from the dread of the tyrant, all parties conſpired to reſtore monarchy, and each one ſtrove to be foremoſt in inviting home, and placing upon the imperial throne,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:014158_0083_0F933009C7F2AEE8"/>
their exiled prince, the ſon of the ſame Charles, who not many years before, had died on the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: The republicans themſelves now ruſhed to the oppoſite extreme, and had Charles the ſecond been as ambitious, as ſome of his predeceſſors were, he might have eſtabliſhed in England a power more arbitrary than the firſt Charles ever had in contemplation.</p>
            <p>Let us now ſuppoſe the colonies united and moulded into ſome form of government. Think one moment of the revenue neceſſary to ſupport this government, and to provide for even the appearance of defence. Conceive yourſelves in a manner exhauſted by the conflict with Great-Britain, now ſtaggering and ſinking under the load of your own taxes, and the weight of your own government. Conſider further, that to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der government operative and ſalutary, ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is neceſſary. This our patriots need not be told of, and when once they had mounted the ſteed, and found themſelves ſo well ſeated as to run no riſk of being thrown from the ſaddle, the ſeverity of their diſcipline to reſtore ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would be in proportion to their former treachery in deſtroying it. We have already ſeen ſpecimens of their tyranny, in their inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man treatment of perſons guilty of no crime, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of differing in ſentiment from the whigs. What then muſt we expect from ſuch ſcourges of mankind, when ſupported by imperial power?</p>
            <p>To elude the difficulty reſulting from our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs ſituation, we are told that the colonies would open a free trade with all the world, and all nations would join in protecting their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mart. A very little reflection will convince
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:014158_0084_0F93300A9687FD78"/>
us, that this is chimerical. American trade, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beneficial to Great-Britain, while ſhe can command it, would be but as a drop of the bucket, or the light duſt of the balance, to all the commercial ſtates of Europe: Beſides, were the Britiſh fleets and armies no longer deſtined to our protection, in a very ſhort time France and Spain would recover poſſeſſion of thoſe territories, that were torn reluctant and bleeding from them, in the laſt war, by the ſuperior ſtrength of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Our enemies would again extend their line of fortification, from the northern to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſhore, and by means of our late ſettlements ſtretching themſelves to the confines of Canada, and the communication opened from one country to the other, we ſhould be expoſed to perpetual incurſions from Canadians and ſavages; but our diſtreſs would not end here, for when once theſe incurſions ſhould be ſupported by the formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable armaments of France and Spain, the whole continent would become their eaſy prey, and would be parcelled out, Poland like. Recollect the conſternation we were thrown into laſt war, when fort William Henry was taken by the French: It was apprehended that New-England would be over-run by their conquering arms: It was even propoſed, for our own people to burn and lay waſte all the country weſt of Connecticut river, to impede the enemies march, and prevent their ravaging the country eaſt of it. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal came from no inconſiderable man. Conſider what muſt <hi>really</hi> have been our fate, unaided by Britain laſt war.</p>
            <p>Great-Britain aſide, what earthly power could ſtretch out the compaſſionate arm to ſhield us

from thoſe powers, that have long beheld us with the ſharp piercing eyes of avidity, and have heretofore bled freely, and expended their millions to obtain us? Do you ſuppoſe their luſt of empire is ſatiated? Or do you ſuppoſe, they would ſcorn to obtain ſo glorious a prize by an eaſy conqueſt? Or can any be ſo viſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and enthuſiaſtical as to believe that the Father of the univerſe will work miracles in favour of rebellion? And after having, by ſome unſeen arm, and mighty power, deſtroyed Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for us, will in the ſame myſterious way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us againſt other European powers? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we are told, that the colonies may put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the protection of ſome one foreign ſtate, but it ought to be conſidered that to do that, we muſt throw ourſelves into their power. We can make them no return for protection but by trade, and of that they can have no aſſurance, unleſs we become ſubject to their laws; this is evident by our contention with Britain.</p>
            <p>Which ſtate would you prefer being annexed to, France, Spain or Holland? I ſuppoſe the latter, as it is a republic; but are you ſure that the other powers of Europe would be idle ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, content to ſuffer the Dutch to ingroſs the American colonies, or their trade? And what figure would the Dutch probably make in the unequal conteſt? Their ſword has been long ſince ſheathed in commerce. Thoſe of you that have viſited Surinam, and ſeen a Dutch Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor diſpenſing, at diſcretion, his own opinions for law, would not ſuddenly exchange the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for Dutch government.</p>
            <p>I will ſubjoin ſome obſervations from the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:014158_0086_0F93300C0C4A02E8"/>
Farmer's letters. "When the appeal is made to the ſword, highly probable it is, that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will exceed the offence, and the calamities attending on war outweigh thoſe preceding it. Theſe conſiderations of juſtice and prudence, will always have great influence with good and wiſe men. To theſe reflections it remains to be added, and ought for ever to be remembered, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in the caſe of the colonies againſt their mother-country, is extremely different from the reſiſtance of a people againſt their prince: A na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may change their King, or race of Kings, and retaining their ancient form of government be gainers by changing. Thus Great-Britain under the illuſtrious houſe of Brunſwick, a houſe that ſeems to flouriſh for the happineſs of mankind, has found a felicity unknown in the reigns of the Stewarts; but if once we are ſeparated from our mother country, what new form of government ſhall we adopt, or where ſhall we find another Britain to ſupply our loſs? Torn from the body to which we are united by religion, laws, affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, relation, language and commerce, we muſt bleed at every vein. In truth, the proſperity of theſe provinces is founded in their dependance on Great-Britain."</p>
            <p>Thus, not only our allegiance binds us to obey acts of parliament, but every civil and religious privilege we enjoy depends upon it. I ſhall next enquire into thoſe acts that are called grievances. I do not know that I could wiſh that Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhould appear altogether blameleſs, but I aſſure you, we ſhall find nothing to juſtify the conduct of our patriots.</p>
