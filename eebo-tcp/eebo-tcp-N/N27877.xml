            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>BLACK GILES, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>POACHING GILES lived on the borders of one of thoſe great Moors in Somerſetſhire. Giles, to be ſure; has been a ſad fellow in his time; and it is none of his fault if his whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily do not end either at the gallows or at Botany Bay. He lives at that Mud Cottage with the broken windows <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tuffed with dirty rags, juſt beyond the gate which divides the upper from the lower Moor. You may know the houſe at a good diſtance by the ragged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iles on the roof, and the looſe ſtones which are ready to drop out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>himney; though a ſhort ladder, a
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037142_0003_100D7C13D179F020"/>
hod of mortar, and half an hour's lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure time would have prevented all this, and made the little dwelling tight enough. But as Giles had never learnt any thing that was good, ſo he did not know the value of ſuch uſeful ſayings as, that <hi>"a tile in time saves nine."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides this, Giles fell into that common miſtake, that a beggarly look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cottage, and filthy ragged children raiſed moſt compaſſion, and of courſe drew moſt charity. But as cunning as he was in other things, he was out in his reckoning here, for it is neatneſs, houſewifery, and a decent appearance which draws the kindneſs of the rich and charitable, while they turn away diſguſted from filth and lazineſs; not out of pride, but becauſe they ſee that it is next to impoſſible to mend the condition of thoſe who degrade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by dirt and ſloth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:037142_0003_100D7C13D179F020"/>
The common on which Giles's hovel ſtands is quite a deep marſh in a wet winter, but in ſummer it looks pretty enough. To be ſure it would be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convenient when one paſſes that way in a carriage if one of the children would run out and open the gate, as it would ſave the poſt boy from getting off, which is not very ſafe for the people within the chaiſe; but inſtead of any <hi>one</hi> of theſe children running out as ſoon as they hear the wheels, which would be quite time enough, what does Giles do, but ſet all his ragged brats, with dirty faces, matted locks, and naked feet and legs, to lie all day upon a ſand bank hard by the gate, waiting for the ſlender chance of what may be picked up from travellers. At the ſound of a carriage, a whole co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of theſe little ſcare-crows ſtart up, ruſh to the gate, and all at once thruſt out their hats and aprons; and for
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037142_0004_100D7C2077D94978"/>
fear this, together with the noiſe of their clamorous begging, ſhould not ſufficiently frighten the horſes, they are very apt to let the gate ſlap full a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, before you are half way through, in their eager ſcuffle to ſnatch from each other the half-pence which you may have thrown out to them. I know two ladies who were one day very near being killed by theſe abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable tricks.</p>
            <p>Thus five or ſix little idle crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who might be earning a trifle by knitting at home; who might be uſeful to the public by working in the field, and who might aſſiſt their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies by learning to get their bread twenty honeſt ways, are ſuffered to lie about all day, in the hope of a few chance halfpence, which after all they are by no means ſure of getting. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when the neighbouring gentle-floks
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037142_0004_100D7C2077D94978"/>
found out that opening the gate was the family trade, they ſoon left off giving any thing. And I myſelf, though I uſed to take out a penny rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give, had there been only <hi>one</hi> to receive it, when I ſee a whole family eſtabliſhed in ſo beggarly a trade, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly put it back again into my pocket, and give nothing at all. And ſo few travellers paſs that way, that ſome times, after the whole family have loſt a day, their gains do not amount to two-pence.</p>
            <p>As Giles had a far greater taſte for living by his wits, than his work, he was at one time in hopes, that his children might have got a pretty penny by tumbling for the diverſion of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and he ſet about training them in that indecent practice; but unlucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Moors being level, the carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges travelled faſter than the children
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037142_0005_100D7C2E77B43D18"/>
tumbled. He envied thoſe parents who lived on the London road, over the Wiltſhire Downs, which being very hilly, enables the tumbler to keep pace with the traveller, till he ſometimes extorts from the light and unthinking a reward inſtead of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. I beg leave, however, to put all gentlemen and ladies in mind that ſuch tricks are a kind of apprentice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the trades of begging and thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
            <p>Giles, to be ſure, as his children grew older, began to train them to ſuch other employments as the idle habits they had learned at the gate very properly qualified them for. The right of Common, which ſome of the poor Cottagers have in that part of the country, which it doubtleſs a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable advantage to many, was converted by Giles into the means of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037142_0005_100D7C2E77B43D18"/>
corrupting his whole family, for his children, as ſoon as they grew too big for the trade of begging at the gate, were promoted to the dignity of thieving on the Moor. Here he kept two or three aſſes, miſerable beings, which, if they had the good fortune to eſcape an untimely death by ſtarving, did not fail to meet with it by beating. Some of the biggeſt boys were ſent out with theſe lean and galled ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, to carry ſand or coals about the neighbouring towns. Both ſand and coals were often ſtolen before they got them to ſell, or if not they always took care to cheat in ſelling them. By long practice in this art, they grew ſo dextrous, that they could give a pretty good gueſs how large a coal they could crib out of every bag be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the buyer would be likely to miſs it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:037142_0006_100D7C31024A3268"/>
All their odd time was taken up under the pretence of watching theſe aſſes on the Moor, or running after five or ſix half-ſtarved geeſe: but the truth is, theſe boys were only watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for an opportunity to ſteal an odd gooſe of their neighbour's. They u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alſo to pluck the quills or the down from theſe poor live creatures, or half milk a cow before the farmer's maid came with her pail. They all knew how to calculate to a minute what time to be down in a morning to let out their lank hungry beaſts, which they had turned over night into the farmer's field to ſteal a little good paſture. They contrived to get there juſt time enough to eſcape being caught in replacing the ſtakes they had pulled out for the cattle to get o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. For Giles was a prudent long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed fellow, and wherever he ſtole food for his colts, took care never to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037142_0006_100D7C31024A3268"/>
ſteal ſtakes from the hedges at the ſame time. He had ſenſe enough to know that the gain did not make up for the danger; he knew that a looſe faggot, pulled from a neighbour's p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e of wood after the family were gone to bed, anſwered the end better, and was not half the trouble.</p>
            <p>Among the many trades which Giles profeſſed, he ſometimes practiſed that of a rat catcher; but he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to ſo many tricks that he never followed the ſame trade long. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was ſent for to a farm-houſe, his cuſtom was to kill a few of the old rats, always taking care to leave a little ſtock of young ones alive ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to keep up the breed; for, ſays he, "If I were to be ſuch a fool as to clear a houſe or barn at once, how would my trade be carried on?<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" And where any barn was overſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037142_0007_100D7D1513677FB0"/>
he uſed to borrow a few from thence juſt to people a neighbouring granary that had none; and he might have gone on until now, had he not unluckily been caught one evening emptying his cage of young rats under Parſon Wilſon's barn door.</p>
            <p>This worthy Miniſter, Mr. Wilſon, uſed to pity the neglected children of Giles as much as he bramed the wicked parents. He one day picked up Dick, who was far the beſt of Giles's bad boys. Dick was loitering about in a field behind the parſons garden in ſearch of a hen's neſt, his mother having ordered him to bring home a few eggs that night by hook or by crook, as Giles was reſolved to have ſome pancakes for ſupper, though he knew that eggs were a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a-piece. Mr. Wilſon had long been deſirous of ſnatching ſome of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037142_0007_100D7D1513677FB0"/>
this vagrant family from ruin, and his chief hopes were bent on Dick, was the leaſt hackneyed in knavery. He had once given him a new pair of ſhoes, on his promiſing to go to ſchool next Sunday: but no ſooner had Rachel, the boy's mother, got the ſhoes into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her clutches, than ſhe pawned them for a bottle of gin, and ordered the boy to keep out of the Parſon's fight, and to be ſure to play his marbles on Sundays for the future at the other end of the pariſh, and not near the Churh-yard. Mr. Wilſon, however, picked up the boy once more, for it was not his way to deſpair of any body. Dick was juſt going to take to his heels as uſual for fear the old ſtory of the ſhoes ſhould be brought forward; but finding he could not get off; what does he do but run into a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle puddle of muddy water which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037142_0008_100D7D18E7657300"/>
lay between him and the Parſon, that the ſight of his naked feet might not bring on the dreaded ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Now it happened that Mr. Wilſon was planting a little field of beans, ſo he thought this a good op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to employ Dick; he told him he had ſome pretty eaſy work for him. Dick did as he was bid; he willingly went to work, and readily began to plant his beans with diſpatch and regularity, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections given him.</p>
            <p>While the boy was buſily at work by himſelf, Giles happened to come by, having been ſkulking round the back way to look over the Parſon's garden wall, to ſee if there was any thing worthy climbing over for, on the enſuing night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ſpied Dick, and began to rate him for working for the ſtingey old Parſon, for Giles had
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037142_0008_100D7D18E7657300"/>
a natural antipathy to whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Church. "What has he promiſed thee a day?" ſaid he "lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enough I dare ſay." "He is not to pay me by the day," ſaid Dick, "but ſays he will give me ſo much when I have planted this peck, and ſo much for the next." "Oh, oh! that alters the caſe" ſaid Giles. "One may, indeed, get a trifle by this ſort of work. Come, give me a handful of the beans. I will teach thee how to plant when thou art paid for planting by the peck. All we have to do in that caſe is to diſpatch the work as faſt as we can, and get rid of the beans with all ſpeed; and as to the ſeed coming up or not, that is no buſineſs of ours; we are paid for planting, not growing. At the rate thou goeſt on thou would'ſt not get ſix-pence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. Come along, bury away."
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037142_0009_100D7D1AA89E7000"/>
So ſaying, he took his hatful of the ſeed, and where Dick had been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to ſet one bean, Giles buried a dozen. So the beans were ſoon out. But though the peck was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, the ground was unplanted. But cunning Giles knew this could not be found out till the time when the beans might be expected to come up, "and then Dick," ſaid he, "the ſnails and the mice may go ſhares in the blame; or we can lay the fault on the rooks or the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds." So ſaying, he ſent the boy into the Parſonage to receive his pay, taking care to ſecure about a quarter of the peck of beans for his own colt; he put both bag and beans into his own pocket to carry home, bidding Dick tell Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he had planted the beans and loſt the bag.</p>

In the mean time Giles's other boys were buſy in emtying the ponds and trout-ſtreams in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manor. They would ſteal away the carp and tench when they were no bigger than gudgeons; by this untimely depredation they plundered the owner without enriching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But the pleaſure of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief was reward enough. Theſe and a hundred other little thieveries, they committed with ſuch dexterity, that old Tim Crib, whoſe ſon was tranſported laſt aſſizes for ſheep ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, uſed to be often reproaching his boys, that Giles's ſons were worth a hundred of ſuch blockheads as he had; for ſcarce a night paſt but Giles had ſome little comfortable thing for ſupper which his boys had pilfered in the day, while <hi>his</hi> undutiful dogs never ſtole any thing worth having. Giles, in the mean time, was buſy in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037142_0010_100D7D1C567F4AE8"/>
his way, but as buſy as he was in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nets, ſtarting coveys, and training dogs, he always took care that his depredations ſhould not be confined merely to game.</p>
            <p>Giles's boys had never ſeen the inſide of a church ſince they were chriſtened, and the father thought he knew his own intereſt better than to force them to it; for church-time was the ſeaſon of their harveſt. Then the hens' neſts were ſearched, a ſtray duck was clapped under the ſmock frock, the tools which might have been left by chance in a farm-yard were picked up, and all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring pigeon-houſes were thinned, ſo that Giles uſed to boaſt to his wife, that Sunday was to them the moſt profitable day in the week. With her it was certainly the moſt labourious day, as ſhe always did her waſhing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037142_0010_100D7D1C567F4AE8"/>
and ironing on the Sunday morning, it being, as ſhe ſaid, the only leiſure day ſhe had, for on the other days ſhe went about the country telling for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and ſelling dream books, and wicked ſongs. Neither her huſband's nor her children's cloaths were ever mended, and if Sunday, her idle day, had not come about once in every week, it is likely they would never have been waſhed neither. You might, however, ſee her as you were going to church ſmoothing her own rags on her beſt red cloak, which ſhe always uſed for her ironing cloth on Sundays, for her cloak when ſhe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, and for her blanket at night; ſuch a wretched manager was Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel! among her other articles of trade one was to make and ſell pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permint, and other diſtilled waters. Theſe ſhe had the cheap art of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king without trouble, and without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037142_0011_100D7D1E09041330"/>
for ſhe made them without herbs and without a ſtill. Her way was, to fill ſo many quart bottle with plain water, putting a ſpoonful of mint water in the mouth of each; theſe ſhe corked down with roſin, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying to each cuſtomer a phial of r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>al diſtilled water to taſte, by way of ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This was ſo good that her bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles were commonly bought up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being opened; but if any ſuſpicion aroſe, and ſhe was forced to uncork a bottle, by the few drops of diſtilled water lying at top, ſhe even then eſcaped detection, and took care to get out of reach before the bottle was opened a ſecond time. She was too prudent ever to go twice to the ſame houſe.</p>
            <p>There is hardly any petty miſchief that is not connected with the life of a poacher. Mr. Wilſon was aware of this,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037142_0011_100D7D1E09041330"/>
he was not only a pious clergyman, but an upright juſtice. He uſed to ſay that people who are truly conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, muſt be ſo in ſmall things as well as in great ones, or they would deſtroy the effect of their own precepts and their example would not be of general uſe. For this reaſon he never would accept of a hare or partridge from an unqualified perſon in his pariſh. He did not content himſelf with ſhuffling the thing off by aſking no queſtions, and pretending to take it for granted in a general way that the game was fairly come at; but he uſed to ſay that by receiving the booty he connived at a crime; made himſelf a ſharer in it, and if he gave a preſent to the man who brought it, he even tempted him to repeat the fault.</p>
            <p>One day poor Jack Weſton, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt fellow in the neighbourhood,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037142_0012_100D7D218BDA1690"/>
whom Mr. Wilſon had kindly viſited and relieved in a long ſickneſs, from which he had but juſt recovered, was brought before him as he was ſitting on the Juſtice's bench; Jack was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of having knocked down a hare, and of all the birds in the air, who ſhould the informer be but black Giles the poacher? Mr. Wilſon was grieved at the charge, he had a great regard for Jack, but he had a ſtill greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for the law. The poor fellow pleaded guilty. He did not deny the fact, but ſaid he did not conſider it a crime, he did not think game was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate property, and he owned he had a ſtrong temptation for doing what he had done, which he hoped would plead in his excuſe. The Juſtice deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to know what this temptation was. "Sir," ſaid the poor fellow, "you know I was given over this ſpring in a bad fever. I had no friend in the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037142_0012_100D7D218BDA1690"/>
world but you Sir. Under God you ſaved my life by your charitable relief; and I truſt you may have helped to ſave my ſoul by your prayers and your good advice. I know I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make you amends for all your goodneſs, but I thought it would be ſome comfort to my full heart if I could but once give you ſome little token of my gratitude. So I had trained a pair of nice turtle doves for Madam Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but they were ſtolen from me Sir, and I do ſuſpect black Giles ſtole them. Yeſterday morning, Sir, as I was crawling out to my work, for I am ſtill but very weak, a fine hare ran acroſs my path. I did not ſtay to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether it was wrong to kill a hare, but I felt it was right to ſhew my gratitude; ſo Sir, without a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's thought I did knock down the hare which I was going to carry to your Worſhip, becauſe I knew Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037142_0013_100D7D2436A9BA88"/>
was fond of hare. I am truly ſorry for my fault, and will ſubmit to whatever puniſhment your worſhip may pleaſe to inflict."</p>
            <p>Mr. Wilſon was much moved with this honeſt confeſſion, and touched with the poor fellow's gratitude. What added to the effect of the ſtory, was the weak condition and pale, ſickly looks of the offender. But this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Juſtice never ſuffered his feelings to bias his integrity; he knew that he did not ſit on that bench to indulge pity, but to adminiſter juſtice. And while he was ſorry for the offender he would not juſtify the offence. "John," ſaid he, "I am ſurpriſed that you could for a moment forget that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accept any gift which cauſes the giver to break a law. On Sunday I teach you from the pulpit the laws of God, whoſe miniſter I am. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037142_0013_100D7D2436A9BA88"/>
I fill the chair of the magiſtrate to enforce and execute the laws of the land. Between thoſe and the others there is more connection than you are aware. I thank you, John, for your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for me, and I admire your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; but I muſt not allow either af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or gratitude to be brought as a plea for a wrong action. It is not your buſineſs nor mine, John, to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle whether the game laws are good or bad. Till they are repealed we muſt obey them. Many, I doubt not, break theſe laws through ignorance, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I am certain, who would not dare to ſteal a gooſe or a turkey, make no ſcruple to knock down a hare or a partridge. You will hereafter think yourſelf happy that this your firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt has proved unſucceſsful, as I truſt you are too honeſt a fellow ever to intend to turn poacher. With poaching much moral evil is connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037142_0014_100D7D262E7EFFF8"/>
a habit of nightly depradation; a cuſtom of prowling in the dark for prey, produces in time a diſreliſh for honeſt labour. He whoſe firſt offence was committed without much thought or evil intention, if he happens to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a few times in carrying off his booty undiſcovered, grows bolder and bolder; and when he fancies there is no ſhame attending it, he very ſoon gets to perſuade himſelf that there is alſo no ſin. While ſome people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a ſcruple about ſtealing a ſheep, they partly live by plundering of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens. But remember that the warren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pays a high rent, and therefore his rabbits are as much his property as his ſheep. Do not then deceive yourſelves with theſe falſe diſtinctions. All proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſacred, and as the laws of the land are intended to fence in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, he who brings up his children to break down any of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe fences,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037142_0014_100D7D262E7EFFF8"/>
brings them up to certain ſin and ruin. He who begins with robbing orchards, rabbit-warrens, and fiſh-ponds, will probably end with horſe-ſtealing or highway robbery. Poaching is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular apprenticeſhip to bolder crimes. He whom I may commit as a boy to ſit in the ſtocks for killing a partridge, may be likely to end at the gallows for killing a man.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, you who now hear me, the ſtrictneſs and impartiality of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. I know Giles to be a worthleſs fellow, yet it is my duty to take his information; I know Jack Weſton to be an honeſt youth, yet I muſt be obliged to make him pay the penalty. Giles is a bad man, but he can prove this fact: Jack is a worthy lad, but he has committed this fault, I am ſorry for you, Jack: but do not let it grieve you that Giles has played
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037142_0015_100D7D2888ECD210"/>
worſe tricks a hundred times, and yet got off, while you were detected in the very firſt offence, for that would be grieving becauſe you are not ſo great a rogue as Giles. At this moment you think your good luck is very unequal: but all this will one day turn out in your favour. Giles is not the more a favourite of heaven becauſe he has hitherto eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Botany Bay or the Hulks; nor is it any mark of God's diſpleaſure againſt you, John, that you were found out in your very firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt."</p>
            <p>Here the good Juſtice left off ſpeaking, and no one could contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the truth of what he had ſaid. Weſton humbly ſubmitted to his ſentence, but he was very poor, and knew not where to raiſe the money to pay his fine. His character had always been ſo fair, that ſeveral farmers preſent kindly agreed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037142_0015_100D7D2888ECD210"/>
a trifle each to prevent his being ſent to priſon, and he thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed to work out the debt. The Juſtice himſelf, though he could not ſoften the law, yet ſhewed Weſton ſo much kindneſs, that he was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, before the year was out, to get out of this difficulty. He began to think more ſeriouſly than he had ever yet done, and grew to abhor p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not merely from fear but from principle.</p>
            <p>We ſhall ſoon ſee whether poaching Giles always got off ſo ſucceſsfully. Here we have ſeen that proſperity is no ſure ſign of goodneſs. Next week we may, perhaps, ſee that the "tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing of the wicked is ſhort: for then I promiſe to give the Second Part of the Poacher, together with the entertaining Story of the Widow Brown's Apple Tree.</p>
