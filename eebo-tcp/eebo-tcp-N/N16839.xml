            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE thirſt for Novelty is unextinguiſhable. The human mind is of ſuch exquiſite ſuſceptibility, as to be inſatiable to variety; hence it is the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this town have more than once diſcovered their avidity to gratify this paſſion or affection by inſtantly ſnatching up newſpapers, magazines, and even <hi>farces.</hi> Some people may perhaps attribute this eagerneſs in purſuit of literary entertainment to a <hi>love of ſcandal.</hi> With what greater degree of truth, might this be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to a deſire of ſomething <hi>new!</hi>—I have the charity to ſuppoſe this may be one of the cauſes which prompt the publick to buy new publications, not to ſay any thing of encouraging the Art of Printing—the boaſt of Americans—the palladium of liberty—and the cream of the Conſtitution. Sorry I am to add that this eager ſolicitude in a generous publick has oftentimes been ill requited; it has been requited with a farcical repreſentation of a few heterogeneous incidents, thrown together with <hi>injudicious haſte,</hi> and prompted ſolely by the lucre of gain—a few private anecdotes have been inſerted in theſe pages, but without inſtruction, without even amuſement for their aim, they have obtained, for the reaſon above cited, a temporary reception; but not deſerving a repoſitory in the library of Curioſity, or even in the memory of Slander, they have ſilently rolled down
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:021678_0003_0FB50F4D68F66F58"/>
the ſtream of time into the dull lake of oblivion. The dramatick ſtyle is univerſally allowed to be a uſeful channel for conveying inſtruction to all claſſes of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens—and though a <hi>new play</hi> muſt neceſſarily looſe a great part of its effect, becauſe the <hi>advantage of action</hi>
is ſhut out, yet a candid mind will doubtleſs and nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertheleſs <hi>receive the ſeed into good ground</hi>; the <hi>good humour</hi> of the reader muſt therefore ſupply the <hi>comick humour</hi> of an actor. Whence it appears that a <hi>Farci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Opera</hi> preſented to the American ſtates at this junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, muſt be a very <hi>uſeful work.</hi> The following <hi>work,</hi> therefore, is now offered to the candour, and for the amuſement and edification of the credulous publick. A publick whom I call <hi>credulous</hi> becauſe they have generally purchaſed books of this kind before they took the trouble to examine them. If then they have been cheated by the empty ſound of a title, the queſtion is, <hi>How ought a Farce to be written.</hi> I can anſwer the queſtion in no better way than by encouraging the reader diligently to peruſe, what he now ſeeth before him. In a more eſpecial manner will his good nature be awakened, when he finds that the converſation of the parties tends to ſome general point, that the <hi>unities</hi> of the Drama are not altogether violated, and that a PLOT is purſued and brought about, all which muſt provoke his patience to read theſe fifty pages clean through.</p>

and ſubject to the caprice of an unnatural father—of a father who places his happineſs in the accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of riches, and deems every man unworthy his eſteem, whoſe diſpoſition is not equally parſimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For this reaſon I begin to ſuſpect the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of old <hi>Alonzo.</hi> I ſee him daily cloſeted with my father, and indeed he has been uncommonly polite to me, of late.

                                       <p>At the Comick Opera I have ſometimes ſeen action alone excite the higheſt applauſe, independent of either the poetry or the muſick. I ſaw a Duo performed by an old man and a young woman, ſuppoſed to be his daughter, in ſuch an humourous manner, as drew an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal <hi>enchore</hi> from the ſpectators. The merit of the muſical part of the compoſition, I was told, was but very moderate, and as for ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you ſhall judge.</p>
                                       <p>The father informs his daughter, in a ſong, that he has found an excellent match for her; who, beſides being rich, and very prudent, and not too young, was over and above a particular friend of his own, and, in perſon and diſpoſition, much ſuch a man as himſelf; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, by telling her, that the ceremony will be performed next day. She thanks him, in the gayeſt air poſſible, for his obliging intentions, adding, that ſhe ſhould have been glad to have ſhewn her implicit obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his commands, provided there had been any chance of the man's being to her taſte; but as, from the account he had given, there could be none, ſhe declares ſhe will not marry him next day, and adds, with a <hi>very long</hi> quaver, that if ſhe were to live to <hi>eternity,</hi> ſhe ſhould continue of the ſame opinion. The father, in a violent rage, tells her, that inſtead of tomorrow, the marriage ſhould take place that very day; to which ſhe replies, Non; he rejoins, Si; ſhe, Non, non; he, Si, ſi; the daughter, Non, non, non; the father, Si, ſi, ſi; and ſo the ſinging continues for five or ſix minutes. You perceive there is noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marvelouſly witty in this; and for a daughter to be of a different opinion from her father, in the choice of a huſband, is not a very new dramatick incident. Well, I told you the Duo was encored—they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately performed it a ſecond time, and with more humour than the firſt. The whole houſe vociferated for it again; and it was ſung a third time, in a manner equally pleaſant, and yet perfectly different from any of the former two.</p>
                                       <p>I thought the houſe would have been brought down about our ears, ſo extravagant were the teſtimonies of approbation.</p>
                                       <p>The two actors were obliged to appear again, and ſing this Duo a fourth time; which they executed in a ſtyle ſo new, ſo natural, and ſo exquiſitely droll, that the audience now thought there had been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deficient in all their former performances, and that they had hit on the true comick only this laſt time.</p>
                                       <p>Some people began to call for it again; but the old man, now quite exhauſted, begged for mercy; on which the point was given up. I never had any idea that ſuch ſtrong comick powers could have been diſplayed in ſinging a ſong.—MOORE'S ITALY, vol. i. page 222, &amp;c.</p>

It is for the glory of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to depreciate the merit of <hi>America,</hi> that ſhe may appear unrivalled—the like as we may ſee in our manner of electioneering; for inſtance; a man wants to be a Rep. or a Congreſs man, he in the firſt place puts a piece in the <hi>Centinel,</hi> telling how and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what a great man he is, with his name in a line of capital letters; but the cream of the jeſt is, that <hi>he takes care to black all the other candidates.</hi> A Frenchman, on the other hand, is a gentleman, and I love a Frenchman.

               <l>Thus to harangue you of our own accord:—</l>
               <l>Perhaps you'd have us tell you, if we're able,</l>
               <l>Whether there's any Moral to our Fable.—</l>
               <l>—A father contradicted by a daughter—</l>
               <l>This, in our mind, is no ſuch mighty matter.</l>
               <l>—Morals we hate—we love to deal in fiction—</l>

               <l>We ſought the <hi>bard</hi>—"a Farce, a Farce," we ſaid—</l>
               <l>"Ah, <hi>ſcandal,</hi>" quoth the man, and ſhook his head—</l>
