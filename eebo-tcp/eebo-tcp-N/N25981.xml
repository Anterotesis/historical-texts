            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE occaſion of our preſent meeting is ſolemn and affecting, melancholy but joyful. We are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened to celebrate the triumphs of benevolence; but we are convened alſo to the renewed exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the long, extenſive, and malignant uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of civil and domeſtic tyranny. Conflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tumultuous recollections preſs upon our minds—recollections of all that renders man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable and abhorred, amiable and illuſtrious. We have ſeen an exemplary ſpirit of juſtice, active and indefatigable, animate the boſoms of a few. The juſtice, the humanity, the policy, the intereſt, of the enſlavers of men have been eloquently appealed to; but with partial ſucceſs!—A few have liſtened and reflected; a few have felt and acted; but the many have continued unmoved, have perſevered in the practice of their cruelties. Yet, ſtartled and confuſed, in the midſt of their career, by the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding progreſs of emancipation, they dread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, are leſs aſſured of their future ſucceſs, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034554_0004_0FFE273559AAE088"/>
have mitigated their ſeverity, or doubled their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions. In this ſtate of the public ſentiment, our duty is obvious and ſimple—to preſerve the vivid recollection of the enormities which mark the reign of oppreſſion; of the efforts which have been made to ſhorten or deſtroy it; of the motives which ſhould compel us to proceed in this exalted labour: to diſſeminate the knowledge of them far and wide, to the young as well as to the old, to the enſlaved as well as to the free; and, for ourſelves, to act with gentleneſs but with firmneſs, with zeal but with prudence.</p>
            <p>The moſt haſty outline of the hiſtory of ſlavery muſt commence with the formation of Society: the hiſtory of man is the hiſtory of ſlavery.</p>
            <p>In the rude ages of the world, as in the moſt refined, ſuperior force and ſuperior cunning have equally been practiſed, and have both ſucceeded in enſlaving one portion of the human race to another. What individual ſtrength and perſonal addreſs accompliſhed, in reſpect to one or a few, in the infancy of ſociety, has been ſince extended and perpetuated by multiform combinations both of power and art. Ignorance, and credulity and fear, the companions of ignorance, furniſhed ample op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for ſucceſsful enterprize, where direct violence muſt have been hazardous and uncertain. Mental ſlavery, therefore, was of early origin and quick growth; it was aſſiduouſly cultivated; and the bands of ſuperſtition reſtrained thoſe who would eaſily have ſhaken off the fetters of ſubjection. So important were theſe two methods of holding men
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:034554_0005_0FFE26FF88E44690"/>
in bondage to each other, ſo conſentaneous in their principles, and ſo co-ordinate in their birth, that, in the outſet, they were not infrequently united in the ſame perſon: the ſame perſon was at once king and pontiff. As ſociety advanced, the agents of this tyranny were augmented; a ſeeming diviſion of powers took place, while a real union was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: to one party was committed the execution of their joint devices; to the other was entruſted the more ſilent and ſpecious diffuſion of opinions favourable to their views. The firſt ſubdued op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the field; the laſt undermined it in the family; and while the king led his chiefs to combat, the pontiff, ſurrounded by his prieſts, inveſted with the ſecurity of inviolable ſanctity, refined his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, multiplied his wiles, and at length ſucceeded in ſubjugating the prince as well as the people. This was ſometimes a delicate taſk; but the fear which even the moſt powerful deſpots entertain of their ſlaves, favoured the ſacerdotal uſurpation; and they were held by intereſt who ſecretly derided the pretenſions of the prelacy.</p>
            <p>As the ſtate of ſociety improved, the cultivators of ſuperſtition ſubtilized and perfected their arts. They ſaw and obeyed the neceſſity of governing leſs in appearance, while they redoubled their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, by converting to their aid all the errors of judgment, all the violences of paſſion, and all the phenomena of nature, to hold an ampler tyranny over the minds of men. Unable abſolutely to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede the progreſs of knowledge, they laboured to diſtort it to their own purpoſes; or, failing of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034554_0006_0FFE2736DDEE0878"/>
impoſed a more powerful obſtacle, by exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their influence for the deſtruction of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable ſovereign, and enlightened philoſopher.</p>
            <p>While nations were excluſively ruled by the prieſthood, or by tyrants who united in their own perſons the offices of monarch and high-prieſt, no ſafe means of obtaining and conſolidating authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were neglected. Afterwards, upon a ſeparation of the two functions of enſlaving the bodies and ſubjugating the minds of men, the leaders of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſtrenuouſly ſupported all the outrages of the deſpot who was ſubſervient to their wiſhes; and, whether he ground with the iron edge of oppreſſion his own ſubjects, or the ſubjects of another, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his capricious frenzy doomed his own territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or the dominions of a neighbouring prince, to deſolation, alike ſuſtained his fury and panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized his injuſtice. Under ſuch circumſtances, is it wonderful that ſlavery became widely diffuſed; that the ſword and the robe alone were deemed worthy the ambition of the great; that all the arts which nouriſh and bleſs mankind were deſpiſed as ſervile; that men became the worſhippers of men, and eagerly acknowledged themſelves the ſervants of one, that they might more ſecurely tyrannize over many.</p>
            <p>Nor was this ſtate of things limited to monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies. Forms of government rather varied the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the ſpirit of deſpotiſm, than deſtroyed it. If the citizens of States denominated free, were leſs ſervile in their demeanour towards thoſe who were at any time entruſted with authority, they
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034554_0007_0FFE27026F7C4FA0"/>
were not the more diſpoſed to relinquiſh their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the perſons and minds of thoſe whom they had ſubdued, by ſtealth, or artifice, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, to their pleaſure. The ſubjects of the Great King, indeed, proſtrated themſelves in <hi>his</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, whom they might now ſupplant, now flatter to accompliſh their deſigns; but the frigid ſoldiery of Sparta, and the fickle citizens of Athens, held, with combined watchfulneſs, their numerous ſlaves in hopeleſs ſubjection. Here, ſtill more than in the voluptuous capitals of the Eaſt, all mechanic arts were deemed baſe, and the free citizen would have held himſelf degraded by the perſonal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of any of the offices which contribute to the immediate ſupport of life. Rome and Carthage were full of ſlaves, whoſe condition was little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe now employed in our own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and the moſt illuſtrious ſtateſmen and generals of all theſe ancient and celebrated Republics re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, through files of proſtrate ſlaves, from the delivery of their fellow-citizens, from the ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſſertion of their own freedom, to domineer, at home, over wretches by nature equally entitled to liberty and happineſs.</p>
            <p>If ſuch were the conduct of the freeſt and moſt flouriſhing States of antiquity, in their moſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous days, what was to be expected from them when ſunk and degraded by all the imbecility of voluptuouſneſs and ſloth, and all the vices of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and ignorance?</p>
            <p>The dark ages, as they are called, were empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically the torpor of the human race; the ſleep, in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034554_0008_0FFE27385FF06C10"/>
which every horrid and diſguſtful dream tortured and disfigured the perverted mind. The introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of letters, from the Eaſt, into the new and riſing republics of Italy, effected but little for the general relief of ſlavery. Feodality and ſuperſtition bound in double fetters the maſs of mankind. The invention of printing was equally without ſudden benefit. The diſcovery of gun-powder contributed more ſpeedily to this end, by equalizing the powers of men. And the reformation, attempted by others, but accompliſhed by Luther and Calvin, made a deeper inroad into this ſavage conſtitution of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. From this moment the foundations of ſlavery were ſhaken. The pillar of the church was its proudeſt column. It was no longer the ſanctuary of the oppreſſor; and the veſtibule of inquiry once ſafely paſt, nothing could protect the interior of the temple from the reiterated attacks of the keen ſpirit of inveſtigation: its lofty turrets, and its ample walls, were deſtined ſucceſſively to thunder to the ground. Thence forward, the progreſs of ſocial amelioration has been conſtant, though ſlow.</p>
            <p>While theſe tranſactions were changing the face of Europe, the diſcovery and ſettlement of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica opened a new field for the execution of every noble, as well as every baneful enterprize. What <hi>was</hi> done, need not be repeated. The melancholy recollection oppreſſes even us, whoſe immediate anceſtors bore ſo little ſhare in theſe deteſtable events. Scarcely was the ſword of extermination laid aſide, half ſated with the blood of its innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable victims, when freſh crimes were deviſed
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034554_0009_0FFE2705582482F0"/>
for the curſe of this new-diſcovered world. A gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant nation, by whoſe generous efforts their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive land had been reſcued from the long dominion of brave but hated conquerors;—a nation that had led the way in naval and commercial enterprize;—whoſe empire, narrow at home, had been extended, by the vigour of its councils and the proweſs of its chiefs, to the diſtant ſhores of Aſia, of Africa, and of America, were the firſt t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> violate the noble principles by which they had been guided in their own defence, and to commence the abominable traffic in their fellow men. Their example was ſpeedily followed by others; and they who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the armies of a monarch, who had brought a king to the ſcaffold, who deſerted their country to preſerve their civil and religious liberty, they were the firſt to imitate this dark proceeding, and to engage in this abhorred commerce. The rivalry of ſome nations, and the avarice of others, multiplied and extended the evil; and while the conſciences and the reaſon of the European pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of America were paralized, or ſlept in thoughtleſs repoſe, African ſubjection and domeſtic ſlavery were propagated, from the frozen bays of the north, to the icy and tempeſtuous oceans of the ſouth. The diſeaſe daily increaſed and gained vigour, while the patient was inconſcious of its progreſs, or regarded it with the ſmile of ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation, as deſirable and felicitous.—Negro ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very was univerſal—and the conduct of it, at home and abroad, was wrought into a ſyſtem, purſued with an unrelenting ſpirit of enterprizing cruelty,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034554_0010_0FFE273E2FE3A4C0"/>
and maintained by all the force of watchful and ſuſpicious tyranny.</p>
            <p>Such was the ſtate of the ſubject in the then Colonies of Great-Britain, in the United States, when an obſcure individual of a derided ſect, ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a ſudden conviction of the enormity of the crime, and the fearful conſequences to reſult from its continuance, ſounded the alarm of forſaken juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and violated humanity, deplored the treachery of man to man, and denounced the diſobedience of mortals to the Immortal. The loud appeals of Woolman were ſucceeded by the gender, but more touching expoſtulations of Benezet. The firſt was a ſudden torrent, daſhed into foam againſt impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable rocks, yet ſcattered over and ſlightly moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſurrounding ſoil: the ſecond, a deep, ſilent, and diffuſed ſtream, that percolates the ſands, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the leaſt conſolidated rocks, bubbling and oozing forth through a thouſand paſſages and clefts, and ſpreading over and fertilizing an extenſive ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory. Encouraged by the example of theſe men, or awakened by their admonitions, new advocates for the oppreſſed aroſe. But they increaſed their own zeal more than they augmented the charity of others. Their ſucceſs was ſmall—their advances ſlow. Still they advanced. The fears and jealouſies of the holders of ſlaves were, at length, alarmed; and oppreſſion, which, at firſt, derided the feeble efforts of its adverſaries, and contemned them as the frantic revels of inſanity or folly, was rouzed into action, and animated into ſpeech.

Truth and Reaſon are all-powerful if they gain an audience. The arguments of Falſehood are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them, as cobwebs in the hands of Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. To have obtained a parley with their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, is to have half atchieved a victory. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley has been obtained; the conferences have been carried on with ardour; the enemy have maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ground with obſtinacy; but they are every where foiled and beaten down; they are driven to their laſt ſubterfuges; and victory begins to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the balance of final ſuperiority on the ſide of juſtice.</p>

They purchaſed the victims of unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful war of their victorious maſters; they obeyed the prophetic voice of Heaven, whether they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugated the accurſed ſeed of Cain, diſtinguiſhed from the righteous progeny of Seth, by their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy hue, or ſubdued to ſervants [themſelves the children of Japhet, dwelling in the tents of Shem,] the offspring of degenerate Ham; they but exerciſed the authority with which they were inveſted, when to man was given dominion over the beaſts of the field, the fowls of the air, and all things elſe which have life and motion.—They forgot that war, but in ſelf-defence, that hoſtile incurſion, was alike a violation of juſtice, whether covered with defeat, or crowned with ſucceſs; that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034554_0012_0FFE273FB2EC1A30"/>
men born to equal rights, though they might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit them by crime, could not be deprived of them by force; that no claim could be founded on the infraction of right; and they concealed, or hoped to conceal, the odious cauſe of thoſe conqueſts on which they built their pretenſions, ſince that cauſe exiſted in their own injuſtice, in their own avarice of oppreſſion. They forgot that the ſame Jehovah who inflicted puniſhment on the firſt fratricide, did not extend it to his offspring; and that the mark which diſtinguiſhed him from men was a token of mercy. They forgot that the curſe was limited to the lineal deſcendants of one of the children of the brutal ſon of Noah; that no induſtry could trace the connection between this ſuppoſed anceſtor and his ſuppoſed progeny; that, whatever might be the will of the Deity, in reſpect to any particular race of men, nothing could juſtify another for inflicting unprovoked injury upon them; that the code from which they derived their pretended authority to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave one portion of their fellow-men, declared all to be brethren, the children of one parent, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the ſame inheritance; that he whom they acknowledged as their Saviour, proclaimed himſelf equally the ſaviour of all men; and that, the future deſtiny of all being the ſame, they were unequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally entitled to the ſame preſent advantages. They forgot that the differences in the talents and erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men aroſe ſimply from external circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; that the ſame courſe or ſpecies of events which now elevated the inhabitants of Europe and their deſcendants to the ſummit of political pre-eminence,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034554_0013_0FFE2709C401AA50"/>
formerly as much diſtinguiſhed the progenitors of their unhappy ſlaves from the reſt of mankind; that the cradle of the ſciences was in Africa, and their firſt nurſlings, and their earlieſt fathers, Africans.—All this they forgot—but they were reminded of it; they were ſilent, but they were not aſhamed.</p>
            <p>Their new plea was founded on <hi>Humanity,</hi>—O impudence of vice!—on that humanity by them ſo violated and trampled on. They removed ignorant and unhappy beings, from regions of barbariſm and ſuperſtition, to countries enlightened by knowledge and adorned with arts. They brought them to a chriſtian country, where the true God was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and worſhipped, where his ordinances were promulgated and explained, and where acceſs was eaſy to the only means of a virtuous preſent and happy future life. Here, fed, clothed, inſtructed in numerous arts, and with opportunities for religious improvement, how much better their condition than in their native realms!—Gentle preachers of humanity! generous inſtructors of the ſavage and the ignorant! It was for this, then, that ye croſſed ſeas and oceans, braving innumerable toils and dangers; for this that ye excited murderous wars between peaceful and friendly neighbours; for this that ye tore away, ſundering them from their native country, from each other, whole tribes,—parents and children, huſband and wife, the infirm and the hardy,—maſſacreing perhaps, or leaving to periſh, the aged and the little one; for this that ye bound them with iron, preſſed them like bales of cloth together into the ſame hold, without diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034554_0014_0FFE274137D9B2F0"/>
of ſex,—excluding them from light and air; for this that ye hurried them to frozen, or to burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regions, ſcourged them to inceſſant toil, and tortured them into unreſiſting ſubmiſſion; it was for this that all theſe exertions were made, and ſo long continued—in obedience to the impulſes of humanity, and the injunctions of religion. Hoary and hallowed apologiſts for avarice and oppreſſion! who conſtituted you judges of the virtue and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of others? who authorized your forcible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terference in their concerns? who made you arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their deſtiny? Had ye gone to them in ſimplicity and truth, with love in your hearts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence in your aſpects, full of kindneſs, and full of inſtruction; had you won them by an indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable and diſintereſted zeal in their behalf, ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by the parental tenderneſs of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and taught them to reverence you for the purity of your lives; had you charmed them to peace, and led them to the ample ſource of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, converting their country into a garden, and themſelves into ſocial and refined beings; then might ye have talked of humanity; then might ye have boaſted of the ſincerity of your devotion. But ye have been as tigers and as wolves. Ye have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the tents of Africa as hyaenas; and the whole land is devoted to carnage; is waſte and deſolate.</p>
            <p>It was madneſs that dictated the plea of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in favour of the oppreſſors of the Africans. The ſubtiler ſpirits of thoſe who had been leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſhelter their conduct under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of religion, ſuggeſted the more obvious and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034554_0015_0FFE270CA62361C8"/>
more complex juſtification of <hi>Policy.</hi> They cited the example of all former nations. Among them, whether governed by one, the few, or the many, ſlavery univerſally obtained. It ſecured the thrones of princes; it occaſionally might protect the ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy againſt encroachments; it delivered the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen from ſervile labour, free to the care of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the cultivation of ſcience, the purſuit of gain, and the extenſion of his country's power. In all, it foſtered and unyielding ſpirit againſt foreign ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; and it generated or increaſed the paſſion, while it provided the means, for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſchemes of aggrandizement and glory:—the legitimate and only aim of the monarch and the ſtateſman.—Wretched and feeble ſophiſtry! what, are we to be bound by the miſerable example of others, or ſhall we be permitted to take counſel with our reaſon? But, are they not coincident in warning us againſt the policy propoſed? Whether we regard the political or the ſocial condition of the States that have authorized ſlavery, whether we conſider its effects on their happineſs or their power, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is equally againſt it. The ſafety and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable felicity of a government depend abſolutely on the attachment of its ſubjects or citizens; and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment can only be founded on a ſenſe of the bleſſings it confers. Power can never be ſteadily maintained, nor effectually exerciſed, for a long period, but from the united exertions of a whole nation. This union muſt flow from mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, of the people and the government, of the citizens in each other. The only ſolid baſis of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034554_0016_0FFE2744AF3D4300"/>
confidence is morality. The ſame means which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate power, ſecure happineſs. Nations, indeed, may exiſt for a time; they may enjoy a temporary ſucceſs, while they diſregard the dictates of juſtice, and trample on the rights of half mankind: a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fire may ſuddenly burſt forth and proſtrate the neighbouring foreſts; a tornado may devaſtate a wide extent of harveſt; an unexpected ſwell of the ocean may lay waſte the labours and overwhelm the habitations of men: but, as in the natural, ſo in the political or moral world, all theſe violent agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are of ſhort duration. They even contain the elements of their own deſtruction, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for their own fury. The degree of power is diminiſhed with its extent, as its ſecurity is by its injuſtice; and as no nation has hitherto attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obtain univerſal dominion on equitable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſo none has hitherto been able to preſerve what little it has gained. Contemptible and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred is that policy which, whether it aim by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral or domeſtic ſubjection to ſecure preponderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence and authority, ſacrifices on the altars of avarice and ambition public virtue and private happineſs. The vultures of horror and remorſe hover over the aceldama of morality to which its ferocious triumphs convert the earth.</p>
            <p>If honeſty be indeed the beſt policy, then, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the tyrants of the Africans, if it be indeed the ſoundeſt policy that nations can purſue to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here with inflexible obſtinacy to the decrees of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, ſtill it is for <hi>individual intereſt,</hi> and thus for the <hi>national benefit,</hi> that ſlavery be permitted. We
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034554_0017_0FFE27124DD84FC0"/>
are the proprietors of a ſoil, the ſojourners in a cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, unfriendly to health, and hoſtile to induſtry. Our deſtiny has caſt us here, and we muſt live, and we are deſirous of enjoying life. By introducing ſlaves, we do but ſecure this by other means than are neceſſary in more fortunate regions. We bring them to climates like their own; to a cultivation for which they are fitted by nature; and we derive that wealth and that power from the labours of an ignorant race of men, which could not be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our own efforts, and which are juſtly due to us, from them, for our ſuperior knowledge, our intellectual pre-eminence.—Blind and fatal infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation! what is the intereſt of man? Sloth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, wealth, and capricious deſpotiſm? Or is it to labour for the happineſs of mankind, and to find our own in the creation of theirs? To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, to the extremeſt verge of life, a mind and body equal to every exigence, untainted by diſeaſe, unpolluted by vice, unembittered by remorſe?—Conſider it ſimply as relative to the acquiſition of wealth. The argument from the effects of ſoil and climate applies only to a part of the countries which permit domeſtic ſlavery. In theſe, numerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples demonſtrate the falſity of the aſſertions of its advocates. Freemen, and white men, can la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour there; the mortality among them is not greater than among ſlaves; and their toil is vaſtly more productive: they have an intereſt in what they do. Much of the difficulty now experienced, and much of the mortality, would be obviated by a change in the objects and mode of culture; and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034554_0018_0FFE274A7208C2F8"/>
the ſuperior productiveneſs of the ſoil, to that of more temperate regions, exacts a degree of toil ſurprizingly leſs to anſwer all the claims of nature and of luxury. But, were this not obviouſly true, thus might we addreſs the thoughtleſs tyrants of the Africans,—conſider the ſtrict connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween vice and miſery, and the certain, inevitable puniſhment which injuſtice draws upon itſelf. Look to the millions of unappropriated lands, ignorant of the plough, profuſe of wealth, and exempt from peſtilence. Haſte! look not behind you! fly the accurſed ſoil which, for your ſubſiſtence, requires to be nurſed with the tears of innocents, and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with the blood of men! Fly, while the vengeful ſword of retribution is yet ſuſpended! Haſte to the more fortunate climes beyond you; learn juſtice; reſtrain your luſtful paſſions; and find your true intereſt in temperance, and in virtue!</p>
            <p>The fate of the practice of oppreſſion has been ſimilar to that of every other vice: the more it has been inveſtigated, the leſs defenſible, the more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous has it appeared.

               </gap>ute the reaſonings by which the juſtice, the humanity, the policy of the ſlave-trade, and the ſubſerviency of ſlavery to national and individual intereſt, have been diſproved. Yet, ſo much are men the ſlaves of habit, ſo cloſely does ſelfiſhneſs cling to our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, ſo difficult is error of eradication, that, foiled in theſe topics of defence, the advocates of ſlavery
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034554_0019_0FFE2713D30260F8"/>
have reſorted to another.—We admit, ſay they, that ſlavery is unjuſt, abominable; an outrage on humanity; contrary to all ſound maxims of policy; and hoſtile to the intereſts of a people: but, then, what ſhall we do? Moſt ſincerely do we wiſh that this curſe had never viſited our country. But it is entailed upon us by our fathers; it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with every part of our ſocial organization; and we can not eraſe the blot, without deſtroying the fabric. <hi>All things are juſt, but all things are not expedient.</hi>—Alas! how multiform is error! how infinitely is it propagated! how does it appear in the very midſt of our ſincereſt labours! and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found our moſt faithful councils! It is by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twining itſelf with truth that it leads ſo many, even virtuous, minds aſtray; nor could the moſt ſubtle enemy of juſtice have deviſed an argument more likely to miſlead than this before us, which ſteals upon our feelings, while it affects to appeal only to our reaſon. In fact, the very motives urged here for the continuance of ſlavery, are thoſe which moſt forcibly demand its abolition. Has the ſlave-trade really devolved all theſe misfortunes upon the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which have permitted it,—put an end to it immediately. This may be done without materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affecting ſlavery. At leaſt, <hi>here</hi> it may be done. The United States do not, like the Weſt-Indies, require a prodigious annual importation to ſupply the waſte of barbarity and diſeaſe. Cruel as is their employment, ſtill they propagate in a proportion not much below their conſumption. But, if ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very be a curſe, let no time be loſt in attempting
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034554_0020_0FFE274BF5E201A0"/>
to remove it. If its ſudden removal be dangerous, let it be gradually accompliſhed; but let it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. What ſtrange reaſoning is that which would perſuade us to continue and increaſe a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, becauſe it has exiſtence at this moment!—O men, free to acknowledge your errors, but indolent to reform them, put, at length, the axe to the root of this tree of evil! If you fear left its ſudden fall bury you in its ruins, proceed with caution! Twig after twig, branch after branch, ſhall decay and fall; and your grateful poſterity ſhall, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, caſt down the bare and withered trunk.</p>
            <p>It was Agathocles, I think, who, when the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious arms of Carthage threatened Sicily with ſubjugation, ſuddenly withdrew from its defence, and led his ſoldiers into Africa, into the country of his enemies. The ſpirit of this meaſure has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been commended; but its ill-ſucceſs has taken off the glare of falſe courage by which it was ſurrounded, and proved how much more certainly it accelerated the defeat of its conductor.</p>
            <p>It certainly deſerves to be numbered among the ſingular contrivances of minds immerſed in error, that, in the courſe and progreſs of the contention between the ſupporters of ſlavery and the advocates of juſtice and humanity, the firſt, after ample ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of the weakneſs of their cauſe in the enumerated particulars, ſhould, at length, come to retort the charge of <hi>injuſtice</hi> on the laſt. The imbecility of this argument, if argument it may be called, is a favourable omen. It beſpeaks the near triumph of truth; the approaching deliverance
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:034554_0021_0FFE271555E3E990"/>
of the oppreſſed. It is the fate of error to loſe ſtrength and conſiſtency by every examination; that all its pleas ſhall regularly diminiſh in effect, as they regularly ſucceed to each other. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the ſlave-holder acknowledged the injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſlavery, that moment the ſlow, but certain, death-wound was inflicted upon it. The apologiſts for this pernicious ſyſtem of domeſtic oppreſſion, have now reached to the extremity of ſubterfuge. Their laſt argument can impoſe on no diſcerning mind; and henceforward they muſt maintain by force, what they can not ſupport by reaſon. But what is this charge of <hi>injuſtice</hi> which they exhibit ſo vehemently againſt the aſſertors of the rights of the innocent? We did not, ſay they, commence the ſyſtem of ſlavery. We found it already eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. The laws of our country authorized the poſſeſſion of a property in human fleſh. They have hitherto maintained us in it. Is it not unjuſt to deprive us of that which the ſocial regulations, you would now change, have conferred upon us? Will you, at once, deſpoil us of that which we have purchaſed on the faith of theſe regulations? Are you prepared, by a ſingle vote, and without any compenſation, to deſtroy ſo large a portion of all our wealth? Does not the law equally protect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, whether it exiſt in animate or inanimate ſubſtance? whether it be clothed with the beſtial or human form? Dare you commit ſo horrid an injuſtice?—Miſerable ſophiſters! were the law to authorize you to enslave your fellow-freemen of one State, or one County, ſhould you act juſtly in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:034554_0022_0FFE274D78421D68"/>
availing yourſelves of its ſanction? Were you born to the inheritance of an ample eſtate in money, the fruits of your fathers' repeated thefts, could you vindicate your conduct in withholding it from the rightful proprietors, by any law of deſcents? Shall the legiſlators of a great nation be denied the power, which pertains to every individual of that nation, of acknowledging their errors, and labouring to correct them? Shall the moſt evident and ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable intereſts of a whole community, not only its preſent, but its future intereſts, require the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance of a ſyſtem dangerous to our ſecurity, hoſtile to our property, and pernicious to our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and ſhall the ſhort-ſighted ſelfiſhneſs of a ſmall, or even a conſiderable part of that community, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine its permanence? But, what is this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation which you are denied? Is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant labour of a ſlave, for fifteen, or for ten, years, a ſufficient compenſation for the care of protecting his infancy? Would the tyrants demand triple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for their injuſtice? Recompence they ſhall have, and thrice threefold,—but let them tremble in the expectation!</p>
            <p>In the exiſting circumſtances of ſociety, encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered as we are with this mighty evil, which ſlavery has caſt upon us, we are only free to chuſe, amid variety of embarraſſments. There is no fear that even this factitious right of property, ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, will not be ſufficiently reſpected.

Wait they till the venders of peſtilence, till the manufacturers of plagues, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh their productive and deſolating craft, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they labour for the reſtoration of health, for the prevention of diſeaſe? What! will they foſter the fury, relax the fetters which partially confine her, and imp her with new wings, that ſhe may more vigorouſly purſue the work of devaſtation?—You, yes you, the Legiſlators of America, you are the real upholders of ſlavery! You, yes you, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators of this Commonwealth, you foſter and protect it here! Is it not recognized by your laws? and in the very face of your Conſtitution? of that inſtrument which you maintained by your arms, and ſealed with your blood?

As in other caſes, ſo has it fared in this. Incapable of vindicating themſelves, or of effectually miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the purity of our motives, the encouragers of ſlavery have fallen on the miſerable Africans; as though their vices and their follies conſtituted a reaſon for ſubjecting them to bondage, and bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with reiterated wrong. Shallow ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge! feeble malice! Every motive urged againſt them ought to intereſt us in their behalf.

Make them outcaſts and vagabonds, thruſt them into the ſociety of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and of thieves, ſhut from them the fair book and ſalutary light of knowledge, degrade them into brutes, and trample them in the duſt, and you muſt expect, them to be vile and wretched, diſſolute and lawleſs, baſe and ſtupid. Madmen! would you "gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles?"</p>
            <p>But, notwithſtanding the degraded condition of the Africans, and their deſcendants, among us,—a condition to which they have been reduced, or in which they have been retained, by thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them with it, and would offer it as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for their own inhumanity and injuſtice,—ſtill they exhibit many examples of humble, but of cheering virtue. We not only ſee them irreproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably employed in various mechanic occupations, but, in ſome few inſtances, elevated to the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offices of inſtructors in learning, and inculcators of morality. The deſk, and the pulpit, have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed their triumphs over all the efforts of blind

and malignant prejudice. Already they begin to feel their own worth as men; already are they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with ſome juſt ſenſe of the nature of thoſe exertions which are making in their behalf; already have they attained to ſome conception of that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and virtuous conduct which is the beſt reward for all our toils; already may they challenge the palm from many of their whiter brethren. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you not that ſpirit of improvement—flow thought it be, yet viſible—which diffuſes itſelf among them? Obſerve you not their growing knowledge, their increaſing induſtry, their ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manners, their correcter morals? Hear you not that ſigh, wakened by your benevolent ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy? Mark you not that tear of grateful joy, ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcending? See you not that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
