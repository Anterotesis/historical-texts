         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>ATELY reading the little Hiſtory of the <hi>Five Indian Nations,</hi> I met with a Paſſage in it, which I thought worth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Notice. It is this, <q>I ſuppoſe our Interpreters were not Poets enough to tranſlate the Songs, otherwiſe I might have gratified the Reader with a Taſte of Indian Poetry.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have enquired whether any ſuch Songs could be found, as I know that you are curious in ſuch Things; and theſe, which I now ſend to you, ſince came to Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maratho</hi> is named for the Originals, and <hi>Yariza,</hi> and that is all that I can tell you of them at preſent, but I ſhall make further Enquiry. This much I can tell you now, that ſome queſtion whether <hi>Yariza</hi> compos'd her Part, or only ſung it. The Diſpute is not very material; but if there be ſuch a Genius, as we are told, among the <hi>Indians,</hi> I know not why the gentler Sex, may not be ſuppoſed to partake of it, eſpecially, on Subjects ſuitable to their Gentleneſs.</p>
            <p>They ſeem to have been deſigned on Occaſion of promulging the laſt General Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007217_0004_102B3EEFA8A18CE0"/>
               <q>What Time is this for them? (ſays a Critic) Why did they not come ſooner?</q>
            </p>
            <p>And, (if it be civil to anſwer one Queſtion by aſking another, but what ſhall one do with captious Critic's) why were they not aſk'd for, or enquir'd after ſooner? Perhaps they are come full ſoon, for any Thing that will be thought of them.—Perhaps it is the Faſhion of Indian Writers, to keep their Compoſures by them for ſome Time, to correct and poliſh; and well it were for ſome others, and for their Readers, that they would do likewiſe. Better Pieces, than they are, have lain by many more Years, before they have made their Appearance.— <q>Ay,—but it looks ſuſpicious, that <hi>Yariza</hi> ſays nothing of Prince <hi>Frederick,</hi> who was living at that Time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There might be a Reaſon given for that,—her Thoughts were taken up;—ſhe was lamenting the Death of the Queen;—admiring the Princeſs,—now Princeſs Dowager:—And is it not natural for the Female Kind, much to ſet by thoſe of their own Sex, who are highly eminent?</p>
            <p>
               <q>Very well,—but to ſpeak of the young Prince, and not to mention his Father, a Prince ſo noble, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, beneficent, of ſuch Appearance and Hopes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Alas!—theſe Critics love to perplex Matters.—I ſhall leave them to obſerve to you, that theſe Songs or Odes, call them which you pleaſe, by their Air and Accent, appear of Indian Extraction They abound with that Phraſeology. The Tree, the Chain, the Houſe of Peace, the great <hi>Sachem</hi> for the <hi>King,</hi> the great Lake for the Ocean, <hi>Corlaer</hi> for the Governor of the Province, <hi>Manhaten</hi> for <hi>New-York,</hi> you very well know are Terms in Uſe with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Book of Peace,</hi> if they are not uſed ſo to call the Book there intended, I think it would be nothing amiſs to learn them to call it ſo; and I can not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that the Tranſlator, granting that he found not
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007217_0005_102B3EF131CA0C48"/>that Expreſſion in the Original, but added it, is to be blamed for ſuch an Addition.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe that the Writer of theſe Odes only took Hints from the Indian, and that they are far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cloſe Tranſlation; yet, ought we not to eſteem the Indian Genius, which could give ſuch Hints to him?</p>
            <p>The Author of the little Hiſtory of theſe Nations, ſays of them, to his Excellency Governor <hi>Burnet,</hi> to whom he dedicates it; that tho' they were under the darkeſt Ignorance, yet, <q>a bright and noble Genius ſhines thro' theſe black Clouds.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He goes on to ſay, that, <q>none of the greateſt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Heroes have diſcovered a greater Love to their Country, or a greater Contempt of Death, than theſe Barbarians have done, when Life and Liberty came in Competition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In another Place he ſays, that, <q>if Care was taken to plant in them, and cultivate that general Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to Mankind, which is the true Principle of Virtue,—they would no longe: deſerve the Name of Barbarians, but would become a People whoſe Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip might add Honour to the Britiſh Nation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What Pity is it, that ſuch a Genius ſhould be ſunk or depraved, which, if it was reliev'd and rightly cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, might ſhine out to them, and to us, with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and with Honour.</p>
            <p>Would not ſuch cultivating of it, tend to the Good of the Publick, not only of this Province and thoſe Nations, but promote the <hi>Britiſh,</hi>—the Chriſtian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt?</p>
            <p>To this might be conducive, if ſome Perſon capable of furthering ſuch an Intention, were encouraged to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for ſome Time in thoſe Parts, to attain the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, if he has it not already, and under proper Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to inſtitute Schools, or, at leaſt, in the mean Time, one good School for Education, and to enquire for the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007217_0006_102B3EF2BAA6FBF0"/>fitteſt Perſons to recommend to the Care and Charge of it.</p>
            <p>If there is already a School there; for I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be well acquainted with the preſent Diſpoſition of Affairs in thoſe Parts, there might be another ſet up at a convenient Diſtance; and it may not be amiſs, to ſet one or two good Miſtreſſes over a ſeparate School of Girls. Much would depend on the Improving and Refining that Sex, to reclaim and civilize the other.</p>
            <p>In theſe Schools, ſome of the moſt Ingenious and Docile of the young Indians might be inſtructed in our Faith and Morals, and Language, and in our Methods of Life and Induſtry, and in ſome of thoſe Arts which are moſt uſeful.</p>
            <p>Theſe, that is, ſome of the beſt diſpoſed and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of them, might in Time be ſet over other Schools, for it may be thought not unfitting, that there were one, at leaſt, for every Nation, or rather for each of the Tribes, which are reckon'd three in every Nation.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, the Youths ſo forming, might be profitable, each in the Family which he belongs to, where he might be look'd upon as a young Inſtructor, and frequently be ſo,</p>
            <p>This, likewiſe, might help to prevent Teachers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent among them by another Nation, which has been done formerly, and has been found prejudicial.</p>
            <p>Our Hiſtorian, Mr. <hi>Colden,</hi> tells us, pag. 69. <q>We may ſtill obſerve the Influence, which the <hi>French Prieſts</hi> had obtained over the other Nations, and to what Chriſtian-like Purpoſes they uſed it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe other Nations, page 70, are the <hi>Onandagas, Cayugas,</hi> and <hi>Oneydoes,</hi> three of the Five; and the Purpoſes were ſpiriting them up againſt other Indians, Friends of <hi>Virginia,</hi> whom they made War on, and kill'd ſome of the People of <hi>Virginia</hi> who aſſiſted thoſe Indians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:007217_0007_102B3EF529F3DA58"/>
And p. 71. By the Influence of one of them, nam'd <hi>Milet,</hi> a Jeſuit, on the <hi>Oneydoes,</hi> they were frequently turn'd againſt the Southern Indians, Friends of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Southern Colonies.</p>
            <p>Theſe Quotations, I hope, will not ſeem tedious to you. This Obſervation may ariſe from them, that ſince there have been, and ſtill are Men ſo induſtrious, for ſecular Ends (at leaſt, ſuch their Deſigns appear to us) as to compaſs Sea and Land, to make Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes; it will be becoming in us to attempt more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Methods for enlightning the Underſtanding, and reforming the Way of Living of thoſe People, to which we are urg'd by a Variety of the beſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
            <p>To civilize our Friends and Neighbours; — to ſtrengthen our Allies and our Alliance;— to adorn and dignify Human Nature;—to ſave Souls from Death; to promote the Chriſtian Faith, and the Divine Glory, are the Motives.</p>
            <p>There is yet another which may incline our Hearts to theſe People, and that is, the great Love which they expreſs to Peace. Is there a Nation under Heaven, which ſpeaks of it in more complacent and pathetic Terms?</p>
            <p>No Wonder, if their young Men of Genius, their Bards or Druids, like <hi>Maratho;</hi> their young Maids of fine natural Qualities, like <hi>Yariza;</hi> No Wonder, if they ſhould frame Songs of Peace, when the old Men, the <hi>Sachems,</hi> ſpeak of it with ſuch Paſſion and Rapture, that their Speech ſeems a poetical Language; a Kind of divine Enthuſiaſm.—</p>
            <p>What do you think, Sir, would it not be worth a Philoſopher's While to come from <hi>Europe,</hi> to ſee theſe Nations of Peace-Lovers, and to converſe with them, and if he could purchaſe ſome Slips or Suckers of their Tree of Peace? Would it not be well done to take them back with him, and recommend them to the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007217_0008_102B3EF6B3FB5F80"/>
               <hi>European Regions?</hi> The Princes there uſe to be fond of foreign Rarities.— What if the precious Tree was propagated in the Gardens at <hi>Kenſington?</hi> What if in thoſe at <hi>Vienna, Marli,</hi> the <hi>Arranjuez,</hi>—<hi>Potſdam?</hi>—</p>
            <p>Not that thoſe Imperial and Royal Gardens, are ſuppoſed now to want Trees or Plants of ſuch Kind,—happy, if they take Root and flouriſh,—if they be duly cultivated;— if the great Owners water them with their own Hands: Nor is that beneath their Dignity, if they look on them as their Garden's chief Ornaments, and Delight to meditate the Good of Mankind, under their Shadows: — But, ſtill, ſuch Slips from hence might be favourably received as an exotic Curioſity.</p>
            <p>I return to the <hi>Five Nations.</hi> That you may not think that I magnify their Love of Peace: Read their own Words, ſpeaking of the Tree of Peace, in one of their Orations, in the 3d Chap. of the Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We now plant a Tree, whoſe Top will reach the Sun, and its Branches ſpread far abroad, ſo that it ſhall be ſeen afar off, and we ſhall ſhelter over ſelves under it, and live in Peace without Moleſtation.</q>—p. 67. <q>The Tree of Peace is planted ſo firmly that it can not be moved.</q> p. 89. they ſay, <q>That they ſhall Dance to the Calumet of Peace, under its Leaves, and ſhall remain quiet.</q>

            <p>In like Language, they ſpeak of the Chain, which ſeems to ſignify with them, a League of Peace or Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>Page 60. <q>We gladly catch at, and lay hold of the Chain, which we deſire may be kept clean and bright like Silver.</q> p. 67. <q>Now we have a new Chain, a ſtrong and a ſtraight Chain that cannot be broken,—Let us on both Sides hold the Chain faſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not a Pity that People, who ſeem ſo much to love Peace, ſhould not be further'd in the beſt Methods of preſerving it inwardly in their Minds, as well as in their
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007217_0009_102B3EF8C5DD5F90"/>outward Condition? I doubt not, but that the worthy Man, who was there formerly, did his Endeavour, and that he who is now there does the ſame; but what is one Man to ſuch Multitudes?</p>
            <p>Should they not be more extenſively acquainted with the Doctrine and Precepts of the Prince of Peace, by the Knowledge and Obſervance of which, they would be led into thoſe ſerene Regions, where their beloved Tree flouriſhes with a ſweet Odour for ever?</p>
            <p>Should not Schools and Oratories be ſet up in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Parts of the <hi>Indian Nations,</hi> or, at leaſt, as has been ſaid before, one or two principal Ones, from whence others might derive, as from ſome beneficent Springs-Head flows a Stream, which becomes a great River to refreſh an extenſive Country, and make glad the Hearts of a populous Nation?</p>
            <p>Where are the Men, who deſire, like the Heroes and Law-givers of Antiquity, to reſcue Nations from Barbarity; like the choſen Miſſionaries, to propagate the Divine Light, which came to enlighten the World: Is it not becoming them to appear in ſuch an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking?</p>
            <p>However uſeful one, or another might be in the immediate Parts: Do you not think, <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> that ſuch an Intention would require the chief Men of the Province, for Preſidents and Conductors of it? Should not the leading Men of the Neighbouring Colonies, deſire to aſſociate in it; the rather as the Welfare and Security of thoſe Colonies as well as of this, ſeem to have ſome Connexion with a right Inſtitution of theſe Indians?</p>
            <p>It is not improbable that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Society, on proper Application, would further encourage it. Nor is it to be doubted, but that ſome in high Stations in <hi>Britain,</hi> would promote it.</p>
            <p>The Court, the Nobles, and Gentlemen there, many of whom are of the fineſt Taſte and Expreſſion, in the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007217_0010_102B3EFAB76770F0"/>various Kinds of Eloquence, might, in Conſequence of this, in a little Time, expect from hence, finer Indian Odes, than what are now preſented to them.</p>
            <p>But if they think little of the Songs of <hi>India,</hi> (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe Tranſeripts, at leaſt, are not much to be thought of, whatever Originals may be) yet, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming them to advance the Cauſe of Chriſtianity; and it is not unworthy of their Care, to promote, by all proper Means, the Maintaining the Ballance of Power in <hi>America,</hi> as well as in other Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>An Objection has been raiſed by ſome Gentlemen, not againſt the Expediency of this Work, but becauſe of the Difficulty of it.</p>
            <p>They repreſent the <hi>Indians,</hi> as an untractable People, very tenacious of their own Manners and Faſhions.</p>
            <p>If ſuch an Attempt and Performance were very eaſy, there would be the leſs Honour in accompliſhing it. But neither can I imagine it ſo very difficult. Very wild and ſavage Nations have been reformed; therefore, the Indians, who are nothing ſo Savage, may be reformed. One or two Men, have ſometimes done a great deal towards civilizing the Manners of a People. What may not be done by the eminent Men of a large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, in Conjuction? Perhaps to be aſſiſted by ſome of their beſt Neighbours, and ſupported by a high En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.</p>
            <p>How much have ſome wild People, ſuch formerly, improved in other Countries within this Century, and ſome in half that Time. What need to ſpeak of other Nations and of ancient Ages? Mr. <hi>Colden,</hi> whoſe Book I open again, ſeems to think the <hi>Indians</hi> like other People. <q>I am fond to think, ſays he, that the preſent State of the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations, exactly ſhews the moſt ancient and original Condition of almoſt every Nation.</q> If the Original be the ſame, why may there not be a like Progreſs, eſpecially in a People,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007217_0011_102B3EFD036B2710"/>who ſeem to have an innate Diſpoſition to Science, and who breathe untaught Eloquence?</p>
            <p>Then,— that Love of Liberty and Honour;— that <hi>Roman,</hi>— that <hi>Britiſh</hi> Spirit:— They ſeem naturally akin to us,— beſide our Alliance,— let us help our Brethren. If the rough Gem throws out ſome Sparks of Light, how will it ſhine when poliſh'd! If the Tree appears fair in the Verdure of its Leaves, will not the Bloſſoms and Fruits make it look more lovely!</p>
            <p>Speaking of Trees, minds me of two Lines in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> which ſeems applicable to this Subject.</p>
            <p>Exuarint Sylveſtrem animum, Cultuque frequenti, In quaſeunque voces Artes, hand tarda ſequentur.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſavage Mind, by Culture when ſubdu'd, Will with the nobler Arts be ſoon imbu'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is no Occaſion for <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Skill in grafting to prolong this Diſcourſe. — Perhaps it is too tedious, I would not multiply Words.</p>
            <p>My reading Mr. <hi>Colden,</hi> and tranſcribing the Indian Songs, rais'd theſe Thoughts in me. I imagin'd, that communicating them might be of Service. It is rot for me to proceed any further: If what is written ſeems for the Good of the Publick; the Ways and Means; the proper Method,—that lies before others.</p>
            <p>It may be, at the next Aſſembly, if it ſhall ſeem good to them; a Committee will be appointed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the State of the <hi>Indian Nations,</hi> and into the beſt Methods for preſerving, and ſtrengthening, and improving our Alliance with them.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, ſome will ſay, ſuch Cares ſhould begin at Home; that it becomes them chiefly to provide for the Education of their own Youth; and that they are to conſider of erecting and endowing a ſtately Edifice ſuitable to that Purpoſe.—It is very well,—wherefore ſhould they not?— But it is noble to have extenſive Views; That they may do; and yet not leave the other unders. They may look to the Welfare of their
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007217_0012_102B3EFF44DC4B10"/>Families, and to the Honour and Advantage of the Province.— Wherefore ſhould they not?— For this they have Dwellings in theſe Lands, and Seats in that Council.</p>
            <p>But, at the ſame Time, they may comprehend, and deliberate on the promoting, more largely the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt, and the Cauſe of Humanity, of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>This would give a peculiar Luſtre to their Aſſembly. This would be to riſe Forts and Bulwarks on their Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. This would be to make their Province and City, a Name and a Praiſe on the Earth.— This would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, more fully, to entitle them to the dear Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Fathers and Patriots.</p>

            <p>YARIZA's Letter, which came lately to Hand, it is hoped, will not be diſagreeable to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Ladies to whom it is directed.</p>
            <p>To judge of it by the Stile and Sentiments, it ſeems no leſs genuine than the other Pieces. It may be reckon'd more rare. We have had before now Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the Oratory of the Male <hi>Indians,</hi> but this, perhaps, is the firſt of the Female.</p>
            <p>Some may imagine the Whole to be from <hi>Maratho:</hi> But why ſhould we doubt ſome of the <hi>Indian</hi> Women having ſome Genius for Poetry and Oratory, when we know there are of the Sex, eminent in thoſe Arts, in other Countries.</p>
            <p>One would think that there is a peculiar Delicacy and Tenderneſs, ſuitable to the Sex, which diſtinguiſhes what is aſcrib'd to <hi>Yariza.</hi> Her Song appears to have a more pathetic Simplicity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maratho</hi> ſpeaks briefly of the Tree of Peace, and then of the Chain of Concord, and of the Grave or Pit of War; nay, he bluſters a little of the Ax riſing again, as if War was not yet quite out of his Head. <hi>Yariza</hi> is all Gentleneſs, and ſeems loth to remove her Contemplations from the delightful Tree.</p>
            <p>At the very firſt, there appears a Concern for it, leſt being of heavenly Origin, it ſhould not grow kindly here on Earth, leſt the Drought, or Froſt, or Storms ſhould injure it. The Leaves, the Bloſſoms and Fruits, are all mentioned in ſuch a Manner, as ſhew her Fondneſs for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:007217_0024_102B3F19CA8BF768"/>
The Birds of ſweeteſt Voice, and the gentleſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures embelliſh it. Wheels and Looms are its Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>But here ariſes a Difficulty: It ſeems doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe can be warranted in her Deſign to go to Court, and in her ſpeaking of the great Perſonages.</p>
            <p>Is this Propriety of Sentiment? It is very ſure, ſhe might have heard of the Queen, and Princeſs, and of the young Prince, and how dear they were to <hi>Britons:</hi> But did it become her to attempt their Eulogies? The whole Affair is ſubmitted to the Ladies and to the Critics, only, let them remember in her Favour, that ſhe did not intend to go to Court without a fine Web along with her.</p>
            <p>Altho' the Solemnity of the Occaſion might lead her ſhe appears there but as by Accident. She do's not depend on any Songs compoſed by her or <hi>Maratho,</hi> to introduce her, but on good Huſwif'ry.</p>
            <p>She makes but a ſhort Viſit to lament the abſent Brightneſs, and to take Comfort from that which is preſent.</p>
            <p>She ſoon returns to the fair Tree, which ſeems dearer to her than the Grandeur of a Court, than the Pomp of Majeſty.</p>
            <p>She had look'd undazzled on royal Splendor, and on an illuſtrious Progeny. But here ſhe is in Raptures She invokes the Earth, the Air, and Heaven.— She appears no longer as an <hi>Indian</hi> Maid, the untaught <hi>Yariza,</hi> but as a <hi>Sybil,</hi> or rather a Propheteſs in a divine Tranſport, while ſhe extends her Hands, and looking up, bleſſes the King and Nations.</p>
            <p>Has ſhe not communicated her Rapture? Is not this Comment ſmit with her Enthuſiaſm? — Be it ſo,— perhaps ſuch Enthuſiaſm is not blameable.</p>
            <p>However, would it not be well done by thoſe, to whom her Letter is addreſs'd, yet to encourage her to go to Court; or after ſome Time, direct thither
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007217_0025_102B3F1C2E4B2E58"/>others of the <hi>Indian</hi> Maids, who ſhall become moſt accompliſh'd, with ſome of their ſine Induſtry.</p>
            <p>Such a Preſent, it may be well imagined, would not be unacceptable to the chief Ladies of the Court of <hi>Britain.</hi>

            <p>And ſuch a Motive, beſide many others, and the Benefit thence to ariſe to themſelves might influence thoſe of the Fair Sex here, who have it moſt in their Power, to promote the Inſtruction and Improvement of the Female <hi>Indians.</hi> As for the Men, it is hoped that they will take Care of the Male Sex; and ſhould the gentler Kind, who are allow'd to have a greater Share of Tenderneſs be outdone on ſo fair an Occaſion for their Emulation: —But, perhaps, <hi>Yariza</hi> is too long detained from her Addreſs to them.</p>

            <p>PARDON <hi>Yariza,</hi> while preſuming thus to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to you; ſhe ſpeaks not only for herſelf, but for many Thouſands of young <hi>Indian</hi> Maids in theſe Parts, who deſire to offer their Services to you, and to congratulate you on the Planting of the Tree of Peace.</p>
            <p>May you walk delightfully under its Shade, for, moſt ſurely, <hi>Corlaer</hi> has ſet up one there, as our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chems</hi> have done here.</p>

May it ſpread its Branches over all your Abodes, and over the whole Country, and no wild Beaft of War come out of the Foreſt to root it up. May the Iſland of <hi>Manhatan,</hi> and the neighbouring Iſles, and the large Land, all become as one Garden of Peace and Pleaſure; and may your Children grow up like fair Plants that are cheriſh'd by the benign Heat of the bright Luminary, and nurs'd by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing Dew of Heaven. May each of you have in your Habitations, a fair Shrub, or little Tree, as a Family Tree of Peace, to bleſs your Dwellings. May the Exhalations from it, be as the ſweet Odour of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, or as the Leaves of the ſweeteſt Trees in the Foreſt, to gladden your Apartments. Let no rude Sounds of Diſcord or Diſquiet, be as a blighting Wind to wither the Leaves thereof. No Diſtreſs nor Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, like a thick Fog, caſt an unkindly Mildew to taint them, but the Man's Eyes, like the Sun-Beams, chear its Roots, and the Woman's Voice, as a gentle Breeze, fan and regale the Branches. Let her draw deep into her Breaſt the Balſam of its Effluence, and her Lips breathe forth and improve the Fragrance.</p>
            <p>How gladly would the <hi>Indian</hi> Maids attend on you in your (high Wigwams) great Houſes, to learn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of your Gracefulneſs and Goodneſs, to watch the Bidding of your fine Eyes, and wait on the Beckoning of your fair Hands! — But we are not worthy, till bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter faſhion'd, Send us, therefore, we pray ye, ſome good Women, who may teach us thoſe Sounds, wherein you utter your Commands and Meaning, that we may perfectly underſtand, and be the more ſit to attend to them, and who may learn us ſome-what of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the fine Needles, wherein yourſelves are ſo excellent; and who may direct us in thoſe Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for the Looms, wherein your Maid-Servants are inſtructed.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:007217_0027_102B3F1F6441FB80"/>The <hi>Indian</hi> Virgins, O Ladies, caſt themſelves at your Feet, humbly deſiring your Protection and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage. Think to what it is that you are call'd upon: To be as pure Living-Springs, that water a dry ſandy Defart; as a bright Light to illuminate dark Regions; as a divine Voice ſounding in the Foreſt, to raiſe the ſweeteſt Confort. You are called upon to be the Praiſe of ſuture Ages, as well as of the preſent; to have the Bleſſings of Nations on you and the Bleſſings of Heaven.</p>
            <p>May you long adorn the Tree of Peace,— and may we, alſo, by your Means, be aſſiſted in thoſe Works and Knowledge, which will yield the fineſt Garlands to bind to its Branches.</p>
            <p>Live happy, O amiable Ladies, and look favourably on the Daughters of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> in behalf of whom, this Gratulation of the Planting of the fair Tree, this Offer of their Service; this Requeſt for their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement; their good Wiſhes for your Welfare, are offer'd with Reſpect to you, and Admiration of you, by</p>
