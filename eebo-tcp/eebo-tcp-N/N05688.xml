            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>ATELY reading the little Hi≈øtory of the <hi>Five Indian Nations,</hi> I met with a Pa≈ø≈øage in it, which I thought worth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Notice. It is this, <q>I ≈øuppo≈øe our Interpreters were not Poets enough to tran≈ølate the Songs, otherwi≈øe I might have gratified the Reader with a Ta≈øte of Indian Poetry.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have enquired whether any ≈øuch Songs could be found, as I know that you are curious in ≈øuch Things; and the≈øe, which I now ≈øend to you, ≈øince came to Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maratho</hi> is named for the Originals, and <hi>Yariza,</hi> and that is all that I can tell you of them at pre≈øent, but I ≈øhall make further Enquiry. This much I can tell you now, that ≈øome que≈øtion whether <hi>Yariza</hi> compos'd her Part, or only ≈øung it. The Di≈øpute is not very material; but if there be ≈øuch a Genius, as we are told, among the <hi>Indians,</hi> I know not why the gentler Sex, may not be ≈øuppo≈øed to partake of it, e≈øpecially, on Subjects ≈øuitable to their Gentlene≈øs.</p>
            <p>They ≈øeem to have been de≈øigned on Occa≈øion of promulging the la≈øt General Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007217_0004_102B3EEFA8A18CE0"/>
               <q>What Time is this for them? (≈øays a Critic) Why did they not come ≈øooner?</q>
            </p>
            <p>And, (if it be civil to an≈øwer one Que≈øtion by a≈øking another, but what ≈øhall one do with captious Critic's) why were they not a≈øk'd for, or enquir'd after ≈øooner? Perhaps they are come full ≈øoon, for any Thing that will be thought of them.‚ÄîPerhaps it is the Fa≈øhion of Indian Writers, to keep their Compo≈øures by them for ≈øome Time, to correct and poli≈øh; and well it were for ≈øome others, and for their Readers, that they would do likewi≈øe. Better Pieces, than they are, have lain by many more Years, before they have made their Appearance.‚Äî <q>Ay,‚Äîbut it looks ≈øu≈øpicious, that <hi>Yariza</hi> ≈øays nothing of Prince <hi>Frederick,</hi> who was living at that Time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There might be a Rea≈øon given for that,‚Äîher Thoughts were taken up;‚Äî≈øhe was lamenting the Death of the Queen;‚Äîadmiring the Prince≈øs,‚Äînow Prince≈øs Dowager:‚ÄîAnd is it not natural for the Female Kind, much to ≈øet by tho≈øe of their own Sex, who are highly eminent?</p>
            <p>
               <q>Very well,‚Äîbut to ≈øpeak of the young Prince, and not to mention his Father, a Prince ≈øo noble, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, beneficent, of ≈øuch Appearance and Hopes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Alas!‚Äîthe≈øe Critics love to perplex Matters.‚ÄîI ≈øhall leave them to ob≈øerve to you, that the≈øe Songs or Odes, call them which you plea≈øe, by their Air and Accent, appear of Indian Extraction They abound with that Phra≈øeology. The Tree, the Chain, the Hou≈øe of Peace, the great <hi>Sachem</hi> for the <hi>King,</hi> the great Lake for the Ocean, <hi>Corlaer</hi> for the Governor of the Province, <hi>Manhaten</hi> for <hi>New-York,</hi> you very well know are Terms in U≈øe with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Book of Peace,</hi> if they are not u≈øed ≈øo to call the Book there intended, I think it would be nothing ami≈øs to learn them to call it ≈øo; and I can not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that the Tran≈ølator, granting that he found not
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007217_0005_102B3EF131CA0C48"/>that Expre≈ø≈øion in the Original, but added it, is to be blamed for ≈øuch an Addition.</p>
            <p>But ≈øuppo≈øe that the Writer of the≈øe Odes only took Hints from the Indian, and that they are far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a clo≈øe Tran≈ølation; yet, ought we not to e≈øteem the Indian Genius, which could give ≈øuch Hints to him?</p>
            <p>The Author of the little Hi≈øtory of the≈øe Nations, ≈øays of them, to his Excellency Governor <hi>Burnet,</hi> to whom he dedicates it; that tho' they were under the darke≈øt Ignorance, yet, <q>a bright and noble Genius ≈øhines thro' the≈øe black Clouds.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He goes on to ≈øay, that, <q>none of the greate≈øt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Heroes have di≈øcovered a greater Love to their Country, or a greater Contempt of Death, than the≈øe Barbarians have done, when Life and Liberty came in Competition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In another Place he ≈øays, that, <q>if Care was taken to plant in them, and cultivate that general Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to Mankind, which is the true Principle of Virtue,‚Äîthey would no longe: de≈øerve the Name of Barbarians, but would become a People who≈øe Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip might add Honour to the Briti≈øh Nation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What Pity is it, that ≈øuch a Genius ≈øhould be ≈øunk or depraved, which, if it was reliev'd and rightly cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, might ≈øhine out to them, and to us, with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and with Honour.</p>
            <p>Would not ≈øuch cultivating of it, tend to the Good of the Publick, not only of this Province and tho≈øe Nations, but promote the <hi>Briti≈øh,</hi>‚Äîthe Chri≈øtian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt?</p>
            <p>To this might be conducive, if ≈øome Per≈øon capable of furthering ≈øuch an Intention, were encouraged to ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for ≈øome Time in tho≈øe Parts, to attain the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, if he has it not already, and under proper Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to in≈øtitute Schools, or, at lea≈øt, in the mean Time, one good School for Education, and to enquire for the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007217_0006_102B3EF2BAA6FBF0"/>fitte≈øt Per≈øons to recommend to the Care and Charge of it.</p>
            <p>If there is already a School there; for I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be well acquainted with the pre≈øent Di≈øpo≈øition of Affairs in tho≈øe Parts, there might be another ≈øet up at a convenient Di≈øtance; and it may not be ami≈øs, to ≈øet one or two good Mi≈øtre≈ø≈øes over a ≈øeparate School of Girls. Much would depend on the Improving and Refining that Sex, to reclaim and civilize the other.</p>
            <p>In the≈øe Schools, ≈øome of the mo≈øt Ingenious and Docile of the young Indians might be in≈øtructed in our Faith and Morals, and Language, and in our Methods of Life and Indu≈øtry, and in ≈øome of tho≈øe Arts which are mo≈øt u≈øeful.</p>
            <p>The≈øe, that is, ≈øome of the be≈øt di≈øpo≈øed and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of them, might in Time be ≈øet over other Schools, for it may be thought not unfitting, that there were one, at lea≈øt, for every Nation, or rather for each of the Tribes, which are reckon'd three in every Nation.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, the Youths ≈øo forming, might be profitable, each in the Family which he belongs to, where he might be look'd upon as a young In≈øtructor, and frequently be ≈øo,</p>
            <p>This, likewi≈øe, might help to prevent Teachers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øent among them by another Nation, which has been done formerly, and has been found prejudicial.</p>
            <p>Our Hi≈øtorian, Mr. <hi>Colden,</hi> tells us, pag. 69. <q>We may ≈øtill ob≈øerve the Influence, which the <hi>French Prie≈øts</hi> had obtained over the other Nations, and to what Chri≈øtian-like Purpo≈øes they u≈øed it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Tho≈øe other Nations, page 70, are the <hi>Onandagas, Cayugas,</hi> and <hi>Oneydoes,</hi> three of the Five; and the Purpo≈øes were ≈øpiriting them up again≈øt other Indians, Friends of <hi>Virginia,</hi> whom they made War on, and kill'd ≈øome of the People of <hi>Virginia</hi> who a≈ø≈øi≈øted tho≈øe Indians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:007217_0007_102B3EF529F3DA58"/>
And p. 71. By the Influence of one of them, nam'd <hi>Milet,</hi> a Je≈øuit, on the <hi>Oneydoes,</hi> they were frequently turn'd again≈øt the Southern Indians, Friends of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Southern Colonies.</p>
            <p>The≈øe Quotations, I hope, will not ≈øeem tedious to you. This Ob≈øervation may ari≈øe from them, that ≈øince there have been, and ≈øtill are Men ≈øo indu≈øtrious, for ≈øecular Ends (at lea≈øt, ≈øuch their De≈øigns appear to us) as to compa≈øs Sea and Land, to make Pro≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes; it will be becoming in us to attempt more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten≈øive Methods for enlightning the Under≈øtanding, and reforming the Way of Living of tho≈øe People, to which we are urg'd by a Variety of the be≈øt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
            <p>To civilize our Friends and Neighbours; ‚Äî to ≈øtrengthen our Allies and our Alliance;‚Äî to adorn and dignify Human Nature;‚Äîto ≈øave Souls from Death; to promote the Chri≈øtian Faith, and the Divine Glory, are the Motives.</p>
            <p>There is yet another which may incline our Hearts to the≈øe People, and that is, the great Love which they expre≈øs to Peace. Is there a Nation under Heaven, which ≈øpeaks of it in more complacent and pathetic Terms?</p>
            <p>No Wonder, if their young Men of Genius, their Bards or Druids, like <hi>Maratho;</hi> their young Maids of fine natural Qualities, like <hi>Yariza;</hi> No Wonder, if they ≈øhould frame Songs of Peace, when the old Men, the <hi>Sachems,</hi> ≈øpeak of it with ≈øuch Pa≈ø≈øion and Rapture, that their Speech ≈øeems a poetical Language; a Kind of divine Enthu≈øia≈øm.‚Äî</p>
            <p>What do you think, Sir, would it not be worth a Philo≈øopher's While to come from <hi>Europe,</hi> to ≈øee the≈øe Nations of Peace-Lovers, and to conver≈øe with them, and if he could purcha≈øe ≈øome Slips or Suckers of their Tree of Peace?

            <p>Not that tho≈øe Imperial and Royal Gardens, are ≈øuppo≈øed now to want Trees or Plants of ≈øuch Kind,‚Äîhappy, if they take Root and flouri≈øh,‚Äîif they be duly cultivated;‚Äî if the great Owners water them with their own Hands: Nor is that beneath their Dignity, if they look on them as their Garden's chief Ornaments, and Delight to meditate the Good of Mankind, under their Shadows: ‚Äî But, ≈øtill, ≈øuch Slips from hence might be favourably received as an exotic Curio≈øity.</p>
            <p>I return to the <hi>Five Nations.</hi> That you may not think that I magnify their Love of Peace: Read their own Words, ≈øpeaking of the Tree of Peace, in one of their Orations, in the 3d Chap. of the Hi≈øtory.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We now plant a Tree, who≈øe Top will reach the Sun, and its Branches ≈øpread far abroad, ≈øo that it ≈øhall be ≈øeen afar off, and we ≈øhall ≈øhelter over ≈øelves under it, and live in Peace without Mole≈øtation.</q>‚Äîp. 67. <q>The Tree of Peace is planted ≈øo firmly that it can not be moved.</q> p. 89. they ≈øay, <q>That they ≈øhall Dance to the Calumet of Peace, under its Leaves, and ≈øhall remain quiet.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In like Language, they ≈øpeak of the Chain, which ≈øeems to ≈øignify with them, a League of Peace or Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>Page 60. <q>We gladly catch at, and lay hold of the Chain, which we de≈øire may be kept clean and bright like Silver.</q> p. 67. <q>Now we have a new Chain, a ≈øtrong and a ≈øtraight Chain that cannot be broken,‚ÄîLet us on both Sides hold the Chain fa≈øt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not a Pity that People, who ≈øeem ≈øo much to love Peace, ≈øhould not be further'd in the be≈øt Methods of pre≈øerving it inwardly in their Minds, as well as in their
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007217_0009_102B3EF8C5DD5F90"/>outward Condition? I doubt not, but that the worthy Man, who was there formerly, did his Endeavour, and that he who is now there does the ≈øame; but what is one Man to ≈øuch Multitudes?</p>
            <p>Should they not be more exten≈øively acquainted with the Doctrine and Precepts of the Prince of Peace, by the Knowledge and Ob≈øervance of which, they would be led into tho≈øe ≈øerene Regions, where their beloved Tree flouri≈øhes with a ≈øweet Odour for ever?</p>
            <p>Should not Schools and Oratories be ≈øet up in ≈øun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Parts of the <hi>Indian Nations,</hi> or, at lea≈øt, as has been ≈øaid before, one or two principal Ones, from whence others might derive, as from ≈øome beneficent Springs-Head flows a Stream, which becomes a great River to refre≈øh an exten≈øive Country, and make glad the Hearts of a populous Nation?</p>
            <p>Where are the Men, who de≈øire, like the Heroes and Law-givers of Antiquity, to re≈øcue Nations from Barbarity; like the cho≈øen Mi≈ø≈øionaries, to propagate the Divine Light, which came to enlighten the World: Is it not becoming them to appear in ≈øuch an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking?</p>
            <p>However u≈øeful one, or another might be in the immediate Parts: Do you not think, <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> that ≈øuch an Intention would require the chief Men of the Province, for Pre≈øidents and Conductors of it? Should not the leading Men of the Neighbouring Colonies, de≈øire to a≈ø≈øociate in it; the rather as the Welfare and Security of tho≈øe Colonies as well as of this, ≈øeem to have ≈øome Connexion with a right In≈øtitution of the≈øe Indians?</p>
            <p>It is not improbable that the <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> Society, on proper Application, would further encourage it. Nor is it to be doubted, but that ≈øome in high Stations in <hi>Britain,</hi> would promote it.</p>
            <p>The Court, the Nobles, and Gentlemen there, many of whom are of the fine≈øt Ta≈øte and Expre≈ø≈øion, in the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007217_0010_102B3EFAB76770F0"/>various Kinds of Eloquence, might, in Con≈øequence of this, in a little Time, expect from hence, finer Indian Odes, than what are now pre≈øented to them.</p>
            <p>But if they think little of the Songs of <hi>India,</hi> (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the≈øe Tran≈øeripts, at lea≈øt, are not much to be thought of, whatever Originals may be) yet, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming them to advance the Cau≈øe of Chri≈øtianity; and it is not unworthy of their Care, to promote, by all proper Means, the Maintaining the Ballance of Power in <hi>America,</hi> as well as in other Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>An Objection has been rai≈øed by ≈øome Gentlemen, not again≈øt the Expediency of this Work, but becau≈øe of the Difficulty of it.</p>
            <p>They repre≈øent the <hi>Indians,</hi> as an untractable People, very tenacious of their own Manners and Fa≈øhions.</p>
            <p>If ≈øuch an Attempt and Performance were very ea≈øy, there would be the le≈øs Honour in accompli≈øhing it. But neither can I imagine it ≈øo very difficult. Very wild and ≈øavage Nations have been reformed; therefore, the Indians, who are nothing ≈øo Savage, may be reformed. One or two Men, have ≈øometimes done a great deal towards civilizing the Manners of a People. What may not be done by the eminent Men of a large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, in Conjuction? Perhaps to be a≈ø≈øi≈øted by ≈øome of their be≈øt Neighbours, and ≈øupported by a high En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.</p>
            <p>How much have ≈øome wild People, ≈øuch formerly, improved in other Countries within this Century, and ≈øome in half that Time. What need to ≈øpeak of other Nations and of ancient Ages? Mr. <hi>Colden,</hi> who≈øe Book I open again, ≈øeems to think the <hi>Indians</hi> like other People. <q>I am fond to think, ≈øays he, that the pre≈øent State of the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations, exactly ≈øhews the mo≈øt ancient and original Condition of almo≈øt every Nation.</q> If the Original be the ≈øame, why may there not be a like Progre≈øs, e≈øpecially in a People,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007217_0011_102B3EFD036B2710"/>who ≈øeem to have an innate Di≈øpo≈øition to Science, and who breathe untaught Eloquence?</p>
            <p>Then,‚Äî that Love of Liberty and Honour;‚Äî that <hi>Roman,</hi>‚Äî that <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> Spirit:‚Äî They ≈øeem naturally akin to us,‚Äî be≈øide our Alliance,‚Äî let us help our Brethren. If the rough Gem throws out ≈øome Sparks of Light, how will it ≈øhine when poli≈øh'd! If the Tree appears fair in the Verdure of its Leaves, will not the Blo≈ø≈øoms and Fruits make it look more lovely!</p>
            <p>Speaking of Trees, minds me of two Lines in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> which ≈øeems applicable to this Subject.</p>
            <p>Exuarint Sylve≈øtrem animum, Cultuque frequenti, In qua≈øeunque voces Artes, hand tarda ≈øequentur.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ≈øavage Mind, by Culture when ≈øubdu'd, Will with the nobler Arts be ≈øoon imbu'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is no Occa≈øion for <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Skill in grafting to prolong this Di≈øcour≈øe. ‚Äî Perhaps it is too tedious, I would not multiply Words.</p>
            <p>My reading Mr. <hi>Colden,</hi> and tran≈øcribing the Indian Songs, rais'd the≈øe Thoughts in me. I imagin'd, that communicating them might be of Service. It is rot for me to proceed any further: If what is written ≈øeems for the Good of the Publick; the Ways and Means; the proper Method,‚Äîthat lies before others.</p>
            <p>It may be, at the next A≈ø≈øembly, if it ≈øhall ≈øeem good to them; a Committee will be appointed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the State of the <hi>Indian Nations,</hi> and into the be≈øt Methods for pre≈øerving, and ≈øtrengthening, and improving our Alliance with them.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, ≈øome will ≈øay, ≈øuch Cares ≈øhould begin at Home; that it becomes them chiefly to provide for the Education of their own Youth; and that they are to con≈øider of erecting and endowing a ≈øtately Edifice ≈øuitable to that Purpo≈øe.‚ÄîIt is very well,‚Äîwherefore ≈øhould they not?‚Äî But it is noble to have exten≈øive Views; That they may do; and yet not leave the other unders. They may look to the Welfare of their
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007217_0012_102B3EFF44DC4B10"/>Families, and to the Honour and Advantage of the Province.‚Äî Wherefore ≈øhould they not?‚Äî For this they have Dwellings in the≈øe Lands, and Seats in that Council.</p>
            <p>But, at the ≈øame Time, they may comprehend, and deliberate on the promoting, more largely the <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> Intere≈øt, and the Cau≈øe of Humanity, of Chri≈øtianity.</p>
            <p>This would give a peculiar Lu≈øtre to their A≈ø≈øembly. This would be to ri≈øe Forts and Bulwarks on their Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. This would be to make their Province and City, a Name and a Prai≈øe on the Earth.‚Äî This would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, more fully, to entitle them to the dear Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Fathers and Patriots.</p>

            <p>YARIZA's Letter, which came lately to Hand, it is hoped, will not be di≈øagreeable to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Ladies to whom it is directed.</p>
            <p>To judge of it by the Stile and Sentiments, it ≈øeems no le≈øs genuine than the other Pieces. It may be reckon'd more rare. We have had before now Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the Oratory of the Male <hi>Indians,</hi> but this, perhaps, is the fir≈øt of the Female.</p>
            <p>Some may imagine the Whole to be from <hi>Maratho:</hi> But why ≈øhould we doubt ≈øome of the <hi>Indian</hi> Women having ≈øome Genius for Poetry and Oratory, when we know there are of the Sex, eminent in tho≈øe Arts, in other Countries.</p>
            <p>One would think that there is a peculiar Delicacy and Tenderne≈øs, ≈øuitable to the Sex, which di≈øtingui≈øhes what is a≈øcrib'd to <hi>Yariza.</hi> Her Song appears to have a more pathetic Simplicity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maratho</hi> ≈øpeaks briefly of the Tree of Peace, and then of the Chain of Concord, and of the Grave or Pit of War; nay, he blu≈øters a little of the Ax ri≈øing again, as if War was not yet quite out of his Head. <hi>Yariza</hi> is all Gentlene≈øs, and ≈øeems loth to remove her Contemplations from the delightful Tree.</p>
            <p>At the very fir≈øt, there appears a Concern for it, le≈øt being of heavenly Origin, it ≈øhould not grow kindly here on Earth, le≈øt the Drought, or Fro≈øt, or Storms ≈øhould injure it. The Leaves, the Blo≈ø≈øoms and Fruits, are all mentioned in ≈øuch a Manner, as ≈øhew her Fondne≈øs for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:007217_0024_102B3F19CA8BF768"/>
The Birds of ≈øweete≈øt Voice, and the gentle≈øt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures embelli≈øh it. Wheels and Looms are its Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>But here ari≈øes a Difficulty: It ≈øeems doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øhe can be warranted in her De≈øign to go to Court, and in her ≈øpeaking of the great Per≈øonages.</p>
            <p>Is this Propriety of Sentiment? It is very ≈øure, ≈øhe might have heard of the Queen, and Prince≈øs, and of the young Prince, and how dear they were to <hi>Britons:</hi> But did it become her to attempt their Eulogies? The whole Affair is ≈øubmitted to the Ladies and to the Critics, only, let them remember in her Favour, that ≈øhe did not intend to go to Court without a fine Web along with her.</p>
            <p>Altho' the Solemnity of the Occa≈øion might lead her ≈øhe appears there but as by Accident. She do's not depend on any Songs compo≈øed by her or <hi>Maratho,</hi> to introduce her, but on good Hu≈øwif'ry.</p>
            <p>She makes but a ≈øhort Vi≈øit to lament the ab≈øent Brightne≈øs, and to take Comfort from that which is pre≈øent.</p>
            <p>She ≈øoon returns to the fair Tree, which ≈øeems dearer to her than the Grandeur of a Court, than the Pomp of Maje≈øty.</p>
            <p>She had look'd undazzled on royal Splendor, and on an illu≈øtrious Progeny. But here ≈øhe is in Raptures She invokes the Earth, the Air, and Heaven.‚Äî She appears no longer as an <hi>Indian</hi> Maid, the untaught <hi>Yariza,</hi> but as a <hi>Sybil,</hi> or rather a Prophete≈øs in a divine Tran≈øport, while ≈øhe extends her Hands, and looking up, ble≈ø≈øes the King and Nations.</p>
            <p>Has ≈øhe not communicated her Rapture? Is not this Comment ≈ømit with her Enthu≈øia≈øm? ‚Äî Be it ≈øo,‚Äî perhaps ≈øuch Enthu≈øia≈øm is not blameable.</p>
            <p>However, would it not be well done by tho≈øe, to whom her Letter is addre≈øs'd, yet to encourage her to go to Court; or after ≈øome Time, direct thither
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007217_0025_102B3F1C2E4B2E58"/>others of the <hi>Indian</hi> Maids, who ≈øhall become mo≈øt accompli≈øh'd, with ≈øome of their ≈øine Indu≈øtry.</p>
            <p>Such a Pre≈øent, it may be well imagined, would not be unacceptable to the chief Ladies of the Court of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ≈øuch a Motive, be≈øide many others, and the Benefit thence to ari≈øe to them≈øelves might influence tho≈øe of the Fair Sex here, who have it mo≈øt in their Power, to promote the In≈øtruction and Improvement of the Female <hi>Indians.</hi> As for the Men, it is hoped that they will take Care of the Male Sex; and ≈øhould the gentler Kind, who are allow'd to have a greater Share of Tenderne≈øs be outdone on ≈øo fair an Occa≈øion for their Emulation: ‚ÄîBut, perhaps, <hi>Yariza</hi> is too long detained from her Addre≈øs to them.</p>

            <p>PARDON <hi>Yariza,</hi> while pre≈øuming thus to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre≈øs to you; ≈øhe ≈øpeaks not only for her≈øelf, but for many Thou≈øands of young <hi>Indian</hi> Maids in the≈øe Parts, who de≈øire to offer their Services to you, and to congratulate you on the Planting of the Tree of Peace.</p>
            <p>May you walk delightfully under its Shade, for, mo≈øt ≈øurely, <hi>Corlaer</hi> has ≈øet up one there, as our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chems</hi> have done here.</p>

May it ≈øpread its Branches over all your Abodes, and over the whole Country, and no wild Beaft of War come out of the Fore≈øt to root it up. May the I≈øland of <hi>Manhatan,</hi> and the neighbouring I≈øles, and the large Land, all become as one Garden of Peace and Plea≈øure; and may your Children grow up like fair Plants that are cheri≈øh'd by the benign Heat of the bright Luminary, and nurs'd by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre≈øhing Dew of Heaven. May each of you have in your Habitations, a fair Shrub, or little Tree, as a Family Tree of Peace, to ble≈øs your Dwellings. May the Exhalations from it, be as the ≈øweet Odour of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen≈øe, or as the Leaves of the ≈øweete≈øt Trees in the Fore≈øt, to gladden your Apartments. Let no rude Sounds of Di≈øcord or Di≈øquiet, be as a blighting Wind to wither the Leaves thereof. No Di≈øtre≈øs nor Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, like a thick Fog, ca≈øt an unkindly Mildew to taint them, but the Man's Eyes, like the Sun-Beams, chear its Roots, and the Woman's Voice, as a gentle Breeze, fan and regale the Branches. Let her draw deep into her Brea≈øt the Bal≈øam of its Effluence, and her Lips breathe forth and improve the Fragrance.</p>
            <p>How gladly would the <hi>Indian</hi> Maids attend on you in your (high Wigwams) great Hou≈øes, to learn ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of your Gracefulne≈øs and Goodne≈øs, to watch the Bidding of your fine Eyes, and wait on the Beckoning of your fair Hands! ‚Äî But we are not worthy, till bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fa≈øhion'd, Send us, therefore, we pray ye, ≈øome good Women, who may teach us tho≈øe Sounds, wherein you utter your Commands and Meaning, that we may perfectly under≈øtand, and be the more ≈øit to attend to them, and who may learn us ≈øome-what of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the fine Needles, wherein your≈øelves are ≈øo excellent; and who may direct us in tho≈øe Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for the Looms, wherein your Maid-Servants are in≈øtructed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:007217_0027_102B3F1F6441FB80"/>The <hi>Indian</hi> Virgins, O Ladies, ca≈øt them≈øelves at your Feet, humbly de≈øiring your Protection and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage. Think to what it is that you are call'd upon: To be as pure Living-Springs, that water a dry ≈øandy Defart; as a bright Light to illuminate dark Regions; as a divine Voice ≈øounding in the Fore≈øt, to rai≈øe the ≈øweete≈øt Confort. You are called upon to be the Prai≈øe of ≈øuture Ages, as well as of the pre≈øent; to have the Ble≈ø≈øings of Nations on you and the Ble≈ø≈øings of Heaven.</p>
            <p>May you long adorn the Tree of Peace,‚Äî and may we, al≈øo, by your Means, be a≈ø≈øi≈øted in tho≈øe Works and Knowledge, which will yield the fine≈øt Garlands to bind to its Branches.</p>
            <p>Live happy, O amiable Ladies, and look favourably on the Daughters of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> in behalf of whom, this Gratulation of the Planting of the fair Tree, this Offer of their Service; this Reque≈øt for their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement; their good Wi≈øhes for your Welfare, are offer'd with Re≈øpect to you, and Admiration of you, by</p>
