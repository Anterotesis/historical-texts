            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the Church, have nevertheleſs been ſo far from that Humility that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attends true Repentance, that their refractory Deportment to their offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Friends hath height'ned their Offence, yea, even ſhut cloſe that Door againſt themſelves, whereby they might in due Time probably have been re-admitted into Unity with the Society. It will, I aſſure you, dear Souls, be much more pleaſing, and acceptable to all the true in Heart, to receive you again, in at the Door aforeſaid, than it was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude you; for, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>More is the Joy over one loſt Sheep (over one Sinner that repenteth) than over Ninety and Nine juſt Perſons which need no Repentance,</hi> yea, even <hi>in the Preſence of the Angels of God,</hi> Luke xv. 7, 10. Let no poor droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls therefore deſpair, or deſpond, for by the Door aforeſaid all may be reconciled, reinſtated, and re-united, though far gone aſtray, as to the Ends of the Earth.</p>
            <p>But yet, if it ſhould ever ſo fall out, where any Perſon or Perſons, in any Place, ſhould have given their Friends
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007016_0014_102AE46CFACAACA8"/>
juſt Occaſion to exclude them from the Unity of the Society, and ſuch Perſon or Perſons ſhould be brought to a Senſe of, and godly Sorrow for their Miſconduct, and ſhew forth the ſame by an orderly and religious Converſation, and keeping cloſe to Meetings for a conſiderable Space of Time, yet notwithſtanding all this, if upón their Application to Friends of the Meeting to which he, ſhe or they did belong, to be received into Unity with Friends, they may find ſome Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or Particulars ſtrongly to oppoſe and weigh againſt them in the Obtaining their Deſire; let ſuch, I earneſtly intreat them, keep cloſe to their Exerciſe, and humble Walking before the Lord, ſpreading and committing their Cauſe unto Him, patiently waiting for Him to open their Way, and, I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, in His Time, Way will be made for them: In the mean while, as above, I beg ſuch may take an eſpecial Care that they let in no Hardneſs againſt any Friend or Friends, nor yet againſt the honorable and neceſſary Diſcipline of the Church, which we have good Ground to believe, was at firſt ſettled

and eſtabliſhed in the Wiſdom of TRUTH, and is of great Service, where 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged and adminiſtred in the ſweet Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Goſpel, which always breathes out <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, Peace on Earth, Good-will towards Men;</hi> hath Charity to the Souls of all Men, but to the Sins of none; loves the immortal Soul of every Man, but the immoral Actions of none.</p>
            <p>It has been, and is obſerved, that ſometimes Perſons that have given real Occaſion for the Line of Judgment to be ſtretched over them, have taken ſuch a Diſguſt at the juſt Cenſure, when paſt upon them, that they have forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en religious Aſſemblies; who by ſo doing do evidently demonſtrate great Weakneſs, and that they give way to the Spirit of the Enemy, who is always ſeeking Advantage againſt us frail Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, in order to draw us farther and farther from the Truth, and nearer and nearer to his own dark Kingdom; Wherefore, I again moſt earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, in much Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, that ye who have taken Offence of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007016_0016_102AE4706C4EBE30"/>
this kind, would forthwith endeavour to lay aſide all Reſentment, and Diſlike, that you may have unwarily let in, and wait to feel the peaceable Spirit of meek Jeſus, our bleſſed Redeemer, and therein attend religious Meetings; that in this manner humbling yourſelves before the Lord, he may pleaſe, in his tender Mercy, to grant unto you Faith, Repentance, and Remiſſion of Sins; alſo, by theſe Means, your Friends may have a true Senſe of your Conditions, and of the Frame of your Minds. Pleaſe to conſider, that neither civil nor religious Society (morally ſpeaking) can ſubſiſt, or be preſerved from utterly relapſing and falling away into Confuſion, without proper Rules and Government: And what ſignify Rules if not obſerved? And proper Meaſures taken with thoſe that knowingly tranſgreſs the ſame? And farther, may it be calmly and ſeriouſly conſider'd, that when thoſe Perſons, who owning our Principles, and profeſſing themſelves to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our Society, and were look'd upon as ſuch, while they walk'd or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007016_0017_102AE47404766CF0"/>
have wilfully volated the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Rules agreed upon and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed amongſt us, have by their own very Actions, and not ſubmitting to the Means uſed by the Church for their Reſtoration, diſunited themſelves from Memberſhip with the Body of which they had been Members; and that the Papers of Deniel, given forth againſt them are but Declarations, that ſuch Perſons having committed ſuch Things which are diſallowed by the Church, and not truly repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and giving Satisfaction, are thereupon diſown'd.</p>
            <p>So, dear Friends, with the Words of the Prophet I ſhall draw to a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Seek the Lord while he is to be found; call upon him while he is near: Let the Wicked forſake his Way, and the unrighteous Man his Thoughts: And let him return to the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> Iſa. lv. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Having now honeſtly thus paid the Debt of Love I have long ow'd you,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007016_0018_102AE47608DE0500"/>
I bid you farewel, and ſubſcribe myſelf, in much Sincerity, your real Friend and Well-wiſher, who can do no leſs than ſtill pray for you, that you may be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
