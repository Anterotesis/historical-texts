            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE epidemic fever which made its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in this city, at the latter end of the month of July laſt year, and which occaſioned a degree of mortality among the people never experienced in ſo ſhort a ſpace before, afforded matter of much ſerious converſation, and gave riſe to a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of opinion. An idea was entertained by ſome, and this idea was, by others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly propagated abroad, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was imported from the Weſt-Indies, and that it was <hi>contagious:</hi> while, on the other hand, many contended that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of local circumſtances, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived an uncommon activity from a <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar conſtitution of the air,</hi> were alone ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to account for its production.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:030041_0006_0FE411B44A5C9298"/>
It is the main object of the writer of this pamphlet to lay before the public a few facts on this important ſubject; and in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, he is conſcious that the chief merit of theſe will conſiſt in the diligence with which they were collected, and the fidelity with which they are detailed. He ſhall purpoſely avoid attacking any particular doctrines in medicine, relatively to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the fever in queſtion; and the ſame temper will incline him to paſs, without animadverſion, the practice of thoſe who have ſtood deſervedly high in their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. He will therefore hold himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible only for a <hi>faithful narrative.</hi>—It has, indeed, been thrown together under circumſtances very unfavourable to regular compoſition; but as it ſprung from no vain conceit of ability to render that clear, which has long been involved in obſcurity, he thinks he may rely on the purity of his motive for publiſhing it, as a ſhield againſt the ſeverity of criticiſm. The motive, as
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030041_0007_0FE411E1C6CC20A8"/>
it firſt ſuggeſted itſelf to his mind, was none other, than a deſire to point out the <hi>real cauſes, as they appeared to him, of the late epidemic,</hi> and thereby, in ſome degree, to moderate individual apprehenſion, and quiet popular alarm.</p>
            <p>At the firſt appearance of the diſeaſe, the following reports were diligently circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and very generally credited, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that Dr. Treat, then health officer of the port of New-York, had viſited the brig Zephyr, juſt arrived from Port-au-Prince; that he found the crew ſickly; that ſeveral men had died on the paſſage; that a boy had died the morning of her arrival; that Dr. Treat had incautiouſly opened the dead body; that it was very generally tinged with a yellow colour; and that it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely offenſive to the ſmell.</p>
            <p>How correſpondent theſe reports were with truth, will hereafter appear, from a ſtatement of facts, ſubſtantiated by the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of indubitable authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:030041_0008_0FE411B755BC6848"/>
A few days after Dr. Treat viſited the brig Zephyr, about the 20th of July, he was ſeized with fever. The manner of the attack, the nature and ſeverity of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent ſymptoms, attended with a yellow countenance, and a ſimilar tinge of the ſkin generally, were ſuppoſed to conſtitute the diſeaſe the <hi>yellow fever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the ſame time that Dr. Treat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came indiſpoſed, a fever, reſembling that of which he died, made its appearance on board the ſhip William, ſaid to be then lying at Fitch's wharf, nearly oppoſite Dover-ſtreet. Shortly after, Auguſt 1ſt, the family of Mr. Jenkins, living in Water-ſtreet, near Dover-ſtreet, was attacked with fever, which was ſuppoſed to have been communicated from the ſhip William.</p>
            <p>At firſt it ſeemed rather extraordinary, that the ſhip William, which had ſailed directly from Liverpool to this place, and whoſe men had been healthy during the paſſage, ſhould have contained matter of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030041_0009_0FE4119DCA66A4B8"/>
a contagious nature, which only operated upon the crew in producing fever ſeveral weeks after her arrival.</p>
            <p>This difficulty, however, was ſoon made to vaniſh, and the explanation became eaſy, when it was alledged that the brig Zephyr, on board of which no one was ſuppoſed to doubt that the yellow fever exiſted, had hauled along-ſide the ſhip William, and thus communicated the diſeaſe to the ſailors.</p>
            <p>This account, plauſible in appearance, obtained almoſt univerſal credit, and though highly erroneous, as will hereafter be proved, was in a haſty and unauthoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way conveyed to Philadelphia, and, no doubt, afforded a conſiderable ground upon which the regulations that took place in that city, relative to this, were founded.</p>
            <p>At this period the public mind laboured under great apprehenſions. A new diſeaſe was ſuppoſed to have made its appearance. Several deaths had already happened, the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030041_0010_0FE411B95460A8D8"/>
nature of which, judging from the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious circumſtance of colour, had an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect extremely formidable. The progreſs, alſo, of the complaint, was ſuppoſed to be ſuch, that to thoſe who took things for granted, there remained but little doubt that the city would ſoon be overſpread with contagion: and it cannot be ſufficiently regretted, that the ſuppoſed contagious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the diſeaſe was too much urged by thoſe who ought to have been more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in their opinion: for as yet no cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances had really occurred to counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or juſtify the violent and exaggerated accounts which were circulated upon this ſubject.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of affairs the torrent of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion became irreſiſtible. Fear and diſmay pervaded every mind; and thoſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants who were moſt alarmed, as well as many of thoſe who had no particular motive for remaining in the city, ſought refuge in the country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:030041_0011_0FE411E6578F6710"/>
In all ſituations in which our ſafety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a matter of conſiderable doubt, it is natural for us, after the panic, with which at firſt we are apt to be ſeized, has a little ſubſided, to enquire what the chances are that we eſcape the danger. Accordingly, thoſe who remained in the city, and were at the trouble of inveſtigating the ſubject, found, that many examples had offered, where the ſick had been attended with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity: neither phyſicians, nor friends, nor attendants had imbibed any infection: and the circumſtances attending the very few inſtances which were ſuppoſed to favour the idea of contagion, were ſo extremely obſcure and doubtful, that nothing could be collected from them, of a nature at all ſatisfactory. In confirmation of this, we have the declaration of the Medical Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in anſwer to a letter from Governor Jay, dated 24th of September, 1795:—<q>The collective opinion of this Society, as the reſult of attentive obſervation, is, that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030041_0012_0FE411BB4AFD1088"/>
the fever is not ſpecifically contagious; and we are confirmed in this opinion from the following powerful conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that neither relatives, nurſes, nor phyſicians have, ſave in one or two doubtful caſes, been infected by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on thoſe who have either recovered or died of the diſeaſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Much was daily urged from theſe facts; and finally, the terror with which the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed contagious nature of the diſeaſe had filled people's minds, was in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure done away: and the confidence which took place, between the patient and phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, as a conſequence of this conviction, was, I have no doubt, in many inſtances, a mean which greatly contributed to the recovery of the ſick.</p>
            <p>Thus it would appear, from what has already been ſaid, that a difference of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion had exiſted, as well among the citizens as the phyſicians, with reſpect to the real origin and character of the late epidemic.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:030041_0013_0FE411E8062935A0"/>
The object I have in view is to reconcile thoſe opinions, as far as that can be effected, by bringing into one view all the facts I have been able to collect upon the ſubject. Theſe ſhall form the principal data upon which any future reaſoning may be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if the ſentiments I may advance are found to differ from the opinion of others, I hope that a liberal and candid communication may tend to our mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and that the public may be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by our attempts to arrive at truth.</p>
            <p>We ſhall, therefore, in the next place, proceed to examine the validity of the opinion, that the brig Zephyr introduced a contagious fever into this city. And the following letters from Meſſrs. Armſtrong and Barnwell, and Miller and Hoope, are, in my mind, very explicit.</p>

                        <p>The brig Zephyr, Capt Frederick Bird, arrived from Port-au-Prince on or about the 19th of July laſt, loaded with ſugar and coffee. The cargo came to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. She hauled firſt to the Old-ſlip, where her cargo was unloaded. The veſſel leaked much on her paſſage from Port-au-Prince, which damaged twenty-two hogſheads of coffee in the ground tier: in conſequence of which the veſſel was ordered into the ſtream, where the damaged coffee was thrown into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, under the inſpection of the Wardens of the Port. One boy died on board the day of her arrival, who had been ſick all the paſſage. The captain, mate, and one ſeaman, were taken ſick at Port-au-Prince, and continued ſo during the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; but were perfectly reſtored to health ſoon after their arrival. Dr. Treat viſited

the veſſel on her arrival. The day was extremely hot, and he uſed uncommon exertions in the middle of it, to find the commanding officer on Governor's Iſland, to obtain permiſſion to inter the boy there. He complained on his return, that the day and exerciſe had almoſt overcome him.</p>
                        <p>The veſſel, after ſhe was unloaded, put up for freight for Baltimore, and took on board her cargo for thence at the Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-houſe ſlip. She was never near the ſhip William, which laid at, or near Fitch's wharf. During the delivery of the inward cargo we were on board every day, as were alſo the Wardens of the Port; and we have not learned that any perſon has been taken ill in conſequence.</p>
                        <p>We underſtand that the captain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Baltimore in the veſſel, and the mate to Boſton. However, as they were more immediately under the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Meſſrs. Miller and Hoope, to

Bird that it was ſickly at Port-au-Prince when he was there in June and July, which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the caſe at that ſeaſon, but that it was ſcarcely known among the French inhabitants, and fell chiefly on the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh and Americans.

                        <p>The brig Zephyr, of Boſton, Capt. Bird, came addreſſed to our houſe from Port-au-Prince; her cargo, conſiſting of ſugar, coffee, and hides, was addreſſed to Meſſrs.

a quantity of damaged coffee, which was thrown into the Eaſt-river. The brig was then hauled to the end of Jones's wharf, below the Coffee-houſe, and took in her cargo for Baltimore.</p>

            <p>The foregoing letters afford an unequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal teſtimony of the condition of the crew of the brig Zephyr, on her arrival in this port. They afford, alſo, a complete refutation of the aſſertion, that the Zephyr communicated a contagious fever to the ſhip William, the two veſſels having never been near one another: and, in ſhort, they ſhew, that, excepting the death of the boy,

the reports circulated concerning the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr, at the firſt appearance of the fever, and indeed believed by many during its continuance, were altogether without foundation.</p>
            <p>When it was diſcovered that the brig Zephyr had not been nearer the ſhip Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam than half a mile, ſo wedded were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals to the idea of imported contagion, that they fixed on the brig Active, which had juſt arrived from Martinique, as the contagious veſſel. But the following letters from Meſſrs.

ſuppoſed to have been one of thoſe veſſels which introduced a contagious diſeaſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this city. The ſaid brig ſailed from this port on the 9th of April laſt, bound to the Weſt-Indies, navigated by Capt. Mathew Rogers, a mate, and five hands. After touching at ſeveral iſlands for a market, ſhe finally arrived at Martinique, where the captain diſpoſed of her cargo, and received in payment thirty-ſix hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheads of molaſſes, and the reſidue in bills of exchange on this city. He alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on board, on freight, and conſigned to Meſſrs. Concklin and Loyd, merchants here, one hundred and thirty-four bales of caſſia, commonly called wild honey. This and the molaſſes conſtituted the whole of her return cargo. The ſaid brig ſailed from Martinique on the 30th of June, bound for this port, and arrived here the 22d of July. Seventeen days previous to her arrival, ſhe loſt one man by ſickneſs, and from information receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030041_0020_0FE411C4E59DEDB8"/>
from the captain, he died with a fever, the nature of which he could not aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but ſuppoſed it was brought on by the uſe of liquor, of which the deceaſed would, previous to his ſickneſs, drink large quantities. After his body was committed to the waves, the captain, for three ſucceſſive days, had the birth, bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and every thing belonging to the deceaſed, carefully cleaned, under his own inſpection. The reſidue of her crew enjoyed a full ſtate of health during the voyage, and were all perfectly well on her arrival in this port. Her cargo was landed at Fitch's wharf, partly by her crew and partly by labourers: nor do we know an inſtance of any one of them being ſick after their diſcharge from the veſſel. She remained at Fitch's wharf about three weeks; at which time we diſpoſed of her to Mr. Orange Webb, merchant of this city, who immediately loaded her and ſent her to ſea.</p>

                  <p>In purſuance of your requeſt, I yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day ſaw Capt. Rogers, late maſter of the brig Active, who tells me he hauled along ſide of Fitch's wharf on Friday the 24th of July laſt, and that he began to break bulk the next day, being Saturday the 25th.</p>

ſeveral of them, none of whom have been taken with the late diſorder.</p>
                  <p>I was repeatedly on board, and in the cabin: once in particular, before ſhe hauled along ſide the wharf, I was in the hold of the brig, and examined the cargo; but as I was not taken with the diſorder until the 5th of September following, (although I lived near Peck-ſlip, where the diſeaſe firſt began to rage) I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent I never took it on board Captain Rogers' brig.</p>

            <p>The preceding letters leave little doubt with reſpect to the healthful ſtate of the brig Active. It appears that ſhe arrived in port on the 22d of July: on the 23d ſhe laid on the outſide of a veſſel at the end of Fitch's wharf: on the 24th ſhe hauled into the ſlip; and on the 25th of July ſhe broke bulk.</p>

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:030041_0023_0FE3F1825066D270"/>
Hitherto it has been ſuppoſed, that the ſhip William alſo laid at Fitch's wharf; but the truth is, that this veſſel did not, at any period this ſeaſon, lie at that wharf. Her ſituation, at firſt, was at the wharf of Lawrence and Kipp, about fifty yards weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Fitch's; and on the 24th of July ſhe removed to Rutgers' wharf, diſtant about half a mile from her firſt ſtation.</p>
            <p>Upon a compariſon of theſe ſtatements it will appear, 1ſt, that the veſſels above named were never nearer one another than fifty yards; and, 2dly, that the day before the Active began to unload, the William was removed to the diſtance of half a mile. Thus it is ſhewn how little foundation there was for a report of a fever being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from the brig Active to the ſhip William.</p>
            <p>The next ſubject of ſuſpicion was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of cotton, which had been imported in the brig Caroline, and which was depoſited in the ſtore of Lawrence and Mott, at the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030041_0024_0FE411C9E450F770"/>
foot of Dover-ſtreet. It was reported that a man had thruſt his arm into a bag of da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged cotton, and that, when he withdrew it, the arm, from the virulence of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, was of a livid colour. However extravagant this declaration may ſeem, there were not wanting thoſe who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to its credit. In ſhort, ſo infatuated were ſome of the inhabitants with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of imported contagion, that they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected every veſſel, which had arrived from the Weſt-Indies previous to the late epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic, to have brought contagion in her.</p>

I have thus advanced ſuch documents, upon the ſubject of imported contagion, as, from a careful enquiry, I have been able to collect. From this inveſtigation the public is in poſſeſſion of ſuch information, as may be made the baſis of a tolerably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate judgment; and I have little heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in believing, that the concluſion na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally reſulting from the premiſes, will be extremely unfavourable, if not abſolutely againſt the opinion which ſome have ſo warmly embraced, that the cauſe of the late epidemic was imported contagion.</p>
            <p>We muſt now take the liberty of recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to a further conſideration of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances relative to the brig Zephyr.</p>
            <p>From the ſtatements contained in the letters already inſerted, regarding this veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, ſeveral facts of conſiderable importance are made to appear, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that no perſon died on board the Zephyr, during the whole of her voyage, except the boy already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; that all thoſe of the crew who had
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030041_0027_0FE411F5122850C0"/>
been taken ſick at Port-au-Prince, and had become convaleſcent, ſoon got well after her arrival in this harbour; and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wardens of the port, the conſignees, nor any other perſon who had been tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiently on board the Zephyr, except Doctor Treat, ſuffered any bad conſequences from their viſits.—The queſtion then occurs, Did Doctor Treat take the diſeaſe, of which he died, from the Zephyr?</p>
            <p>It was a circumſtance well known, that the health of Doctor Treat was generally impaired. His ſtomach was in a ſtate of conſtant diſorder; and this, independent of other effects, was, at particular periods, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſuch extreme dejection of ſpirits, that he did not, as he had often aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me, expect to live from one day to another. The Doctor had been complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than common for ſeveral days before he viſited the Zephyr. He embarked in a ſmall open boat at mid-day, with a black hat on his head, and without an um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brella,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030041_0028_0FE411CD832F71E8"/>
which he had always been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to uſe, to defend him from the ſun's rays. The day was calm, extremely hot, and the veſſel at leaſt one mile and a half from the place of his departure. It is alſo ſtated, that he was much fatigued, upon Governor's Iſland, in ſearching for the commanding officer.</p>
            <p>Thus, then, it would appear as matter of fact, firſt, that Doctor Treat was indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at the time he viſited the Zephyr: ſecondly, that in performing that duty he was expoſed, for ſeveral hours, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme heat of the ſun; and, thirdly, that he encountered conſiderable bodily fatigue. If theſe circumſtances are well conſidered, and that peculiar ſtate of the weather, which prediſpoſes to fever, is taken into the eſtimate, is it unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that the fever with which Doctor Treat was attacked, might have originated from the operation of ſuch a combination of cauſes? Every candid phyſician will give
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030041_0029_0FE411F7D1CD8E60"/>
a negative anſwer to the queſtion. But we ſhall not be very ſolicitous to prove, that Doctor Treat did not contract his diſeaſe in this manner—We grant that he might have received <hi>infection</hi> from the Zephyr; but does it neceſſarily follow, that it ſhould have cauſed a <hi>contagious</hi> fever? A conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the conſequences, in a variety of parallel caſes, will contribute much to the formation of an opinion upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.—The following is conſidered illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of this point.</p>
            <p>At the termination of the late war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the United States and Great-Britain, Colonel William Smith, of this city, was appointed, by General Waſhington, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in New-York, with the conſent of Sir Guy Carlton, for the purpoſe of ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the evacuation of the country, and to ſee that it was performed agreeably to the treaty. In the exerciſe of this duty, he had frequent occaſion to go between the decks, and into the holds of veſſels. In
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030041_0030_0FE411CF72D0D1D0"/>
the courſe of theſe viſits, he was ſeized with (what is commonly denominated a ſhip-fever) a bilious remitting fever. After a few days, the fever happily intermitted, and Colonel Smith ſoon recovered a toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſhare of ſtrength.</p>
            <p>It was thought proper to caution him againſt the danger he would incur by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating his viſits on board ſhip. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the duty was indiſpenſible. The conſequence was, he contracted a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond fever. The firſt of the attack was attended with a ſenſe of coldneſs, which was ſoon ſucceeded by violent pain in the head. His countenance was fluſhed, and his eyes were very red. The third day his neck and breaſt took on a yellow appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and in forty-eight hours, the whole of his body became as yellow as an orange. From the acceſſion of his fever to its ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, his heat was ſo conſiderable, that on feeling his pulſe, or graſping his wriſt, the ſenſation communicated was ſimilar to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030041_0031_0FE411FA098FEFE0"/>
the ſting of nettles, or very fine needles pricking the hand.</p>
            <p>Colonel Smith lodged at Mr. Depeyſter's in Pearl-ſtreet, and notwithſtanding the unremitting attention he received from the family, the diſeaſe was not communicated to one of his attendants.<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>I have twice, in the purſuit of my avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, imbibed infectious fevers—once on ſhip-board; and again on viſiting a priſon. I was handled very ſeverely in both inſtances, and deprived of my ſenſes ſeveral days during each confinement. My attendants were numerous, and vigilant;
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030041_0032_0FE411D230722D08"/>
yet no one ſuffered from contact with my body, or from breathing the air of my chamber.</p>
            <p>As favourable to the ſame concluſions with the above inſtances, and tending to illuſtrate the doctrine we are endeavouring to eſtabliſh, we ſhall here introduce the hiſtory of a fever which raged among the men of Monſ. De la Motte's fleet, in 1757.</p>
            <p>A fleet, under the command of Monſ. De la Motte, ſailed from Breſt on the third day of May, 1757, for Louiſburg, in Nova-Scotia. A number of ſailors (about two hundred) who had been confined in Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort hoſpital, with putrid fever, and had become convaleſcent, were embarked on board the Glorieux and Duc de Burgogne, ſhips of war. Theſe ſhips had been two years in a ſtate of equipment, and moſt of that time at ſea; they, therefore, could not be ſuppoſed to have been very clean. The other ſhips of the fleet had lain ſome time in the harbour of Breſt, and were not in a
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030041_0033_0FE411FBFA45A5F8"/>
very healthy condition. On board the different veſſels were alſo diſtributed four hundred ſailors, who had juſt returned from confinement in the Engliſh priſons. The ſhips' companies became ſickly on their paſſage, particularly thoſe of the Glorieux and Burgogne; and on the 20th of June they arrived at Louiſburg. The wind was fair during the paſſage, blowing moſtly from the ſouth-eaſt; and the weather was ſo favourable and temperate, that it was found unneceſſary to ſhut the port-holes or cloſe the hatch-ways.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the fleet arrived at Louiſburg, the different ſhips had their tents pitched on ſhore, for the accommodation of the ſick; and they were accordingly diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked immediately. The tents were pitched too near one another, and hence the ſick did not receive all the advantages which they might have derived from their ſituation.</p>
            <p>

But it is obſerved, that the number of the ſick was greatly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented during the latter part of September. This aroſe from two cauſes; firſt, from the neceſſity they were under of collecting all their ſtrength from the different veſſels, to finiſh works, in order to defend the city: ſecondly, from a ſevere gale of wind, which happened on the 25th of September, and threatened deſtruction to the whole fleet. Several ſhips were in particular danger, to ſave which, the united exertions of officers and ſailors were required; and in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this duty, the men were unavoidably expoſed to exceſſive labour and extreme bad weather. After this, the ſick became more numerous; and by the 30th of October, the day on which the fleet left Louiſburg for Breſt, the ſick amounted to fourteen hundred. Of this number, four hundred
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030041_0035_0FE411FDA87F37D0"/>
of the worſt caſes were left at Louiſburg, in bad lodgings, and under the management of few, and thoſe unſkilful attendants.</p>
            <p>The fleet had not been at ſea more than ſix days, before moſt of thoſe who were ſick at the time of ſailing, with many others, died. The paſſage was attended with very boiſterous weather; and the ſea ran ſo high, that the ports were obliged to be kept ſhut. Under circumſtances ſo uncomfortable, the malady ſpread with great rapidity, and on the arrival of the fleet at Breſt, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on the 22d of November, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſick amounted to four thouſand.</p>
            <p>Fifteen days before the return of De la Motte's fleet, the two ſhips of war, Bizarre and Celèbre, arrived in Breſt harbour from Canada. The crews of theſe ſhips were affected with a complaint ſimilar to the one which prevailed on board the Louiſburg fleet; and they had already ſent one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men to the hoſpitals at Breſt. The hoſpitals, therefore, were found crouded;
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030041_0036_0FE411D61E212280"/>
and for the accommodation of the ſick newly arrived, temporary hoſpitals were erected. Into theſe the ſick were hurried from the ſhips, in cold and wet weather, and thrown together in heaps(entaſſé pélé mélé). Under theſe circumſtances, little benefit was obtained from the means em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for their relief.</p>
            <p>The diſeaſe raged, with unrelenting violence, from the 22d of November to the laſt of February. It began to diminiſh in the month of March, and ceaſed entirely in April. But it was remarked, that this cruel diſeaſe did not ceaſe until it had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed ſo many men, that thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained had, in conſequence, an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of enjoying all the advantages of breathing a pure air, of cleanlineſs, and good attendance.</p>
            <p>The number that died in the hoſpitals at Breſt, at this period, was not leſs than ten thouſand, beſides a conſiderable number in the city.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:030041_0037_0FE4120161F920D8"/>
Of the four hundred men left at Louiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, who appeared to be in a condition from which a recovery could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, badly accommodated, and worſe attended, three hundred and eighty were cured.</p>
            <p>The foregoing is an epitomized narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a voyage from Breſt to Louiſburg, in which is related the prevalence and mortality of a fever, which the author of the account denominates PUTRID, MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGNANT, CONTAGIOUS, and PESTILEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIAL.</p>
            <p>A conſideration of the circumſtances at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending this expedition, and the ſtate of a conſiderable part of the men employed on the occaſion, will readily, I apprehend, explain the fatality attending it, without recurring to the ſuppoſition of the diſeaſe being, in its nature, eſſentially <hi>contagious</hi> or <hi>peſtilential.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will have been perceived before this, that we have been ſomewhat ſolicitous to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030041_0038_0FE4120332596780"/>
eſtabliſh a diſtinction between diſeaſes which are <hi>infectious,</hi> and thoſe which are <hi>contagious.</hi> By contagion we underſtand ſomething <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>ſpecific,</hi> poſſeſſing properties <hi>eſſentially</hi> different from any thing elſe. Thus the contagion of the ſmall-pox, the meaſles, &amp;c. Thoſe diſeaſes do not require the concurrence of certain cauſes to render them contagious; they are ſo under <hi>all</hi> circumſtances. But other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes may, or may <hi>not</hi> be <hi>infectious,</hi> according to the conditional ſtate in which they are placed. Thus a fever ſhall continue days, or even weeks, without giving riſe to the leaſt ſuſpicion that it has, in any inſtance, been the cauſe of fever in any perſon, who may have been, either a frequent viſitor, or conſtant attendant: whilſt a fever, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the ſame ſymptoms and appearances, and not more violent in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, ſhall be communicated from one to another, and extend to incalculable lengths, ſo long as the circumſtances exiſt which
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030041_0039_0FE4120526114510"/>
favour its propagation. Agreeably to this difinition, may be explained the ſlow, or rapid progreſs of the fever of the Louiſburg fleet, at different periods.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate this more fully, we ſhall take a review of the circumſtances attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that fleet, from the time of its ſailing from Breſt harbour, to its return to that port, and the after diſpoſal of the men.</p>
            <p>The convaleſcents from Rochfort hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital received on board the fleet, had been weakened by a previous diſeaſe; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of which we preſume not to have been contagious, becauſe no mention is made of it. They were ordered into ſhips which had been the greateſt part of two years at ſea, and in a condition, it is ſtated, not very favourable to the re-eſtabliſhment of health. The conſequence was, that moſt of theſe unfortunate men had a return of fever, and this fever became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious. The fever, it is ſaid, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to ſome of the ſhips' company
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030041_0040_0FE41206D33607A0"/>
during the paſſage to Louiſburg. We have no doubt of the fact. But we by no means admit this as a proof of the contagious nature of the diſeaſe. It is very common for fevers to become <hi>infectious,</hi> when a number of ſick are crowded together in confined apartments; and on ſhip-board they are particularly liable to become ſo, from the impoſſibility of ventilation in ſome inſtances, and the neglect of it in others. Here, too, it often happens, that, for want of room, the well are compelled to lie with, or near the ſick, and to breathe an air rendered extremely noxious from the abſtraction of that part which is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to animal vigour, and from a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the different effluvia ariſing from the ſick, the dying, and perhaps the dead. Hence a cauſe appears why ſhip-fevers are often communicated with ſo much facility, and are a cauſe of ſo great a mortality.</p>
            <p>But in the caſe now more immediately under conſideration, the extenſion of the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030041_0041_0FE4120B1EB04708"/>
fever, beyond thoſe who came on board in a debilitated ſtate, did not take place in many inſtances; and the reaſon is evident:—The weather, during the paſſage from Breſt to Louiſburg, was ſo mild, that the port-holes (the windows of a ſhip they might be called) and hatch-ways were permitted to be generally open, by which means a circulation of air was kept up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween decks, and thus the cauſes of infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were, in a great meaſure, carried away. The fine weather, alſo, allowing the men to be chiefly on deck, was another reaſon why the crews were not more ſickly.</p>
            <p>The narrative does not mention the ſtate, nor the number of the ſick during the months of July and Auguſt. It ſays, "On a perdît quelqu'un."</p>
            <p>If this fever had been contagious, ought it not to have ſpread more generally during the ſummer months? "Il repandit tres peu." I preſume that a contagious diſeaſe among ſo many people would have been ſo
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030041_0042_0FE4120CCD778668"/>
generally experienced, that a particular account of it would have been kept, and reported in the general ſtatement.</p>
            <p>To promote the object of the expedition, it was thought neceſſary, ſome time in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, to collect all the men of the fleet, and throw up works, in order to defend the town. The exertions that were made on this occaſion greatly augmented the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſick; and this effect was attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the contagious nature of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. But I apprehend the cauſe to have been <hi>over-fatigue,</hi> and of that ſort to which the men had not been accuſtomed: to which we may add, expoſure to inclement weather, and a ſcarcity of proviſions, and thoſe of a bad quality.</p>
            <p>On the 25th of September, a ſevere gale of wind happened. This neceſſarily occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned a great degree of expoſure, and much fatigue. From theſe cauſes the ſick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more numerous; and the number increaſed till the period of their departure
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030041_0043_0FE4120E763EB030"/>
from Louiſburg, which was on the 30th of October, when fourteen hundred were upon the liſt. Of theſe it was thought that four hundred of the moſt deſperate and hopeleſs caſes ſhould remain at Louiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</p>
            <p>The fleet had not been at ſea more than ſix days before moſt of thoſe who were ill at the time of ſailing, with many others, were dead; and by the time that the fleet arrived at Breſt, which was on the 22d of November, four thouſand ſailors were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined with fever.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the circumſtances of the paſſage, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the ſtate of the men taken on board the fleet; the condition of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, owing to boiſterous weather, which rendered cloſe confinement neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and a proper ventilation impracticable, we need not be ſurpriſed that the fever ſhould have prevailed ſo generally, nor that the mortality ſhould have been ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The air between decks, in a ſtagnant
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030041_0044_0FE4121076AD40E0"/>
ſtate, and in which ſo many ſick were crouded together, could not fail of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming infectious: and the heat, as well as the moiſture, which muſt neceſſarily exiſt in ſuch ſituations, would give a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular activity and virulence to the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And in this way we may account for the propagation and fatal tendency of the diſeaſe, without ſuppoſing it to have had any thing in its nature ſpecifically contagious.</p>
            <p>After the arrival of the fleet at Breſt, the men were placed under circumſtances as little favourable to their recovery, as they were before their debarkation. They were ſent to hoſpitals, too ſmall to contain them, ſave in a ſtate extremely crouded; and there were not attendants in ſufficient number to take proper care of the ſick, and to preſerve cleanlineſs.</p>
            <p>In this ſituation, ſo confined was the air, and ſo impregnated with the foul vapours, ariſing from the ſick, that, on entering the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030041_0045_0FE41213AAFBA598"/>
hoſpital, it is obſerved, a perſon found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſurrounded by an air ſo extremely warm, and poſſeſſing a cadaverous odour, ſo diſagreeable to breathe, that one who had not been accuſtomed to it, could not remain expoſed to its operation but for a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, without feeling a pain in the head.</p>
            <p>When, from the great numbers who died, the hoſpital became ſo thinned, and the ſick ſo few, that they received all the advantages of pure air, good attendance, a due obſervance of cleanlineſs, proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, &amp;c. the progreſs of the diſeaſe was ſoon arreſted, and in a ſhort time it finally diſappeared.</p>
            <p>Now, when the preceding hiſtory is well conſidered, together with the concluſions drawn from the facts therein ſtated, it will appear, that the fever of De la Motte's fleet ought to be arranged under the head of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious</hi> diſeaſes, and not that of a conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:030041_0046_0FE41215CA6A5608"/>
But if it ſhould ſtill be urged, that there was contagion in the caſe, and at the ſame time we admit, (which <hi>facts</hi> compel us to grant) that a free air, and other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, will ſtop the progreſs of a contagious diſeaſe, nay, deſtroy its contagious property, the conceſſion is all we wiſh to obtain, in order to eſtabliſh our doctrine of the nature of <hi>infectious fevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a corroborating fact to our opinion, it will be proper to remark the aſtoniſhing recovery of three hundred and eighty, out of the four hundred worſt caſes, that were left at Louiſburg. The hiſtory of contagious diſorders no where, I believe, furniſhes any thing like a parallel example of ſo large a proportion of ſick getting well.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>'When a malignant fever, in the late war, was brought from England into the hospital at Mahon, the house being insufficient for the reception of so great a number of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, tents were erected in the fields for many of the men. These poor men were thought to be hardly accommodated but it was observed, that most of those who lay in tents recovered; when the mortality in the house was so great, that, in some wards, not one in three escaped,' &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:030041_0047_0FE4121776484D20"/>
We find upon record, numberleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of people having received infection of the moſt ſerious nature, from going out of the healthy air of the common atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, into confined places; ſuch as dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, crouded priſons, or between the decks of veſſels, where fevers have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. But there is not an inſtance within my recollection or obſervation, where a perſon, having imbibed ſuch infection, and where cleanlineſs, keeping the room well aired, and other proper attentions have been obſerved, has communicated the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, either to occaſional viſitors, nurſes, friends, or relatives: and the particulars of Doctor Treat's caſe will furniſh another analogous fact.</p>
            <p>He went on board the Zephyr, and, as his duty required, deſcended into the hold, or between decks, to aſcertain the ſtate of the veſſel, as it regarded infection. In doing this, we will ſuppoſe that he expoſed himſelf to foul and ſtagnant air, rendered
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030041_0048_0FE4121969F5B300"/>
particularly noxious by the exhalations which paſſed off before and immediately after the boy's death.</p>
            <p>A day or two afterwards he began to complain. Where he reſided, there was a family about him. His ſiſter, particularly during his illneſs, was a conſtant attendant at his bed-ſide. His numerous friends were preſſing around him to his laſt moments. Several of them aſſiſted in the execution of the means preſcribed for his relief, when they had direct contact with his body, and were more immediately expoſed to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever aroſe from it:—Yet the fever was in no inſtance communicated to a ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>If, then, the Doctor's diſeaſe had been <hi>ſpecifically</hi> contagious, ought we not to have expected an unequivocal manifeſtation of it, in ſome of thoſe who were placed under circumſtances ſo favourable for receiving contagion?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:030041_0049_0FE4121E24328E48"/>
Many people were confirmed in the opinion, that the fever was contagious, from the vague reports of examples having occurred, where perſons were infected with fever in the country, in conſequence of having had a communication with thoſe who had carried the diſeaſe from the city. Now, I believe, there are not any well au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticated caſes of this ſort: and if a few ſolitary inſtances are offered in ſupport of the contagious nature of the diſeaſe, which, however, are very obſcure, they prove very little when compared with the uniform confinement of the diſorder to thoſe who were immediately expoſed to the firſt cauſes which produced the complaint.</p>
            <p>We have already admitted that the air of a room in which a perſon is lying with a bilious remitting fever, may become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious, if ventilation is not performed; if all excrementitious matter is not ſpeedily removed, and if the bedding and clothing of the patient are not in due time changed.
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030041_0050_0FE4121FEF7523B0"/>
And if the fever has ariſen in the country, in the manner the reports above ſtated ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, I preſume infection has been the cauſe, and not contagion; for all that has hitherto been alledged is, that one or two inſtances have happened, where people have taken the diſeaſe, from the many of thoſe who have ſickened in the country after leaving the city; not that the diſeaſe has ſpread through a neighbourhood or a village.</p>
            <p>I preſume it is ſufficiently proved by this time, that the late epidemic fever was not brought here from abroad; and, alſo, that there exiſts in nature, and that there ought to be made, a diſtinction between <hi>infectious</hi> and <hi>contagious</hi> diſorders. Much more might be ſaid upon theſe ſubjects, and a variety of teſtimony added; but, without fatigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reader, by entering into a farther diſcuſſion of theſe queſtions, I ſhall proceed to enquire into thoſe cauſes which may,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030041_0051_0FE41221E35CEAE0"/>
with great probability, be conſidered as productive of the late epidemic.</p>
            <p>During the months of January and Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary, 1795, the weather was unuſually variable; the loweſt degree to which the thermometer fell was five degrees of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renheit's ſcale, and it roſe as high as forty-ſix degrees.</p>
            <p>The weather of the ſucceeding ſpring, during the months of March and April, was alſo very variable, and was attended with a greater degree of cold and wet than common. This was remarkably evidenced by their effects upon vegetation. Trees put forth their buds, and bloſſomed later, than is uſual in ordinary ſeaſons.</p>
            <p>As the ſeaſon advanced, the weather became warmer; but the moiſture of the air was in no degree diminiſhed. This ſtate of the atmoſphere continued during the ſummer months. The acceſſion of heat was ſlow, but by the latter end of July it became exceſſive, and continued ſo
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030041_0052_0FE4122392C73488"/>
generally during Auguſt and the firſt part of September. The effects of this hot and moiſt air was remarkable in the production of mould.</p>
            <p>It was a very common complaint, that hardly any thing could be kept without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming mouldy. Books, which had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for years in libraries and other places, became covered with this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Shoes and boots, thrown aſide only a day or two, contracted an abundance of mould; and the wooden floors, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered walls of family rooms which were cloſed a few days only, and even in ſome inſtances where the rooms were daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a free acceſs of air, which before had always remained perfectly dry, now generated a great quantity of mould.</p>
            <p>The prevailing conſtitution of the air produced remarkable effects upon cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages. It was obſerved, that this vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grew with uncommon rapidity to its uſual ſize, and with the appearance of
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030041_0053_0FE41228093FFF08"/>
great health and vigour; it would then ſuddenly aſſume an unhealthy aſpect, which, on examination, was found to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon ſome diſeaſe at the juncture of the head with the trunk; and this, on many occaſions, proceeded ſo far as to cauſe a complete ſeparation, and the head would fall to the ground. It was alſo a common obſervation, that the cabbages which were brought to market, were found damaged about the center: and, further, that ſome ſpecies of cabbages would not form into a head as uſual.</p>
            <p>The effects of a peculiar ſeaſon were ſhewn alſo upon different kinds of fruit. It was remarked that cherries did not come to that perfection in which we commonly have them, and that they very ſoon ſhewed a diſpoſition to decay. Early in the ſeaſon the apple-trees were very generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely productive, and promiſed a large ſupply of their fruit in the autumn; but the expectations of the huſbandman on this
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030041_0054_0FE41229E8289420"/>
head were greatly diſappointed: the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples began to fall at leaſt a month before the uſual time, and in a very imperfect ſtate; and thoſe which came to maturity could not be kept ſo long as it is common for them to be preſerved.</p>
            <p>In a letter from John Kemp, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of natural and experimental philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, &amp;c. &amp;c. in Columbia college, dated April 12th, 1796, it is ſtated, "that in his obſervations upon the ſtate of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere during the laſt ſummer, the mercury in the thermometer was, on an average, three degrees of Farenheit's ſcale higher than it has been, at the ſame ſeaſon, during the ten preceding years; that the moiſture, as indicated by the beſt hygrometers, was much greater than uſual; that the quantity of active electricity was ſo ſmall, as to be frequently imperceptible by very ſenſible electrometers, connected with an exploring rod; that the quantity of rain was much greater than uſual, and thunder ſtorms leſs
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030041_0055_0FE4122B9558E3B8"/>
frequent; and that, for the moſt part, the wind was between ſouth-eaſt and north-eaſt."</p>
            <p>The firſt being eſtabliſhed, that the ſtate of the air, during the winter of 1794—5, and particularly during the ſucceeding ſpring and ſummer, has differed very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially from its uſual temperature and diſpoſition, can there be any good reaſon aſſigned why the diſeaſes to which our cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate is liable in a greater or leſs degree, every ſeaſon, ſhould not receive a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar character,</hi> or be variouſly modified by a peculiarity of weather? The influence of climate upon the human conſtitution has been remarked in all ages; and not a year paſſes that we do not hear of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſeaſes, being attended with ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common appearances, ariſing from pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity of ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>At a meeting of the Medical Society of the State of New-York, held on the ſecond Tueſday in July, it was remarked by one
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030041_0056_0FE4122D868138E0"/>
of the members, that he had ſeen ſeveral caſes of angina trachealis, which were attended with anomalous ſymptoms, and alſo a few caſes of dyſentery in adults, which proved obſtinate: and as theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes were not unſual at that ſeaſon of the year, he concluded that they would become epidemic, or be found the forerunner of one. He was led to this opinion from the hiſtory of epidemics; diſeaſes of that kind being almoſt always anticipated by ſome particular previous diſorder: and he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remarked, that there was ſomething in the ſtate of the air which prediſpoſed to complaints.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time it was obſerved by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther member, that he had alſo ſeen ſeveral caſes of angina trachealis, and he found the diſeaſe attended with leſs danger of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation than uſual. Bleeding ſerved ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a check to the ſymptoms than to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford that manifeſt advantage which is its effect on common occaſions. The diſeaſe
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030041_0057_0FE412302CFEF390"/>
yielded to emetics, warm bathing, moderate bleeding, and liberal bowels.</p>
            <p>It was further remarked, that febrile complaints had occurred more frequently than uſual at that ſeaſon, and eſpecially among children; and that in the uſe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonials, the evacuations were extremely bilious in their appearance. From what had been obſerved, therefore, there would remain little doubt that there was ſome circumſtance in the ſeaſon, which prediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to complaint, and on many occaſions attended with a ſuperabundance of bile.</p>
            <p>Several members of the ſociety had met with inſtances of cholera, and alſo with obſtinate conſtipation of the bowels. It was alſo noticed, that the diarrhoea and dyſentery, to which children are ſo liable here in the ſummer ſeaſon, and which is ſometimes a cauſe of great mortality among them, were very rare diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>The Medical Society came to a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be particular in noticing the diſeaſes
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030041_0058_0FE4123266D68910"/>
which might take place in the interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the then preſent meeting and their next monthly meeting. But the report of a <hi>contagious yellow fever,</hi> which began to prevail in the city about the 25th of July, was a cauſe of ſo much hurry and haſty declaration of opinions, that a compariſon of notes, and a friendly diſcuſſion of a queſtion of ſo much importance, at the time appointed, was entirely ſuperſeded. But, however widely individuals differed in ſentiment on this intereſting occaſion, it is but juſtice to mention, that no exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were wanting, on either ſide of the queſtion, to leſſen the calamity with which our city was threatened.</p>
            <p>If we carefully peruſe the hiſtory of diſeaſes, we ſhall find, that thoſe which have proved moſt fatal to the human race, have proceeded, either directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, from ſome acknowledged peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſtate of the air.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:030041_0059_0FE4123455546748"/>
Of this truth, every author, who has written on epidemic diſeaſes, bears abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant teſtimony: and notwithſtanding that ſome countries are more expoſed to changes than others, few have been found altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exempted. Nor can it be expected, from the nature of things, that the people of North-America, who inhabit a climate which may be ſaid to participate of all the climates in the world, ſhould not, in their turn, experience the operation of ſimilar cauſes.</p>
            <p>In order the better to underſtand why the fever aroſe in a particular part of the city, and was more prevalent, as well as malignant, in that part, it will be neceſſary to take a general view of the ſituation of New-York, and the diſpoſition of the ground.</p>
            <p>New-York is ſituated in north latitude forty degrees and an half, longitude ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four degrees weſt from the meridian of London. It is built on a ſouth-weſt point
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030041_0060_0FE4123602DD8540"/>
of land, the higheſt elevation of which, above the level of high water mark, is near forty feet, and which is continued, through the city, near a mile lengthways. From this elevation in the original ſtate of the ground, there was a pretty bold deſcent continued, in oppoſite ways, to the water's edge. But it has been the policy of the corporation of this city, at different times, to make <hi>new ground,</hi> as it is called, or to ſell to others the privilege of doing ſo; which has conſiderably increaſed the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of the city, both on the eaſt ſide, and on the north.</p>
            <p>The new made ground is nearly a level, or the deſcent is ſo gradual, that it is drained with difficulty; and we may add, that the level of the new made ground is but very little above the mark of high water. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is ſometimes entirely overflowed by the ſpring tides; and from the looſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ground, the water frequently finds its way into the cellars of the houſes
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030041_0061_0FE4123A1BA894E8"/>
in Front and Water ſtreets, and ſometimes even into thoſe of Pearl-ſtreet.</p>
            <p>The new made ground from Whitehall to Catharine-ſtreet, along the Eaſt-river, is, on an average, four hundred feet in breadth, creating, if one may ſo ſpeak, fifty acres of ground, all of which is built upon. The ground made on the weſt ſide of the city is about ten acres. The conſequences of this mode of extending the city are, no doubt, extremely injurious to the health of the inhabitants; and it is much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted, that meaſures are not taken to prevent an increaſe of the evil: for we ſhall preſently ſee, that the late epidemic was rendered particularly malignant and fatal, from cauſes ariſing in this plan of inlarging the city. To render this appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, we muſt take a more particular ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of that part of the city where the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic firſt made its appearance.</p>
            <p>We ſhall begin at the river on the eaſt ſide of Peck-ſlip: from thence to Water-ſtreet
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030041_0062_0FE4123BDD326550"/>
the ground is nearly a level: proceed up the ſlip, and after leaving Water-ſtreet a few paces, the ground aſcends until you arrive at Pearl (late Queen) ſtreet: from this to Dover-ſtreet the ground is riſing, but gradually deſcends again as you proceed along Cherry-ſtreet as far as Rooſevelt-ſtreet: from this to the New-ſlip it is nearly a level. The ground at the top of Dover-ſtreet may be conſidered as the higheſt ſpot in the range between Peck and the New-ſlip, by the way of Pearl and Cherry ſtreets, and extending eaſt and weſt, maintains a general height, which may be computed at fifteen, twelve, ten, &amp;c. feet above the level of Water-ſtreet.</p>
            <p>The houſes on the high grounds are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally three ſtories high, and built of brick, between which and thoſe lowly ſituated on the north ſide of Water-ſtreet, there is a ſpace of ground conſtituting the different yards of the above houſes, meaſuring about one hundred feet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:030041_0063_0FE4123DD18AD458"/>
Water-ſtreet, extending from Peck to New-ſlip, in many places has been raiſed two feet, or more, above the ordinary level of the ground on the north ſide of the ſtreet. From thoſe grounds to the river there are no drains to convey off the water, &amp;c. which renders an accumulation of filth, in the rear of the houſes upon thoſe lots, almoſt a neceſſary conſequence. Water will frequently become ſtagnant, and this containing animal and vegetable matters, expoſed to a hot ſun, muſt prove a fruitful ſource of noxious vapours. Under theſe circumſtances, it is natural to expect that thoſe who are expoſed to the influence of ſuch foul air, ſhould feel its effects, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a ſtate of prediſpoſition, ariſing from a peculiar conſtitution of the air.</p>
            <p>The grounds on the ſouth of Cherry-ſtreet are ſo arranged, that they are more immediately expoſed to the ſun; for they may be conſidered as on the ſouth ſide of a conſiderable hill; and no one is ignorant
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030041_0064_0FE4123F80171DF8"/>
of the powerful effects which the ſun pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces on a ſurface of this expoſure.</p>
            <p>In a very correct map of this city, by Benjamin Taylor, it will appear, that a line drawn from Whitehall to the bottom of Dover-ſtreet, will run in the direction of north-eaſt; and from the bottom of Dover-ſtreet to Corle's-hook, the courſe is nearly eaſt. An attention to this fact, alſo, is of conſequence, if it produces the effect upon the tides it is ſaid to do, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that of creating different eddies, which furniſh a vaſt quantity of floating, periſhable matter, to the ſlips in the vicinity of the ground which we have been deſcribing.</p>
            <p>From this arrangement of the ſhores along the Eaſt-river, the ſalutary effects of thoſe winds which blow during the hot months, from the different points of the compaſs, between ſouth-weſt and north-eaſt, and which ſo often afford refreſhment to the inhabitants of the elevated ſituations, and at the weſt end of the town, are little
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030041_0065_0FE4124243034D20"/>
or not at all experienced by thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide at the eaſt end: for the air is ſo chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its temperature and qualities, before it arrives there, by paſſing over a large part of the city, that it loſes that vivifying principle ſo eſſential to health.</p>
            <p>From all theſe circumſtances it is plainly diſcoverable, that the ſouth-eaſt part of the city is placed under circumſtances not very conducive to the health of its inhabitants; eſpecially as a great number of them are of the poorer kind, and in many places very much crouded together in ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined apartments. To ſtrengthen this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I will give an extract of a letter from a gentleman of great candour and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability in the neighbourhood of Dover-ſtreet:—<q>Although the docks in the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the ſtore which I occupy may be leſs offenſive than in many other parts of the city, yet many of them are in a very exceptionable ſituation. The pond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of water, by running a bulk-head
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030041_0066_0FE412447ADB8CF8"/>
acroſs an unfiniſhed dock, and leaving the vacancy, for ſeveral years, to be filled with every ſpecies of filth and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable matter, is an object worthy the attention of the police. The ſituation of the grounds between Water and Cherry ſtreets is rendered very noxious, by Water-ſtreet being raiſed above a certain level, and thus preventing thoſe grounds from being drained. The effect of ſuch a nuiſance on the health of the inhabitants of a crouded part of the city cannot be imaginary.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is not to be underſtood, that the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a place is always to determine its temperature; nor is it uniform in giving a ſimilar character to the diſeaſes moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent under a ſimilar parallel. Local cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will have a much more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful operation, and, in general, are found to produce the characteriſtic diſtinctions which exiſt between the prevalent diſeaſes
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030041_0067_0FE412466B37BC68"/>
of countries upon or near the ſame line of latitude.</p>
            <p>The country bordering upon the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt, from the Province of Main to the Neverſink, or Highlands of Shrewſbury, is rough and irregular, and almoſt every where covered with hardy oaks and hick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories; and the ſoil is generally as irregular as the face of the country. Moſt of the different capitals, on the coaſt, are ſituated upon eminences, or high ground, and ſo near the ſea, that the rapid currents which waſh their harbours, may be conſidered almoſt as pure as the ſea itſelf; and this is particularly the caſe with the harbour of New-York.</p>
            <p>The nearneſs of New-York to the ſea, the ready acceſs which the tides have to its harbour, and the elevation and boldneſs of the ſhores, muſt doubtleſs be a great ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the health of the inhabitants. I believe it may be ſaid, with great truth, that few cities enjoy ſo many natural ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030041_0068_0FE412481A1692D8"/>
ariſing from ſituation, as New-York; and I make no doubt, that a vigilant and determined police would render it as healthy a city as any under the ſun.</p>
            <p>The country, on the ſea-coaſt, for many hundred miles to the weſt and ſouth of the Highlands of Neverſink, is low, with very few elevations, and thoſe not conſiderable. The principal cities are moſtly ſituated at a diſtance from the ſea, and on the margin of ſome river, the navigable waters of which are a mixture of freſh and ſalt water; and the freſhets which take place in thoſe rivers, at particular ſeaſons of the year, often overflow their banks, and have, no doubt, a conſiderable agency in produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the epidemic diſeaſes which ſo often prevail in thoſe climates, of which Doctor Jackſon has given a very particular and intereſting deſcription. <q>We learn from experience (ſays the Doctor) that fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are little known in rough and hilly countries, where waters flow with a rapid
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030041_0069_0FE4124C504BEFA0"/>
courſe: while we alſo know, that they are common in low and champaign countries, where water ſtagnates, or has only a ſluggiſh motion. Independent of which, thoſe ſituations which are in the neighbourhood of large ſwamps, or near the oozy banks of large rivers, have always been obſerved to be particularly liable to ſuch diſeaſes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Winterbotham, on the climate of North-Carolina, remarks, that "in the flat coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, near the ſea-coaſt, the inhabitants, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſummer and autumn, are ſubject to intermitting fevers, which often prove fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, as bilious or nervous ſymptoms prevail. Theſe fevers are ſeldom immediately dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the natives who are temperate, or to ſtrangers who are prudent. They, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if ſuffered to continue any length of time, bring on other diſorders, which greatly impair the natural vigour of the mind, debilitate the conſtitution, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in death. The countenances of the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030041_0070_0FE4124E0AF58AC0"/>
inhabitants, during theſe ſeaſons, have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally a pale yellowiſh caſt, occaſioned by the prevalence of bilious ſymptoms. They have very little of the bloom and freſhneſs of the people in the northern ſtates."</p>
            <p>The plague, which often rages in Egypt, appears, upon good authority, to be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by ſimilar cauſes. <q>En Egypte ou' la peſte eſt trois, ou quatre mois l'année, a cauſe des diſbordmens du Nil. Leur mauvais effet, ſe fait ſurtout ſentir, quand un vent chaud &amp; humide, ſouffle, ou being quand il eſt mêlé avec des vapeurs corrompues.</q> The effect of low ſituations, attended with moiſture, in producing fever, is well illuſtrated in the following detail:—"In the year 1748, upon the breaking up of the Britiſh camp in Flanders, the cavalry were cantoned upon the unhealthy ground, about Bois le Duc, and were ſoon after attacked with a general ſickneſs, occaſioned by a late inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that part of the country. Doctor
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030041_0071_0FE41250000687E0"/>
Horne, then ſurgeon to Cope's dragoons, obſerves (Diſſertat. Medica. Inaug. de Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre Remittente) that the troops ſuffered in proportion to their proximity to the marſhes; and that, univerſally, the nearer to Bois le Duc, the more violent was the diſtemper; the number of ſick, by very accurate obſervations, being found exactly to correſpond with the dampneſs of their ſituations and of the air.</p>
            <p>To put the matter beyond all doubt, this ingenious gentleman provided himſelf with a good <hi>hydroſcope,</hi> by which he carefully meaſured, every day, the degree of moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and dryneſs of the air.</p>
            <p>Upon comparing his tables with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter he kept of the ſick, he found that the progreſs of the diſeaſe kept an exact pace with the humidity of the air.</p>
            <p>On the 29th of June they left the camp, and from that day to the 12th of July, the air being dry, not one ſoldier was affected with an ailment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:030041_0072_0FE41251AA776620"/>
On the evening of the 20th, the <hi>hygro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter</hi> indicated a great degree of moiſture in the air; and that very night the epidemic ſickneſs (<abbr>viz.</abbr> the remittent fever) began among the troops, three dragoons of Cope's regiment being ſeized with it.</p>
            <p>During eight days afterwards the air continued extremely moiſt, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſick was proportionably increaſed. The ten following days being dryer, the number of the infected viſibly diminiſhed: but two very moiſt days ſucceeding, the patients were again greatly increaſed.</p>
            <p>In a word, the ſame quality of the air which differently affected the inſtrument, did alſo, every day, in like manner, affect the health of the men.</p>
            <p>Sir John Pringle, on the diſeaſes of the army, has alſo the following obſervations. Speaking of the diſeaſes of the low and marſhy parts of the Netherlands, which are conſiderably to the northward of our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; "It is to be remarked, (ſays he)
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030041_0073_0FE4125612191E20"/>
that the ſickneſs never begins till the heats have continued ſo long as to give time for putrefaction, and evaporation of the water; the commencement, therefore, of the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics, may be dated from ſome time in July, or the beginning of Auguſt, under the canicular heats; their ſenſible decline about the falling of the leaf; and end when the froſt begins."</p>
            <p>Speaking of the garriſon of Ghent, he obſerves,—"The battalion of the guards was a remarkable inſtance of the difference of quarters: two of its companies were ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned on St. Peter's hill; the remaining eight in the lower part of the town, in rooms ſo very damp, that the men could hardly keep their ſhoes and belts from moulding. In the month of July, the ſick of this one battalion amounted to about one hundred and forty; of which number only two men belonged to the companies on the hill, and all the reſt to thoſe in the lower town. But in the middle of Auguſt,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030041_0074_0FE41257EF9B58F0"/>
upon changing the barracks, the ſickneſs ſuddenly abated."</p>
            <p>Can any thing ſhew more ſatisfactorily than this ſhort deſcription of Sir John Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, the unfailing influence of ſituations in determining the extent of diſeaſes under particular conſtitutions of the atmoſphere? And might not any one ſuppoſe, that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Horne's hydroſcopical obſervations were made in New-York, during the prevalence of the late epidemic? For my part, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refrain from comparing Broadway, and the higher ſituations of New-York, to St. Peter's hill; and the upper end of Water-ſtreet, to the lower part of the city of Ghent.</p>
            <p>It is a fact, then, well eſtabliſhed, that while an epidemic has raged among the inhabitants of flat and low ſituations, thoſe who have lived on high grounds, in the neighbourhood, have not, in the ſmalleſt degree, felt its influence: but they need only deſcend to the low ground, and they
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030041_0075_0FE41259E47E73F8"/>
will there ſicken in common with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
            <p>If the preceding circumſtances are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, they afford a ſufficient explanation why the effects of the late epidemic were ſo partially felt by the inhabitants of this city.</p>
            <p>It will be proper to remark here, that the epidemic of laſt year is not a new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. It is eſtabliſhed upon reſpectable authority, that a diſorder, in every reſpect ſimilar to the one which made its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this city in July laſt, and in one inſtance attended with the ſymptom of black vomiting, occurred in Water-ſtreet, in the neighbourhood of Dover-ſtreet, four or five years ago, and more or leſs every year ſince; and was particularly confined to that part of the city: but being unaided by a particular ſtate of the air, and under the influence, perhaps, of exciting cauſes of a leſs active nature, it was neither ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally felt, nor ſo fatal in its operation.</p>
            <p>Agreeably to this opinion is the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030041_0076_0FE4125B92376FD8"/>
contained in a letter we before have had occaſion to quote; the author of which obſerves,—<q>I am convinced that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order has originated from local cauſes, becauſe it has appeared in this quarter of the city, at the ſame ſeaſon, for ſeveral years paſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor has this diſeaſe been confined to New-York. It is a fact beyond contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, that during the warmer parts of the year 1795, a fever, in all eſſential circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances reſembling the epidemic of this place, appeared in many places in this ſtate and in the ſtate of Connecticut. The ſame cauſes, we ſhould naturally expect, would produce ſimilar effects. Accordingly, we have it upon the evidence of ſeveral very reſpectable characters, that a peculiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the air, the ſenſible qualities of which were <hi>exceſſive heat and moiſture,</hi> was generally prevalent. This ſtate of the atmoſphere, operating with the exhalations ariſing from the decompoſition of dead
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030041_0077_0FE4125E37BD2658"/>
animal and vegetable matters, in low and damp ſituations, were a frequent cauſe of bilious remitting fever.</p>
            <p>In confirmation of this truth, we are fortunate in being enabled to preſent our readers with the following intereſting communication from Doctor Williams.</p>

                  <p>As near as I can recollect, there are at Whitehall, formerly called Skeenſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, about two hundred and eighty fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; out of which, and tranſient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, there died, from the firſt of July to the laſt of October, about twenty of a bilious fever.</p>
                  <p>In the town of Hampton, which lies ſouth-eaſt, and adjoining Whitehall, containing about one hundred families, five died of bilious fever. In Weſtfield and Greenfield about twenty-four died, two thirds of a bilious fever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="unknown:030041_0078_0FE412609428CFF8"/>
That part of the town of Whitehall where the deaths in general happened, is by the ſide of Wood-Creek, where there are low marſhy grounds and dead waters. New comers to this place are commonly attacked with bilious or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent fevers. But the laſt year, by reaſon of continued hot and dry weather ſucceeding an uncommon wet ſpring, ſome of the old ſettlers were likewiſe attacked with theſe complaints.</p>
                  <p>It was obſerved that the lowneſs of the waters had expoſed, more than common, dead vegetable matter to the action of the ſun; and thus the exhalations did not conſiſt of watery vapours only, but of a putrid effluvia, ariſing from the decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of dead vegetable matter, and innumerable inſects, which are always found in ſuch ſituations.</p>
                  <p>About the year 1788, at the town of Hebern, ſouth and adjoining Grenville, a mill was erected on a dead creek. The
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030041_0079_0FE412628874FA60"/>
waters in conſequence ſpread over the flat grounds for near three miles in length. This cauſed, in the hot ſeaſons, a fourth of the inhabitants adjoining this water, to be attacked with bilious fever.</p>
                  <p>About ſix years ſince, in the town of Argyle, an obſtruction of water was cauſed as above, ſo that three hundred acres of land were overflowed. This oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, the firſt year, ſlight bilious and intermitting fevers. The ſecond year, when part of the land before covered with water became dry, and was expoſed to the ſun, the complaints became putrid in their tendency, and numbers died. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the following winter, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the place again became heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and ſo remains.</p>
                  <p>It is to be remarked, that the laſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer produced more ſickneſs than was ever known in that country, except in the year 1788; when, at the latter part of July, there happened a great flood, which
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030041_0080_0FE412644F595240"/>
was followed by a great drought. The heat of laſt ſummer was acknowledged by all to have been much greater than in former ſeaſons. The water of Saratoga lake, in Saratoga county, was very low, and the colour exceeding green.</p>
                  <p>From Lanſingburgh, northerly, along the banks of the river Hudſon, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants were generally attacked with bilious fever; moſt of which, without timely care, became putrid. At Schoch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticook, a town about a mile to the eaſt of Hudſon river, and upon the banks of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack river, heretofore healthy, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were generally attacked with bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious fever, and ſome died.</p>
                  <p>Although I have attended numbers, and frequently remained days and nights with the ſick, I never felt any bad effects from it. But I have obſerved, that, if the nurſes came from ſituations not ſo much expoſed to bilious complaints, it was not uncommon for them to be taken ſick.</p>

The exiſtence of a bilious remittent fever, reſembling the late epidemic of this place, at a diſtance from the city, is further confirmed by the teſtimony of a gentleman, of high eſtimation, and extenſive practice in his profeſſion, in the city of Hartford, in the ſtate of Connecticut, who writes, in a letter to Doctor Wright Poſt, dated January 12th, 1796, as follows:—</p>
            <q>
               <p>This epidemic (the dyſentery) was by no means a partial one; it ſpread over the whole city, and continued until about the beginning of October, when it gave way to the introduction of the bilious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent, which has, as yet, ſcarcely left us, though for a month or ſix weeks paſt, the caſes have been few and trifling. This, although not ſo prevalent as the dyſentery, ſpread over particular parts of the town, and many of the caſes were obſtinate and lengthy.</p>
               <p>The weather, eſpecially in Auguſt and September, while the dyſentery prevailed,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030041_0082_0FE41269B4381E48"/>
was very ſingular, ſuch as is without a ſimilar inſtance in the recollection of the oldeſt perſons; I mean particularly as it reſpected the <hi>deluging rains,</hi> which fell ſo frequently in the courſe of theſe two months. Every two or three days, a fall of rain, which generally laſted about ſix hours, would deluge the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; inſomuch that moſt of the vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, plants, graſs, &amp;c. in the vallies, where vegetation was much the moſt rapid, were killed and ſwept away, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained among ſtagnant waters. In many places the air became highly offenſive, and wholly unfit for reſpiration. Theſe heavy rains were ſucceeded, almoſt without an exception, by uncommonly hot ſuns; hence the whole atmoſphere was impregnated with exhalations, from putrid vegetables, and more eſpecially in the neighbourhood of rivers and vallies.</p>
               <p>The effect of local ſituation was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly obſervable in this place; I mean
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030041_0083_0FE4126BAA72BEB8"/>
as it reſpects the bilious remittent. Between our front ſtreet and the river, a diſtance of about forty rods, the ground is much lower than on each ſide. This extends about half a mile in length, with ſeveral interruptions, by ſtreets being built acroſs it. It was about this place, and on the banks of a little river which runs through a part of the town, that this diſeaſe was moſtly confined; <hi>and this I find was generally the caſe in the moſt ſickly parts of the ſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will relate to you the ſituation of one family, which was the moſt remarkable of the whole. Some time in the month of September, I was called to viſit a young man, about eighteen years old, in a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſkirts of this town. He was violently attacked with moſt of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic ſymptoms of the yellow fever, as deſcribed by Ruſh. The next day a ſecond was taken in the ſame manner; and on the morning of the third day,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030041_0084_0FE4126D57398E80"/>
three more were taken ſick. This led me to ſuſpect ſome particular cauſe. I ſearched for it in vain at that time. The next morning, on paſſing through the kitchen, I ſmelt ſomething that was very offenſive, which none of the family had noticed. On opening the cellar-door, I found that it proceeded from the cellar. Two perſons went down to examine, and found in one corner of a ſmall tight room, a quantity of June cabbages, on which the ſun had ſhone about three hours in the day. They had rotted, and ſunk down into a lump of putrefaction. They run a ſtick under them, and lifted them up, and there immediately iſſued ſuch an intolerable ſtench, as obliged them inſtantly to leave the cellar. A vomiting was brought on at once, which laſted them nearly an hour. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the doors and windows of the cellar were thrown open, it was two days before they could clear it out. No
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030041_0085_0FE41270ACAA99D0"/>
other perſon in the family was taken afterwards, and thoſe who were already ſeized, all recovered.</p>
               <p>Here was the ſame diſeaſe, excited by the ſame cauſe which produces it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and that cauſe detected. Why may we not ſuppoſe, that if this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance had taken place in a thickly inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited neighbourhood, prepared by prediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and aided by all thoſe cauſes which generally exiſt during the hot ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in populous places, that it would have ſpread with the ſame rapidity it did in New-York or in Philadelphia? I confeſs the conjecture appears to me a rational one, and ought, at leaſt, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our attention.</p>
            </q>
            <p>We cannot forbear to remark on the facts contained in the above letters, how analogous the circumſtances were, under which the bilious fever aroſe in different parts of the country: and by comparing theſe facts, more eſpecially as they relate
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:030041_0086_0FE412725A17AC18"/>
to the city of Hartford, with what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in this place, we ſee a very ſtrong analogy indeed. Now, were it neceſſary to inlarge any further upon the ſubject of imported contagion, we might, with great propriety, adduce the exiſtence and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a fever at Hartford, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the family ſo particularly mentioned, the ſame as our late epidemic, which no one ever entertained a ſuſpicion to have ariſen from any cauſes than thoſe <hi>perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly local.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be difficult to aſcertain with accuracy, what proportion the different deſcriptions of people bear to one another, who were attacked with the late epidemic fever. It may be taken for granted, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, upon the teſtimony of thoſe whoſe opportunities beſt enabled them to judge, that the number that were taken ſick, living on the new made ground, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at the ſouth ſide of the city, and in other low places, compared with thoſe
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030041_0087_0FE412744DD3BBE0"/>
reſiding in more elevated ſituations, may be computed as twenty to one; and if we were to make a calculation of the number of inhabitants who died, compared with viſitors, or tranſient perſons, we might ſay five of the latter to one of the former.</p>
            <p>This diſproportion may be accounted for: firſtly; viſitors, eſpecially thoſe from the northward, where the air is generally purer, are more ſuſceptible of an epidemic influence than the inhabitants, who are accuſtomed to the circumſtances of their ſituation: for there cannot remain a doubt, that the human conſtitution acquires, by habit, the power of reſiſting, to a certain degree, the effects of thoſe cauſes which have a tendency to produce diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>We find this fact particularly noticed by moſt writers on the bilious or yellow fever, which ſo commonly makes its appearance on board the ſhipping in the different har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the Weſt-Indies. It is deſcribed as moſt fatal to thoſe lately from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:030041_0088_0FE412ABD48BAC90"/>
latitudes. So, in New-York, the firſt appearance of the fever was on board the ſhip William, from Liverpool, the 25th of July, four of whoſe crew died. On the 26th of July the fever appeared in the ſhip Connecticut, from Liverpool: ſhe alſo loſt four of her men. Theſe veſſels, it muſt be remarked, laid at the wharfs in front of that part of Water-ſtreet, where the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe firſt appeared among the inhabitants. Their men, without doubt, were frequently on ſhore, and having lately arrived, were more ſuſceptible of the cauſes producing the fever, than the reſidents of that ſituation, who had become gradually habituated to its action.</p>
            <p>The men of many other veſſels from the northward, which were ſtationed at different wharfs in the eaſt river, felt more or leſs the effects of the epidemic influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: whereas the crews of thoſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels which arrived during the ſummer months from the Weſt-Indies, and other
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:030041_0089_0FE4127DC54D25B0"/>
warm latitudes, all remained well; and ſuch individuals among them as had been ſick on their paſſage, recovered very ſoon after their arrival in this harbour.</p>
            <p>Secondly; of the viſitors who were ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the epidemic fever, a great propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were emigrants from England, Ireland and Scotland; and they were more expoſed to its effects from the very crouded and confined ſituations in which they were unavoidably placed.</p>
            <p>The miſerable condition of that claſs of unfortunate people, is well ſhown in a candid and very intereſting communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Rev. Mr. O'Brien, paſtor to the Catholic congregation in this city, from which the following is an extract:—</p>
            <p>
               <q>As ſoon as the above cauſes had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced their malignant effects in the part of the city which was previouſly diſpoſed to receive them, I was conſtantly employed, inſomuch that I might with ſome truth ſay, that I lived in the centre of the diſeaſe;
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:030041_0090_0FE4127FB26CC870"/>
and for nearly two months, never laid in bed one whole night. I found in moſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, a total want of every neceſſary of life. Numbers of poor ſufferers, confined in ſubterraneous apartments, which admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no light, but from their hatch-doors; ſo that when ſhut down at night, it might literally be ſaid of them that they were buried alive. In the progreſs of viſiting the ſick, I was much diſguſted at the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, uncleanly ſtate of their miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble habitations, and a total want of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries: for in moſt places, they had not even a ſtool to ſit on, nor a bed to lie upon. On inquiry, I found the much greater part of them to be emigrants of that very ſummer; inſomuch that out of four hundred and ſixty-two of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, who ſunk under the diſorder, nineteen twentieths were totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this deplorable condition of the poor emigrants who arrived in this city during
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030041_0091_0FE4128161109598"/>
the prevalence of the epidemic fever, is to be aſcribed, humanly ſpeaking, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of its mortality. It is a circumſtance, moreover, well known to many, that numbers of them were obliged to remain on board ſhip for ſome time after their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in this port, as well from their want of means to procure comfortable lodgings, as from the very crouded ſtate of the city; and at laſt they exchanged their confined holds for thoſe ſubterraneous apartments which have juſt been ſo emphatically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Mr. O'Brien. This may account for the fact, that out of nearly eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perſons who died, not more than one hundred and fifty were citizens of New-York; and of this number but a ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion until the diſeaſe had prevailed a conſiderable time, perhaps one half during the laſt four weeks.</p>
            <p>If the above ſtatement be true, what a leſſon does it convey, as well to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as to the magiſtracy! Ought it not
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030041_0092_0FE4128427481760"/>
to inſpire the citizens with a proper degree of confidence, and ſtimulate thoſe who have the regulation of our city police to adopt ſuch meaſures as are within their authority, in order to obviate, as far as poſſible, the fatal effects of another viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>I ſhall now diſmiſs this part of the ſubject, in order to lay before my readers the ſymptoms which ſerved to character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize the fever in queſtion, as far as they came under my obſervation.</p>
            <p>The firſt and the moſt conſtant of theſe, as well as the moſt ſevere, was a pain ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily fixed in the fore part of the head; and this was uſually attended with a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed redneſs of the eyes, and a pain in the back. Theſe ſymptoms have been known to exiſt, in a moderate degree, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days previous to the attack of fever.</p>
            <p>A ſenſe of coldneſs did not always take place at the beginning of the fever; and
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:030041_0093_0FE4128638A6DE60"/>
much leſs frequently was any thing like rigors experienced. The loſs of ſtrength, alſo, in the beginning, was very variable. Many did not complain of any particular weakneſs; whilſt others felt ſo great a degree of proſtration, as to be unable to ſupport themſelves.</p>
            <p>The patients ſometimes complained of a general ſoreneſs of the muſcles, and particularly thoſe of the thighs and legs; and in ſome this affection continued a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome ſymptom.</p>
            <p>It did not frequently happen that the ſtomach was much affected at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the diſeaſe; yet inſtances occurred where the fever was uſhered in with great ſickneſs, frequent retchings to vomit, oppreſſion and pain about the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia, with exceſſive anxiety and reſtleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>The tongue often at firſt appeared na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but it moſt commonly looked white. After the fever had continued ſome days,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:030041_0094_0FE412882EC7EBF0"/>
the matter collected upon its ſurface, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a brown colour, but continued moiſt. At length it became dark, ſometimes black, dry, and rough.</p>
            <p>The pulſe was generally frequent at the beginning of the fever, but varied, as to fulneſs and ſtrength, according to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and conſtitution of the patient. It ſometimes happened, after the fever had made conſiderable progreſs, that the pulſe remitted, and was commonly a ſymptom of great danger. A rare pulſe, alſo, was in ſome inſtances met with. In a boy who had had the fever ſix or ſeven days, and in whom the number of pulſations in a minute had been, for the moſt part, about one hundred and twenty, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency was ſuddenly diminiſhed, and did not exceed fifty-five ſtrokes in a minute. In this ſtate they continued, with very little variation, for two days, while the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient appeared to be getting well. The pulſe then ſuddenly became as frequent
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030041_0095_0FE41289DBBAD0E0"/>
as before, and two days after the acceſſion, he died. It happened alſo in the inſtance of a gentleman, whoſe attack was very violent; whoſe pulſe was frequent, full, and ſtrong, and who had been freely and repeatedly bled; that after eight days, the number of pulſations were reduced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the uſual ſtandard, and ſeemed to be attended with a general change for the better. Theſe appearances; however, were fallacious: a recurrence of violent ſymptoms ſoon put a fatal termination to the diſeaſe. The ſame circumſtance we find taken notice of by Doctor Hunter and others.</p>
            <p>Yellowneſs of the ſkin was by no means a conſtant concomitant of the diſeaſe. Sometimes it appeared partially about the face and neck; at other times a little tinge of the eyes was the only yellowneſs to be obſerved. In ſome inſtances it made its appearance about the third day, but more commonly not until the fifth, ſixth, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030041_0096_0FE4128D8CBF9878"/>
day. When it came on early, it was generally attended with violent ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and denoted danger: and yet pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients recovered, whoſe ſkin was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally as yellow as ſaffron.</p>
            <p>The temperature of the ſkin varied very conſiderably. In ſome caſes it was hot and dry, and communicated a very diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ſenſation to the touch. In others it was moiſt and cool from the firſt attack, and continued ſo during the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Although the fever frequently ran high, it was ſeldom attended with much thirſt; except in ſome few caſes, where it was difficult to ſatisfy the demands of the ſick for drink.</p>
            <p>When the pain in the head was very conſiderable, the eyes were commonly a good deal inflamed, ſuffuſed with tears, and very impatient of light: and it now and then happened, that the patients com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of a ſenſation, as if the eyes were endeavouring to eſcape from the ſockets.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:030041_0097_0FE4128F39C3B458"/>
The reſpiration was ſeldom much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the beginning. On ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, however, it was difficult, attended with a ſenſe of fulneſs in the cheſt, which was ſometimes a cauſe of great anxiety, and frequent deep ſighing. Doctor Hunter obſerves, that <q>there is no difficulty in diſtinguiſhing thoſe ſymptoms from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious reſpiration, that depends upon a local affection of the lungs. In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the difficulty of breathing is uniform; whereas, in the former, both the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inſpirations will, for two or three times, be natural and eaſy, and immediately after become laborious and unequal, and ſo on, alternately.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The urine, in general, underwent very little change. It was ſometimes a little increaſed in quantity, and at other times ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diminiſhed. But in thoſe caſes where the ſkin became yellow, the urine put on that dark brown appearance which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030041_0098_0FE4129130E2D0F8"/>
in diffuſions of bile. In ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of black vomiting, and in two or three caſes, previous to the occurrence of that ſymptom, the urine became exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly turbid, and depoſited a dark coloured matter.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the ordinary train of ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which attended the fever, we have endeavoured to deſcribe; and though in particular caſes, no doubt, ſome deviations might be noticed, yet it is believed there were none which could be thought to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect eſſentially the character of the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>In the treatment of the late epidemic fever, my firſt care was to have the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient placed in a room as large, and well ventilated as poſſible. The advantages ariſing from an attention to this part of practice, muſt appear obvious to all who reflect, that while a cauſe which may have produced a diſeaſe continues to act, or while circumſtances exiſt, which tend very much to aggravate the ſymptoms, the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030041_0099_0FE41292DD51EBA0"/>
efficacy of our remedies is rendered, if not of no avail, at leaſt extremely doubtful.</p>
            <p>When the patient was placed in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as eligible as could be procured, the leading object was to evacuate the ſtomach and bowels. If this important point could be effected at the firſt attack, it was often found to cut ſhort the courſe of the diſeaſe: and when it did not do this, it for the moſt part rendered the ſubſequent ſymptoms ſo moderate, that they more readily yielded to the means of art.</p>
            <p>In general it was not thought of much conſequence, what purgative medicine was uſed, except in inſtances where the ſtomach ſhewed ſigns of particular diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. A ſolution of ſalts and manna, in ſuch doſes as circumſtances ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, was very commonly preſcribed. In moſt caſes it ſat eaſy upon the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; and even when the firſt doſes were rejected, by perſevering in its uſe, in final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſed downwards, and, upon the whole,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030041_0100_0FE4129699EF9E30"/>
was found to operate with more certainty and effect, than any other medicine.</p>
            <p>The bowels being emptied, with ſalts and manna, it was thought expedient to continue the evacuation in a moderate degree; and for this purpoſe, a ſolution of manna and cream of tartar was employed, ſo as to produce its effect three or four times a day. This was a favourite medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. It was found not diſagreeable to take, and generally remained upon the ſtomach, without producing any ſickneſs, or other uneaſineſs. When the diſeaſe was extended beyond the ſixth or ſeventh day, and purgatives were indicated, there was a manifeſt advantage derived from equal parts of rhubarb and magneſia, in mint-water, over any other medicine, given in ſmall and repeated doſes; or a ſtrong watery infuſion of rhubarb, with the addition of a little manna, and ſp. lavend. comp. to render it agreeable to the taſte. Theſe medicines anſwered the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030041_0101_0FE4129846647D68"/>
of gentle aperients, whilſt they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced no debility by their operation.</p>
            <p>If jalap and calomel were preſcribed at the beginning of the complaint, it was ſeldom thought neceſſary to repeat them. To preſerve the bowels ſoluble, a ſolution of manna and cream of tartar was found better to anſwer the intention.</p>
            <p>When a diſordered ſtomach did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear among the primary affections, but, on attempting the uſe of purgatives, they were thrown up again, a few grains of ipecacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anha, with a free uſe of camomile tea, has ſometimes emptied the ſtomach to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. After allowing the ſtomach to reſt a few hours, purgatives could then be employed with the uſual ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>A diſordered ſtomach, with frequent retchings and efforts to vomit, was now and then met with at the beginning of the fever, and ſometimes, with other matters thrown up, there was an appearance of bile. Glyſters, frequently repeated, very
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:030041_0102_0FE41299EE0A02C0"/>
commonly moderated this ſymptom. Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally an infuſion of camomile, or, where the patient preferred it, warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was uſed to cleanſe the ſtomach; and as ſoon as there was a probability that the ſtomach would retain it, recourſe was had to the purgative ſolution.</p>
            <p>When a ſenſe of weight and oppreſſion at the ſtomach, a tenderneſs or ſoreneſs of the praecordia upon preſſure, a vomiting of a bilious matter, of a dark poracious appearance, extreme reſtleſſneſs, a dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirits, were met with among the primary ſymptoms, the caſe wore an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming aſpect, and called for the utmoſt ſkill and exertions of the phyſician. To allay the vomiting, frequent glyſters, and the application of a bliſter to the region of the ſtomach, were found moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and to theſe was added the occaſional uſe of efferveſcing draughts. If this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod did not ſucceed, the feet and legs were wrapt in large flannel cloths, wrung very
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030041_0103_0FE4129BF42E2780"/>
dry out of hot water. This expedient, by relaxing the veſſels on the ſurface, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing perſpiration, ſometimes relieved the diſtreſſing ſymptoms juſt enumerated.</p>
            <p>When the vomiting could not be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, the patient at length threw up a dark coloured matter, reſembling the grounds of coffee, and ſometimes little dark coloured flakes were found mixed with it. To this affection of the ſtomach, ſucceeded coldneſs of the extremities, with a livid appearance of the hands and feet, intermitting pulſe, exceſſive anxiety, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion about the region of the ſtomach, and hiccough, with difficult and laborious reſpiration. Theſe ſymptoms continuing in a high degree, commonly indicated the near approach of death, which was ſeldom protracted to more than two or three days. I am happy to add, however, that there were not wanting inſtances of the recovery of perſons who had laboured under black vomiting, accompanied with all the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

ſymptoms peculiar to this ſtage of the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>It likewiſe happened during the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the foregoing ſymptoms, but at no certain period, that a haemorrhage took place from the noſe, mouth, or gums, and ſometimes from all three ſources at once. In one inſtance, a friend of mine inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that the blood trickled from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts of the ears. But in the courſe of my viſiting the ſick, I ſeldom met with conſiderable haemorrhages, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ice to the bleeding veſſels, or to the neighbouring parts, did not moſt certainly check the diſcharge.</p>
            <p>The ſevere train of ſymptoms above enumerated, according to my obſervation, generally occurred in what might be called the ſecond ſtage of the diſeaſe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times after a free uſe had been made of the lancet.</p>
            <p>At the firſt of my attendance upon the epidemic fever, I was impreſſed with an
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030041_0105_0FE412A31A8809B8"/>
idea that an early recourſe to the bark was eſſentially neceſſary to the ſucceſsful treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. Under the influence of this opinion, after the contents of the ſtomach and bowels were carried off, I directed the bark to be uſed, either in powder, decoction, or the cold infuſion, as circumſtances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to indicate. In every inſtance it was found to diſagree with the firſt paſſages. In ſome it occaſioned a fulneſs and ſtraightneſs about the praecordia: in others it offended the inteſtines, producing a fulneſs and ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the abdomen: whilſt in others it excited the ſyſtem, increaſed the head-ach, and brought on an acceſſion of fever. Nor did I ever ſee the bark do good, <hi>until an entire ſolution of the diſeaſe took place.</hi> That it might not have been beneficial, I ſhall not aſſert. If, however, an opportunity of a ſimilar kind unfortunately occurs, I ſhall preſcribe it, under particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in a manner very different from that in which I have before uſed it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:030041_0106_0FE412A50DB65488"/>
The bad effects of the bark, which ſo invariably followed the uſe of it, under my direction, were commonly removed by the uſe of purgatives. Whilſt the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was taking laxative medicines, I made it a common practice to give freely of ſp. minderer. and evidently with good effects.</p>
            <p>If the heat and fever were conſiderable, and the ſtomach retentive, ſmall doſes of antimonials, particularly James's powder, ſometimes joined with camphor, were found uſeful. The ſp. minderer. alſo, was a uſeful medicine in this ſtate of the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The diaphoreſis which it commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced afforded great relief, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought on a remiſſion, if not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion of the fever. When a free perſpiration took place on the ſecond or third day, it was conſidered as a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble event, and denoted a happy termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diſeaſe. But ſweating did not
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:030041_0107_0FE412A6B606CB98"/>
always prove ſerviceable. Inſtances hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, where this evacuation was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe from the firſt attack, without ſeeming to benefit the patient in any degree. When it came on thus early, the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſkin generally, and particularly of the extreme parts, was ſo altered as to communicate a conſiderable ſenſe of cold to the touch.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to calomel, which many have preſcribed with that freedom and conſtancy, as if it poſſeſſed ſome ſpecific qualities, I can ſay little from my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. I never could induce my mind to believe that it poſſeſſed any advantages over many other purgatives; and from the account given of its effects by ſome of my friends, I am diſpoſed to favour a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that its operation, as a purgative, was <hi>very limited.</hi> It produced frequent ſtools, but the quantity diſcharged was very ſmall; and during the uſe of it, the patient fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently complained of a ſenſe of fulneſs
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:030041_0108_0FE412AA27E83F60"/>
and conſtriction in different regions of the abdomen. Theſe feelings were commonly ſoon relieved by the more copious evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions procured by either of the purgative ſolutions before mentioned. That calomel has nothing ſpecific in its nature, ſeems pretty clearly evinced by thoſe caſes in which it has been taken as a preventive. Inſtances of this ſort were not unfrequent during the prevalence of the late epidemic in this city. But the fever was known to attack perſons under the influence of this medicine; while others, who did not take mercury, and were living preciſely under the ſame circumſtances, have eſcaped the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Three perſons out of four, of the ſame family, had taken mercury for ſome time, with a view to guard themſelves againſt the fever; but they were, notwithſtanding, ſeized with the epidemic. In one, a ſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation had been produced, and in this ſituation, he was attacked with fever.
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:030041_0109_0FE4127BD8D48D58"/>
As ſoon as the fever came on, from a conviction that the mercury had not been of any ſervice to him, he omitted the uſe of it, and with the aſſiſtance of mild pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, ſoon got well. The fourth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who had not taken any calomel, and who nurſed the other three, eſcaped the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>A number of other inſtances might be mentioned, in which calomel had been taken as a preventive, where the perſons, notwithſtanding, took the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>In the management of the late epidemic, the cold bath was frequently reſorted to. As a general application, I can ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it from my own obſervation. I have been, indeed, in the habit of waſhing the hands, arms, face, neck, and breaſt, with cold vinegar and water, in caſes of fever, and always found it a very grateful refreſhment to the patient. I according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed it freely, and as extenſively as conveniences would allow. But I know
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:030041_0110_0FE412AD81D033F0"/>
that the general bath was alſo employed for the late fever, with great advantage, but under what particular circumſtances I cannot ſpeak with preciſion. Doctor Charlton, of this city, a phyſician of much experience, who had in many inſtances witneſſed its good effects, favoured me with the following communication: <q>I experienced the happieſt effects from cold bathing, in a variety of caſes. I uſed river-water, and had the patient placed in a large tub, and a couple of pails-full thrown over him. It happened in one inſtance only, that the patient did not feel ſo much refreſhment, as to be impatient for a repetition of it. In this caſe the patient grew chilly after uſing the bath, which I thought a ſufficient reaſon for diſcontinuing it. In every other inſtance I found no method ſo effectual for reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the extreme diſtreſs of the head and ſtomach, ſo generally attendant on that diſeaſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="unknown:030041_0111_0FE412AF71108818"/>
We find a ſimilar practice recorded by Mr. Bruce, who ſays, that the inhabitants of Maſuah are ſubject to violent fevers, which <q>generally terminate the third day in death. If the patient ſurvives till the fifth day, he very often recovered by drinking water only, and throwing a quantity of cold water upon him, even in his bed, where he is permitted to lie, without attempting to make him dry, or change his bed, till another deluge adds to the firſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the uſe of cordial medicines, or drinks of that nature, much circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was neceſſary. In the firſt ſtages of the diſeaſe, they were altogether inadmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. They were preſcribed in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, after conſiderable remiſſions had taken place, but manifeſtly to the injury of the ſick. Even after complete inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions had formed, they ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a ſtate of excitement, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the patient's ſituation much leſs
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:030041_0112_0FE412B296703F58"/>
comfortable. Theſe obſervations apply particularly to thoſe caſes, where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions took place at an early period, or where the diſeaſe did not run out beyond the fifth, ſixth or ſeventh day. When the fever was of longer continuance, the debility it induced made the uſe of cordials not only allowable, but particularly neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Porter, more or leſs diluted, was found to agree better with the ſick than any other drink of the cordial kind: but its ſalutary effects appeared very much to depend upon a liberal ſtate of the bowels. When given conjointly with ſome mild purgative, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the ſtrength, and very often ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded the uſe of any other tonic.</p>
            <p>In the latter ſtages of the complaint an infuſion of ſnake-root was alſo made uſe of with advantage. On many occaſions it compoſed the ſtomach, ſupported the ſtrength of the patient, without exciting him, and ſeemed productive of very happy effects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:030041_0113_0FE412B48CFEA130"/>
Much has been ſaid and written re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the uſe of the lancet, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of bleeding in this diſeaſe. On this part of practice I ſhall advance nothing, but what is the reſult of experience and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. In general, the indications of cure were not ſuppoſed to include this operation; it was, therefore, but ſeldom had recourſe to. In ſome of thoſe caſes, in which the lancet was uſed, the good effects of bleeding were obvious, more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in relieving the diſtreſſing pain in the head; whereas in other inſtances, and, where the ſymptoms ſeemed to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it peculiarly proper, it did not afford the relief that was expected from it; but, on the contrary, although the quantity of blood drawn was copious, and the bleeding frequently repeated, the patient ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>If I were to ſay in what caſes bleeding would probably be uſeful, it would be where the fever ſeizes upon healthy, robuſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030041_0114_0FE412B6798D98C8"/>
where the pain in the head was extremely violent, and where the eyes, (to uſe a frequent expreſſion of the ſick) ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ready to leap from their ſockets, <hi>and eſpecially if ſuch a ſubject had juſt arrived from the purer and cooler air of the country.</hi> In a perſon of this deſcription, the attack, and all the ſubſequent ſymptoms, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly violent indeed; to moderate, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the exceſſive action of the ſyſtem, bleeding would probably be neceſſary and uſeful. Under circumſtances like theſe, I have accordingly bled, and to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but I have, previouſly to blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, directed my patient to drink freely of warm water; by which means I have obſerved, that not only the action of the vaſcular ſyſtem was much abated, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that the whole body more readily yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a copious perſpiration. But if a perſon is attacked with this fever, whoſe body has been previouſly debilitated, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by a ſedentary manner of living, and
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030041_0115_0FE412B828776BB8"/>
               <hi>from having reſided ſome time in the epidemic conſtitution of the air,</hi> it could hardly be ſuppoſed that the ſame remedies would be required as in the former inſtance.</p>
            <p>An attention to the above diſtinction of cauſes, as far as reſpects the remedy of bleeding particularly, may be of greater importance in the treatment of this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, than has been commonly imagined.</p>
            <p>Opium was rarely admiſſible in this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and never in the firſt ſtage of it. But after the contents of the ſtomach and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els were freely evacuated, and the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive action of the ſyſtem moderated, the uſe of it was juſtified in many inſtances of ſucceſsful practice. Indeed, particular caſes occurred, in which great irritation, reſtleſſneſs, and want of ſleep, could by no other means be ſo well alleviated. When given under ſuch circumſtances, it was commonly conjoined with ſome ſudorific, and moſt frequently with ſp. mind. When, alſo, in the advanced ſtage of the diſeaſe,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030041_0116_0FE412BBC7CA33A0"/>
the vomiting became exceſſive, opium was adminiſtered with the beſt effects.</p>
            <p>Bliſters were occaſionally employed; they were found moſt uſeful in removing local affections. If the head-ach continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſevere, after free evacuations, a bliſter, applied between the ſhoulders, often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the pain. When the ſickneſs at the ſtomach was great, attended with oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and pain, a bliſter to the praecordia has often proved of advantage. Doctor Blane found nothing ſo ſucceſsful in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving irritability of the ſtomach, as a bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter applied externally to the part. When there has been a general ſoreneſs and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the abdomen, which has not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided after a free uſe of purgatives, the application of a bliſter has produced the happieſt effects. A friend of mine had a young clergyman under his care, whoſe diſeaſe, from its continuance, had become very formidable. He was covered with petechiae; his ſtomach was eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited;
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030041_0117_0FE412BD73FFDFD8"/>
his ſtools were generally of a dark colour, and ſometimes black. The bark had been tried, but it did not agree with him. Upon examining the abdomen, it was found univerſally tender to the touch, but not painful. A large bliſter was applied to the affected part, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of which put an immediate check to the progreſs of the diſeaſe. His drink was porter, to which water was occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally added; and with the aſſiſtance of an eaſy diet, ſuch as ſago, gruel, &amp;c. his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery was ſoon completed.</p>
            <p>The drinks which ſeemed the moſt grateful to the ſick, and were conſidered as the moſt proper during the fever, were lemonade, water with toaſt in it, water alone, molaſſes and water, balm-tea, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The diet commonly recommended was ſago, tapioca, panado, and occaſionally weak broths. The latter, however, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently produced uneaſineſs at the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which made it neceſſary to deſiſt
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030041_0118_0FE412BF221B6648"/>
from their uſe. A gruel made with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian-meal, or oat-meal, appeared, upon the whole, to agree better with the ſick than any other food; and, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, it conſtituted the whole diet and drink of the patient.</p>
            <p>The uſe of animal food was uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended with bad effects; the ſmalleſt quantity, taken in the intermiſſion, has haſtened the acceſſion of fever, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed its violence. Even after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe had entirely ſubſided, and debility only remained, a too early recurrence to animal food has brought on a renewal of fever.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, that through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, the ſtricteſt attention was paid to cleanlineſs, eſpecially to the immediate removal of all excrementitious matter. The patient's linen, bed-cloaths, and often the bed itſelf, were frequently changed, and the refreſhment it always af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded was a ſufficient proof of its utility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="unknown:030041_0119_0FE412C117AFACC8"/>
The foregoing exhibits an unvarniſhed view of the hiſtory of the late epidemic, as far as it came under my notice; and of the practice, as far as it ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and was ſucceſsful under my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement: and I have purpoſely avoided, as much as poſſible, all theoretical or controverſial grounds.</p>
            <p>Indeed, I have been anxious about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as to fix upon the mind, the great and obvious diſtinction betwixt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſes, and thoſe which, under very peculiar circumſtances, may aſſume much of that character.</p>
            <p>The utility of this diſtinction is ſo well ſhewn by Doctor John Hunter, in his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the Nature and Cauſes of the Remittant Fever, that I cannot do better than give his own obſervations upon the ſubject. <q>There is hardly any part of the hiſtory of a diſeaſe (ſays the Doctor) which it is of more conſequence to aſcertain with accuracy, than its being
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030041_0120_0FE412C3E478F9A0"/>
of an infectious nature or not. Upon this depends the propriety of the ſteps that ſhould be taken, either to prevent it, or to root it out. It is productive of great miſchief to conſider a diſeaſe as infectious that really is not ſo; it expoſes ſuch as labour under it to evils and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, which greatly aggravate their ſufferings, and often deprive them of the neceſſary aſſiſtance: they are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, if not ſhunned; and at the time they require the greateſt care and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, they have the leaſt. I have had occaſion to obſerve, that the remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant fever, whether with its uſual, or more uncommon ſymptoms, with the yellow colour of the eyes and ſkin, or without them, was never found to be infectious. The ſtrongeſt proofs of this, in my opinion, were to be met with in private families, where the ſon, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or the huſband, labouring under the worſt fevers, were nurſed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitting
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030041_0121_0FE412C6148F9C60"/>
aſſiduity, by the mother, the ſiſter, or the wife, who never left the ſick by day or by night, yet without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infected. That ſuch near relations ſhould take upon them the office of a nurſe, is matter of the higheſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in a country, the diſeaſes of which require to be watched with greater care and attention than can be expected from a ſervant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Why the late epidemic, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances during its deſtructive progreſs in this city, wore the dreadful aſpect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, may be gathered, in a good degree, from the few following particulars, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the knowledge of us all, <abbr>viz.</abbr> The laſt ſummer, and a great part of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, were marked by an uncommon degree of heat, combined with moiſture. The atmoſphere, which, at that ſeaſon, is ordinarily loaded with the electric fluid, ſeemed deſtitute, for weeks together, of this vivifying principle. The intenſe
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:030041_0122_0FE412C80D63A490"/>
heats which we often experience in the forenoons of July and Auguſt, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally allayed by thunder and lightning, and the refreſhing rains, which follow towards the evening; but in the ſeaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to, this precious relief from the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor induced by a verticle ſun, was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom felt.</p>
            <p>Now, when we reflect that a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of thoſe who fell victims to the late epidemic fever were not only foreigners, but poor perſons, many of whom had been only a few weeks in the country, arrived after a long voyage, and prediſpoſed to ſickneſs by hard and ſcanty fare; hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled together, in a great many inſtances, in the moſt uncomfortable apartments, and theſe ſituated in the moſt unhealthy parts of the city; frequently without the early at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of a phyſician, deſtitute of friends, and often without the moſt common com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of life; under ſuch diſtreſſing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, notwithſtanding the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:030041_0123_0FE412C9B6C5CE08"/>
of the citizens, were numbers placed; and what conſequences, but thoſe which followed, could reaſonably have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected?<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>In the former part of this essay, we enumerated many circumstances which tended to shew, that the season of the late epidemic more especially, was attended with <hi>an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon constitution of the air.</hi> Since these observations were put together, I have been favoured with a letter from Mr. Gardiner Baker, proprietor of the Museum in this city, who mentions several occurrences illustrative of the same thing. He observes, <q>Books in my libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and those that were in daily use, were covered with mould. All the preserved animals in the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seum, that were not contained in glass cases, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured very much by the long continued atmos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheric moisture, and some of them quite spoiled; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly a very finely preserved buffaloe, which had, in the course of twelve years, been exposed to every climate on the continent, without shewing the least disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to decay. But, in the month of August last, upon applying my hand under the belly, I found it as wet as if taken out of water, and soon after this part of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal began to fall, piece by piece, as large as my two hands, until the whole of the belly had fallen to the floor. Fish that had been well preserved for several weeks, had collected so much moisture from the air, that drops of water fell from them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I have a very excellent electrical machine, and have been in the daily habit of using it; but during the sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, when the appearance of the atmosphere was the most favourable, I could not, with all my art or industry, excite it, so as to answer any purpose in experiment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. when, in the ordinary state of the atmosphere, four or five revolutions of the cylinder, will give as hard a shock as a man can bear with convenience.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The foregoing observations of Mr. Baker prove, in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable degree, that there was a prevailing property in the air, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                     <hi>extreme moisture.</hi> The annexed table will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the degree of heat, which appears, upon an average, to exceed the usual temperature several degrees.</p>

               <p>THOSE who have inclination, and have not peruſed the writings of ſome authors juſtly diſtinguiſhed for their talents in medicine, and who have written profeſſedly on the <hi>fever in queſtion,</hi> (for I pay no regard to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous names by which it is known) may find in the annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pages, a very circumſcribed view of their opinions of right practice, as far as reſpects the moſt efficacious remedies employed againſt it. Thoſe who have more leiſure, and more curioſity, will, of courſe, conſult the originals from whence they are taken; for my own part, I have by no means intended, by this ſelection, to ſtrain any part of their practice, with a view to ſtrengthen, or give conſequence to <hi>my own opinions,</hi> or to fix a <hi>methodus medendi,</hi> which, it will occur to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intelligent practitioner, obtained under circumſtances, in many inſtances, very diſſimilar.</p>

               <head>HILLARY.</head>
               <p>THE firſt indication of cure, Doctor Hillary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, is <q>to moderate the too great and rapid motion of the fluids, and abate the heat and violence of the
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030041_0126_0FE412D1B0ADC6D8"/>
fever, in the two firſt days of the diſeaſe. Wherefore bleeding, in the beginning of the firſt ſtage of this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, either to a greater or leſs quantity, accordingly as the following ſymptoms and circumſtances indicate, is always abſolutely neceſſary: and the quantity to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away ſhould always be as the age and ſtrength of the patient, the degree of the plethora, and the greater or leſs elaſtic ſtate of the ſolids, the fulneſs of his pulſe, and the violence of the fever and its ſymptoms. For which reaſon, when I have been called in time, (which is too ſeldom the caſe) I generally order 12, 14, 16, 18, or 20 ounces of blood to be taken away on the firſt or ſecond day; but always, as the above ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and rules indicate and direct: and if the patient's pulſe riſes after the firſt bleeding, or if the fever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to be ſtill high, and the pulſe full, (for it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver high in this fever) I repeat the bleeding once, in the firſt or ſecond day of the diſeaſe, if the above mentioned ſymptoms indicate it; but bleeding a third time is ſeldom or never required, neither is bleeding on the third day almoſt ever required; and when it is performed on that day, it ought not to be adviſed without great caution and judgment; neither ſhould a vein be opened after the third day in this fever, unleſs ſome very extraordinary ſymptoms and circumſtances require it, which very rarely or never happen. I have always found that taking away a moderate, but ſufficient quantity of blood on the firſt or ſecond days, has rendered the fever more moderate, and abated the putreſcent diatheſis afterwards. But as to the quantity of blood to be taken away in this caſe, either the firſt or ſecond time, or on the firſt or ſecond days, it is impoſſible to aſcertain it, ſince that
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030041_0127_0FE412D3A7259B40"/>
muſt be different, in different patients; becauſe ſome conſtitutions can better bear the loſs of fifty ounces of blood than others can the loſs of eight or ten; therefore, the only rules that can be given are thoſe laid down before.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The irritable ſtate of the ſtomach, Doctor Hillary ſays, forbids the uſe of emetics; but to carry off the contents of this organ, a liberal uſe of warm water is recommended, which greatly relieves the patient. In the next place, <q>in order to gain a truce, and ſome reſpite from the anxiety, and almoſt continual reaching, vomiting, and ſickneſs, which are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, but ſomewhat relieved by drinking the warm water, I uſually give extract<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thebaic. g. I vel. g. I ſs. and order them to take nothing into their ſtomachs for two hours after it, that they may retain it; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſo ſmall a compaſs, they ſcarce ever reject it. By this method the poor diſtreſſed patient gets ſome reſt and reſpite, and all the ſymptoms are generally conſiderably abated, the reaching and vomiting ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther totally ceaſes, or do but ſeldom return; ſo that other medicines may be given and retained on the ſtomach, which it would not retain before; ſuch as cooling acid juleps, or other antiphlogiſtic and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeptic medicines.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The evacuation of the bowels is the next circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to which Doctor Hillary directs our attention. He attempts this firſt by glyſters, <q>and after ſix or eight hours reſt and reſpite, he orders a gentle antiphlogiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and antiſeptic purge.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Or if the patient has a purging before, which ſometimes, though very ſeldom happens, I order a gentle doſe of toaſted rhubarb to be given, and an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſeptic
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:030041_0128_0FE412D881BE78E0"/>
anodyne, after it has operated, to abate and check the too much purging, but not to ſtop it, as I have always obſerved it to be of ſervice in this caſe, provided that it is moderate, and not too violent: and I obſerved that all thoſe who had this purging, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally did well with it, if the patient's ſtrength was but properly ſupported with ſuitable nouriſhment, and proper antiſeptic medicines, which laſt are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abſolutely neceſſary in this fever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And though purging in many other fevers, may be deemed bad practice, yet in this fever, as nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated it, I have always found it of ſingular ſervice, and the patient not only greatly relieved by it, but the diſeaſe always rendered more moderate and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able afterwards.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Doctor Hillary not only purges in the beginning of the diſeaſe, but, ſays he, <q>and I moſt commonly find it neceſſary to repeat this purging every ſecond or third day, for two or three times, and ſometimes, when the ſymptoms are very bad, and have not much abated upon taking the firſt and ſecond purge, and the patient has not been treated in the method before deſcribed, or I have not been called in till late in the diſeaſe, I have found it neceſſary to repeat the gentle purging every day, for four or five days ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, and with the deſired ſucceſs too.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the latter ſtages of the diſorder, when, (according to Doctor Hillary) it might be ſuppoſed that antiſeptics <q>were neceſſary to put a ſtop to the putreſcent diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the fluids, and prevent gangrenes coming on,</q> our author found the cort. peru. though a medicine of the nature indicated, <q>ſo diſagreeable to moſt palates, and the ſtomachs of the ſick, in this
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030041_0129_0FE412DA2A7297A8"/>
diſeaſe, are ſo much affected, and ſo weak, and ſo ſubject to reject every thing, even the moſt pleaſant and innocent, that they can very rarely take it in any ſhape, and ſtill much fewer can retain it, when they have got it down.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As a ſubſtitute for the bark, Doctor Hillary uſed an infuſion of ſnake-root, to which Madeira wine and elixir of vitriol was added, <q>and with much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſs than he could hope for, or dare expect.</q> If this medicine required "more warming," the quantity of rad. ſerpent. was increaſed, or vin. croc. or confec. cardiac. or ſome ſuch medicines were added.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>The firſt patient I was called to, was one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews, a plethoric, muſcular man, about twenty-five years of age: he had not complained three hours when I ſaw him, about ten in the forenoon; yet the oppreſſion on the praecordia, and the bilious vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings had already ſeized him. His pulſe was full and ſtrong, and I took ſixteen ounces of blood from his arm immediately, and ordered a laxative clyſter to
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:030041_0130_0FE412DC1F1CC090"/>
be injected as ſoon as it could be got ready, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined him to drink plentifully of barley water, acidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with the juice of the lime. I called upon him at noon, and was much diſappointed to find the ardent ſymptoms, and the oppreſſion on his breaſt both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed: his vomitings were almoſt continual, and he complained much of diſtreſs on breathing, and of the burning of his eyes. The reaſons for bleeding him ſtill continuing, I took fourteen ounces of blood from the ſame orifice, and ordered him, the ſame evening, a ſcruple of ipecacuanha at ſix o'clock, and at ten applied a large bliſter between his ſhoulders, in hopes of relieving his cheſt.</p>
                  <p>He continued to vomit, with but ſhort intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, from the time he took the emetic, although he diſcharged a great deal of bile by ſtool. He had a very reſtleſs night, and continued through the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day, vomiting, and labouring under the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his breaſt, till about twelve at night, when he died; about forty hours from the time of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt ſeized.</p>
                  <p>At this time the practice in Barbadoes was, to uſe large and repeated bleeding, vomiting, and bliſtering, as recommended by Doctor Town, which method I, as a ſtranger, thought myſelf obliged to follow.</p>
                  <p>Before Andrews died, ſeveral others were taken ill, and, except the ſecond bleeding, which was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they were treated the ſame way, with no better ſucceſs.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Doctor Hume next relates the morbid appearances exhibited upon opening the bodies of the two firſt men who died. There were an inlarged liver, and <q>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent marks of inflammation on the lower extremity
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:030041_0131_0FE412DDCB294CC0"/>
of the ſtomach, and likewiſe on the ſuperior part of the duodenum.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>No marks of mortification were found on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or external ſurface of the ſtomachs of either of theſe men; but I opened two not long after, who died in a more advanced ſtate of the diſeaſe, and found one of them, who had vomited the black matter, in a ſtate of mortification every where, and ſome coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated blood in it; the internal coats of the other were covered with livid ſpots of different ſizes, and, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, towards the bottom, there were large black ſpots of the ſize of a crown piece.</p>
                  <p>Having obſerved, with much regret, the bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs I had from bleeding and vomiting, and that the firſt man who died evidently ſunk after the firſt bleeding, I bled the reſt but once; and when the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients were not plethoric, I have frequently omitted the operation altogether, as I ſometimes did when I had not ſeen them within twenty-four hours of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken ill.</p>
                  <p>I have ſeen ſome ſubjects opened, on whoſe ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs no marks of inflammation could be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet even theſe had exceſſive vomitings.</p>
                  <p>The ſtate in which I found the ſtomachs of the two firſt men who died, deterred me from giving any more vomits; and I have ever found that bowel ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and irritable, that I have never ſince ventured to give any emetic whatever. There ſeems, however, a neceſſity to evacuate the bile by the ſtomach, by the inteſtines, and by the ſkin, when there is a tendency to ſweat.</p>
                  <p>After bleeding, I uſed to order a clyſter of &amp;c. and for common drink, I ordered a pleaſant ſherbett made of freſh, ripe limes, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="unknown:030041_0132_0FE412E0B04C8C38"/>
I found this not only a pleaſant drink for the ſick, but looked upon it as the moſt powerful antiſeptic, and antiemetic I could give them. It is true that on firſt uſing, it was thrown up as faſt as water, when an emetic is given; but ſuch as had reſolution to perſevere in drinking it, ſoon found their ſick fits leſs ſevere; and, after the firſt three or four draughts, every ſucceeding one remained longer on the ſtomach than that before it, ſo that, in a few hours, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions between the fits of vomiting came to be ſo lengthened, that I could attempt giving ſome mild purgative medicine. I commonly ordered two ounces of manna, and one of cream of tartar, diſſolved in three pints of lemonade. Of this I gave them a few ſpoonfuls, or a tea-cup full, at ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of time, as I thought their ſtomachs could bear.</p>
                  <p>Manna and cream of tartar was continued occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was ſometimes changed for tincture of rhubarb, drawn in weak cinnamon-water, to render it more grateful to the ſtomach. When theſe failed of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing frequent bilious ſtools, glyſters were injected; but the heat, frequency, and acrimony of theſe bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ſtools, often deprived me of this reſource, for the extremity of the rectum, many times, became ſo tender as not to be able to bear the introduction of the ſmalleſt and ſmootheſt pipe.</p>
                  <p>When I obſerved any tendency to ſweating, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſcontinued the laxative medicines, and gave ſix drachms, or an ounce of the ſp. mind. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the doſe in five or ſix hours, if the ſweat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo long, encouraging the ſick to drink a weak
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:030041_0133_0FE412E3134889E8"/>
infuſion of ſage, acidulated, if they deſired to have it ſo.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Doctor Hume recommends the application of bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the thighs, to relieve the ſevere vomitings. "When," ſays he, <q>the ſick complained much of the bliſters of their thighs, the vomiting uſually began to abate, and to ceaſe entirely, as the irritation and inflammation increaſed.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>This fever, like ſome others, often ends in ſcabby eruptions about the mouth and noſe, and ſometimes I have ſeen ſmall biles, from the ſize of a common pea to that of a horſe-bean, break out on the breaſt, ſides, ſhoulders, or hips, and prove critical.</p>
                  <p>There is one critical appearance, which I do not remember to have ſeen taken notice of by any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the bilious fever, and which, I believe, has been obſerved by few practitioners, (it ſometimes happens in the third ſtage, and ſometimes in the courſe of it) which is, one or more cluſters of ſmall florid eruptions on or near the pit of the ſtomach, not larger than meaſles, and from three or four to ſeven or eight in a cluſter.</p>
                  <p>In whatever ſtate of the diſeaſe, the ſick are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, whether by ſweats, bilious ſtools, biles, erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or by bliſters, and it is evident from the ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vomiting, from the load at the breaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed, and from the reſpiration becoming ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier, that the fever is giving way, we ſhould attempt to give the bark: ſooner would be to no purpoſe, for it would hurt the patient, by exaſperating the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To the infuſions of bark, uſed by Doctor Hume, ſnake-root was added.</p>

Speaking of opiates, Doctor Hume ſays, <q>it does not ſeem probable that they can be of any uſe in this diſeaſe, if it is conſidered, that the principal inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cure is the evacuation of the offending bile, by every outlet; and to attempt confining it by opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, is to counteract that intention.</q>

               <head>DOCTOR JACKSON ON THE FEVERS OF JAMAICA, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>Doctor Jackſon, after dividing the yellow fever into three ſpecies, and giving the ſymptoms attending each form, proceeds to the method of cure.</p>
               <div type="treatment">
                  <head>Treatment of the firſt ſpecies.</head>
                  <p>"The ſpecies of the yellow fever," ſays he, <q>which I have now deſcribed, is univerſally allowed to be a terrible diſeaſe; and there are few, I believe, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candid as to boaſt of general ſucceſs in the manner of curing it. A road is, therefore, left open, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for improvement, but almoſt for total innovation. The only author I have read on the ſubject, or the practitioners with whom I am acquainted, do not ſeem to have extended their views beyond the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the diſeaſe. There are ſome, who, from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that there is pain in the head, and fluſhing of the face, recommend bleeding; others, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of nauſea, or inclination to vomit, make trial of emetics; and many, from various cauſes, inſiſt on the indiſpenſible uſe of cathartics. My views, I muſt confeſs, are different from thoſe of preceding authors. Bleeding was employed occaſionally; emetics were
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030041_0135_0FE412E6B488A778"/>
cautiouſly avoided; but time appeared to be too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to be ſpent in attending to the effects of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartics, which cannot often be known in leſs than twenty-four hours; and which at beſt are precarious and feeble. Inſtead, therefore, of attempting to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate redundant bile, or to correct it when ſuppoſed to be vitiated, I exerted myſelf from the firſt moment that I was called to the patient, to change the genius and natural temper of the diſeaſe; or, if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the expreſſion, to take the buſineſs, as ſpeedily as poſſible, out of the hands of nature.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I remark, in the firſt place, that I generally began the cure of this ſpecies of the yellow fever with bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Bleeding was employed in the preſent caſe, chiefly with a view of paving the way to remedies of greater efficacy. It was, however, found to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the violence of local pain, particularly the violence of the head-ach, and to be not altogether without effect in retarding the uſual rapid progreſs of the diſeaſe. It has hitherto been thought neceſſary, indeed almoſt indiſpenſible, to empty the firſt paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in this ſpecies of fever; but time is ſhort, and the good which accrues from ſuch evacuations, is not very certain, and often not eſſential. It was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thought ſufficient to truſt this intention, for the moſt part, to laxative glyſters; after the employment of which, (bleeding having been premiſed in ſuch quantity as was deemed proper) the patient was waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed clean, and bathed in warm water, in as complete a manner as the circumſtances of ſituation would permit. It is needleſs to mention that this was done with a view to increaſe the mobility of the ſyſtem, and to remove ſpaſmodic ſtricture from the extreme
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:030041_0136_0FE412EB08AEABE8"/>
veſſels of the ſurface; in conſequence of which, greater benefit was expected from the application of cold ſalt water, which was daſhed ſuddenly from a bucket on the head and ſhoulders. This practice may appear hazardous to thoſe who argue without experience; but I can vouch for its general ſafety, and bear teſtimony to its good effects. Sweat, with perfect relief from all the feelings of anxiety and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, was generally the conſequence of this mode of treatment. If employed within the firſt twelve hours from the attack, it ſeldom failed of removing all the ſymptoms of danger; or of affecting a total and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete change in the nature and circumſtances of the diſeaſe; but if the progreſs was more advanced, though the ſame rule of practice might ſtill be proper, the execution required more boldneſs and deciſion. It is only poſſible to judge from the circumſtances of the caſe, at this period, of the neceſſity or propriety of bleeding, and of emptying the lower inteſtines, by means of glyſters; but when buſineſs ſhall have been accompliſhed, in ſuch manner as ſhall have been deemed right, or conducive to the main view, it will be adviſable to ſhave the head, to bathe the whole body in warm water, and inſtantly to daſh cold water from a bucket on the head and ſhoulders. I have even ſometimes, where there was an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of greater obſtinacy, ventured to wrap the whole body in a blanket ſoaked in ſea-water, or in water in which was diſſolved a large portion of ſalt. If anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety was great, or nauſea and vomiting troubleſome, I have alſo obſerved benefit from the application of a bliſter to the epigaſtic region. Opiates, joined with remedies which had a tendency to determine to the
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:030041_0137_0FE412ED02D45D80"/>
ſurface, were found to be ſerviceable; and wine, with a ſupply of freſh and cool air, in moſt caſes was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary. This method of proceeding will, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be thought unwarrantable, but I can ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently of its ſafety; and I may further add, that unleſs ſome decided ſteps are taken to change the nature of the diſeaſe, during the continuance of this ſtage, our future endeavours to do good will gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be in vain. I have hitherto promiſed ſucceſs in the cure of this fever, with a good deal of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but if it ſhould ſo happen, that we are not called to the patient till the yellowneſs has ſpread over the whole of the body, or till the black vomiting has begun to make its appearance, the proſpect, I muſt confeſs, is then very dark. The ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of our art are feeble; and if good can be done at all, it can only be done by means, which, in the common opinion of practitioners, border on raſhneſs. In this latter ſtage of the complaint, ſo great a degree of torpor overwhelms the powers of life, that remedies do not produce their uſual effect, and our labour is often the ſame, as if we attempted to reſuſcitate a corpſe. I have, however, ſeen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſuch unexpected recoveries, from the moſt hopeleſs ſtate in fevers, that I ſeldom totally deſpair as long as life remains. I know that death may be prevented, even after black vomiting has appeared, with all its terrors, if a remedy can be found power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough to excite the action of the extreme veſſels, and to recall the determination to the ſurface of the body. For this purpoſe, I have employed alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, warm and cold bathing, with ſucceſs. I have even wrapt the body, as I mentioned before, in a
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:030041_0138_0FE412EEAC575180"/>
blanket ſoaked in water, in which a large portion of ſalt was diſſolved, or which had been ſteeped in bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or rum, enjoining, at the ſame time, the liberal uſe of wine, or even more powerful cordials. I have heard of ſome well atteſted inſtances, where plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful draughts of rum and water have checked the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, and apparently ſaved the lives of patients, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the medical people had given them up for loſt.</q>

                     <q>The cure of this ſpecies of the diſeaſe, though by no means eaſy, was leſs difficult, upon the whole, than that of the former. Inſtead of the torpor and inſenſibility, which prevailed in the latter periods of the proper yellow fever,</q> (for Doctor Jackſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the firſt deſcribed ſpecies as the true yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Jamaica) <q>the mobility of the nervous ſyſtem was ſo much increaſed in the preſent ſpecies of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, that remedies ſeldom failed of producing ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects: and wherever remedies produce effects, it is generally in our power to manage the buſineſs in ſuch a manner, that ſome good may ariſe. It may be obſerved in the firſt place, with regard to the cure, that bleeding, which frequently was uſeful in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſpecies, was generally hurtful in the preſent; and that, inſtead of retarding, it oftener accelerated the progreſs of the diſeaſe. Emetics were employed, very commonly, by the practitioners of the Weſt-Indies, in this as in other caſes of fever; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help remarking, that languor and debility, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently yellowneſs, and ſometimes a continual vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, which no remedies could reſtrain, were often the conſequence of antimonial emetics of ſevere operation; and I have no doubt in ſaying, that the
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:030041_0139_0FE412F0C7FBEA30"/>
approach of death was actually haſtened, in ſeveral inſtances, by this method of treatment. Laxatives were occaſionally of ſervice; but the ſtronger purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives frequently hurtful. Bliſters were often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely beneficial; but it requires care and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to apply them in the proper circumſtances, ſo as to reap the full advantage. Opiates were ſometimes ſerviceable; and bark and wine, in moſt inſtances, were remedies of great value; but the principal truſt was placed in warm and cold bathing, which, under proper management, ſeldom failed of anſwering every expectation completely, or ſpeedily of removing the chief ſymptoms of danger. Sometimes it appeared to cut ſhort the courſe of the diſeaſe abruptly.</q>

                  <p>In the next place, as introductory to the ſymptoms and method of cure, of the third ſpecies of yellow fever, Doctor Jackſon obſerves, <q>I have now deſcribed two ſpecies of fever, which ſeem to be, in ſome degree, peculiar to the natives of northern regions, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their arrival in the Weſt-Indies. In the one, a determination to the alimentary canal and biliary or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, with marks of putreſcent tendency, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral maſs of fluids, was diſcoverable at an early period; in the other, the brain and nervous ſyſtem were more particularly and principally affected; while the ſpecies of which I now attempt to give ſome account, exhibited ſtrong marks of vaſcular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement, with a very high degree of apparent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory diatheſis. This was more irregular in its appearances, and more complicated in its nature, than the others. The marks of inflammatory diathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis were generally very apparent in the beginning; but they uſually gave way, or became complicated
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030041_0140_0FE412F4B6D02678"/>
in the latter ſtages, with ſymptoms of putreſcency or nervous affection.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Speaking of the cure of this ſpecies, he ſays, <q>if we proceed on the firſt obvious view of the diſeaſe, we ſhall often do irreparable miſchief, by copious and repeated evacuations; yet there will not be leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, on the other hand, if, regardleſs of the preſent degree of excitement, we indulge freely in the uſe of ſtimulants. It is neceſſary to obſerve a middle courſe; and, I muſt confeſs, that it is ſometimes dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to do any thing without doing harm. Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was frequently employed in the cure of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and, in moſt caſes, it was an uſeful remedy, though leſs perhaps from its own effects merely, than from paving the way to other more powerful appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. It is, however, capable of being eaſily carried to exceſs; and ought not to be truſted to wholly for the removing the irritability, and high degree of excitement, which prevail ſo generally in the beginning of this diſeaſe. After bleeding, eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics and cathartics are employed very freely. I have always profeſſed myſelf an enemy to the practice of giving emetics in the fevers of Jamaica; yet I muſt confeſs, that antimonials were not only ſafer, but of more particular <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

The operation of this remedy

was extenſive. It might be ſo managed as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote nauſea, or vomiting, ſweat, or moderate evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations downwards; at the ſame time, it proved very powerfully ſedative. I may likewiſe add, that I have ſometimes found benefit from nitre, camphor, and opium, given in pretty large doſes, and accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with plentiful dilution. But though theſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were often ſerviceable, and contributed, in many caſes, to moderate the high degree of irritability; yet the chief dependence of the cure was much better truſted to cold bathing. After the ſurface of the body had become ſufficiently relaxed, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious uſe of warm bathing and fomentations, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of cold bathing were wonderful. The exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive irritability was moderated or removed, and the powers of life were invigorated, in a very ſingular manner, in conſequence of it.</q>

If a perſon, newly arrived in the Weſt-Indies, has ſubjected himſelf to any of the cauſes which may produce this fever, previous to the attack he has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warning given him, if he will attend to it, and time enough, in general, to cure it by anticipation. For, as ſoon as any heavineſs, or reſtleſſneſs, or laſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or ſtretching and yawning is perceived, he has reaſon to expect that they are the harbingers of this tragedy, and he ſhould immediately be blooded, and take a doſe of ſalts, and dilute plentifully, and keep himſelf quiet and cool; and after the operation of the ſalts, he ſhould take ſmall doſes of <hi>James's powder,</hi> live low, and drink barley-water. After the body is well evacuated, and cooled, it is always prudent to take the bark.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt ſtage of the fever, when it has made a regular attack, when theſe precautions have not been uſed, or when they have failed, and the patient is no longer able to abſtain from his bed, he ſhould be kept in a large room, as cool as poſſible, covered lightly with bed-clothes, with a circulation of air admitted into the room, but not directly upon or near the bed: and this muſt be obſerved through the whole of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Bleeding muſt then be performed, and muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated every ſix or eight hours, or whenever the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acerbations come on, while the heat, fulneſs of pulſe, and pains continue; and, if theſe ſymptoms be violent and obſtinate, and do not abate during the firſt thirty-ſix or forty-eight hours of the fever, bleeding ſhould be executed <hi>uſque ad animi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

The blood taken away in the beginning is very flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, and of the arterial blood colour; and the ſurface never ſizy, and ſeldom contracted.</p>
                  <p>The intention of bleeding can be anſwered only by performing it immediately, and in the moſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive manner, which the high ſtate of inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the rapid progreſs of the diſeaſe, demand, Taking away only ſix or eight ounces of blood, becauſe the patient may faint, which is a ſymptom of the diſeaſe, is doing nothing towards the cure. Where bleeding is improper, no blood ſhould be taken; where it is proper, that quantity cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve—and it is loſing that time which can never be regained.</p>
                  <p>Bleeding, it is evident, muſt not be performed in any other ſtage of the diſeaſe than the firſt, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory ſtage; but this has been injudiciouſly done, which has given riſe to the notion, that a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will ſeldom bear more than two bleedings.</p>
                  <p>Many practitioners have been deterred from bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their patients from the depreſſion of the pulſe, and from the faintneſs which ſometimes accompanies the very firſt onſet of this fever; but here the pulſe always riſes, and the faintneſs diſappears, as the heart is relieved from its oppreſſion by the loſs of blood.</p>
                  <p>Faintneſs and depreſſion of the pulſe here are not to be conſidered like thoſe circumſtances where putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction has commenced, or where there has been long and fatiguing illneſs: they are ſymptoms here of <hi>ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora,</hi> the reverſe of inanition; and bleeding is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed for ſuch ſyncopes by two of the greateſt phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians the world has produced.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="unknown:030041_0144_0FE412FFAEB0AEB8"/>
Nor is fainting, during the operation, any reaſon for not repeating it, in the firſt ſtage of the fever; for I have often cured it by bleeding only: and it has frequently happened in the Weſt-Indies, that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental bleeding from the orifice, when a patient has fallen aſleep, to far greater quantities than has ever been directed to be taken away, has carried off the fever entirely; and the ſurpriſe on diſcovering a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of blood in the bed, has been changed to joy for the alteration it has produced in the patient.</p>
                  <p>The effects of nature would be oftener ſucceſsful than they are, were not her powers totally overcome in hot climates. Bleeding at the noſe, in the firſt ſtage of this fever, has ſometimes removed it; and it is as certain a ſolution of this fever, as it is of the <hi>cauſus</hi> in Europe.</p>
                  <p>In the early part of the diſeaſe ſpontaneous hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage is always critical, and ſhould never be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; afterwards it is ſymptomatical, and if not ſtopped, the patient ſoon ſinks under it.</p>
                  <p>Eruptions about the lips and noſe, painful biles, or phlegmons about the body, which always ſuppurate unkindly, or an abſceſs forming, are alſo critical, and generally terminate the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Sweating, in the firſt ſtage of the diſeaſe, is ſeldom critical. Whenever ſweats are critical, which may happen very early in the diſeaſe, if the patient has been well evacuated, they are accompanied with a ceſſation of vomiting, and a change in the appearance of the urine; the ſweating is then to be aſſiduouſly promoted, and if preceded by a bleeding of the noſe, it is a complete criſis.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="unknown:030041_0145_0FE413015CE37E18"/>
The ſickneſs of the ſtomach, and diſagreeable taſte in the mouth, indicate the quality, and not the quantity of the offending ſecretions. The vomiting is from irritation in the ſtomach, and not from plenitude; therefore vomits are never to be given, though ſtrongly adviſed by Towne: no, not ſo much as warm water, recommended by Hillary, for fear of exciting and ſtirring up that terrible operation, which, when once begun, no art can ſometimes allay.</p>
                  <p>When a ſufficient quantity of blood has been taken away, which is never done, let the patient's habit be what it may, while the heat, reiterated exacerbations, fluſhings in the face, thirſt, pains in the head, and burning in the eyes remain, the ſtep is to evacuate the contents of the bowels, and turn the humours downwards.</p>
                  <p>But if large and repeated bleedings, during the two firſt days, ſhould not remove the thirſt, pains, fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and heat in the eyes, and the ſtate of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach ſhould be ſuch as to reject every thing that is taken, ſo that there is no chance of procuring eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation by ſtool, the patient ſhould have repeated purgative glyſters, and be put in a tepid bath.</p>
                  <p>The bath ſhould be compoſed of a very weak de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of camomile flowers, in which a little nitre may be diſſolved, and a little vinegar added.</p>
                  <p>This will often remove every ſymptom at once, and diſpoſe the patient to a <hi>diaphoreſis,</hi> which muſt be promoted until a ſufficient quantity of ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative medicine can be taken, ſo as to make an effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual operation downwards.</p>
                  <p>There is ſeldom a neceſſity to repeat the bath, as the ſtrictures and tenſion generally yield to the firſt
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030041_0146_0FE413035308E4F0"/>
immerſion. The patient ſhould not remain long in the bath, nor ſhould it be deferred till late in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, for it can be of no uſe when the ſtomach is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Soft, ſmooth drinks, free from any ſtimulating tendency, ſuch as barley-water, always anſwer beſt for common drink, and are no impediment in the way of medicine.</p>
                  <p>Glyſters are to be frequently given in the beginning of the diſeaſe, particularly where the patient is coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and to precede the uſe of cathartics, and aſſiſt their operation.</p>
                  <p>The purging medicine to be uſed in the yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is the <hi>tartarum, vitriolatum chryſtaliſatum,</hi> or <hi>ſal polychreſtus,</hi> diſſolved in equal parts of <hi>ſimple cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon</hi> and <hi>common water,</hi> or in ſimple <hi>cinnamon-water</hi> alone. It muſt be given in ſmall doſes every hour, until it operates; and the patient is to dilute copiouſly while it operates, with very weak chicken broth. The quantity of the ſalt is four drachms, to ſix or eight ounces of water, (as much as the water will diſſolve) and the doſe of it may be two table ſpoonfuls. In defect of this medicine, ſoluble tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, or ſal catharticus amarus, or manna and cream of tartar, muſt be uſed. But let me caution practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners againſt adding tartar emetic, in order to quicken the operation of their medicines; which, however uſeful it may be in bilious diſeaſes, may be fatal in this.</p>
                  <p>Purging generally completes the ſuppreſſion of the fever, and carries off the vomiting; but it muſt be continued while the ſtools remain bilious, or foetid, otherwiſe the fever will riſe, and the vomiting return.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="unknown:030041_0147_0FE41304FB40A3E0"/>
In caſe the fever ſtill continues, the ſtomach ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, and the bowels well evacuated, recourſe muſt be had to ſudorifics: repeated doſes of James's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, efferveſcent draughts, and plentifully diluting with barley-water, or balm, or mint-tea, generally ſoon remove it.</p>
                  <p>An intermiſſion being procured, bark, in ſubſtance, is immediately to be given, and repeated every hour, in drachm doſes, if the ſtomach will bear it, until twelve drachms have been taken; which is generally a ſufficient ſecurity againſt the progreſs of the diſeaſe: but it muſt ſtill be continued, at longer intervals, for many days; interpoſing mild cathartics, ſuch as an infuſion of rhubarb and tamarinds, with, or without a ſmall quantity of ſal polychreſt, or by keeping the body from a coſtive ſtate by glyſters.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond ſtage, or <hi>metaptoſes</hi> of this fever, which I believe will ſeldom happen, where the preceding directions have been faithfully purſued, we muſt draw a diſtinct line, or boundary, in the very beginning of it, and put a final period to bleeding. In this alarming ſtate, all the ſkill and power of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic muſt be ſummoned up, and quickly too, to oppoſe the various breaches which the diſeaſe is now mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the entrance of death.</p>
                  <p>The ſtrength now begins to fail; the pulſe is ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the ſuffuſion of yellowneſs is perceived in the eyes, neck, and breaſt; the vomiting inceſſant, and the ſtomach rejects every thing that is ſwallowed. A coldneſs here, not ſucceeded by ſweat, or bilious diſcharges, is almoſt a certain mortal ſymptom.</p>
                  <p>In this ſtate nothing but purging can remove the vomiting, and ſave the patient's life. Here the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:030041_0148_0FE41308A8E56BE0"/>
of the humours begins, and the ſtools are acrid, corroſive, and foetid, to an extraordinary degree.</p>
                  <p>The misfortune here is, that the ſtomach, retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing, without great difficulty, oppoſes all our attempts. The tartarum vitriolatum, or ſal poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chreſt, is a nauſeous medicine: but there is no other proper medicine, of which a ſmall quantity will purge, which is the objection againſt tamarinds, cream of tartar, and manna; nor is there any other that I have ever found equally cooling and attenuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It muſt be given; and though part of it will be returned, yet ſome of it will remain; and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating a very ſmall quantity every hour, ſtools will, in time, be procured, and generally urine plentifully. If the patient have five or ſix ſtools, the vomiting will ceaſe. He muſt dilute with weak chicken broth.</p>
                  <p>Glyſters may aſſiſt, with warm fomentations fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently applied to the region of the praecordia, which ſometimes bring out a crop of acrid eruptions about the pit of the ſtomach, on which the vomiting gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ceaſes; but in caſe theſe attempts fail, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſhould be put into a tepid bath, and have a bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter applied to his back, or to the inſide of his thighs, or, what is more effectual, to the region of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; and a diaphoretic treatment adopted, with <hi>James's powder,</hi> in order to relieve the internal irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by revulſion, and enable the ſtomach to bear purgatives, which alone can carry off the offending humours, and remove that perverſion, as it were, of the periſtaltic motion, which is the ungovernable ſymptom, and, by its continuance, the moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mortal ſymptom of this fever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="unknown:030041_0149_0FE4130AD0A496F0"/>
As to what is called fever, there is nothing after the firſt ſtage of the diſeaſe that deſerves that name. Therefore, after the firſt ſtage, bark is always to be given, when the ſtomach will bear it. The worſt evil that generally attends the giving of bark here a little too early, is oppreſſion and load at the ſtomach; which, if glyſters do not remove, the purgative ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a watery infuſion of rhubarb, will; or the uniting ſome purgative medicine with the bark.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, ſoon after the firſt attack of the fever, an abatement of every ſymptom is obtained; and thoſe who are not well acquainted with the pulſe, and the extenſive evacuations this fever demands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that a remiſſion, or an intermiſſion, or a ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fever is decided. But when this happens before the third day, a ſtrict attention to the pulſe, and the excretions, will diſcover the deception, and ſhew, by their diſagreement with thoſe ſymptoms which appear favourable, that they appear ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a proper cauſe, and cannot be laſting.</p>
                  <p>They who unfortunately make any dependence here, deſiſt from further evacuations, and proceed to giving bark, and cordial nouriſhment. Every body about the patient is filled with flattering hopes of his recovery. But the evacuations have been diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued too ſoon, and have not been ſufficient to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh entirely the inflammatory diſpoſition of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; which, now aggravated, breaks out and rages with redoubled violence, and hurries the patient into the ſecond ſtage of the diſeaſe, and then ſoon out of the world.</p>
                  <p>A yellow ſuffuſion may be either critical, or ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatical. Critical, as Towne ſuppoſes; but it muſt
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:030041_0150_0FE4130C86329028"/>
be when there is a tranquil ceſſation, without languor, of all the other ſymptoms, with warm perſpiration; and ſymptomatical, as Hillary ſuppoſes, when accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with laſſitude, nauſea, or vomiting, colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſweats, and ſunken pulſe.</p>
               </q>

                  <q>Great diſputes have ariſen in this part of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, concerning the application of bliſters.</q> Bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, however, according to Doctor Moſely, <q>are found to be a ſafe and powerful remedy. Natives, and long reſidents in the Weſt-Indies are ſeldom diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by inflammatory diſeaſes, and bliſters can ſcarcely ever be applied amiſs. They give a ſtimulus to the languid veſſels, and form a drain for the acrid ſerum of the blood, which often keep up diſorders from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, obſtruction, and irritation.</q>

               <q>

                  <p>If the vomiting cannot be ſuppreſſed, and the bark retained:</p>
                  <p>The laſt ſtage of the diſeaſe appears with its dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vomiting; which at firſt has generally the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the grounds of coffee; then that of a ſlate colour, and then dark, thick, and grumous. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior ſurfaces of the body are oozing out blood into their cavities. Every excretion is corrupted blood.</p>
                  <p>I have ſeen people recover after the vomiting has reſembled coffee grounds, when any purgative medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, united with a decoction of bark, could be made to paſs downwards.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould not have thought it neceſſary to mention even the name of <hi>opium</hi> in this fever, had not Hillary
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:030041_0151_0FE4130E757EA808"/>
adviſed it, and others raſhly followed his advice in giving it, to check the vomiting in the beginning of this diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>In a fever ſo highly inflammatory, with the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach in a conſtant ſtate of inflammation, and the contents of the whole alimentary canal ſo hot and acrid, it muſt be, what I believe it often has been, a fatal medicine.</p>
                  <p>In regard to regimen, during the firſt three or four days, thin, ſoft, cooling drink, emulſion, and chicken broth, beſides the medicines, will be as much as the ſtomach can ſuſtain, even were any thing elſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. After the criſis, or after the firſt ſtage of the diſeaſe, panado, ſago, and gruel, are the moſt proper articles of nouriſhment, with the addition of a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Madeira wine, where the patient is weak, languid, and exhauſted. Wine cheriſhes the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and acts as a cordial, mixed with theſe nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhments; but if it be given in any other way, it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the head, and heats the patient. Wine, where it is neceſſary, ſhould be uſed in the ſame manner in all fevers.</p>

               </head>
               <q>
                  <p>In treating of the cure of the remittent fever, I ſhall give an account of the remedies, in the order in which they were adminiſtered when the fever had its moſt uſual appearance; and ſhall afterwards enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:030041_0152_0FE41313A454E740"/>
the means that were found moſt ſucceſsful in removing, or palliating particular ſymptoms, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>No diſeaſe requires more ſpeedy aſſiſtance; for the efficacy of the medicines employed depends, in a great meaſure, on their being given early.</p>
                  <p>If I ſee a patient during the firſt fit, I direct an ounce of Glauber's ſalt, or the ſame quantity of the bitter purging ſalt, to be diſſolved in half a pint of water, to which two drops of the oil of peppermint being added, four table ſpoonfuls of the ſolution are given every half hour, till it operates, or be all taken. As there is generally much ſickneſs at the ſtomach, it is given in ſmall doſes, leſt it ſhould excite vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The eſſential oil covers the taſte of the ſalt, and renders it leſs offenſive to the ſtomach.</p>
                  <p>It is probably of no great conſequence, what kind of purgative medicine is given, provided it operates effectually, and without violence.</p>
                  <p>After a few ſtools having been procured, the patient generally feels himſelf much eaſier, and a remiſſion often enſues. This is to be carefully watched for, and immediate advantage is to be taken of it, for adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Peruvian bark. The common doſe of this medicine is a drachm, which may be repeated every ſecond hour; and as a general rule in giving it, this is perhaps the beſt; but both the quantity and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val muſt often be varied, according to circumſtances. Where the preceding fit has been uncommonly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and there is reaſon to fear that the ſucceeding one will be ſtill more violent, and where a long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion cannot be depended upon, the doſe may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to two drachms, which may be given every hour. But few ſtomachs will bear ſo much, and
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:030041_0153_0FE41315512947B0"/>
ſometimes the bark cannot be given at all, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. In ſuch a caſe recourſe muſt be had to a decoction, or an infuſion.</p>
                  <p>In ſevere attacks of the fever, in which it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to watch for the remiſſion, in order to make the beſt advantage of it, whenever the pulſe becomes a little flower, and the heat begins to abate, a doſe or two of the infuſion may be given, and the powder added afterwards, as ſoon as the ſtomach will bear it. This I found the moſt certain way of moderating or preventing the next paroxyſm.</p>
                  <p>The vehicle in which the bark is given, muſt, in many caſes, be ſuited to the patient's ſtomach. It will ſometimes ſit eaſy on the ſtomach, when mixed with coffee, with wine and water, or with wine alone, if the remiſſion be conſiderable; in ſome caſes, it anſwers the ſame purpoſe to mix it with milk, or with a weak infuſion of camomile flowers. By theſe expedients the ſtomach is reconciled to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, is enabled to receive a larger quantity of it, and to retain it better.</p>
                  <p>It will ſometimes happen that the bark purges ſtrongly, and paſſes through the body almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed. This is not an unfavourable ſymptom, and the remedy is eaſy, for three or four drops of the <hi>tinct. thebaic.</hi> added to each doſe, ſoon put a ſtop to the purging.</p>
                  <p>When the method of cure laid down above is carefully put in practice from the beginning, it will, in many caſes, prevent a return of the fever; in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, however, a ſufficient quantity of bark cannot be given on the firſt remiſſion, nor is there time for it
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:030041_0154_0FE413170B1E1990"/>
to produce its effects upon the body, ſo as to prevent a ſecond paroxyſm.</p>
                  <p>The heat, reſtleſſneſs, anxiety, and indeed all the ſymptoms uſually accompanying the ſecond parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſm, are more violent than in the firſt, if nothing has been done in the remiſſion to ſtop the progreſs of the fever; but if the length of the remiſſion, and the ſtate of the ſtomach have admitted of the liberal uſe of the bark, it has a conſiderable effect upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing fit. The ſymptoms run high, but the ſtrength of the patient appears more equal to the ſtruggle; the paroxyſm is ſharp, but it is of ſhort duration, and the remiſſion that follows is of the completeſt kind.</p>
                  <p>The medicine that I have found moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to relieve the ſymptoms during the paroxyſms, and promote a remiſſion, is James's powder. It is given in ſmall doſes, ſeldom exceeding five grains, and is repeated every three or four hours. If the ſtomach be in an irritable ſtate, the doſe is often not larger than half the quantity juſt mentioned; for, as has been obſerved before no ſymptom of the diſeaſe is more troubleſome or dangerous than vomiting; in the cure, therefore, care muſt be taken to avoid every thing that might induce or aggravate any tendency that way. The moſt ſalutary operation of James's powder is, either to excite a ſweat, or gently open the body. There is ſeldom occaſion to give James's powder in the firſt paroxyſm, that being occupied by the purgative medicine; but if the fit continues as long as forty-eight hours, and the purge has been given and produced
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:030041_0155_0FE4131913258510"/>
the full effect, and ſtill there is no remiſſion, James's powder may be given in the manner juſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by exciting a ſweat, or further gently open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body, it promotes a remiſſion of the fever.</p>
                  <p>In ſubſequent attacks, the ſame courſe is to be followed; that is, ſmall doſes of James's powder are to be given during the paroxyſm, and the bark in remiſſions.</p>
                  <p>If James's powder does not keep the body open, which it ſeldom fails to do, laxative glyſters are of uſe; for it is to be obſerved, that one or two ſtools in the twenty-four hours, greatly relieve the ſick, and promote the good effects of the bark. This is particularly the caſe in the fevers ſubſequent to the rains in September and October, which are of the worſt kind. In ſuch it is frequently advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to join four or five grains of rhubarb, to each doſe of the bark, in order to procure two or three motions in a day.</p>
                  <p>I have had occaſion to mention, that no ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are more dangerous than violent retching and vomiting, and nothing can be more pernicious than the uſe of emetics in ſuch circumſtances. If there be ſickneſs and vomiting at the beginning of the diſeaſe camomile-tea, or warm water, are ſufficient to cleanſe the ſtomach. If the vomiting or retch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill continues after making uſe of them, which they will often do, and harraſs the ſick, even dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a remiſſion of the other ſymptoms, ſaline draughts, in a ſtate of efferveſcence, repeated every hour, or oftener, will frequently allay this diſtreſſing ſymptom. The ſtomach is alſo relieved by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body, which further tends greatly to check
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:030041_0156_0FE4131E8CA117E0"/>
the vomiting; but as cathartic medicines would be immediately thrown up, purgative glyſters are the only means that can be employed for that purpoſe, and it is neceſſary ſometimes to repeat them ſeveral times. In this way the vomiting is often quieted, and the ſtomach enabled to retain the bark.</p>
                  <p>It will ſometimes, however, happen, in the worſt fevers, that the retchings are not abated by the effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcing draughts, which are themſelves thrown up. In ſuch caſes I have had recourſe to opiates, and generally with ſucceſs. From fifteen to twenty drops of the <hi>tinct. thebaic.</hi> may be added to an efferveſcing draught, or given in a little Briſtol water, and repeated in two or three hours, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the exigency of the ſymptoms.</p>
                  <p>The vomiting being overcome, the bark muſt be given with diligence, yet with caution at firſt, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the infuſion, or decoction, and adding the ſubſtance as the ſtomach will bear it.</p>
                  <p>During the acceſſion of fever there is commonly more or leſs of head-ach, which ſometimes becomes extremely violent, and greatly diſtreſſes the patient. A bliſter, applied between the ſhoulders, ſeldom or ever fails either to relieve, or entirely remove this ſymptom.</p>
                  <p>In the very low ſtate that was mentioned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſucceed violent paroxyſms, eſpecially in thoſe fevers that were attended with yellowneſs of the ſkin, nothing was ſo uſeful as cordials; for, though the bark was not entirely laid aſide, yet the quantity the ſtomach would bear, in any form, was ſo ſmall that little could be expected from it. Wine and nouriſhment were the beſt cordials.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="unknown:030041_0157_0FE3F186E3F4E520"/>
The nouriſhment which Doctor Hunter recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, conſiſts of chicken broth, panado, ſago, ſalop, thin gruels, and tea, in which bread has been ſoaked. <q>To all theſe, except the broth and tea, wine may be added, with ſugar and nutmeg, or any other ſpice that is more agreeable. It is of the utmoſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in giving both nouriſhment and wine, that it be repeated often, and that only a little be ſwallowed at a time; for the ſtomach is eaſily overloaded, and provoked to vomit.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>When the ſick are greatly reduced, after two or more paroxyſms of fever, wine and nouriſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more eſſential than medicine.</p>
                  <p>In treating the ſick, I have ſuppoſed the method of cure to be put in practice from the beginning of the diſeaſe; but this cannot always be the caſe, as, for various and obvious reaſons, a firſt, or even a ſecond paroxyſm may have paſſed before any thing is done towards the cure. In this ſituation, if there be a remiſſion, and the preceding fit has been violent, and there is reaſon to believe that the ſucceeding one will be more ſo, it is not adviſable to loſe three or four hours in giving an opening medicine, which muſt therefore be omitted, and the bark adminiſtered directly. In order, however, to prevent any ſenſe of fulneſs, either in the ſtomach or bowels, which might ariſe from that medicine, and likewiſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the operation of it upon the conſtitution, ſome opening medicine is joined to it, ſo as to procure three or four ſtools in the twenty-four hours. With this view, four or five grains of rhubarb may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to each doſe of the bark.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="unknown:030041_0158_0FE4132036B00BB8"/>
If a delirium, with a conſiderable degree of wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and agitation, which ſometimes prevail during the paroxyſm, continue after the uſual evacuations, an opiate, given in a moderate doſe, and repeated after two or three hours, will, in ſome caſes, have a good effect in quieting it, and thereby promote a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the fever.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Doctor Hunter, in his obſervations on the effect of remedies, remarks; <q>Blood-letting well deſerves to be conſidered. In ſuch caſes as ſeemed moſt to require it, for example, where the patient was young, ſtrong, of a full habit, and lately arrived from Europe; where the pulſe was quick and full, the face fluſhed with great heat and head-ach, and all theſe at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fever, bleeding did no good. It neither diminiſhed the ſymptoms for the time, nor procured a ſpeedier remiſſion. I cannot ſay, however, that it did that miſchief that has been imputed to it by ſome; for, provided it were a moderate quantity, it could hardly be ſaid to produce any ill conſequences. But if it were copious, or repeated a ſecond time, it was always hurtful, and rendered the recovery of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient extremely ſlow, if not attended with worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. This effect it had in the inflammations of the lungs that ſometimes happened, in which it was neceſſary to bleed freely. It will not be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a recommendation of bleeding to ſay, that there were ſome caſes in which it did little or no harm, if uſed moderately; yet ſuch is the concluſion, to which the obſervations I had an opportunity of making lead me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="unknown:030041_0159_0FE413222D378BD8"/>
IT will be recollected that I ſet out with a reſolution, from which I am unwilling to depart, to make no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the doctrines, or method of cure, of thoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors who have written largely and learnedly on the bilious remittent fever; but I cannot forbear making a remark or two on the practice of adminiſtering of bark. My own experience authorizes me to ſay, as in page 105, that I never knew it <hi>ſafe or uſeful, until an entire ſolution of the diſeaſe took place;</hi> or at leaſt when no ſymptoms of importance remained, except the <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> of ſevere fever, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                  <hi>mere debility.</hi> That the bark is too indiſcriminately given, and without due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the condition of the firſt paſſages, cannot have eſcaped the notice of the moſt inattentive; and to me it appears evident, that in thoſe caſes where it is given in the early ſtages of the diſeaſe, unleſs it acts as a gentle purgative, it ſeldom fails to do miſchief, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly if the pain be conſiderable in the head, or any tenſion or ſenſe of fulneſs remains in either of the larger cavities. To <hi>throw in the bark,</hi> as the phraſe is, after the firſt obſcure remiſſions in fevers of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ſort, <hi>particularly in theſe northern climates,</hi> is a practice, in my judgment, if not calculated to endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the life, of the patient, at leaſt ſuch as to protract, in many inſtances, the continuance of the moſt formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſymptoms. This fact is correſpondent with the obſervations and experience of ſeveral practitioners of medicine in this city, who ſtand deſervedly high in their profeſſion. The celebrated traveller Bruce, who was alſo a phyſician, informs us, that in Maſuah, on the coaſt of the Red Sea, a certain ſpecies of fever prevails, which, in that country, is called <hi>nedad,</hi> and which, when it terminates fatally, is generally on the third day.
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:030041_0160_0FE41323D8B950B0"/>
In this fever there is no remedy ſo ſovereign as the bark; but he poſitively aſſerts that it does not ſucceed unleſs <hi>it acts as a purgative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſecond or third doſe of the bark, (ſays he) if any quantity is ſwallowed, never fails to purge; and if this evacuation is copious, the patient rarely dies, but on the contrary, his recovery is generally rapid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He further adds, <q>bark, I have been told by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, who have been in South-America, purges al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways when taken in their fevers. A different cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, different regimen and habit of body, or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, may ſurely ſo far alter the operation of a drug, as to make it have a different effect in Africa to what it has in Europe. Be that as it may, ſtill I ſay bark is a purgative, when it is ſucceſsful in this fever,</q> &amp;c.</p>
