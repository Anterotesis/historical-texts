            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And O, that both <hi>You</hi> and <hi>I</hi> may be, <hi>by Him,</hi> enabled to ſpeak, and hear, as it becometh the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of CHRIST, and the <hi>Oracles</hi> of GOD!</p>
            <p>The Words before us are the Words of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> who is no other but CHRIST, <hi>in whom are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, by <hi>Wiſdom</hi> we are ſometimes, <hi>in Scripture,</hi> to underſtand an <hi>Attribute</hi> of the divine Nature; and ſometimes <hi>Religion</hi> is hereby intended: But the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſpoken of, or rather <hi>who ſpeaketh,</hi> in my Text, is no other but the <hi>Second</hi> glorious Subſiſtence in the adorable <hi>Trinity:</hi> For, "perſonal Qualities and Properties, Affections and Effects are predicated of <hi>this Wiſdom,"</hi> as is obvious to any who will conſult the Context, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Chapter. As alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 20,—23. Where we read, not only of <hi>Wiſdom's crying aloud</hi> to Sinners, and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulating</hi> with them becauſe of their Dilatorineſs and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs, and <hi>exhorting</hi> them to turn at his Reproof; but moreover, a <hi>Promiſe</hi> is added, that if they would indeed turn unto GOD, then, <hi>I</hi> (ſays <hi>Wiſdom) will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my Words</hi> (i. e.) more clearly and effectually, <hi>unto you.</hi>—Which promiſe of pouring out <hi>his Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. ſufficiently evinces the <hi>Perſonality</hi> of <hi>this Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Nor <hi>can this Perſon</hi> reaſonably be tho't to be any other but the SON of GOD.</p>
            <p>'Tis HE, I ſay, who tells us, as in the Text, <hi>by me Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here we may take Notice of <hi>Three</hi> Things;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Words not only have reſpect to the <hi>King,</hi> who is ſupreme; but alſo to <hi>others</hi> who bear Rule under him; including, doubtleſs, the <hi>various Degrees</hi> and Orders of Men concern'd in the <hi>Civil</hi> Government, of what particular Title or Denomination ſoever; for, both the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> and the <hi>Executive</hi> Powers are here ſpecify'd; Judges as well as Kings.—Yea, and the Words do moſt probably refer alſo to the <hi>various Forms</hi> of civil Government which are in the World; for the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anner</hi> of Expreſſion is applicable to <hi>each</hi> of them.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:006593_0005_102947E1B6AB4CE0"/>
2. 'Tis plainly hinted to us, <hi>when</hi> the civil Powers may be ſaid to <hi>Rule well, viz.</hi> when they <hi>decree Juſtice,</hi> that is, juſt and good <hi>Laws</hi> (the <hi>Abſtract</hi> being put for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete</hi>) and not only Decree, but alſo <hi>Execute</hi> the ſame: For otherwiſe, the Decrees wou'd be quite vain and inſignificant. Kings and others in ſubordination to them are not exalted, meerly, that ſo they might be in a State of Superiority over their Fellow-Men: No, they are to Rule; but then their manner of Rule muſt be <hi>ſuited</hi> to the <hi>Ends</hi> of civil Society, and for the promoting of the public Good; which neceſſarily implys the <hi>Executing</hi> as well as the Decreeing of Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. and <hi>laſtly;</hi> We are expreſsly told, <hi>by whom</hi> it is that Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice.—<hi>By Me,</hi> ſays the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of GOD, or the <hi>Son</hi> of GOD. <hi>Q. D.</hi> They derive their Authority <hi>from Me:</hi> And moreover, <hi>by Me,</hi> are they quickned and enabled, <hi>firſt,</hi> to Decree; and <hi>then,</hi> to Execute juſt and good Laws; and thereby to anſwer the great End of their exalted Station.</p>
            <p>Some read it, <hi>For</hi> me; others, <hi>In</hi> me, Kings reign—But I ſhall conſider the Text according to our Tranſlation, which is the ſame with the <hi>Marginal</hi> reading.</p>
            <p>So that, from the Words we may note this</p>
            <p>
               <label>DOCTRINE.</label>
That it is <hi>from</hi> the LORD JESUS CHRIST that Kings and all other civil Rulers do <hi>derive</hi> their Authority: And it is by <hi>Him</hi> alſo, that they do <hi>exerciſe</hi> the ſame <hi>in a due manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may be ſpoken to under <hi>two</hi> Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Kings and all other civil Rulers <hi>derive</hi> their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>from</hi> CHRIST. And 2. It is <hi>by him</hi> alſo, that they <hi>exerciſe</hi> the ſame <hi>in a due manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PROP. I. That Kings and all other civil Rulers do <hi>derive</hi> their Power and Authority <hi>from</hi> CHRIST.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By Me,</hi> ſays <hi>Wiſdom, Kings reign</hi>—: And <hi>By Me, Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I ſhall, 1. In a more <hi>general</hi> Way (in ſome meaſure) evince the Truth of. And then, 2. For further Illuſtration,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006593_0006_102947E354FB3358"/>
ſhall mention <hi>in what Reſpects,</hi> civil Rulers may be ſaid to derive their Authority from CHRIST.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt;</hi> I am, in a more <hi>general</hi> Way (in ſome meaſure) to evince the Truth of this Propoſition.</p>
            <p>Here then let it be conſidered.</p>
            <p>That <hi>all Power both in Heaven and on Earth is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> CHRIST. True indeed; as he is GOD co-eſſential, and co-eternal with the <hi>Father,</hi> ſo, he is <hi>equal</hi> with him in Power and Glory: But as God-Man and <hi>Mediator,</hi> ſo all Power was <hi>given</hi> to him. This Doctrine was known and receiv'd under the <hi>old Teſtament;</hi> for it was not only Decreed, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhou'd have the Kingdom, but alſo this Decree was <hi>publiſhed. Pſal.</hi> 2. 6,—9. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 6, 7. and to the ſame Purport, in many other Scriptures of the <hi>old Teſtament.</hi>—And agreeable hereto, our LORD JESUS <hi>himſelf</hi> told his Diſciples, as in Mat. 28. 18. <hi>All Power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> And John 5. 22. <hi>The Father judgeth no Man, but hath committed all Judgment unto the Son:</hi>—And this ſame Doctrine was afterwards taught by his <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> Thus <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, that JESUS CHRIST <hi>was</hi> LORD <hi>of all.</hi> Acts 10. 36. And the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> ſays, as in Phil. 2. 9. 10, 11. GOD <hi>hath highly exalted him,—that at the Name of</hi> JESUS, <hi>every Knee ſhould bow,—and and that every Tongue ſhould confeſs, that</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>is</hi> LORD. And in Eph. 1. 20, 21, 22. <hi>And ſet him at his own right Hand—far above all Principality and Power—in this World, and that which is to come. And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the Head over all things to the Church.</hi> i. e. for the Benefit of the ſame.</p>
            <p>SO that, 'tis evident, that our LORD JESUS CHRIST is the ſole univerſal <hi>Monarch;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> by <hi>Donation</hi> and <hi>Unction</hi> from the <hi>Father.</hi> He ruleth not only in the Kingdom of Grace, but alſo in that of <hi>Providence:</hi> And may therefore very fitly ſay, as in my Text, <hi>By me Kings reign,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p>That our LORD JESUS CHRIST does <hi>actually exerciſe</hi> this his Kingly Power and Authority. He does not ſit in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, meerly, as a <hi>Spectator,</hi> or, only to behold the Things which are done here, upon the Earth, No; but he <hi>actually</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:006593_0007_102947E54E8CC6F8"/>
orders and over-rules according to his own good Will and Pleaſure, and yet, always in Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs.—This is <hi>that Judge of all the Earth</hi> (ſpoken of in Gen. 18. 25.) <hi>who can doe no other but right. The Sceptre of his Kingdom is a right Sceptre.</hi>—And he is <hi>Wiſe</hi> as well as Righteous in all his Adminiſtrations, and is fitly ſtiled <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as in my <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, all ſuch are groſsly miſtaken who imagine, either, that it is <hi>beneath the</hi> LORD JESUS, now, in his State of Exaltation, to regard Men and Things here below: Or, that it is too great a <hi>Burden</hi> for him to inſpect and govern in all Affairs: For, <hi>He by whom all things were made,</hi> does not think it <hi>beneath</hi> him to govern the World: Nor is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the ſame, in any meaſure <hi>tedious</hi> to him, who, <hi>as GOD,</hi> is preſent in all Places, and is alſo infinite in Power, and in all other divine Perfections:—As in making the World, <hi>He ſpake and it was done, he commanded and it ſtood faſt;</hi> even ſo, by a Word's ſpeaking, he can, now, put quite another Face upon Things, and make all the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are on the Earth, to ſerve his own Purpoſe and Glory: Yea, and he <hi>actually</hi> does ſo, from time to time; for he <hi>cauſeth the Wrath of Man to praiſe him, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Wrath he reſtrains.</hi> Pſal 76. 10.—'Tis not only a truth that the Kingdom is CHRIST's, but moreover, he <hi>really</hi> preſides <hi>as Governour among the Nations.</hi> Pſal. 22. 28. He not only has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Honour to ſuſtain the Title and Character, but alſo <hi>acts</hi> the part, and <hi>does</hi> the Buſineſs of an Univerſal Monarch.—And it was with this View, <hi>Namely,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and embolden his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to proceed in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, notwithſtanding all Oppoſitions, that he informed them, before his Aſcenſion into Heaven, that <hi>all Power was given unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then,</p>
            <p>Our LORD JESUS CHRIST does not ordinarily exerciſe his Power and Authority over Men, <hi>immediately,</hi> or by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>only:</hi> Nay, but for the moſt part, he employs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves <hi>ſome,</hi> by whom he ruleth over <hi>others</hi> of 'em.—True indeed; he ſometimes executeth Judgment on his Enemies <hi>without the hand of Man?</hi> and this he does to make his
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006593_0008_102947E851D264A8"/>
Power known, and to proclaim his Holineſs, as alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince People of an over-ruling Providence, and that all around may hear, and be afraid to doe the like Wickedneſs. Pſal. 9. 16. <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>is known by the Judgment which he executeth; the Wicked is ſnared in the Work of his own Hands.</hi>—'Tis alſo true, that our LORD JESUS does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in a very <hi>ſignal</hi> manner, protect and defend his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Servants and People; <hi>viz.</hi> When he obſerves that otherwiſe, they, together with his own Cauſe and Intereſt, will ſuffer great Wrong: And from hence, many have been induc'd to acknowledge (as in Pſal. 58. <hi>ult) Verily there is a Reward for the Righteous; verily he is a GOD that judgeth in the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet, I ſay, that the LORD JESUS does ordinarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his Authority over Men, by ſome of their own Species: For 'tis obvious to all of us, that ſome Men do actually bear Rule over others: And 'tis alſo evident from my Text, and from many others (which I ſhall have occaſion to mention) that civil Rulers have and receive their Authority from CHRIST: They rule by and under him.</p>
            <p>And <hi>this</hi> is to be <hi>further</hi> illuſtrated and confirmed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> By ſhewing <hi>in what Reſpects</hi> Kings and other civil Rulers may be ſaid to derive their Power and Authority <hi>from</hi> CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Here then,</p>
            <p>In the 1<hi>ſt</hi> place; Let it be remarked, that civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf is <hi>an Inſtitution of</hi> CHRIST. 'Tis not barely a Permiſſion of Providence, no, but an Appointment of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: The Diſtinction of Rulers and Ruled is not the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of crafty and ambitious Men, no, but of divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>But then, to prevent a miſtake; let it be here obſerved, that I am <hi>not</hi> now ſpeaking of <hi>any particular Form</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; for it does not appear, that any one Form or Species of civil Government is eſtabliſhed by CHRIST: Nay, but this Matter ſeems to be left to the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> of each Nation and Language: And accordingly, 'tis eaſy to obſerve, that one Manner and Form of Government ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains in one Nation and Country; and another in another;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006593_0009_102947EB7953ACA8"/>
and a third is different from both; and a fourth differs from all three.</p>
            <p>But what I aſſert is, that CHRIST has appointed that there ſhall be civil Government in ſome Form or other: 'Tis of divine Original, from Heaven and not of Men, that there be Rulers over Men, and that they be taken from among Men.—The <hi>Gentiles</hi> had their Kings; yea, and a Principle of Self-preſervation, which is a Branch of the Law of Nature, led them hereunto; and this Law of Nature is no other but the <hi>Law of GOD.</hi>—But then, the <hi>Examples</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> relating hereto, which are upon Record in the holy Scriptures, do render this Article inconteſtible.—For, it was the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Cov'nant,</hi> or, the <hi>Son of GOD,</hi> who long before his Incarnation, appeared unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in a <hi>Flame of Fire out of the midſt of a Buſh,</hi> and appointed him to lead his People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to be <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Jeſhurun.</hi>—And <hi>Joſhua</hi> had the honour aſſign'd to him, <hi>by the ſame</hi> divine Perſon, of leading the ſeveral Tribes into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and of making Room for them there.—After him, ſeveral <hi>Judges</hi> being au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized from Heaven, preſided over <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſucceſſively.—And then, there was a Succeſſion of <hi>Kings,</hi> and that by the expreſs Direction and Appointment of the <hi>moſt High.</hi>—I might have obſerv'd alſo, that even before the Death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it was the Pleaſure of the LORD <hi>of Hoſts,</hi> that there ſhould be not only a Commander in Chief, but alſo Rulers under him, viz. <hi>Rulers of thouſands,—of hundreds—of fifties, and—of tens.</hi> Yea, while <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in the Wilderneſs, a National Council was appointed, conſiſting of <hi>ſeventy Elders,</hi> and call'd the grand <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi>—By which it appears, that altho' the <hi>Jews</hi> were (for a ſeaſon) more directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately than any other People, under the divine Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (and therefore their Government is call'd a <hi>Theocracy</hi>) yet, it was the Will of GOD, that they ſhou'd <hi>even then,</hi> be under the Government of <hi>Men alſo,</hi> like themſelves, and of their own Nation.</p>
            <p>And when our LORD appear'd in the Fleſh, he was ſo far from diſclaiming civil Government, that, by what he <hi>ſaid</hi> and <hi>did,</hi> he confirm'd and eſtabliſh'd it; for, he exhorted the People <hi>to pay Tribute to Caeſar;</hi> nor did he refuſe to do the ſame <hi>himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:006593_0010_102947EE6F1E2DF8"/>
And agreable hereto, the holy and inſpir'd <hi>Apoſtles</hi> taught the ſame Doctrine, and have ſtrictly enjoyn'd <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be in Subjection to the civil Authority, namely, <hi>as an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of GOD.</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>begin:</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>And indeed; <hi>this</hi> divine Inſtitution is an unſpeakable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Mankind: Alas! what wou'd Men do, if they had no Rulers to controul them, but even like the Fiſhes in the Sea, or, as the wild Beaſts in the Deſart, the greater devour the leſs?</p>
            <p>And now, I ſay, ſeeing civil Government is an Inſtitution of our LORD <hi>Redeemer,</hi> therefore Kings and all ſubordinate Rulers, do, <hi>in this reſpect,</hi> derive their Authority <hi>from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, beſides this,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Kings and other civil Rulers are, <hi>Themſelves,</hi> of our LORD's appointing and advancing. Some Kingdoms, indeed, are <hi>Hereditary</hi> and others <hi>Elective;</hi> but however, <hi>the Powers that be, are ordained of GOD.</hi> (Rom. 13. 1.) Here the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle by a <hi>Metonimy</hi> of the <hi>Adjunct</hi> for the <hi>Subject,</hi> puts the <hi>Power</hi> for the <hi>Perſon,</hi> in whom it is lodg'd. And "if the <hi>Power</hi> itſelf be of GOD's ordaining, ſo likewiſe are the <hi>Perſons</hi> inveſted with it: For, Power to act always ſuppoſes ſome Subject inveſted with that Power, and that in order to the exerting of it."</p>
            <p>'Tis evident to all Men, that there are many and different Poſts of Honour and Service in one and the ſame Form of Adminiſtration: Some are in higher, and others in lower Stations. We read (in 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14.) <hi>of the King as Supreme, and of Governours as ſent by him:</hi> And beſides theſe, there are different Ranks and Degrees of Men, and accordingly, have different Buſineſs aſſign'd them. Some are concern'd in the <hi>Legiſlative,</hi> and others in the <hi>Executive</hi> part, and ſome in <hi>both.</hi>—But whoever they be that are veſted with Authority, they are introduc'd and advanc'd thereunto <hi>by</hi> our LORD JESUS CHRIST.—I don't mean, as in former Times, in a way of ſpecial <hi>Nomination,</hi> or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Deſignation; No, but in a <hi>Mediate</hi> way and manner: <hi>That is,</hi> by the Mediation of <hi>Men,</hi> and according to the divers Conſtitutions of Kingdoms and States: But then, the all governing <hi>Providence</hi> of the LORD <hi>of all the Earth is</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:006593_0011_102947F28CCE55E8"/>
               <hi>always concern'd herein:</hi> As they are veſted with his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and hold under him, ſo 'tis <hi>He,</hi> who <hi>in his Providence,</hi> promotes them to Honour and Dignity. 1 Sam. 2. 8. <hi>He raiſeth up the Poor out of the Duſt—to ſet them among Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces—for the Pillars of the Earth</hi> (meaning civil Rulers) <hi>are the</hi> LORD's, <hi>and he hath ſet the World</hi> (of Mankind) <hi>upon them;</hi> to be, <hi>under him,</hi> guided and govern'd <hi>by them.</hi> And agreably, in Pſal. 75. 6, 7. <hi>Promotion cometh not from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South; but</hi> GOD <hi>is the Judge, he putteth down one, and ſetteth up another.</hi> Theſe <hi>Shields of the Earth</hi> are ſaid <hi>to belong to</hi> GOD: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they both rule under him, and are <hi>ſet up by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this holds true, not only with reſpect to ſuch, who rule in and over the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of GOD; but alſo, as to thoſe, who <hi>bear rule over</hi> the <hi>Heathen.</hi> And agreably, we read of ſome <hi>Heathen</hi> Princes, that they were exalted <hi>by</hi> GOD. <hi>He raiſed up Pharaoh.</hi> Exod. 9. 16. And he calls <hi>Nebuchadnezzar his Servant.</hi> Jer. 25. 9. And he ſtyles <hi>Cyrus,</hi> his <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and his <hi>Anointed.</hi> Iſa. 44. <hi>ult.</hi> and 45. 1. And the ſame is true concerning all others; for, GOD <hi>reigneth over the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi> Pſal. 47. 8.</p>
            <p>Yea, and even ſuch Rulers who prove themſelves to be no other but <hi>Tyrants,</hi> theſe alſo are exalted by <hi>the most High.</hi>—Such an one as <hi>Hazael,</hi> who diſcover'd more of the Beaſt than of the Man, yet, GOD <hi>had ſhewed</hi> to the Prophet, that he ſhould be <hi>King</hi> over <hi>Syria;</hi> yea, and foretold what Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Barbarities he wou'd be guilty of. 2 Kings 8. 12, 13. <hi>Not,</hi> that the <hi>Abuſe</hi> of Power is <hi>from</hi> GOD, No, but yet the <hi>Power</hi> it ſelf <hi>is his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it at all inconſiſtent with the Government and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of GOD, ſometimes to advance ſuch to bear rule over Men, whom he fore-knows will be no better than Beaſts of Prey: Nay, but he illuſtrates his Holineſs, and preſerves the Honour of his Government, while he <hi>thus puniſhes</hi> a ſinful People for their Wickedneſs. And a very dreadful Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, truly it is, For, <hi>as a roaring Lyon, and a ranging Bear ſo is a wicked Ruler over the poor People.</hi> Prov. 28. 15.</p>
            <p>I may add,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That civil Rulers may be ſaid to have and to hold their
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006593_0012_102947F563E73920"/>
Power and Authority <hi>from</hi> CHRIST, and to rule <hi>by him,</hi> in that, they bear Rule, <hi>but only during his good Pleaſure.</hi> As it is he who exalts them, ſo it is he (and no other) who holds their Souls in Life, and who <hi>continues</hi> them in their exalted Stations.—Whenever he pleaſeth, he removeth them from their Seats of Dignity, either by Death, or in ſome other Way: For, <hi>by him the Bows of the mighty are broken, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who upholds Kings, and all in Authority under them, whether they be conſidered as <hi>Men,</hi> or as <hi>Rulers:</hi> They receive both their Authority for Government, and their Power for Action from him: And they can't perform one Act of Power, nor yet move one ſingle Step without him, nor one Moment longer than he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>This may ſuffice for the <hi>firſt</hi> Propoſition.</p>
            <p>PROP. II. It is alſo <hi>from</hi> and <hi>by</hi> CHRIST that Kings and other civil Rulers do exerciſe their Power and Authority <hi>in a due manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice,</hi> or, juſt and good Laws.</p>
            <p>Not the Abuſe, but the <hi>due Exerciſe</hi> of Power is <hi>from him:</hi> He can't be the <hi>Author</hi> of Confuſion, or of any Sin; but <hi>from him cometh down every good and every perfect Gift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now under this Head, 1. I may ſhow, <hi>What is imply'd</hi> in Princes decreeing Juſtice: Or, <hi>when</hi> civil Rulers may be ſaid to exerciſe their Authority <hi>in a due manner.</hi> And then,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006593_0013_102947F6F5749DB8"/>
2. Evince and Prove, that it is <hi>from</hi> CHRIST, that they ſo do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt;</hi> I am to ſhow, <hi>what is imply'd</hi> in Princes decreeing Juſtice; or, <hi>when</hi> civil Rulers may be ſaid to exerciſe their Authority <hi>in a due manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>in General;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It implies, that they ſhould have the ſeveral Qualifications, which are neceſſary to ſit them for Government: And alſo denotes, that their Authority ought to be improv'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd for promoting the <hi>good</hi> of the <hi>Public:</hi>—For, it is not the End of the Inſtitution, that ſome Men may have the Opportunity, meerly, to ſerve themſelves; No, but that they may be <hi>Benefactors</hi> to the People, or, <hi>Miniſters of</hi> GOD <hi>unto them for good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, this cannot be unleſs they <hi>both</hi> Decree and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute Juſtice.—You obſerve I ſaid, <hi>Execute</hi> as well as Decree Juſtice: For, altho' <hi>that</hi> be not <hi>expreſs'd</hi> in the Text, yet, it is <hi>neceſſarily imply'd,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Executive</hi> Power is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable from Rule and Government: Without the Exerciſe of <hi>this,</hi> a Power to decree Juſtice wou'd be of no avail.</p>
            <p>But to be more Particular;</p>
            <p n="1">1. It implies, that Rulers ſhou'd be <hi>able Men;</hi> that is, ſhou'd be furniſhed with a good meaſure of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> according to their reſpective Poſts and Stations in the Kingdom or Common-wealth.—Every Man, and every <hi>Ruler</hi> in particular, ſhou'd be well acquainted with his BIBLE, and improve the ſame as the Man of his Counſel:—But then, beſides this, he ſhou'd have a right underſtanding of <hi>the Conſtitution</hi> he is under, both civil and religious, and eſpecially the <hi>former:</hi> As alſo, a good Acquaintance with the Laws of his Country.—Nor may he, if in <hi>an exalted</hi> Station, be ignorant of the <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that ſo he may deſcry to what <hi>Dangers</hi> they <hi>expoſe</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and being furniſh'd with <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> may be capable of forming a right Judgment what Methods wou'd be the moſt probable Means of <hi>Prevention.</hi>—And in ſhort, he ſhould be acquainted with Books and Men too, and in particular, with the <hi>State</hi> of the Province, that ſo, <hi>having underſtanding of the Times,</hi> he may know what is moſt <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> to be ſaid or done in this or that particular Juncture, and may provide
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006593_0014_102947F9E693FA00"/>
accordingly.—It was the Commendation of the Heads of the Tribe of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> (1 Chron. 12. 32.) that <hi>they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Times, to know what</hi> Iſrael <hi>ought to do.</hi> And 'tis mention'd (<hi>Eſt.</hi> 1. 13.) as an Eſſential Part of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>States-Men,</hi> viz. that they are <hi>ſuch as know the Times.</hi> And truly, without this Knowledge, a People can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be provided, from one Time to another, with ſuch Laws as are juſt and good, ſuitable and proper.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Decreeing of Juſtice does alſo imply, that in a <hi>mixed</hi> Government, ſuch as <hi>Our's</hi> is, there ought to be ſpecial Care taken to preſerve, what may be call'd "a Ballance of Power" For, neither Part of the Legiſlature, may with any ſhow, either of Honour or <hi>Juſtice,</hi> invade the Province of the other; Nay, but by ſo doing, the Political Fabrick it ſelf muſt ſoon fall, and thereby Government be at an End. Such is the good Conſtitution in <hi>Britain,</hi> and ſo <hi>among our</hi> ſelves, "that the Powers of each are limited, and bro't to an happy Poiſe; Power and Priviledge are ſo twiſted together, and inlaid in the Foundation of the Conſtitution, as not to bear a Separation without a mutual Deſtruction". So that, I ſay, it is the <hi>firſt</hi> Point of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and Righteouſneſs in a Kingdom or Province, to act up to the Conſtitution.</p>

            <p>That it belongs to the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Powers to take the moſt effectual C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But then, beſides this; It will be but an Act of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> in the ſaid <hi>Honourable Powers</hi> to make effectual Proviſion alſo, that all and every of the People's <hi>Weights</hi> and <hi>Meaſures,</hi> by which they Buy and Sell, may be preſerv'd from Time to Time, in a <hi>Due</hi> Regulation: For otherwiſe, the wicked and crafty will impoſe upon or defraud the ſimple and honeſt. Prov. 20. 23. <hi>Divers Weights are an abomination to the Lord, and a falſe Ballance is not good.</hi> Deut. 25. 13, 14, 15.—<hi>Thou ſhalt have a perfect and juſt Weight; a perfect and juſt Meaſure ſhalt thou have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a Word;</p>
            <p>Unleſs the <hi>Legiſlators decree Juſtice,</hi> how is it poſſible, that ſuch Men, with whom the Executive Power is lodg'd, ſhou'd <hi>miniſter Juſtice</hi> to the People? <hi>If the Foundations are out of Courſe, what can the Righteous do?</hi> A ſpecial Care ought therefore to be taken, <hi>both</hi> in the Choice of <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives</hi> and <hi>Councillors,</hi> that <hi>ſuch</hi> Men may be <hi>Elected,</hi> who <hi>walk uprightly and work Righteouſneſs, and ſpeak the Truth in their Hearts.</hi>—More of which afterwards.</p>
            <p>But then;</p>
            <p>Altho' there be ever ſo many wholeſome, <hi>juſt</hi> and good Laws provided, yet, they avail not, if there be not a due Execution of the ſame.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:006593_0017_1029480448F79BC8"/>
Wherefore;</p>
            <p n="4">4. The decreeing of Juſtice further implies in it a <hi>proper Care</hi> for the <hi>due Execution</hi> of ſuch Decrees.—The <hi>Executive</hi> Power (as was before noted) is <hi>inſeperable</hi> from Rule and Government; and therefore, it highly <hi>concerns</hi> ſuch a Part of the Honourable Legiſlature to whom it appertains, always to make Choice of and appoint thoſe Perſons for <hi>this</hi> Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who are beſt qualified for, and are moſt likely to anſwer the true end and intention of their reſpective Offices; ſuch as will <hi>not bear the Sword in vain,</hi> but approve themſelves <hi>the Miniſters of</hi> GOD, and <hi>Revengers to execute Wrath upon them that do evil:</hi> As alſo, commend and <hi>protect</hi> all thoſe who are <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>peaceable</hi> in the Land.</p>
            <p>And I may add; that when any who are appointed to execute the Decrees of Juſtice, are evidently <hi>Delinquent;</hi> or if they ſhall <hi>exceed the Limits</hi> of their Commiſſion, to the detriment of the <hi>Public,</hi> or even of any particular Perſon, doubtleſs, they ought <hi>(in Terrorem)</hi> to ſuffer Diſgrace in proportion to their Offence; as alſo, to make good all Damages.—</p>
            <p>But on the other hand; all ſuch who are not only ſkillful in the Law, but are alſo diligent and faithfull in the Diſcharge of the Truſts repoſed in them, ought to have the Praiſe of it, yea, and a <hi>Reward</hi> for it, <hi>that is,</hi> higher and greater Honours confer'd upon them.—Their Commiſſions ſhou'd <hi>riſe</hi> with their Accompliſhments for, and their Applications to, the ſervice of the Public: That ſo, all around may ſee and know, that the <hi>Preference</hi> is given to <hi>ſuch</hi> as are <hi>faithful in the Land.</hi>—And truly, <hi>this</hi> wou'd be an excellent means to bring Vertue and Faithfulneſs more and more into Repute among all the People.</p>
            <p>In a Word; 'Tis a ſeaſonable and prudent Execution that gives <hi>Life</hi> to the Decrees of Juſtice; and without this, they will be but a <hi>dead</hi> Letter: For, the bare Promulgation of the ſame will not ſuffice to reſtrain ſuch as are vitiouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd; No; but they muſt ſee and <hi>feel too</hi> (when there is <hi>juſt</hi> Occaſion) that the civil Authority <hi>is in good earneſt;</hi>—otherwiſe, Vice will grow ſtill more rampant, and ſeek to bear down all before it.—If there be no more but the <hi>ſhaking</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:006593_0018_10294805DA42B7A0"/>
of the Spear, <hi>this</hi> will only <hi>be laugh'd at</hi> by all ſuch who love to run into an exceſs of Riot.</p>
            <p>To proceed;</p>
            <p n="5">5. The decreeing of Juſtice does alſo imply, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>has any tendency to obſtruct,</hi> either the Decreeing or the Executing of Juſtice, ought to be avoided and deteſted; and conſequently, that all civil Rulers ſhou'd <hi>ſhake their Hands from holding of Bribes.</hi> i. e. "Tho' it be thruſt into their Hands, yet they may not hold it, but ſhou'd ſhake it out, looking upon it as an Affront."—For alas! What unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Reſolves</hi> wou'd be, many times, come into; and how often wou'd unjuſt <hi>Petitions</hi> be granted, and ſuch as are juſt be rejected, if a Legiſlature, or the <hi>major Part</hi> of the ſame, ſhould come into the Method of taking Gifts (of what Name or Kind ſoever) of one or t'other of the Parties concerned! Yea, if they be, by far, the <hi>minor</hi> Part, yet being Men of <hi>Influence,</hi> 'tis highly probable, that they may eaſily gain their Point, and obtain an <hi>unrighteous</hi> Vote; and yet, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (for the preſent) not be ſenſible of the <hi>injustice</hi> of it: And the Reaſon is, becauſe, as ſaith the Scripture, <hi>a Gift blindeth the Wiſe.</hi>—And ſo like wiſe, if <hi>Peſts</hi> of Honour and Profit may be <hi>purchaſed</hi> with Money, then, many times, ſuch Perſons who are leaſt qualified for them, will ſuſtain them; which wou'd be exceedingly to the detriment of the Public.—And it is as true, that if a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> does judge for Reward, or give Judgment in favour of him who giveth Gifts, this wou'd be no other but a <hi>ſelling</hi> of Juſtice (if I may term it, Juſtice) to the higheſt Bidder.</p>
            <p>It was a Law in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in order to prevent the giving of falſe Judgment, and it is of <hi>perpetual</hi> Obligation, for it is a Branch of the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, <hi>viz.</hi> (Deut. 16. 18, 19.) <hi>Judges and Offices ſhall thou make,—and they ſhall judge the People with juſt Judgment; thou ſhalt not wreſt Judgment; thou ſhalt not reſpect Perſons, neither take a Gift, for, a Gift doth blind the Eyes of the Wiſe, and pervert the Words of the Righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Civil Rulers of every Denomination ſhou'd be <hi>Men of Truth</hi> and <hi>

Spirit, and have at Heart the Weal of the State, much more than the making of any private Gain to themſelves. Not the Fear of Man, nor yet Reſpects to a Friend or Party, but a tender Regard to <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſhou'd direct and influence all their Councils and Adminiſtrations. Deut. 16. 20. <hi>That which is altogether juſt ſhalt thou follow.</hi> Or, as it is in the Original, <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice ſhalt thou follow.</hi> i. e. "They muſt adhere to the Principles of Juſtice, and act by the Rules of Juſtice; muſt labour to do right to all, and beware of doing wrong to any."</p>
            <p>But yet, we may <hi>not wholly</hi> exclude <hi>Compaſſion</hi> and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency from the Character of civil Rulers: For truly, the exerciſe of this is ſometimes a neceſſary part of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and particularly, in a <hi>King</hi> or his <hi>Repreſentative;</hi> for as <hi>the Throne</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>eſtabliſh'd by Righteouſneſs.</hi> Prov. 16. 12. So it is alſo ſaid <hi>to be upheld by Mercy.</hi> Prov. 20. 28. <hi>That is,</hi> when the exerciſe of Mercy will not be at all preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the public Weal; but on the contrary, has a direct tendency to promote the ſame: With <hi>this</hi> Limitation and Proviſo, Pity and Compaſſion in a Ruler, will come under the general Head of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>But then,</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Words further imply, that civil Rulers ſhou'd be <hi>Patterns of Righteouſneſs</hi> in their Buſineſs and Commerce of a <hi>private</hi> Nature; as alſo, bright <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>every other Vertue:</hi> For, with how very ill a grace does a Man of bad Morals pretend either to decree or execute Juſtice! Such an one wou'd be a conſtant Self-contradiction, and wou'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably do more hurt than good; and therefore, it is <hi>inſiſted upon</hi> in the Oracles of GOD, that Rulers ſhou'd be Men of Vertue; <hi>Juſt</hi> Men, Men of <hi>Truth,</hi> &amp;c. Here then,</p>
            <p>(1. They ſhou'd be exemplary for <hi>Commutative</hi> Juſtice, and render unto all their dues; yea, ſtudy to do Juſtice to all, in their Perſons, Goods and good Name.—'Tis evident, that moſt Men who are cloth'd with Authority, have Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a <hi>private</hi> (as well as of a public) Nature; Now I ſay, it becomes and concerns them (in particular) to deal <hi>juſtly</hi> with all, and thereby to inſtruct and incite the People to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct <hi>honeſtly</hi> one towards another: And not by uſing any
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006593_0020_10294809544DA5A8"/>
mean Artifices, and leaſt of all, by running over the Law, teach and encourage People to do the like, and thereby, to defraud and devour one another; and at the ſame time, render their Perſons as well as their Authority contemptible.</p>
            <p>And yet, I don't intend, that Rulers may be ſo exactly and <hi>ſtrictly</hi> juſt <hi>to themſelves,</hi> as not to be examples of <hi>Charity:</hi> For truly, the exerciſe of <hi>this</hi> Vertue towards proper Objects is an act of <hi>Justice</hi> as well as of Beneficence in all Men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral Abilities; and wou'd be <hi>peculiarly</hi> amiable as well as influential in the <hi>Leaders</hi> of a People.—And indeed, ſometimes, the civil Authority, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> is oblig'd <hi>in Juſtice,</hi> to take Cognizance of the Caſe of one or more Perſons, and to diſpence Relief out of the public Stock.</p>
            <p>But then, they ſhould not only be fair and honeſt in their Dealings, and true and faithful to their Promiſes, as alſo kind to ſuch as are in <hi>Need,</hi> after the Example of <hi>Job,</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Job 29. 11,—16.</note> who was a Man in Authority; But moreover,</p>
            <p>(2. They ſhou'd labour to exhibit <hi>every other Vertue</hi> in their Conduct among Men.—</p>
            <p>I ſhall juſt hint at <hi>ſome</hi> of 'em. As, <hi>firſt, Meekneſs:</hi> For ſurely, all ſuch who rule over Men ought to have the rule over their own Spirits:—Nor is this at all inconſiſtent with a <hi>regular Zeal</hi> for the Glory of GOD, and the <hi>People</hi>'s Weal; as is undeniably evident from the Inſtance and Example of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was <hi>very meek above all the Men which were upon the face of the Earth;</hi> and yet, was eminently <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> to him that appointed him. <hi>The Wrath of Man worketh not the Righteouſneſs of GOD.</hi>—Again; They ſhou'd be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary for <hi>Humility.</hi> I don't mean, that they ſhould be of a daſtardly and timerous Spirit, but condeſcending to Men of low degree: Not too familiar, and yet not puffed up, but diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a due <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the weight and importance of the Truſt repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in them.—Even as I well remember a <hi>Gentleman,</hi>

They ſhou'd rather ſuffer in their private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, than be profuſe and laviſh in diſpoſing of the public Money; and yet, they may not be ſparing of the ſame, when there is a fair Proſpect of procuring thereby, <hi>to the People,</hi> that which will anſwer much better than Money.—And <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is profitable to direct in this matter; and indeed, in every other matter relating to Government: <hi>Pilots</hi> have need of Prudence, and <hi>ſuch</hi> are <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to a People. <hi>Take ye wiſe Men,</hi> ſaid <hi>Moſes, and I will make them Rulers over you.</hi> And I muſt add; that they ſhou'd be Men of <hi>Courage:</hi> For, this is an Endowment highly neceſſary. Prudence without Courage will not avail, but theſe <hi>in Conjunction</hi> bode well to a People.—Nor may I omit to ſay, that they ought to live <hi>Frugally,</hi> and not run into all the Extravagancies of the Age: And even, in <hi>all other</hi> reſpects, ſhou'd behave <hi>wiſely</hi> in their own Houſes; and thus, while they preſerve a public Spirit, muſt take care alſo to diſcharge the Duties of whatever <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> Relations they ſuſtain.</p>
            <p>'Tis a juſt Obſervation, that when <hi>OEconomy, Honeſty</hi> and a <hi>public Spirit</hi> do obtain among a People, then they are in the Road to Proſperity. And doubtleſs, Political <hi>Fathers</hi> ought to be <hi>ſhining Examples</hi> of the ſame.</p>
            <p>What I ſay, is, that the <hi>exhibiting</hi> of <hi>Vertue,</hi> by Rulers,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006593_0022_10294814A66BD4A8"/>
in the <hi>ſeveral</hi> Branches thereof, is highly neceſſary in order to <hi>reform</hi> a People: The making of wholſom and good Laws, and a due Execution of the ſame is indeed a proper means; But yet, if ſuch who make and execute them, are not ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <hi>themſelves,</hi> then, the People will incline to think, that their Rulers aim at nothing more than to keep them in Awe, and to oblige 'em to ſupport them in their Vice, as well as their Grandeur: The People will not be perſwaded, but that they may live as they liſt, when they obſerve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>s the manner of their Superiours, or of many of them, ſo to do.—But now, on the other hand, if Rulers are vertuous <hi>themſelves,</hi> then, the common People will be led to think, that truly 'tis high Time for them to be ſo too: yea, and will be, much the rather, <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed</hi> to <hi>endeavour</hi> it, agreeable to that Obſervation, <hi>Precepts teach,</hi> but <hi>Examples were</hi> Men: But then, there is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <hi>Force</hi> in the Examples of Superiours, and eſpecially of <hi>Rulers;</hi> and hence is that Proverbial ſaying, that <hi>all Men will fellow the King's Example.</hi>

And then, beſides this, the <hi>publick Worſhip of GOD</hi> ought to be, in the ſtated Seaſons for it, willingly and devoutly attended by him: Like that good <hi>King David,</hi> he ſhou'd <hi>rejoice,</hi> when-ever he is <hi>invited to go up to the Houſe of the</hi> LORD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, and when he is there, he ſhou'd <hi>reverence GOD's Sanctuary.</hi>—All ſuch whom GOD has, in his Providence, advanc'd to Places of public Honour and Truſt, are <hi>peculiarly</hi> oblig'd, <hi>viz.</hi> in point of Gratitude to him, and for the ſake of ſetting a good Example before others, as well as for their own perſonal Benefit, to do Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and pay Homage <hi>to him</hi> in the moſt <hi>public</hi> manner: And truly, ſuch of them who neglect to do this, not only incenſe the Wrath of GOD againſt them, but alſo bring a <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> on their own Character, <hi>as Rulers;</hi> for it is quite <hi>ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> when any who are thus exalted, and expect, therefore, that their Fellow-Men will be in Subjection unto them, yet, they themſelves will not do Homage <hi>to him</hi> who is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Monarch, <hi>the moſt high</hi> GOD, and <hi>the poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth;</hi> but chooſe rather for ſome weak (not to ſay wicked) Reaſon, to be excuſed.</p>
            <p>Nor is it eno' that they be Righteous and Religious <hi>before Men;</hi> but moreover, they ſhould be <hi>Lovers</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Beauty,</hi> as well as for the Benefit of it, and becauſe it is a part of the divine Image: As Sin, in all the Inſtances of it, ſhou'd be odious to them, becauſe of it's <hi>Deformity,</hi> and as it is <hi>the abominable thing which the Soul of GOD hates;</hi> even ſo, Juſtice or <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> not only in a ſtrict, but alſo in a <hi>larger</hi> ſenſe of the Word, <hi>viz.</hi> as it intends <hi>Holineſs,</hi> of an univerſal Rectitude of all our Actions relating both to GOD and <hi>Man,</hi> ſhou'd be <hi>their Delight</hi> and <hi>Ambition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> is what wou'd add a ſhining Luſtre to all their other good Qualifications, and wou'd not only cauſe them to be reverenc'd by bad Men, but alſo render them the delight of good Men, yea, of good Angels, and which is infinitely more, of the good GOD.</p>
            <p>I don't ſay, that every good Man is qualified to be a Ruler
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006593_0024_10294818F47F5C90"/>
in the Common-Wealth, but a good Man (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) will certainly make the beſt Ruler: I mean, one, who, in the Judgment of rational Charity, has a living, holy Principle within him, and ſo, has the Intereſt of CHRIST, as well as the Proſperity of the People at Heart, and bears a <hi>dutiful</hi> Regard to his SAVIOUR's <hi>Authority</hi> in all his Actions.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>good</hi> Man; yea, and he is very often in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, call'd by the Name of the <hi>Righteous</hi> Man: Nor indeed, may we <hi>depend</hi> upon any other, but one of <hi>this</hi> Character, to decree or execute Juſtice, <hi>at all Times,</hi>—'Tis true, a Man that is deſtitute <hi>of the Fear of GOD,</hi> and who is a Stranger to vital Piety and to the Power of Godlineſs, may do ſome <hi>very worthy Deeds,</hi> in his Day and Place (as <hi>Tertullus</hi> ſaid of and to <hi>Felix</hi>) for, Men's Honour and Worldly Intereſt will oftentimes incline and prompt them this Way: But what I ſay, is, that a Man void of the Fear and Love of GOD, and of Faith in CHRIST, will <hi>not adhere</hi> cloſely and ſteadily, and at all times, to the Word of Truth and Righteouſneſs, but will deviate from the ſame when he can ſerve a turn thereby: And, in a Word, <hi>Self</hi> is at the bottom in ſuch a Man; and altho' he be induſtrious to cloak and hide it, yet, in reality, <hi>this</hi> is what he regards much more than any thing elſe in this World, or even in Heaven it ſelf, for, it is <hi>his Idol;</hi> and therefore, the public is not in ſafety while in his Hand.</p>
            <p>And this may ſuffice for the <hi>firſt</hi> general Head under the 2 d. PROP. which was to ſhow, what things are <hi>Imply'd</hi> in Rulers decreeing and executing Juſtice.</p>
            <p>I proceed now, more briefly,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> To <hi>Evince</hi> and Prove, that it is <hi>from</hi> CHRIST, that <hi>they ſo do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then, let us conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>the beſt Rules</hi> which Political Rulers have to guide and govern themſelves by, both for the enacting and execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Juſt</hi> and good Laws, are <hi>from</hi> the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain, that neither the Legiſlative nor the Executive Powers may act <hi>their own</hi> Will and Pleaſure; Nay, but his, who authorizes and improves them; and therefore, ſuch of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006593_0025_1029481AAAABA908"/>
them who have the Opportunity for it, are oblig'd to conſult <hi>his</hi> revealed Mind and Will, and to take their Meaſures (chiefly) <hi>from thence,</hi> and not conform to any State or States-Men any further than is conſiſtent with this divine Rule and Pattern.</p>
            <p>And Thanks be to GOD our SAVIOUR, that the Sacred Oracles are at hand; and all of us, Rulers and others, have the Opportunity, not only to read, but alſo to hear the ſame explain'd and apply'd, and ſo to learn <hi>what is good, and what the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD <hi>requireth of us.</hi>—And it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd on the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in particular,<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. 17. 18, 19.</note> that they ſhou'd <hi>have a Copy</hi> of the divine Law, and <hi>read</hi> therein <hi>all the Days of their Life,</hi> that they might <hi>learn to fear the</hi> LORD, and <hi>to keep his Statutes,</hi> and might <hi>not turn aſide,</hi> either <hi>to the right hand or to the left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly, 'tis no leſs neceſſary <hi>now,</hi> that Kings and even all ſubordinate Rulers ſhou'd conſult the HOLY BIBLE, and the <hi>Moral Law</hi> in particular; for, this is of perpetual Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and accordingly was Ratified by our SAVIOUR, and is enjoyn'd upon us by him, as the Rule of Life;<note n="‖" place="bottom">Matt. 5. 17,—20.</note> And this, if rightly underſtood, and duly conſider'd, in it's ſeveral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Branches, wou'd be (in the main) a ſufficient Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory for our Conduct, whether we be in private or public Station.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Magiſtrate is <hi>Cuſtos utriuſque Tabulae:</hi> He muſt <hi>keep</hi> all the Words of this Law; <hi>that is,</hi> not only be obedient to all the Commandments, and thereby, ſet a good Example before others (as was before ſhown,) but alſo ſhou'd <hi>protect</hi> them <hi>from Inſult,</hi> and take care that <hi>others ſubmit</hi> and <hi>conform to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, civil Rulers may not think, that the weighty Affairs of State, and much leſs their own Buſineſs of a private Nature, will excuſe them from reading and hearing the Word of GOD: They ought to be <hi>the Miniſters of GOD unto People for their good;</hi> and therefore, it concerns them to learn yet more thorowly, what is <hi>the good and acceptable and perfect Will of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:006593_0026_1029481C4450EB60"/>
And Oh, that Rulers in general, thro'out the Land and Nation, wou'd be pleaſed more frequently and devoutly to conſult the <hi>ſacred Scriptures,</hi> as alſo to attend the public <hi>Preaching</hi> of the Word! This would be, not only an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to them, but alſo a Token for good, both to themſelves and to their People; and eſpecially, if they wou'd improve it as the <hi>Man of their Counſel:</hi> For, what-ever ſome may think of it, yet, here are ſuch Maxims of Wiſdom, and ſuch Rules of Juſtice and Equity, as are not elſewhere to be found. Indeed, many other Books are of uſe, but yet, none come up to the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> of CHRIST and his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I may proceed to ſay, that not only Chriſtian Rulers, but <hi>ſuch</hi> alſo who <hi>have</hi> the <hi>Government</hi> over <hi>Heathen</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and even <hi>all the Judges of the Earth,</hi> are beholden to CHRIST for all thoſe good Rules and wholſome Laws which obtain among them.—Several of thoſe Nations did <hi>formerly</hi> receive many Principles of Wiſdom from the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were then converſant among them: And doubtleſs, many of them, more lately, from the Mouths of <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> And all this muſt be aſcribed to the kind <hi>Providence</hi> of the <hi>King of Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, beſides this, they have the <hi>Light of Nature;</hi> and ſo have ſome ſence of Juſtice and Equity, of Honour and Purity, and of Love and Charity: The Light of Nature, not only forbids Murder, Lying, Stealing, Perjury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but alſo teacheth Obedience to Parents, Pity to the miſerable, as alſo the <hi>Conſervation</hi> of <hi>public Peace</hi> and <hi>Order;</hi> yea, and it <hi>dictates</hi> to ſuch who are inquiſitive about <hi>that</hi> matter, many <hi>ſuitable</hi> Methods for that <hi>End:</hi> So that, the <hi>Heathen</hi> are a <hi>Law unto themſelves;</hi> and accordingly, their Conſciences do either accuſe or excuſe them, as they do, or do not, obſerve the ſame.—And now, this Law and Light of Nature, as well as that of Scripture, is <hi>from</hi> the LORD JESUS CHRIST: Unto <hi>him</hi> is Mankind indebted for thoſe poor Remains of the divine Image which ſurvive our primative Apoſtacy; For, <hi>this</hi> is <hi>he,</hi> who <hi>lighteth every Man that cometh into the World.</hi> John 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. Moreover,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Not only good Rules, but alſo the Ruler's <hi>good Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> for Government are <hi>from</hi> the LORD JESUS.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:006593_0027_1029481DEC0A6A00"/>
As there are different Poſts and Offices in the civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo, ſome Men need more and greater Endowments and Abilities than others: One Station requires a greater degree of Skill, Courage and Reſolution than another does.—And 'tis alſo certain that each Man's Qualifications are <hi>from</hi> CHRIST: Thus we are taught in my <hi>Text, By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice.</hi> And in the preceeding Verſe, <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel is mine, and ſound Wiſdom; I am Underſtanding, I have Strength.</hi> And in Chap. 2. 6. <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>giveth Wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> is that <hi>Prince of the Kings of the Earth,</hi> who gave <hi>King Solomon</hi> his Wiſdom, and made him to be ſo judicious a Prince, and even <hi>the wiſeſt of all Men.</hi>—And when <hi>Saul</hi> was made <hi>King</hi> over <hi>Iſrael;</hi> 'tis ſaid, that <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>gave him another Heart. That is,</hi> he was (thereupon) qualified more than before for public Service, and had a Spirit for Government: Being immediately call'd of GOD, he was alſo (in ſome meaſure) immediately qualify'd for that high Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Not that we may expect civil Rulers, now, in theſe Days, to be furniſh'd and prepar'd for public Service, in ſuch an immediate and extraordinary manner; No, but Choice ſhould be made of <hi>ſuch</hi> who appear to be the <hi>beſt</hi> qualified for it, and then <hi>Prayer</hi> ought to be made daily by them for themſelves, and by others for them, that they may be ſtill more and more ſo.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more eaſy to obſerve than that ſome Men's <hi>Natural</hi> Parts are much greater and brighter than ſome others: And it is the LORD JESUS who makes this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;—for, no Man is more capable than <hi>he</hi> makes him to be.—And the ſame is true, when ſome Men, by means of Education and cloſe Application, <hi>acquire</hi> a greater meaſure of Knowledge and Underſtanding than others; for, <hi>this</hi> is owing to the Bleſſing of CHRIST on thoſe Means: All our Powers both Natural and Acquired come from him. <hi>He giveth Wiſdom to the Wiſe, and Knowledge to them that know Underſtanding.</hi> Dan. 2. 21.—But then, I ſhall add, that when a Man has a Principle of Righteouſneſs, I mean, a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and <hi>holy</hi> Principle implanted in him, <hi>this</hi> is a <hi>ſpecial</hi> Gift of CHRIST, by the Energy of the divine <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:006593_0028_10294824AA98F3F8"/>
3. Not only the Qualifications, but alſo the <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>improve</hi> the ſame in a due manner, is <hi>from</hi> CHRIST: The readineſs of Mind and ability of Body, to act, as well as the Principle and Habit of Vertue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is <hi>from him.</hi>—Alas! <hi>how many</hi> neglect the Gift which is in them, and may be ſaid to hide or bury their Talents: And there are <hi>others</hi> ſtill more wicked, for, they pervert their Powers, both of Body and Mind; inſtead of doing good, they do abundance of miſchief.—But then, on the other hand; there are <hi>ſome</hi> who are not only diſpos'd, but fully determin'd (notwithſtanding any Temptations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) to doe what good they can, in their Places, and exert themſelves accordingly: And <hi>theſe</hi> whether they be veſted with Authority, or not, are under the kind Influence of CHRIST, who <hi>worketh in us both to will and to do, of his good Pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, I ſay, ſeeing the good <hi>Rules</hi> for Government, as alſo the Ruler's good <hi>Qualifications,</hi> together with an <hi>Heart</hi> to improve them aright, are <hi>from</hi> CHRIST, it follows, that it is <hi>by him,</hi> that they both decree and execute Juſtice.</p>
            <p>One more,</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is <hi>by him</hi> that they rule, inaſmuch as <hi>all the Succeſs</hi> of their wiſe and juſt Decrees and Adminiſtrations is <hi>from him:</hi> Neither the Decree, nor the utmoſt Care to execute the ſame wou'd anſwer any good end without his Bleſſing.—We are too apt to think, that Men of ſuperior Parts and great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and more eſpecially, if they are great <hi>Politicians,</hi> will do <hi>ſome</hi> eminent Service in the State; yea, that <hi>many</hi> great and worthy Deeds will be done by them: But how often has it been found, that <hi>the help of Man is vain.</hi>—If CHRIST be forgotten, or neglected, and the Bleſſing of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be deny'd, <hi>then,</hi> the Counſel of the deepeſt Politician is <hi>turned into Fooliſhneſs:</hi> For, <hi>he leadeth Councellors away ſpoiled, and maketh the Judges fools.</hi>—But on the other hand; when a due Regard is paid to the Authority of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and CHRIST eſpouſes their Cauſe, then, both Councellor and Judge go on proſperouſly; becauſe <hi>he,</hi> unto whom all Judgment is committed, is nigh to them, both to direct their Path, and to ſucceed their Meaſures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:006593_0029_1029482671616738"/>
And this may ſerve for the Illuſtration and Confirmation of the 2 d PROP.</p>
            <p>But yet, before I come to the Application, I ſhall juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to Remark, that all this is ſaid to be done <hi>by him,</hi> who is WISDOM.</p>
            <p>And truly, <hi>the Wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>Son of</hi> GOD is very <hi>conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous</hi> herein, namely, in <hi>Appointing</hi> that the generality of the humane Race ſhould be under the Rule and Government of ſome of the ſame make and frame with themſelves: And then, in <hi>Qualifing</hi> and <hi>Authorizing ſome</hi> to bear Rule; and in <hi>diſpoſing others</hi> to ſubmit.—</p>
            <p>I ſay, here is <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as alſo Goodneſs and Kindneſs: For, as humane Societies cannot ſubſiſt without Government, ſo neither wou'd it, at all ſuit with the Nature of Man, in its preſent frail ſtate, to be under the <hi>immediate</hi> Government of the <hi>moſt High,</hi> "and to be directed only, from time to time, by a Voice from Heaven, accompanied with ſuch Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, as would become the Majeſty of Heaven and Earth": For, this would ſo fill us with amazement, as to unfit us for Service, and inſtead of bringing us near to GOD, wou'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drive us further from him: And accordingly, we read, that when our firſt Parents <hi>heard the Voice of the</hi> LORD GOD, <hi>they hid themſelves.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 8.</note> Being Guilty, they abſconded: And ſurely, we are all Guilty, and may juſtly tremble <hi>at the Tho't</hi> of GOD's appearing and ſpeaking unto us.—We are alſo told,<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. 20. 19.</note> that the People of <hi>Iſrael ſaid unto Moſes, ſpeak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not GOD ſpeak with us, leſt we die.</hi>—And GOD was pleaſed to grant them their Requeſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only juſt add, that the <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as alſo the Kindneſs of <hi>him,</hi> who is <hi>the Head over all things to the Church,</hi> are very evident, not only in Governing, but alſo in <hi>Teaching</hi> us <hi>by Men</hi> like our ſelves, <hi>whoſe Terror ſhall not make us afraid, nor their Hand be heavy upon us.</hi>

               <p>That they are <hi>Mortal,</hi> is evident to all; for, we ſee, that wiſe Men die: Tho' they are ſometimes ſtiled <hi>gods,</hi> yet they are ſo by <hi>Office only.</hi> Pſal. 82. 6, 7. <hi>I have ſaid, ye are Gods, but ye ſhall die like Men:</hi> All their Authority together with all their Riches and Grandeur can be no ſecurity to them againſt the Arreſts of the <hi>King of Terrors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And not only muſt they die, but <hi>give Account</hi> of their Doings <hi>to their</hi> LORD and MASTER; <hi>viz.</hi> how they have improv'd their Authority, and all the other Talents which he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted them with.—Yea, even <hi>Monarchs</hi> themſelves, tho' accountable to none upon Earth, but act their own Will and Pleaſure without Controul, yet, muſt all appear at WISDOM's Bar, and receive their Sentence from his Mouth, <hi>Namely,</hi> either, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed</hi>—, or, <hi>Go ye Curſed</hi>—.

               <p>Theſe are the great ends which they muſt keep in view, as they would anſwer the deſign of their Promotion.—And indeed, they are <hi>oblig'd</hi> to proſecute the ſame, both by the Law of Juſtice and Gratitude; for, they can't make returns ſuitable to the Honour conferr'd on them, unleſs they exert themſelves to advance the Honour of CHRIST, and of his holy Religion, and thereby, to promote the Weal of their Fellow-Creatures.</p>
               <p>What! Has CHRIST put Honour upon <hi>them,</hi> and are they regardleſs of <hi>his</hi> Honour? then, they are both unjuſt and ungrateful to their LORD and <hi>Benefactor,</hi> and he will highly <hi>reſent</hi> it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Wou'd to</hi> GOD, that thoſe Words in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12. may be very heedfully regarded by Kings, and even by all in ſubordinate Authority! <hi>viz.

               <p n="5">5. Seeing it is <hi>from Chriſt,</hi> that Kings and all other Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rulers do derive their Authority, as alſo exerciſe the ſame in a due manner, <hi>this</hi> may teach <hi>us,</hi> that it is <hi>the Peoples In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> as well as Duty, to <hi>Study</hi> the <hi>things</hi> that <hi>pleaſe him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wou'd you have good Rulers ſet up, and continu'd over you? Or, wou'd you have the Preſence of CHRIST with them, to direct them to the moſt proper Meaſures, and then to animate them to proſecute the ſame, and finally, to give the deſired Succeſs to their wiſe and juſt Adminiſtrations? Why, in order to this, the <hi>People</hi> muſt <hi>return,</hi> every one, <hi>from his evil way,</hi> and <hi>learn to do juſtly, to love mercy,</hi> and <hi>to walk humbly with</hi> GOD. Or, in other Words, they muſt pay a religious Regard to the ſeveral Duties, both of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Revealed</hi> Religion, and do all in the <hi>Name</hi> of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>'Tis readily acknowledg'd by all, that the Safety and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of a People does very much depend, under CHRIST, upon their having wiſe and good Rulers: Surely then, it concerns People (if they wou'd conſult their own Welfare) to get and keep in good terms <hi>with him, by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree juſtice.

               <p n="7">7. Seeing Political Rulers derive their Authority <hi>from</hi> CHRIST, and rule <hi>under him,</hi> this teaches us, that it is the unqueſtionable <hi>Duty</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> to <hi>ſubmit to them,</hi> and that <hi>for Conſcience ſake.—That is to ſay,</hi> unleſs they ſhall ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert their Authority, as to decree and adminiſter in ſuch manner, as has a direct tendency to overthrow the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, or to deprive the People of their <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty;</hi> or, in a Word; unleſs they <hi>violate their Oath,</hi> and appear no other but as Enemies to the civil and religious Conſtitution.—</p>

               <p>And in a Word;</p>
               <p>We Eſteem and Reſpect <hi>your Honour,</hi> as under GOD, and the KING, our <hi>preſent Political Head;</hi> and we queſtion not but you will, during your Adminiſtration, Conſult the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of this whole People, in all regards; and will alſo be accepted of the multitude of your Brethren.</p>

SIRS,</p>
               <p>None of this great Aſſembly may be ſuppos'd to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of this Day, nor to be unacquainted <hi>in whoſe Hands</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Election</hi> is lodg'd; Nor yet, are any but the tho'tleſs among the People, unmindful and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of how great Importance it is, that Men of true Wiſdom and ſolid Goodneſs be ſelected from out of our Tribes, to ſit at the <hi>Honourable Board:</hi> For, we do, or may know, that the Gentlemen who ſhall, this Day, be Elected (by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative</hi> Body of this People, in Conjunction with his <hi>Majeſty's Council</hi> now in being) and then be <hi>Approved</hi> by his <hi>Majeſty's Repreſentative,</hi> will not only be oblig'd, when deſir'd, to aſſiſt the <hi>Captain General</hi> with their beſt Advice in all Articles relating to Government, and particularly, in that weighty one, of Conſtituting <hi>Judges</hi> and other <hi>civil</hi> Officers: As alſo, bear a Part in the Inſpection and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>College:</hi> But beſides all this, they will make <hi>one main Branch</hi> of our <hi>Legiſlature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Liberty of making choice of <hi>Councillors</hi> from <hi>among our ſelves,</hi> may juſtly be reckon'd one of the greateſt of our preſent Charter Privileges: A Privilege, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted, <hi>above</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> it ſelf:—And in a Word, the Welfare of the whole Province in <hi>all</hi> regards, <hi>viz.</hi> as to <hi>Church, State</hi> and <hi>College,</hi> does under GOD, very much depend upon a wiſe and good Choice.—</p>
               <p>Wherefore, <hi>much honour'd Gentlemen-Electors,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It highly concerns <hi>you,</hi> and all of us, to be <hi>ſtill ſeeking</hi> Direction from above: As alſo, that <hi>you</hi> be very conſiderate and circumſpect in <hi>this</hi> matter: And then, to be fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in your own Minds and Conſciences, that all ſuch whom you ſhall give your Vote for, are, Matters being duly weigh'd, the <hi>moſt ſuitable</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> Perſons, <hi>whom you know of,</hi> in the Province, for that <hi>honourable Station.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be pleas'd to permit me here to ſay,</p>
               <p>That as not Piety alone, ſo neither may Learning alone, or the greateſt ſkill in Politicks, determine your Choice this Day: And much leſs, meerly a flowing Income, or, only ſome high Title of Honour.—But when theſe <hi>meet in one,</hi> as ſometimes they do, ſuch a Man is worthy of the public Voice.</p>

                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:006593_0041_1029484BBADB3AF0"/>
'Tis very deſireable indeed, that they be Gentlemen of good Extract, and of large Intereſts; and doubtleſs a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Number of <hi>ſuch</hi> may ſtill be found among us, and who <hi>alſo</hi> in other and better reſpects are duly Qualified.</p>
               <p>But whatever elſe be lacking, yet, pray, endeavour to be ſatisfied, that they are Perſons of a pious Principle, and that they have a good meaſure of Knowledge and Wiſdom; not only acquainted with, but alſo Friends to our Conſtitution, both of Church and State; Well-wiſhers to our <hi>College,</hi> and the other means of Education; Lovers of GOD, and of all good Men, of every Denomination; moſt capable and beſt inclin'd to encourage and promote Piety towards GOD and Juſtice towards <hi>Men:</hi> And in a Word, Men approv'd of by the People of GOD in general, where-ever they are known: For, <hi>this</hi> was an ancient Rule, Deut. 1. 13. <hi>Take ye wiſe Men and understanding, and known among your Tribes, and I will make them Rulers over you. That is,</hi> ſuch as were <hi>known</hi> to be wiſe and good Men, and had been all along <hi>approved of</hi> as ſuch.</p>
               <p>O SIRS, allow me to be ſo free and open, as to intreat of you, in the <hi>Name</hi> of HIM, who has, in his all-governing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, committed to you this Power and Privilege; and in the <hi>behalf</hi> of this whole <hi>People;</hi> and even <hi>for your own ſakes, to exerciſe your ſelves,</hi> this Day in particular, <hi>to have Conſciences void of Offence both towards</hi> GOD <hi>and Man.</hi>—Let not Favour nor Prejudice determine you for, or againſt any Man: Seek not your ſelves, nor meerly to oblige your Friend; but let the Honour of CHRIST and the Weal of this People be your great and governing Deſign.</p>
               <p>As it is not a matter of perſonal Concern, but of the moſt public nature, ſo, the <hi>Eyes</hi> of all of us, both <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> are upon you, hoping that you will, one and all, act your part very faithfully and ſincerely.</p>
               <p>Yea, and more than all this, the Eye of HIM <hi>by whom Princes rule,</hi> will be upon you; nor indeed, will HE be far from you, For, <hi>he ſtandeth in the Congregation of the mighty, and judgeth among the gods.</hi> He does and will ſee into, and thorow you, to obſerve, whether you are trifling or ſelfiſh in this weighty Affair; or whether, on the other hand, you have
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:006593_0042_1029484EA2DD1450"/>
a due Regard to Perſon's Piety and other neceſſary Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations: And ſuffer me juſt to put you in mind, that you muſt, each one, e're long, moſt certainly <hi>give Account to him,</hi> from what Principle, and with what Views, you ſhall manage the important Buſineſs of <hi>this</hi> Day.</p>
               <p>'Tis Requir'd (you know) of <hi>Truſtees,</hi> that they be found Faithful; pray conſider your ſelves <hi>as ſuch</hi> in this matter: Neither forget, that our Privileges, Civil, Religious and Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical are too precious in themſelves; and moreover, have been too dearly bought, to be put into the hands of ſuch Men, who are either unſkillfull or unfaithful.</p>
               <p>But that I be not further tedious;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Fathers,</hi> you have the whole Province before you: And I know of no better Rule for you to go by, than that of <hi>Jethro</hi> to <hi>Moſes;</hi> and which was approved of by GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> Exod. 18. 21. <hi>Thou ſhalt provide out of all the People, able Men, ſuch as fear</hi> GOD, <hi>Men of Truth, and hating Covetouſneſs, and place ſuch over them.</hi>—Here 'tis ſaid, <hi>able Men:</hi> Or, Men of good Senſe and Courage, able to ſupport the Authority of their Station, and equal to their Truſt. <hi>Such as fear</hi> GOD: i. e. Conſcientious Men, who not only believe the Being and Providence of GOD; but will move and act, decree and execute, <hi>as under his Eye;</hi> and therefore dare not do an ill Thing, nor indulge any ſiniſter Views.—<hi>Men of Truth:</hi> Or, ſuch who will not act a Part or betray a Truſt; whoſe Fidelity and Steadineſs may, on all Occaſions, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon. <hi>Hating Covetouſneſs.</hi> i. e. Not only, not ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not taking; but even <hi>abhorring</hi> whatſoever has any tendency to foreſtall their Minds, or bribe and byaſs their Judgments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe</hi> are the Men who honour GOD, and whom <hi>he</hi> will honour with his Preſence: As <hi>they</hi> are on his ſide, ſo will <hi>he</hi> be on their's.—But now, as for Men of a <hi>contrary</hi> Character; as they are not the friends of GOD (nor indeed of Men, unleſs when they can ſerve themſelves) ſo neither may any other be expected, but that <hi>he</hi> will leave them to walk on in their own Counſels, and conſequently, to bring Miſchief both on themſelves and their Dependents.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:006593_0043_102948516E243D98"/>
And finally; We earneſtly <hi>pray,</hi> that GOD wou'd be pleas'd to <hi>direct this</hi> your Path for you, and to lead you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Choice of ſuch, who are Men <hi>after his own Heart:</hi> With <hi>him</hi> we humbly and gladly leave you, who has <hi>the Government</hi> both of the Church and World <hi>upon his Shoulder;</hi> and <hi>whoſe Name is called Wonderfull, Councellor, the Mighty</hi> GOD, <hi>the everlaſting Father, and the Prince of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, having thus ſpoken reſpecting the particular and ſpecial Buſineſs of <hi>this</hi> Day;</p>
               <p>I preſume it will not be taken amiſs, if I go on to ſay, We humbly truſt, that when the weighty Affair of the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is over, that <hi>then,</hi> the ſeveral Branches of our Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Legiſlature will be very <hi>mindful</hi> of HIM, <hi>by whom</hi> (as you have heard) <hi>Princes decree Juſtice,</hi> and will be <hi>daily</hi> ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to HIM, to lead and guide you into ſuch <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Reſolves</hi> as ſhall be agreable to the Laws and Rules of his holy Word, and conſequently will be good in his ſight.</p>
               <p>We deſire to be very thankfull for all thoſe juſt and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws, which have been already Enacted, at one Time and another, by the Government of this Province, for the ſuppreſſing of Vice and Immorality, and for the encouraging of Vertue, Religion and good Literature among us. Ah! were it not for ſuch Laws, we had doubtleſs, been in a moſt <hi>forlorn</hi> Condition long before this Day.</p>
               <p>But pray, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> be pleas'd to conſider, whether ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further may not yet be done;</p>
               <p>And <hi>particularly,</hi> firſt, for the prevention of that beaſtly Sin of <hi>Uncleanneſs;</hi> by which, I <hi>now</hi> more eſpecially intend, the Sin of <hi>Fornication;</hi> which it ſeems, is made very light of by many among us; altho' it be <hi>expreſsly</hi> and <hi>frequently</hi> prohibited in the Oracles of GOD.<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. 6. 13, 18. and 7. 2. and 10. 8. 1 Theſ. 4. 3. 4.</note>—Alſo, ſomething further, to ſuppreſs the Sin of <hi>Drunkenneſs;</hi> which is not only an heinous Tranſgreſſion in it ſelf, but is alſo big with all manner of evil, both moral and miſchievous.—And O, that ſomething may be done for the retrenching of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality,</hi> and for the bringing into faſhion again <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Frugality:</hi> For, alas! What will become of us, if our <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:006593_0044_10294854A60B1708"/>
be not par'd off, the Support and Maintenance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is abundantly more Expenſive than wou'd ſuffice to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the whole Charge both of Church and State. O, how long ſhall this Country be ſpoken of by Travellers, as exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all others, (and not our Mother-Country only) in coſtly Faſhions; and for Extravagance in manner of Living, as well as in their Attire; and thoſe of the <hi>lower</hi> Rank among us, as muchas if not more than any.—And pray, may not ſome more effectual Method be taken to promote <hi>Induſtry;</hi> and eſpecially to oblige ſuch who are but <hi>Peſts</hi> to a Common-Wealth, to become ſome way or other uſeful and beneficial to it: Or, if not uſeful, yet may they not be ſo confin'd, as to be reſtrain'd from being miſchievous.—And not only Idle Perſons, but alſo our Waſt and <hi>Wilderneſs Loads</hi> muſt be Subdued and Improved, as we wou'd ever be a flouriſhing Province.—And O that we may be a People henceforth <hi>remark'd</hi> for <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Honeſty,</hi> and no longer be ſpoken of as <hi>addicted</hi> to oppreſs one another!</p>
               <p>And in a Word; whatever is further needful in order to cure us of the aforeſaid, and other our Immoralities; and to prevent any <hi>new</hi> ones which may ſeem to threaten us, and to render and preſerve us a vertuous People, we pray our <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Legiſlature,</hi> in their great Wiſdom to meditate the moſt proper Methods for, and by their Authority to ſee that the ſame be put in Execution.</p>
               <p>And will <hi>your Honours</hi> allow me to be your humble Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor, and ſay, it is not eno' that Righteouſneſs and other moral Vertues be cultivated and cheriſh'd, but moreover, <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>public Worſhip</hi> of GOD in particular, muſt come under your <hi>ſpecial</hi> Care: The <hi>firſt</hi> as well as the ſecond Table being committed to the <hi>Cuſtody</hi> and Protection of the <hi>civil Magiſtrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will you be pleaſed therefore, to improve your Authority, that ſo the LORD's <hi>Day,</hi> in particular, may be more ſtrictly obſerved, and the public Worſhip be more frequently attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For, GOD has given <hi>that Day</hi> to be <hi>a ſign between him and his People;</hi> it is therefore, moſt highly offenſive to him, when the ſame is profaned; nor may we wonder if he ſhall evidence his Reſentment of it by his Judgments; and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006593_0045_1029485679F04680"/>
in that awfull manner ſpoken of by the <hi>Prophet</hi> in Jer. 17. ult. <hi>If ye will not hearken unto me, to hallow the Sabbath-Day,—then I will kindle a fire in the Gates, and it ſhall devour the Palaces, and ſhall not be quenched.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And may it be alſo your Care, that a pious, learned and orthodox <hi>Miniſtry</hi> be duely encouraged and ſupported among us; even, as you wou'd expreſs and teſtifie a <hi>dutifull</hi> Regard <hi>unto</hi> HIM, whoſe Embaſſadors <hi>they</hi> are, and by and under whom <hi>you</hi> rule.</p>
               <p>'Tis well known, that our pious Progenitors founded the COLLEGE in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> chiefly with this View, that ſo, the Churches in the Country might, from time to time, have their Supply from that Fountain: And indeed, neither the civil nor eccleſiaſtical State can be <hi>preſerved</hi> in a flouriſhing Condition without Men of good Learning.</p>
               <p>However contemptibly ſome ignorant Perſons may have ſpoken concerning Learning, yet 'tis certain, "that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the Goſpel Miniſtry are vitally link'd with Religion: Religion will ſoon decay without Learning, and even die without a learned and faithful Miniſtry: And if we loſe our Religion, what have we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore? For, 'tis not only the beſt Religion in the World, out 'tis the very beſt thing that we have: So that <hi>our All</hi> very much turns upon an effectual, wiſe Care to ſee that Learning and the Goſpel Miniſtry be well ſupported."</p>
               <p>'Tis obvious to all who are acquainted with the Hiſtory of the Country, that NEW-ENGLAND was originally Planted, not ſo much for <hi>Trade</hi> as for <hi>Religion,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> with an Eye not only to their own and their Poſterity's ſpiritual weal, but alſo to the Chriſtianizing of the <hi>Heathen;</hi>) And truly, the way for the <hi>former</hi> to flouriſh, is to be tender of the <hi>latter:</hi> But if <hi>Religion</hi> be not cheriſhed, <hi>Trade</hi> will decay more and more; or, if it ſhou'd flouriſh, it will prove no other but a Curſe to us.</p>
               <p>I may not omit to add, that we are very <hi>thankfull</hi> to our honourable Rulers for their Smiles on the <hi>College</hi> hitherto; and do humbly and earneſtly <hi>intreat</hi> the <hi>continuance</hi> of the ſame:—As alſo that there may be effectual Proviſion (if poſſible) that the good Laws concerning <hi>Inferiour Schools</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:006593_0046_10294859B793EF90"/>
may not be eluded, as has too often been the Caſe; leſt the Children riſing up prove an ignorant and ungovern'd Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the ſucceeding ones be ſtill more ſo.</p>
               <p>We are alſo <hi>thankfull</hi> to <hi>Heaven</hi> for the good Laws which ſome <hi>former</hi> Aſſemblies have enacted for the Encouragement and Support of the <hi>Goſpel Miniſtry</hi> among us, and eſpecially for that <hi>Standing</hi> and <hi>Righteous</hi> Law, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>All Contracts and Agreements made, or that ſhall be made reſpecting Miniſters Settlement or Maintenance ſhall remain good and valid ACCORDING TO THE TRUE INTENT THEREOF, and ſhall accordingly be purſued, put in execution and fulfilled.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But alas! has not <hi>this juſt</hi> and <hi>good Law</hi> been too much <hi>diſregarded</hi> by many People, for more than <hi>thirty Years</hi> paſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I am ſenſible, that this is call'd a <hi>tender</hi> Point; but yet, I hope, not grievous to any who have a <hi>tender</hi> Conſcience, and <hi>are willing in all things to live honeſtly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Believe me, <hi>Sirs,</hi> I ſhould very gladly wave it, and not trouble your Honours and this Audience with it, if I cou'd only perſwade my ſelf, that I <hi>may</hi> omit it, and yet be <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to GOD and <hi>Man:</hi> But the truth is, I underſtand not how I can be ſaid to be <hi>faithful to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Will our <hi>honoured Fathers</hi> therefore be pleaſed, if only <hi>in kindneſs to the Province,</hi> and yet in the fear of GOD, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider at Leiſure, as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether the generality of the People do not live <hi>in the Sin</hi> of detaining from their Miniſters a part of their juſt Due: My meaning is, do they not live <hi>under</hi> the <hi>Guilt</hi> of a <hi>manifeſt</hi> and <hi>long continued violation</hi> of <hi>that</hi> good <hi>Law</hi> of GOD and <hi>Man,</hi> which relates to, and ſtrictly enjoins <hi>Juſtice</hi> and Equity? <hi>If not;</hi> then the matter ought to be wholly drop'd. But <hi>if ſo,</hi> then, whether there be not juſt Reaſon, both from the Word of GOD, and the nature of the thing to conclude, that the Province is under the <hi>Rebukes</hi> of a righteous GOD, partly, on <hi>this</hi> account?</p>

And <hi>if ſo;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, whether it may reaſonably be expected, that HE will be aton'd to the Province, (altho' we ſhou'd, in every other reſpect, become a reformed People) <hi>until this</hi> matter ſhall be adjuſted; <hi>Righteouſneſs between Man and Man,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>eſſential</hi> branch of the <hi>Religion</hi> of our LORD and <hi>Saviour?</hi>

               <p>[King <hi>Solomon</hi> makes mention both of the Sin, and the ill conſequence of it.

               <p>Juſtice, we all know, muſt be <hi>executed</hi> as well as decreed; this Power therefore, ought always to be lodg'd with ſuch Men who are beſt qualified and ſpirited for and unto this good Work.—And indeed, we have not a little Reaſon to be thankful, that ſo many of our <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Juſtices</hi> are Men of Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, and that they do ſo well adorn their Office and Character by an exemplary Conduct.

               <p>Let us, <hi>my dear Brethren,</hi> be tender of <hi>his</hi> Honour, who <hi>has</hi> put ſo great Honour upon <hi>us,</hi> as to appoint us to be ſome of <hi>his</hi> Embaſſadors to our fellow-men.—And as we wou'd hope to be ſtill own'd and honour'd by him in our Work, let <hi>Him</hi> be the <hi>principal</hi> Subject of our Preaching: Nor can we treat on one more noble, he being the marrow and ſcope of the holy Scriptures; I mean the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of CHRIST,

                  <hi>viz.</hi> of his Perſon, Natures, Offices and Benefits:—And next to theſe, let us preach all other the Principles of our holy Religion.</p>
               <p>And while we endeavour to preſerve the honour of the divine Sovereignty, we muſt alſo encourage the People to be waiting and hoping (in GOD's way) for the powerful Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the divine <hi>Spirit,</hi> that they may be effectually turned unto GOD.</p>
               <p>Nor may <hi>Moral</hi> Duties be omitted, nay, but muſt be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preached up, and as Duties requir'd and enjoyn'd <hi>by</hi> GOD our <hi>Saviour.</hi>—But then, we muſt alſo ſhow People the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of their having a living <hi>holy principle</hi> within them, <hi>in order</hi> to their bringing forth ſuch fruit as ſhall be <hi>well-pleaſing</hi> to the <hi>holy one of Iſrael.

               <p>And I can't forbear to ſay, that it becomes us to teſtifie againſt all <hi>unchriſtian Separations;</hi> as alſo to beware of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing in any meaſure, an <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>unlearned Miniſtry.</hi>

               <p>O, that <hi>We</hi> in the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> (in particular) may be excited to <hi>greater Induſtry</hi> in our Calling, conſidering that the time is haſtning on, when we ſhall be no longer Stewards, but muſt go away to give account of our Stewardſhip.—We have had frequent Admonitions of the truth of this in the <hi>Providence</hi> of GOD: And now again, <hi>very lately</hi> in the Death of <hi>one</hi> of <hi>the Paſtors</hi> of <hi>this Town:</hi>

               <p>Let me direct my ſelf to <hi>the Body of the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suffer, I beſeech you, the Word of Exhortation, and be intreated to recall to mind, <hi>the main Intention,</hi> on which our Fathers came into this then howling Wilderneſs; <hi>Not</hi> on a <hi>Worldly</hi> deſign, no, <hi>but</hi> on the account of <hi>Religion; viz.</hi> that they might (without moleſtation) worſhip GOD with that Purity and Simplicity, which <hi>they</hi> look'd upon to be moſt agreable to the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of CHRIST, and might leave the ſame as a Legacy to their Children: And they had an Eye alſo to the Inſtruction and Converſion of the Aboriginal Natives; which <hi>ought ſtill</hi> to be Proſecuted.</p>
               <p>And it is very evident, that GOD remarkably own'd and bleſs'd them, increas'd and eſtabliſh'd them; and thanks be to GOD, we are, at this Day, in the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of moſt of their external Privileges.—But yet alas! the Crown is fallen from our head, in that, now a <hi>Worldly</hi> Spirit threatens to eat out the <hi>Heart</hi> of Religion; yea, to deſtroy the very <hi>Name</hi> as well as the Power of it.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Many Vices ſeem to abound in the midſt of us, but <hi>this</hi> of <hi>Worldly-mindedneſs</hi> is become a <hi>general Malady;</hi> and truly it is of a <hi>fatal</hi> Aſpect and Tendency; for, hereby <hi>the Word of</hi> GOD <hi>is choak'd</hi> and rendred unfruitful; and hence, People prove to be good for themſelves <hi>only;</hi> yea,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:006593_0054_102948746BA318C8"/>
and that in ſo low and vile a Senſe, as to deſtroy themſelves, as well as injure the Public.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> Leſſon you have to learn, is, to <hi>Fear</hi> GOD. Wherefore, let <hi>Him,</hi> and not the World, have the <hi>Empire</hi> over you.</p>
               <p>The <hi>next</hi> Leſſon is, to <hi>Honour the King:</hi> And therefore, pray, <hi>continue</hi> to be dutiful and loyal Subjects to our right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and gracious SOVEREIGN: Yea, and not to him only, but to all ſuch alſo, who have the <hi>immediate</hi> Rule over us: O beware, <hi>Brethren,</hi> of ſpeaking evil of Dignities, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when it is apparent, that they exert themſelves in our Service. <hi>Some</hi> it ſeems have been too apt to ſpeak contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibly of our Rulers; having heard, that they have been <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> bro't into ſuch a <hi>ſtrait,</hi> that <hi>they knew not what to do.</hi> But let me tell <hi>ſuch</hi> People, that it wou'd better become you, to enquire, whether <hi>you</hi> have not had a hand in provoking <hi>the moſt high,</hi> at ſome Seaſons, to ſcatter Darkneſs in <hi>their</hi> Paths? The Word of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> are very worthy of your Conſideration. Chap. 29. 13, 14. <hi>Wherefore, the Lord ſaid, foraſmuch as this People draw near me with their Mouth, and with their Lips do honour me, but have removed their Heart far from me,—therefore, behold I will proceed to do a marvelous work amongſt this People,—for the Wiſdom of their wiſe Men ſhall periſh, and the Underſtanding of their prudent Men ſhall be hid.</hi>—And now, enquire, has not <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality</hi> in divine Service been exceeding prevalent in the Land? Alas! How greatly has a ſluggiſh, or an heedleſs Diſpoſition been indulg'd in our ſeveral Congregations! And how few, who appear to Worſhip GOD in Spirit and Truth! Yea, and GOD knows, whether there be not many among us, who wou'd ſeldom if ever attend the public Worſhip, were it not for ſhame or the fear of Man.</p>
               <p>I deny not that our honourable Rulers themſelves have their Imperfections, and doubtleſs they are ſenſible of it:—But what I ſay, is, let the People <hi>alſo</hi> learn to look at home, and labour to approve your ſelves unto GOD both in Worſhip and Converſation, and be much in Prayer for all ſuch who have the Rule over you.—And in a Word; if both <hi>they</hi> and <hi>you</hi> ſhall be <hi>upright before</hi> GOD, then he will guide <hi>them</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:006593_0055_102948764048C100"/>
by his Counſel, and will make their Path always ſafe, as well as plain before them.</p>
               <p>But then, let me go on to ſay, that you ought not only, to honour and pray for our civil Rulers, <hi>in being,</hi> or, <hi>as ſuch;</hi> but moreover to be very careful what manner of Men you <hi>ſhall</hi> make choice of <hi>from Year to Year,</hi> to <hi>Repreſent</hi> you at the <hi>Great and General Court:</hi> And omit not to beg of GOD (at the ſeaſon for it) that <hi>He</hi> would lead you into the Choice of the moſt ſuitable Perſons to take part in the Government over you. <hi>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, <hi>Brethren,</hi> of which I now ſpeak, is a matter of very great Importance: For, be pleas'd to conſider, that the <hi>Honourable Houſe of Repreſentatives</hi> do make <hi>One Branch</hi> of our Legiſlature; and not only ſo, but moreover, they have it under GOD, very much in their power, by reaſon of <hi>their Number,</hi> to determine, with the <hi>Conſent</hi> of the <hi>Captain General,</hi> what particular Gentlemen ſhall conſtitute <hi>another Branch</hi> of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as you tender the <hi>Weal</hi> of the <hi>whole</hi> Province, let every Town be very circumſpect in this matter: And as you do, or <hi>ought</hi> to deſire, that your ſeveral Repreſentatives would conduct at Court, even <hi>ſo do ye</hi> in the Choice of them; <hi>viz.</hi> lay aſide all <hi>Siniſter</hi> Views, and don't ſeek meerly to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie a Friend, nor let a proſpect of any perſonal Intereſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine you in this weighty Affair: But chooſe ye out wiſe Men, and of a public Spirit; true Friends to the Province, and the Privileges thereof, Religious and Academical as well as Civil: But then, (I ſay) they muſt be <hi>Wiſe</hi> Men, as well as Zealous in their Country's Cauſe; becauſe Zeal without Prudence will <hi>but hurry</hi> Rulers and their People with them into the depth of Miſery: Yea, and they ſhou'd be <hi>Honeſt</hi> Men, I mean, ſuch as have a principle of <hi>Juſtice</hi> within them, and have their <hi>Eyes open,</hi> ſo as to be able to <hi>See</hi> for their <hi>Neighbour</hi> as well as for themſelves; and will deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rather than injure the Public, or even a particular Perſon.</p>
               <p>And this leads me to exhort the <hi>whole Body</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> to <hi>ſtudy</hi> to be <hi>Honeſt.</hi>—We ſet up for a <hi>Religious</hi> People;

               <p>Yea, and ſuffer me in kindneſs to you, to deſire you to <hi>learn</hi> to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> between the Sin of <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> and a Love to <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and don't Charge any Man, or Order of Men, with the Guilt of the <hi>Former,</hi> meerly, becauſe he or they humbly deſire no more than the bare exerciſe of the <hi>Latter;</hi> for this wou'd either diſcover groſs Ignorance in you; or, which is much worſe, wou'd favour of Maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—'Tis certain, that Defrauding is not good Huſbandry, but Honeſty is the beſt Policy: <hi>Render therefore unto all their Dues; and owe no man any thing, but to love one another.—This</hi> is to be kind to your ſelves, and the way to become a <hi>delightſome Land,</hi>

               <p>But if, on the other hand, a People, and eſpecially in a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Country, will not be punctual to <hi>their own voluntary</hi> Obligations, <hi>according</hi> to the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper Intent</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of the <hi>ſame,</hi> altho' as capable of fulfilling them as formerly, and more ſo; what elſe can be expected, but that a <hi>Righteous</hi> GOD will make DISTRAINT upon them, either by a Succeſſion of Judgments, or elſe bring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome Yoke more heavy than the preſent.</p>

What can ſuch a Country expect, but to be involv'd in Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties more and more?—If <hi>they</hi> will <hi>Oppreſs</hi> one another, GOD will <hi>preſs</hi> hard <hi>upon them,</hi> and ſo cauſe the Puniſhment to anſwer to the Sin, till He has made them the <hi>Tail</hi> and the very <hi>ſcorn</hi> of the Provinces.—They may groan under their Burdens, but may expect no relief, unleſs they, reform, and become devout and ſincere in divine Service, and alſo pay a greater regard to the good Law of Equity and Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Yea, and ſuch a People's <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> are ſtill <hi>the greater,</hi> if they diſpiſe (not to ſay hate) him or them, whoſe Office <hi>obliges</hi> them to Reprove in the Gate: Or, if they are quite impatient when put in mind of their faults; altho' they can't but know, that it is the <hi>Indiſpenſible Duty</hi> of their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> to <hi>reprove, rebuke, and exhort</hi> as there ſhall be Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; yea, <hi>to cry aloud and not ſpare, to lift up their Voice like a Trumpet, and ſhow the People their Tranſgreſſions and Sins.</hi>—When the Caſe is <hi>thus,</hi> the <hi>Watchmen</hi> are bro't to this ſad <hi>Dilemma, viz.</hi> Whether to diſobey GOD, or to diſpleaſe <hi>Men.</hi> But then the Difficulty ſoon vaniſhes, if it be conſider'd, that we are under infinitely greater Obligations to obey GOD, than we are, or can be, to pleaſe <hi>Men:</hi>—And <hi>this Maxim</hi> ought to be receiv'd and remembred by the <hi>People</hi> alſo, that ſo, they may be <hi>patient</hi> under ſeaſonable reproof and admonition: Yea, it concerns them, not only to hear, but to humble themſelves and reform, leſt GOD ſhall in ſome more ſevere method of diſpenſation, ſo humble them, as to ſtain the pride of all their glory: <hi>For, thoſe that walk in pride, he is able to abaſe.</hi>

               <p>Nor do I deny, that the Caſe is ſometimes ſo, that the <hi>Watchman</hi> himſelf ſtands in need of being call'd upon:—Altho' People ſhould beware of a captious, litigious Spirit, yet, if they, or any of them obſerve any thing in their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's</hi> Doctrine or Conduct, which is <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with the <hi>Oracles</hi> of GOD; or, do apprehend, that he is too <hi>remiſs</hi> in the Diſcharge of any part of his Office; then doubleſs, they may and ought, in a proper decent manner, to put him in mind of it, and to ſay to him, as the <hi>Brethren</hi> of the Church in <hi>Coloſſe</hi> were <hi>directed</hi> to ſay to <hi>Archippus</hi> (Col. 4. 17.) <hi>Take heed to the Miniſtry which thou haſt received in the</hi> LORD,

               <p>To Proceed;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be ye not as Children toſſed too and fro with every wind of Doctrine: Neither heap to your ſelves Teachers, having itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ears;</hi> for as <hi>there were falſe Prophets among the People</hi> in old time, even ſo, without doubt, <hi>there will be falſe Teachers among you:</hi> Wherefore, <hi>hold faſt the form of ſound Words in faith and love, which is in</hi> CHRIST JESUS.—And as I ſaid, ſome Years ago, on a public Occaſion,<note n="*" place="bottom">In my <hi>Artillery-Election</hi> Sermon, pag. 51. Preach'd on <hi>June</hi> 1<hi>ſt.</hi> 1741.</note> ſo I ſay again, <hi>Hold faſt,</hi> in particular, the Doctrine of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> and that of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity of the New-Birth,</hi> and that of <hi>Juſtification by Faith without the Works of the Law,</hi> and that of the <hi>divine Decrees,</hi> as alſo that of the <hi>Saints Perſeverance, viz.</hi> as taught you in the BIBLE; and agreable thereunto have been taught by the <hi>godly Reformers;</hi> and as they now ſtand aſſerted and explained in the famous <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church of England:</hi> And which if ſuitably improv'd, will mightily ſerve to promote practical Religion and vital Piety.</p>
               <p>True indeed, you <hi>muſt have reſpect to all</hi> GOD's <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: This is a faithful ſaying, and we conſtantly teach and affirm it, that they who believe in</hi> GOD, and in JESUS whom he hath ſent, <hi>muſt be careful to maintain good Works:</hi> Yea, and <hi>you will</hi> be careful ſo to do, if you have a good Principle <hi>within</hi> you: Put then, you may not have the <hi>leaſt Dependance</hi> on the ſame to <hi>juſtifie</hi> you before the <hi>Holy</hi> LORD GOD, but muſt <hi>Build</hi> on CHRIST, the <hi>Rock</hi> of Ages, and the <hi>Hope</hi> of all <hi>true Iſraelites.—To him</hi> you muſt look for Guidance, Strength and Righteouſneſs: And the more you <hi>adore</hi> and <hi>rely</hi> upon <hi>Free Grace thro'</hi> JESUS CHRIST, in the way of <hi>well doing,</hi> the more will your Souls be in Health and Proſper.</p>
               <p>And pray, let ſpecial Care be taken by Parents and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that ſo, the <hi>Riſing Generation</hi> may be unto the LORD for a Praiſe and a Glory. Let your Children and Servants

be under a <hi>due Regimen,</hi> as well as be <hi>Inſtructed</hi> in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our holy Religion, and in other uſeful Learning.—Be fervent in <hi>Prayer</hi> to GOD with and for them; as alſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and Caution, Charge and Watch over them for their good: And <hi>thus</hi> let a good Foundation be laid for the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>next</hi> ſucceeding, yea, for <hi>many</hi> Generations.—Think it not too much, I beſeech you, to provide and ſupport good <hi>Schools</hi> for their ſakes: For certainly a part of your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Incomes being thus expended, will turn unſpeakably more to <hi>their</hi> real Advantage, than if otherways improved, and in the mean time, their Education be neglected: Good Inſtruction is much better <hi>for them,</hi> than Silver, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than the fineſt Gold.</p>
               <p>And let me be an humble <hi>Petitioner</hi> to my Dear Country-Men, to beſtow, in Imitation of your good Fathers, <hi>a Liberal Education</hi> on the <hi>moſt hopeful</hi> and <hi>promiſing</hi> of your Sons; that ſo, there may be a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of Men, capable of ſerving GOD and their <hi>Generation,</hi> both in the civil and ſacred Order.</p>
               <p>It has been matter of Grief, that any who call themſelves Friends to Religion, do ſo contradict and diſhonour the good Fathers of this Country, and the Founders of our Univerſity (which has prov'd ſo rich a Bleſſing to the Land) as to make light of Learning, and a learned Miniſtry: For, all ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, tho' perhaps they may not, at preſent, be ſenſible of it, inſtead of cheriſhing, are wounding Religion: Their Zeal is not according to Knowledge, nay, but in proportion to their own Ignorance, a blind, miſ-guided Zeal: And altho' they acknowledge it not, yet moſt probably, takes its Riſe from <hi>Pride</hi> of Heart, and a Fondneſs to be improv'd: And I may truly add, that there is more of the Hand of <hi>Satan</hi> in this matter than many imagine.</p>
               <p>But to draw <hi>towards a Cloſe;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As it is a true ſaying, that the beſt Conſtitution cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a proper Adminiſtration, make a People happy; ſo it is likewiſe a manifeſt Truth, that unleſs there be a <hi>Concurrence</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> with their Rulers, they cannot be in a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing State; for, no People <hi>can</hi> be made <hi>happy without</hi> their own <hi>Conſent:</hi> And therefore let the People of this Province ſuffer me without Offence, to urge and inculcate upon you,

the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of avoiding the very <hi>appearance</hi> of that ſhameful and pernicious evil of <hi>Corahiſm,</hi> and to intreat and beſeech you, chearfully to <hi>ſubmit to every Ordinance of Man for the</hi> LORD's <hi>ſake;</hi> and in Obedience to <hi>Him,</hi> as alſo for your own Benefit.</p>
               <p>Yea, <hi>Brethren, Whatſover things are true,—honeſt,—juſt, pure,—lovely,—and of good report; if there be any vertue, and if there be any praiſe, think upon,</hi> and be found in the Practice of <hi>thoſe things</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Phil. 4. 8.</note>.—And let all be done in the <hi>Name</hi> of CHRIST, and after a <hi>godly</hi> ſort; that ſo, your Praiſe may be, not of <hi>Man</hi> only, but of GOD alſo.</p>
               <p>And O, let none of us, of what Order or Calling, Age or Language ſoever, be unmindful of <hi>Him by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice;</hi> but let us <hi>Kiſs the</hi> SON, and acknowledge <hi>Him</hi> as the LORD our <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Strength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and ſubmit to <hi>Him,</hi> even, in all his Offices, as we wou'd partake in all his Benefits: For, <hi>He is the Way, the Truth and the Life, and no Man commeth to the Father but by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Finally,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As our Honourable <hi>Rulers</hi> will doubtleſs be very <hi>cautious</hi> leſt they give any <hi>juſt</hi> Occaſion to any Man to ſpeak evil of them; as alſo, will be much in <hi>Prayer</hi> both for themſelves and for the People under their Government;</p>
               <p>Even ſo, let us the LORD's <hi>Miniſters</hi> bear <hi>them</hi> together with our moſt <hi>Gracious</hi> SOVEREIGN and the <hi>Miniſtry at Home,</hi> upon our Hearts, in our Addreſſes to the Throne of Grace; not in public only, but every Day, both in private and ſecret.</p>
               <p>And let all the <hi>People</hi> both rich and poor, do the like; and in ſo doing, you will pray for yourſelves.</p>
               <p>And may it pleaſe GOD, this Day, and every Day, to <hi>hear us in Heaven, his holy dwelling place, and when he heareth, to forgive the Sins of the Land, and do for us, as the matter does or may require!</hi> And more eſpecially, to make us to be <hi>an Habitation of Righteouſneſs and Mountain of Holineſs!</hi>

And then, We ſhall not only find favour in the Eyes of the KING and of his <hi>Councellors;</hi> but moreover, GOD will in <hi>all other</hi> reſpects alſo, cauſe his Face to <hi>ſhine</hi> upon us; yea, He <hi>Himſelf</hi> will take delight to <hi>dwell</hi> in the midſt of us: And if <hi>He be</hi> with us and <hi>for us, who can be againſt us?
