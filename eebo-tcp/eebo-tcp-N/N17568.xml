         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>CORNELIA, daughter of Scipio Africanus, and mother of the Gracchi, was not more diſtinguiſhed by the nobility of her rank, than by the luſtre of thoſe virtues which adorned her character—a moſt amiable trait of which ſhines in that little incident recorded to her immortal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. A lady of Ionia coming one day to viſit her, impatiently expected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>A DESIRE of happineſs is the firſt propenſity of the heart.—It is born with us, and to attempt its ſuppreſſion were equally fruitleſs and wrong; for the Author of Nature has done nothing in vain, and the happineſs he has imprinted on the mind ſo clear an idea of, has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where an exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto you have obeyed the impulſe of nature in the artleſs purſuits of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; but the time is at hand, when this ſweet tranquillity will be interrupted by the buſtle of the world, which will not longer permit you to repoſe in the ſimple amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of dreſſing dolls, purſuing butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies, or plucking daiſies. Sweet dear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of innocence; on which, as you
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:022756_0006_0FBA5DEE3318FE60"/>
climb the rugged heights of life, you will look back with fond regret.</p>
                     <p>But we are not born for ourſelves alone; and therefore have duties to perform, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to diſcharge, and difficulties to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter; in the courſe of which, many a ſevere check is given to this happineſs which we all ſo ardently ſeek: yet the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of it will even acquire ſtrength by the repulſe, and there was never yet a wretch who had found it diminiſhed by misfortune. I wiſh the ſucceſs of this paſſion could be ſhown as demonſtrable as its exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>But the truth is, all mankind are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after the ſame object, though in ſuch oppoſite directions, that if it were not for their concurrent teſtimony, it would be ſcarce credible that they had each the ſame view. Yet it is the fate of moſt of them to ſit down at laſt in the very ſame diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which Solomon was in when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, rather peeviſhly it muſt be owned, that all was vanity and vexation of ſpirit. Man walks indeed in a vain ſhadow, and it is pitiable to reflect that a being of ſo tranſient a duration ſhould yet waſte the trifling portion of time allotted him in vain and fruitleſs purſuits, and after all the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:022756_0007_0FBA5DEFB3A82AB8"/>
ſchemes of the ſanguine, and the labours of the active, to find the deſired attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as far off as ever.</p>
                     <p>But this has been the caſe of millions, and I am afraid will ſtill continue to be ſo, at leaſt till we are unanimous in deciding on that grand point wherein this good, of which we have all ſo high an idea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts: an agreement from which, alas, we are at the fartheſt diſtance imaginable. And here, my deareſt girls, lies the whole of the miſtake. The Creator has not been wanting to provide a happineſs exalted as the mind itſelf can conceive, but man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf errs in the purſuit of it; ſome placing it in riches, ſome in power, ſcarcely on in an age ſuppoſing it to be where it really is—in the practice of virtue.</p>
                     <p>But while the human heart is ſet on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements, in which it can find no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction if attained, the ſpan of life muſt neceſſarily be paſſed in reſtleſs anxieties and melancholy diſappointment. It was the aim of philoſophy, to draw juſt eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of things, and to prevent its pupils from being dazzled with the ſplendor of wealth and power: it taught that the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign good was to be found in rectitude
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022756_0008_0FBA5DF504D457E8"/>
of will. It would be a ſhame for us to be at a loſs on ſuch an important ſubject, who have received leſſons from a much better maſter than ever gave lectures in the ſchools of Athens.</p>
                     <p>Reſt aſſured that in the exerciſe of ſocial and religious duties, the mind will find her ſolid happineſs. Wandering in reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſearch, like Noah's dove, 'tis here ſhe finds at length the welcome olive, the branch whoſe verdure blooms for immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Should you doubt the aſſertion, be prevailed on at leaſt to try the experiment.</p>

                     <p>PLEASURE has ſomething ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring in the very name, that it is not ſurprizing it finds ſo great a number of votaries. On no account would I have you inſenſible to its attractions, but rather lead you to its flowery paths, and conduct you to the moſt refined delights. Theſe how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you can never obtain, except you are guided in the choice by taſte and judgment.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022756_0009_0FBA5DF72AECE440"/>
A taſte in pleaſure is neceſſary for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of ſuch as are above the enquiries of the vulgar, ſuitable to delicate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined minds, and correſpondent to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt ſentiments: of courſe dependant more on intellectual, than on corporeal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. Taſte never fails to reject whatever is groſs and ſenſual; yet even among the more refined pleaſures, a found judgment is wanted, to diſcriminate the ſolid and rational, from the frivolous and faſtidious. The elegant hand of faſhionable diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has often given a poliſh to what, in its own nature, can never deſerve the name of pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Under this head muſt be comprehended the various ſpecies of faſhionable amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are injurious either to health or fortune. One would ſcarcely ſuppoſe ſuch purſuits as theſe ſhould ever be digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the name of pleaſure. Yet when numbers are daily ſeen hazarding, not only extravagant ſums, but peace of mind alſo, at the gaming-table.—When the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature is inverted, and the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of repoſe are bartered for midnight routs, we muſt conclude that ſuch valuable ſacrifices are not made but with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022756_0010_0FBA5DF7FABA6C80"/>
of ſome ſupreme pleaſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them: how ſeldom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> rewards are found, can beſt be determined by the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the diſſipated and gay, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have waſted the moſt valuable bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of life, as time, health, ſpirits, &amp;c. will generally confeſs that they have never found the ſatisfactions they ſought after.</p>
                     <p>To be able to diveſt real enjoyment from the falſe gloſſes the world has put upon it, is a piece of wiſdom becoming a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher; but it is a piece of wiſdom, you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ny dear girls, muſt alſo acquire, if you expect to be happy. Faſhion has arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to itſelf the prerogative of fixing the criterion of pleaſure; but faſhion is often a dangerous director, and is at beſt an imperfect one; for who has a power of effectually biaſſing the natural diſpoſition of another: if therefore what is called amuſement, be not agreeable to the real-turn of the mind, it ceaſes to be viewed in that light, and can only be conſidered as an irkſome conformity to the taſtes of others.</p>
                     <p>Yet, abject as ſuch a ſubmiſſion undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly is, there are thouſands who volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily yield to it, who are content to live, move, and act, not as they like themſelves,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022756_0011_0FBA5DF98472A430"/>
but as the polite world thinks fit to dictate. I am no advocate for affected ſingularity in things merely indifferent; but when the idol faſhion breaks in upon the rules of virtue (as it too often does) or the true enjoyment of life, this is ſo mean a ſlavery that a rational being might be expected to deſpiſe it.</p>
                     <p>When therefore reaſon and religion have given the clue to your pleaſures, reſolve always to have them of your own chooſing, and not of other people's. The ſanction of numbers is the cauſe that draws youth from virtue and happineſs: reaſon, when aided by a proper education, would if left to herſelf, point out the way to both.</p>
                     <p>There are pleaſures, my dear girls, to be met with in this journey of life, pure and ſublime ones too, if we look for them through the medium of unvitiated taſte. Did you ever diſcharge a ſocial duty, but upon looking into your heart, you there perceived a glow of ſatisfaction? But if you aim at more exalted, more rapturous ſenſations, give full ſcope to the impulſes of benevolence: try what it is to heal the broken-hearted: diffuſe joy through the manſions of ſorrow, and reſcue merit from
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022756_0012_0FBA5DFAF3FFEB90"/>
the preſſure of indigence and misfortune.—Theſe employments are capable of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſures ſuitable to the moſt exalted capacities, boundleſs as the moſt ſanguine imagination can paint them.</p>
                     <p>But if ſo vaſt a multitude has erred in the purſuit of pleaſure, through levity, not an inconſiderable number, of a very oppoſite temper, are at equally as great a diſtance from it: theſe are the moroſe and cynical, who will not condeſcend to the ſober ſatisfactions that are to be found in a domeſtic circle, where the ſocial affections are cultivated; if the gay and volatile miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the nature of pleaſure, theſe ſeem to queſtion its very exiſtence, and paſs through life without ſtooping to pick up one of the fair bloſſoms which nature has ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the way.</p>
                     <p>Ever be your hearts open to the ſweet emotions of ſocial love, and you will not have cauſe to complain that the path of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life affords nothing but briars and thorns.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it from the relative duties alone we can derive happineſs: the amuſing, the intereſting book of nature is open to all who can read it: here you meet with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

variety, order, and beauty; a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand charms await the mind which poſſeſſes a taſte for ſimple pleaſures; to ſuch the whole creation is a boundleſs ſource of rational amuſements. Happy, ineffably happy, they who can be pleaſed with art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs nature, and contemplate with delight, the noble imagery with which ſhe abounds. For my part, I ſhould deſire no greater proof of the purity and elegance of your taſte, than to hear you ſpeak in raptures of the graceful foliage of a wood, the beauty of a lawn, or any of thoſe charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rural ſcenes which are ſo often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for the far leſs nobler productions of art.</p>

                     <p>Covetouſneſs is a vice that abſorbs every finer feeling of the ſoul. Whatever ſordid ſatisfaction the miſer may feel in amaſſing his treaſures, yet the cares which unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably attend it, and the ſolicitude the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of it demands, more than ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the ſelfiſh gratification.—He knows nothing of the ſweet emotions of charity and benevolence, and muſt be ever a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the noble ſenſations they excite. It is well if the ſuggeſtions of his boundleſs avarice do not prompt him beyond the bounds of integrity. The honeſty of a covetous perſon can be but doubtful at the beſt.</p>
                     <p>A revengeful diſpoſition is as dreadful to ſociety as burdenſome to itſelf: it is the whirlwind of the ſoul, which under its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion

reſembles a fury of the infernal regions. What ſad cataſtrophes have been effected by revenge! what inexpreſſible torment overwhelms the heart, where that dreadful venom operates!</p>
                     <p>It is eaſy to perceive by the ſlighteſt glance, that every one of the paſſions here enumerated are totally deſtructive of peace: there can be no ſuch thing as tranquillity in the breaſt which they inhabit: let it then be the care of my deareſt girls, to guard againſt the fatal aſcendancy of either of them. There cannot be a more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable object than a human being who ſubmits to become the ſport of paſſions: a bark in a ſtorm driven by winds, and ſhattered by the tempeſt, exhibits but a faint picture of ſuch a wretch, whoſe days paſs in continual anguiſh; he looks for peace, but finds deſpair; caſts oblique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the wiſdom and goodneſs of Providence; diſtruſts his attributes; curſes his own being, and dies if poſſible more wretched than he lived.</p>
                     <p>The infinitely wiſe and good Creator ſaw the abundant evils that would accrue to mankind from the degeneracy of the paſſions, and therefore in his goodneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined

                     <p>Perhaps the natural paſſions of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind may be reduced to two—the love of pleaſure and the love of praiſe, and from the corruptions of theſe may be traced every irregular affection of the heart—when men no longer knew the true ſource from whence to look for happineſs, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, it is not much wonder it ſhould be fought in power, riches, and pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; nor that the love of theſe ſhould branch into ſelf-love, vain glory, and all the other evil paſſions, which cauſe ſo much miſery in the world.</p>
                     <p>The regulation of the heart and its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, is a point then of the utmoſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſince on it depends your preſent peace and eternal glory.

                     <p>Never loſe ſight of this truth—that there is no happineſs adequate to the capacities of the human ſoul, but what is found in the exerciſe of piety and virtue; nor any praiſe worthy her regard, but what reſults immediately therefrom. Adieu,</p>

                     <p>By all means cultivate a taſte for reading, but take care that your taſte be a juſt one—that is, be more deſirous of inſtruction than amuſement, or you will profit but little by literary purſuits.

                     <p>The private lives of famous perſons afford much edification to the reader; the vice or meanneſs too often there diſplayed, teaches us not to be dazzled by the blaze of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity or power; and to contemn that virtue which is built on the deſire of fame alone.

<pb n="25" facs="unknown:022756_0029_0FBA5E21F3F3E570"/>
few are called forth as diſtinguiſhed actors on the theatre of the world, all may, if they pleaſe, be <hi>great</hi> in private life; that is, may acquire thoſe amiable qualities of mind, which can only conſtitute real great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; without which the hero is no more than a hypocrite, and even the robe of roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, but a tinſel ornament to cover real meanneſs.</p>
                     <p>Your chief aim ſhould be the knowledge of the human heart, and that is in general more fully diſcovered in trifling traits and circumſtances, than by important actions performed under the public eye. But you no where find human nature ſo impartially delineated, as in the ſacred writings. There the hiſtorians neither influenced by paſſion or prejudice, relate both actions and their ſecret ſprings with unerring can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; never calumniating enemies, or ſtooping to flatter the favourites of their nation.</p>
                     <p>The Jewiſh writers had the faireſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities imaginable for exaggerating the virtues of their heroes, conſidering the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous powers ſo often exerted in their behalf. Such an adventure as that of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid with Goliah, would have been thought
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:022756_0030_0FBA5E349E7D2D00"/>
by a pagan writer, ſufficient grounds for exalting his favourite to a God; yet the inſpired Biographer has drawn that Prince with all his frailties about him; all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of humanity; ſometimes glowing with the rapturous devotion of a Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim;—at others, enſlaved by the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt paſſions. Such inſtances of candour, conſidered with the national pride of the Jews, leave no room to doubt the vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the ſacred penman on any occaſion.</p>
                     <p>The ſcriptures alſo finely illuſtrate many parts of profane hiſtory: we are told of embattled armies, and cities levelled with the duſt; but it is only in holy writ we find thoſe armies prophetically marſhalled, and that deſtruction denounced perhaps an hundred years before the event. Theſe are inſtances which impreſs the mind with reverence for the ſacred records, and fill it with auguſt ideas of the eternal Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p>The works of our beſt moraliſts will not be unentertaining to you, if your taſte for reading be as good as I wiſh it. Amongſt the productions of this kind are the Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator and the Rambler; as conſpicuous for the elegance of their language, as the ſoundneſs of their morality. But there
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022756_0031_0FBA5E3588D7E2B0"/>
are no better rules for the moral conduct of life, than are found in the writings of Solomon, and the Son of Sirach; which, though compoſed ſo many ages ago, may yet be read to much advantage, by thoſe who would paſs through life happily and reſpected.</p>
                     <p>If you are fond of poetry, be careful to read only what is good of it. There is a kind of verſification that tends to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

Elegance of numbers, though a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, is yet the loweſt recommendation of good poetry;—its characteriſtics are dignity of thought, purity of expreſſion, and, above all, the beſt principles of piety and morality. For this reaſon, thoſe poet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical pieces extant in the Bible are by good judges allowed to be truly ſublime. Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in its original ſtate, being only the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious effuſions of a mind glowing with elevated ſentiments of generoſity, gratitude and devotion. Many of the Pſalms are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble compoſitions, and neither for beauty of figure, or energy of expreſſion, have ever been excelled.</p>

There is a line of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter drawn between the ſexes, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can paſs without becoming contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It is not to make you deſpiſe thoſe acquirements which have ever been appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the female ſex, that you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited

to mental attainments, but to render you ſtill more valuable as women; and the better your minds are cultivated, the more you will ſee the propriety of attending to thoſe minutiae which become the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which Providence has placed you.</p>
                     <p>I do not ſee how you can acquit yourſelf tolerably in domeſtic life, without a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of needle-work; but granting your rank and fortune may pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Even our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent amuſements require variation, and the mind may be agreeably relieved, by imitating with the needle the beautiful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of nature—but there is ſomething which places a ſkill in needle-work in a much more important point of view, and that is, the inconſtancy of fortune, which in her capricious moods has been often known to compel thoſe, whom once ſhe ſmiled on, to procure their ſubſiſtence by thoſe very arts which were acquired only for amuſement. Whatever may be a reſource

                     <p>A proficiency in the arts of domeſtic ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and oeconomy, ought juſtly to be ranked among the accompliſhments of a young lady. You muſt be unacquainted with nothing that appertains to good houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery. Some girls have I known profeſs ſo violent an attachment to literary purſuits, that they are content to remain ignorant of common attainments. This ſhows a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable weakneſs—elevated minds are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to every thing; and, believe me, it is very poſſible to poſſeſs a competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of polite literature, and be well verſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the methods of well governing a houſe at the ſame time—the latter qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations have of themſelves conſtituted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an uſeful character in female life, which is more than can be ſaid of the former. Blend therefore, my beloved girls, <hi>polite</hi> with <hi>uſeful</hi> acquirements, and you will be what I wiſh you.</p>
                     <p>In writing, acquire, if poſſible, a good hand; yet that is not ſo eſſentially neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as the being able to write grammatically—the violation of the <hi>common</hi> rules of grammar is an indiſputable mark of low

breeding; and although my Lord Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field ſarcaſtically ſaid, that bad ſpelling was only allowable in a woman, it certainly is not in any one, who pretends to an edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation above the vulgar. Could you write as fine a hand as even A—n himſelf, bad ſpelling would diſgrace the whole. The ſubſtituting <hi>have</hi> for <hi>has, are</hi> for <hi>is,</hi> &amp;c. infallibly ſinks you in the eſtimation of well bred perſons. In order to avoid errors of this kind, habit is to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly guarded againſt. If in your early years you are not careful to write and ſpell correctly, it is a thouſand to one if you ever do. You ſee, therefore, of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it is that you pay a preſent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to theſe points.</p>
                     <p>I reckon among the uſeful attainments, the ability of penning an epiſtle with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and elegance—many fortunate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in life may be facilitated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by—a well wrote letter has often effected what verbal requeſts have ſought in vain—beſides this conſideration, how greatly muſt the ſweet intercourſe of friendſhip be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by a free and intelligent correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence!

all the pleaſures of ſuch a connection; but except you attain the deſirable habit of expreſſing your ſentiments without em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment, hope not to enjoy any thing of ſo delicate a ſatisfaction. Letters ſhould be the pictures of the ſoul; and ſo they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways would be, if people acquired only the knack of expreſſing their thoughts juſt as they ariſe. Write as you would ſpeak, were the perſons you addreſs immediately before you. There is no more than this neceſſary to eſtabliſh that eaſineſs of ſtyle which is the chief beauty of epiſtolary correſpondence. That good breeding which I hope will be habitual to you, will dictate thoſe terms and forms of addreſs the condition of thoſe you write to require—We do not always find the moſt learned people write the moſt agreeable letters—perhaps for no other reaſon than that they take too much trouble about it, and like the good Archbiſhop of Benevento, reject the firſt thought that occurs. Some that I have known indite an epiſtle in ſuch a ſtiff and formal ſtyle, and load it ſo diſguſtfully with tautology, that one would almoſt

                     <p>WHEN you compare the aukward motions of a ruſtic, with the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel and graceful movement of a perſon of education, you cannot but be aſſured of the utility of dancing: but it ſhould never be forgotten, that to give this ſuperiority of mien and air is the chief end of that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite accompliſhment;—to loſe ſight of this idea is to take away the real worth of that branch of genteel education;—to reduce it to an unimportant, if not pernicious attainment. However a knowledge of dancing may ſometimes conduce to ſocial pleaſure, and in that light be eſteemed an agreeable and innocent recreation, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help thinking, that the ſame applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is requiſite to form an opera dancer, may very well be diſpenſed with in a young lady of a different character. The extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant leaps and geſtures of ſome faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able females, make me think of the ſpeech of Philip of Macedon to his ſon, on another occaſion—I am ready to aſk if they "are not aſhamed to <hi>dance</hi> ſo well."</p>

There is ſcarce a human ſoul, however apparently dead to ſenſibility, but is in ſome meaſure alive to the extatic charms of muſic. The ſtory of Orpheus is more than a fable—minds almoſt as inert and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate as trees themſelves, have been moved by the power of harmonious ſounds;—why elſe does the gaping ruſtic follow with ſuch manifeſt delight the itinerant muſician? and why, but that the effect of muſic on the paſſions is ſo inconteſtibly proved, has the army adopted the ſons of Apollo with thoſe of Mars?—Since then this ſcience has ſo great an influence on the feelings of the ſoul, is it not ſurpriſing that the polite world ſhould not be more ambitious of enjoying thoſe ſublime ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, which the beſt pieces are ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly capable of exciting, and not reſt poorly ſatisfied with the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Drawing, painting, &amp;c. juſtly form a part of polite education, becauſe they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh an agreeable, as well as rational amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

They lead to a familiarity with the beauties of nature, and that can ſcarcely fail to advance the mind a degree higher, even to the contemplation of her Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. But if it had not this happy tendency, drawing is ſtill a laudable amuſement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an innocent one; and whatever fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes a recreation of that nature, may certainly be deemed an auxiliary to virtue.</p>
                     <p>An acquaintance with the languages of polite nations greatly enlarges the mind. It is the property of ignorance to eſteem nothing valuable that a foreign country produces; and ſcarcely to allow that its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are human. Nothing tends more immediately to remove ſuch illiberal preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, than ſtudying the language of the people thus deſpiſed. The ſupercilious contemner is ſurpriſed to find them rational, and expreſſing ſimilar ideas with thoſe of his own country.</p>
                     <p>If neceſſity or inclination ever leads you from your native land, a previous acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the language of thoſe you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide among, would much facilitate your pleaſure and convenience; would open to you the avenues of ſocial love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and take off much from thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs ſenſations the mind is apt to feel in
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:022756_0044_0FBA5E4A9EC1B010"/>
the idea of being amongſt a people it knows not. For this end, perhaps it may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to acquire the knowledge of the French tongue, that being generally underſtood by intelligent perſons of every European na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But there is another advantage at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending this branch of polite education, and which probably to you, my dear girls, will be the moſt uſeful—I mean the being able to read in their original, thoſe beautiful compoſitions which loſe many of their excellencies by tranſlation. For this reaſon become acquainted alſo with the Italian; but Homer and Virgil, you tell me, have beauties that can never be tranſlated—true, yet theſe I fancy you muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to taſte as pure as the labours of the learned afford them; the Greek and Latin tongues, forming no part in the polite ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of female education at preſent, nor certainly ever can in the <hi>uſeful.</hi>

                     <p>From a total ignorance of letters in female life, we are advanced to an age which requires
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:022756_0045_0FBA5E4BFA6ECD20"/>
every girl to be made a grammarian; yet it unfortunately happens, that of the numbers who profeſs to have ſtudied the grammar of their native tongue, few ſpeak or write it with that accuracy which could be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; indeed the progreſs that women uſually make in that ſcience, is ſeldom of itſelf ſufficient to give an habitual elegance of expreſſion; they are more indebted for it to frequent reading of the beſt authors, and the converſation of thoſe who have themſelves acquired it perfect. What you can, acquire of grammar by ſuch aſſiſtances as theſe. There is an indiſpenſable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for you to write and ſpeak Engliſh correctly: acquire that qualification as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily as you can, but nothing will more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate it, than the methods I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

attainment. Yet painful application muſt render that wiſh effectual—a reflection howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that ſhould excite your emulation, rather than deſpondency—trivial acquirements may content the indolent and timid, but the arduous and difficult are the proper aim of elevated minds. Courage belongs not to the warrior alone,—it is as often found in the cloſet, as the field.</p>
                     <p>That reſolution which is neceſſary for every valuable purpoſe of life, is the fruit only of active minds, and was never found with indolence and ſloth;—determine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conquer every tendency to an inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive temper. Whenever you feel in your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an inaptitude for doing what neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ought to be done, rouſe that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or you will give ground to an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the moſt deſtructive to happineſs and virtue; and who once entrenched is hard to be diſlodged. Never defer to the next hour, that which ſhould be the buſineſs of the preſent. "Whatever thy hand find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to do, do it, with all thy might," ſaid a very wiſe man many hundred years ago; indeed there is no precept throughout the ſacred writings, inculcated with greater energy than this of diligence. It is the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:022756_0048_0FBA5E507169D378"/>
ſoul of virtue—the foundation of honor and affluence.</p>
                     <p>Many a bright and ſhining talent lies hid in a napkin, for want of activity to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold it; nor do we unfrequently meet with perſons ſtruggling with diſtreſſes, which require only their own exertions to remove. Indolence takes hold of the diſpoſition much oftener than is acknowledged; it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be wholly under its dominion, and yet ſuſpect nothing of it: and, what is yet more ſtrange, to believe one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s ſelf to be the moſt diligent perſon in the world at the very time. You have ſeen numbers of bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling people, who are always in a hurry, and ſo perplexed do they appear with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as never to be able to enjoy a friend or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It would ſeem hard at firſt ſight to accuſe them of indolence, and yet they are of all people moſt commonly under its power; for an habitual diligence would ſo comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably arrange the affairs of life, that none would be found to intrude on another. Conſider the ſurpriſing diſpatch with which ſome in public ſtations, manage a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the moſt important concerns;—to contemplate them, one would almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing too extenſive for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:022756_0049_0FBA5E543A650D08"/>
of the human mind;—diligence is the charm which effects it all.</p>
                     <p>In that diſmal catalogue of diſeaſes which imbitter mortality, not a few owe their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence to indolence. The indigent labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er who toils for daily bread, knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that ſad train of nervous diſorders which render life itſelf burdenſome to the wealthy. In ſome caſes, poverty might juſtly be called a bleſſing. Great are the atchievements which reſolution and diligence can effect:—in nothing is their power more conſpicuouſly ſeen, than in the culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the mind: to reflect on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the human underſtanding—to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the refinements of philoſophy with a ſtate of ſavage nature—a Newton, with an inhabitant of New Holland—we ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conclude ſome ſupernatural power muſt have contributed to give the former ſo infinite a ſuperiority in the ſcale of beings. Without the quality I have recommended, it could never have been attained, for though much be owing to accidental ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, ſuch as the being born in an enlightened kingdom affords, yet no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable portion of diligence is required to render theſe advantages perſonally effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. It is this, my dear girls, that makes
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:022756_0050_0BFA5E55B41F5E58"/>
them yours, and without it, the ſoul will remain as uninformed as if deſtined to a land where ſcience never darts a cheering beam.</p>
                     <p>It may ſeem ſtrange to tell you of old age, before you have ſcarce paſſed your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; yet I muſt not conceal from you, that a period will arrive, when exterior attractions will be no more;—when mental acquirements will prove your higheſt luſtre and ſublimeſt comfort. However deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an ignorant woman appears at any part of her life, in the decline of it ſhe is ſure to become far more contemptible; at that time, it is the improvements ſhe has made in early days, that give dignity of character. An old age of cards neceſſarily ſucceeds a youth of folly. Pope could not have ſaid any thing more deſtructive of the inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of thoſe ancient habits, than he has expreſſed in that conciſe ſatire. If you would avoid the contempt which never fails to attend a frivolous old age, you muſt paſs a youth of diligence and application.</p>
                     <p>But then the pleaſures reſulting from it ſurpaſs deſcription; the ſatisfactions of a rich cultivated mind are only fully known to the happy poſſeſſor; one of them, we are aſſured, is a noble independence, which
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:022756_0051_0FBA5E573A7D86A8"/>
creates, if I may ſo ſpeak, its own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; is not indebted to diſſipation, or the caprice of others; but can derive from itſelf exhauſtleſs reſources for ſolitude or ſociety. Ordinary perſons are obliged to fly from <hi>Ennui</hi> to the regions of amuſement, but ſuperior beings, who have traverſed the fields of uſeful and polite knowledge, can from themſelves ſelect materials for the moſt exquiſite enjoyment.</p>
                     <p>Do you think this an acquiſition worth deſiring—then never forget that it can be obtained only by diligence and active in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. Habits of indolence are deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of every valuable attainment, and they are as much ſo of happineſs, as they are known to be of virtue.</p>

foibles of others, preſents to our view the beſt ſide of this motley ſcene.</p>
                     <p>Without doubt, ſuperior minds have a quicker ſenſe of what is beautiful in nature, or deſirable in life, than a peaſant, whoſe ideas extend not beyond his daily occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions perhaps they feel more acutely the evils of their condition; yet the perſons who ſuffer moſt by this affected ſenſibility are not they who have the greateſt ſhare of afflictive events, but the idly ſpeculative, who being employed to no good purpoſe, have time to nouriſh thoſe artificial feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which Nature knows nothing of.</p>

                     <p>I have often thought that the great prevalence of vice ariſes chiefly from a culpable weakneſs of temper—for there is nothing ſo amiable in it, that it ſhould be followed for its own ſake. It is the mere want of reſolution that betrays ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into the dreadful abyſs of ſin and miſery.</p>

                     <p>But, in my opinion, he muſt be a poor philoſopher who cannot, and would have made but a ſorry figure in the Portico or Lyceum.</p>

but theſe cannot be ſupported with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome portion of reſolution. There is a proper firmneſs, without which neither virtue, happineſs, or dignity of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, can be long maintained.

                     <p>Be poſſeſſed of the true principles of honor and rectitude, and dare to adhere to them in ſpite of ſolicitation, or that ſtill more powerful means of temptation, ridicule. Eſtabliſh your opinions on truth and reaſon, and maintain them, when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, with firmneſs;—ſome people give up both their faith and their friends, for want of reſolution to defend them—

                     </p>
                     <p>In buſineſs, and the affairs of life, a proper firmneſs is indiſpenſably neceſſary. Thoſe who can be influenced by every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſer or intimidated at every appearance of difficulty, muſt of courſe be deſultory and unſettled. They effect nothing of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, becauſe they know not how to perſevere in any undertaking. Obſtacles will attend the beſt concerted ſchemes, and mankind will ever think differently
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:022756_0057_0FBA5E66C6F70138"/>
about them; but the truly wiſe will await with ſteady patience the iſſue of thoſe meaſures they have been careful to found in prudence and the moral fitneſs of things. Some will undertake nothing, till they ſee the path ſmooth before them, and attain almoſt a certainly of ſucceſs. Such will find their lives waſte, before they have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on the plan of it. Thoſe who beſt know the ſtate of humanity, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that to deſign prudently and act firmly, is all that can be done by mortals.</p>
                     <p>Without reſolution, it will ſometimes be impoſſible to act agreeably to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of right reaſon, and virtue; for theſe are not always the <hi>ton;</hi> and when that is the caſe, no inconſiderable ſhare of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is requiſite to repel the attacks of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule or amuſement—nor can the treaſures of knowledge be explored, without a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it—for "there is nothing truly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable to be attained without pains and labour." Diſmayed at the proſpect, the indolent, as deſcribed by Solomon, cry, "a lio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> is in the ſtreet."—Rather may my dear girls be animated with a noble ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, to ſurmount every difficulty which would retard their acquiſition of merit and felicity. Parnaſſus itſelf was a craggy

rock, but then the Muſes dwelt on its top.</p>
                     <p>But if reſolution be neceſſary to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining whatever is valuable or deſirable in life, it is no leſs ſo to the ſupporting us under a deprivation of it. The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong—hence it follows, that the wiſeſt meaſures do not always meet with ſucceſs, nor can virtue itſelf prevent the encroachments of affliction—in ſuch circumſtances fortitude gives a dignity to ſuffering, and tends alſo to alleviate the weight of it. Every one knows the ſentiment of the Philoſopher—<q>that a good man ſtruggling with adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, is a ſight on which the Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves might look down with delight.</q> However that be, it is certain that ſuch a character never fails to command the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and veneration of mankind. Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, of all the qualities of the mind, ſeems moſt ſecure of admiration. The Saviour of the world inculcated it, when having forewarned his diſciples of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching ſufferings, he enjoined them to poſſeſs their ſouls in patience. Patience is amongſt the Chriſtian duties, what mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity is in the liſt of heroic virtues. They are ſynonymous terms—both imply that calm, unſhaken fortitude, which is at
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:022756_0059_0FBA5E6AB6756BE8"/>
once characteriſtic of the hero and the Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>But do not conclude this firmneſs of mind—this laudable reſolution, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> calculated only to be admired. It is of the higheſt actual ſervice to the unfortunate, not only by enabling them to ſuſtain the burden of their ſufferings, but by opening a way to better proſpects. The timid and irreſolute ſink, at the approach of adverſity, into a deſpondency the moſt unfriendly to their affairs, by precluding that courageous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry which might render them more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable; and therefore, by the nature of things, augment the very evils of which they complain.</p>
                     <p>Cultivate in all circumſtances this innate conſtancy—it will aid you in the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every good and valuable end,—in proſperity, will ſecure you from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of vanity,—impart dignity and ſerenity to adverſity.

                     <p>MY epiſtles to you, my dear girls, are written without the leaſt attention to method; their reſpective ſubjects have more the appearance of chance, than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; and therefore, may be juſtly called curſory thoughts on various ſubjects. Young folks, I know, do not love preciſe rules, and perhaps you deem the irregularity of my letters their chief merit. Allow them, however, one more—that of ſincerity: and believe that the ſentiments they contain, flow from the heart; I believe, I need not add the word <hi>ſpontaneouſly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As I diſclaim all methodical arrangement of my ſubjects, I will here give you my thoughts on that very important part of female ſtudy, dreſs. Be not afraid that I am about to confine you to a primitive plainneſs, though probably, ſuch a mode may be found more advantageous to beauty and elegance, than modern finery; yet I ſhall recommend that which is at once agreeable to faſhion, and your own rank and circumſtances. To reconcile theſe
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:022756_0061_0FBA5E6DC2D910A0"/>
three conditions, is no eaſy taſk, yet herein lies a chief perfection of the female cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; few women poſſeſs the happy art;—yet thoſe who do, muſt be allowed a very ſuperior degree of merit. It is no inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable trait in the character of an amiable young lady, that ſhe knows how to ſupport a genteel appearance; and yet pay a juſt regard to the frugality, which probably her limited circumſtances require.</p>
                     <p>A fantaſtical and expenſive turn in dreſs, is the certain mark of a little mind; but that attention to it, which principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards neatneſs, is undoubtedly extremely laudable. Reſolve to be always neat, or you can never be well-dreſſed;—a dirty ruffle, a torn apron, &amp;c. are ſufficient to diſgrace the moſt ſplendid apparel. Neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is always within your power, and will always render you reſpectable in whatever rank of life you are placed; but finery, without it, is nothing more than a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous glare, which is never ſeen but with diſguſt.</p>
                     <p>Faſhion has impoſed ſome general rules, which may innocently be followed under the reſtrictions I have mentioned. Your clothes may be made according to the mode, though the materials which compoſe
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:022756_0062_0FBA5E2B231F6CB0"/>
them, be leſs coſtly than if they belonged to a Dutcheſs. An uncouth, ill-faſhioned habit, derogates even from the importance of a philoſopher; and it is not till after a near acquaintance, that merit is diſcovered through a ſhabby garment—ſo much are mankind governed by appearance.</p>
                     <p>"Prithee good Xenocrates (ſaid Plato to his pupil) ſacrifice to the graces." That great man knew how much the mental ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments might be illuſtrated and adorned by a poliſhed exterior;—a wiſe perſon, it is true, would not make this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the criterion of merit, yet perhaps, would not readily look for worth beneath an ungraceful exterior.</p>
                     <p>After all, my dear girls, eſteem the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, though often troubleſome arts of dreſs, but as a tax you are in ſome ſort obliged to pay to the folly of the age. Remember on all occaſions, that external ornaments cannot make you better or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier women. Great minds, however they may have judged it neceſſary to conform to inſignificant cuſtoms, have always regarded them in their proper light. The attention ſuch are ſeen to ſhow to the idol faſhion, is only a good natured condeſcenſion to the weakneſs of mankind, in points they judge of an indifferent nature, and much too tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:022756_0063_0FBA5E6F88814AB8"/>
to become the objects of their ſerious cares. The ſilly and ignorant are they who love dreſs for its own ſake.</p>

                        </gap> greater folks than themſelves. Thus in the room of that ſocial amity with which the human heart ſhould overflow, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily divided between the throbbings of ambition, and the pangs of offended pride.</p>
                     <p>It is evident, that in this buſtle, greater attention is paid to the accidental circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of rank and affluence, than to real merit; we ſhould not elſe ſo often ſee peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the middling rank, when flattered by the notice of a ſuperior, ſo elated with the honor of keeping, what they call good company; when perhaps, that ſuperior is conſpicuous for almoſt every vice and meanneſs. This is a grand miſtake ſurely—as fatal to happineſs as to morals.</p>
                     <p>Good company can only mean perſons of noble ſentiments, refined manners, and enlightened underſtandings. But theſe qualities are not to be expected, where the ſcantineſs of fortune has abſolutely exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the means of education; for the human
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:022756_0065_0FBA5E7230FD5DD8"/>
mind becomes every thing by culture. It is therefore found, that in the lower ranks of ſociety, where poverty has denied time and abilities for that happy employ, the worſt habits, and moſt depraved morals prevail; for this reaſon you are not to chooſe companions from ſuch a claſs.</p>
                     <p>In fine, your aſſociates muſt be thoſe of a liberal and virtuous education. It may happen you may find a friend of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciption, whoſe relative or neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections may not be eligible for you. In this caſe ſhe is by no means a proper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, as her own merit, however great, will not compenſate for the danger you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in frequently mingling with perſons of improper character.</p>
                     <p>A cultivated mind is the proper ſoil for every moral and ſocial virtue—it is moſt likely to be found where Heaven has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed an eaſy fortune, conſequently the genteeler ranks of life will be moſt likely to afford you proper companions. But here let merit alone, and not adventitious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, influence your ſelection—de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe that contemptible weakneſs which piques itſelf on the rank, rather than the mental value of an acquaintance; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let a principle of vanity lead you to

the ſervile imitation of vice or folly, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſanctioned by wealth or titles. Little minds are ever dazzled by ſhow and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour—it is the property of the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened only to diſtinguiſh perſonal worth from external advantages. I ſhould think you diſgraced by an acquaintance with an empreſs, if ſhe was not as much diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by virtue as power.</p>
                     <p>Be careful not to form an acquaintance too haſtily—many a virtuous girl has ſunk for ever in the eſteem of the world, by being ſeen in company with thoſe of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reputation.

She having admitted them to her ſociety, without the requiſite inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of that point, infallibly renders her own prudence ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>A very extenſive acquaintance is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſocial happineſs. A few ſelect friends will moſt conduce to that end; and it is among theſe, that

The cruel aſperſion is borne on the wings of ſcandal from circle to circle, nor perhaps reaches the injured party till the wound given to his reputation is too deep for cure.</p>
                     <p>Barbarous as ſuch a cuſtom is, I need not ſay how greatly it prevails in almoſt all companies. I have, however, the charity to believe it does not always proceed from malice or envy. W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

ſomething muſt re-kindle it; and when no rational ſubject ariſes, that ſomething muſt be ſcandal. This, though it may may be a palliation of the crime, is yet no excuſe; for the wounds given by unmeaning igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance are as deep as thoſe inflicted by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated rancour.

                     <p>Whatever you ſay, ſhould be meant for the entertainment or inſtruction of the company, rather than the gratification of vanity.

Deliver your ſentiments as they occur, without affecting more graces in your tone or geſtures than are your own—theſe, well managed, will be enough to render you amiable.

This, dear girls, is the ſum of all religion; without it, vain were the oblations of the Jewiſh church—vain are the ceremonials of the Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>The "love of God," is an expreſſion, that of late years has been as groſsly abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the word religion. Strange as it may appear, there have been thoſe, who leading the moſt immoral lives, have ſtyled themſelves lovers of the God of purity—whoſe tongues could utter a pious ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while their hands were committing the moſt flagitious crimes. But be not deceived—this exalted character belongs neither to bigotry nor enthuſiaſm. The love of God is not a paſſion, but a rational principle; it is thoſe ſentiments of reverence and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which naturally ariſe in a generous mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when reflecting on one ſupreme bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent power, who is the immediate author of all good, and the fountain of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. This conviction is the parent of
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:022756_0077_0FBA5E83802ECC78"/>
unaffected piety; the ſoul cannot but adore the Being ſhe believes to be all wiſe, all mighty, and eternal;—ſhe cannot but love him who is the ſource of unnumbered bleſſings;—nor chooſe, but dread to offend him whoſe nature ſhe believes to be holineſs. Hence the ſource of moral virtue—ſin is avoided, becauſe diſpleaſing to the will of the Deity; and virtuous are diſpoſitions are acquired, becauſe agreeable to a power who is able to reward every endeavour to pleaſe him, with eternal and unſpeakable happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

To prevent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſturbed by the ſpiritual pride of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical fanatics, remember there is an invariable teſt by which you may know if you have the love of God. Aſk your own heart, if it ſeeks the favour of the Deity above every other conſideration? if it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues this more than its deareſt intereſts, and even life itſelf, a ready affirmative puts the queſtion out of all doubt.</p>
                     <p>I have been always of opinion, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion owes the abuſes that have been put

ordain him the father of a nation; who being by numerous and peculiar laws, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the reſt of the world, might preſerve, uncorrupt the knowledge of the Divine Nature. The Bible will convince you how ineffectual, not only theſe laws, but the frequent and ſignal manifeſtations of Almighty Power were to ſecure that people from the groſſeſt idolatry, the rites of which were now become ſo terrible to the imagination, that they even burnt their children alive, in ſacrifices to their horrid idols.</p>
                     <p>What a picture is here of human nature! that nature which once ſo nearly approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the angelic! Do you not begin to ſee the neceſſity of a Redeemer? Let us pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the thread of hiſtory, and take a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial view of the moſt celebrated nations which peopled the earth before the glorious aera of his appearance.</p>
                     <p>The Egyptians were very early eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for learning, laws and arts—they were a numerous, powerful, and wealthy people, but ſo groſsly idolatrous, that they not only worſhipped images, but beaſts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, and even vegetables. The manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and extenſive commerce of Phoenicia, ſuppoſe ſome advance in refinement—but

national intercourſe in thoſe wretched times ſerved but to promulgate national idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Babylon, that mighty ſeat of empire, ſurpaſſed moſt other nations in the ſuperb materials of her Gods. Aſtronomers there obſerved the motions of the Heavens, and bowed in adoration to the ſplendid hoſts that adorned them. Cyrus, who erected the Perſian on the ruins of the Babyloniſh Monarchy, knew nothing of the Almighty Being, who named him, an age before he had exiſtence, as the inſtrument of liberty to his captive people. Alexander, who in his turn ſubverted this extenſive empire, could only blend his Grecian idols with the Perſian—for dark, deplorably dark, was every corner of the habitable earth, except the inconſiderable land of Judea, where only a few deſpiſed, enfeebled tribes, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the light of ſacred knowledge.</p>
                     <p>What a ſpectacle for the Father of the Univerſe! who produced a world to know him and be happy! How much muſt his divine compaſſion be excited, on contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating his glorious work in ruins!—to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it was an effort worthy of himſelf.</p>
                     <p>We now come to the enlighted ages of Greece and Rome—a period when I fancy I ſee the human ſoul like a brilliant gem,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:022756_0085_0FBA5EDA28ABF8D8"/>
illuſtrious in the duſt. What noble ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles did then the human reaſon make to free itſelf from the incumbent load of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and error! Then lived thoſe numerous worthies, whoſe names are yet precious to poſterity. What greatneſs of ſoul—what a taſte for ſolid glory—what elevated ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents did they not diſcover? Yet theſe men, ſo far ſuperior to the reſt of their ſpecies, acknowledged a multiplicity of Deities, whoſe moral characters were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely inferior to their own, and to whom they ſcrupled not to aſcribe actions which themſelves would have bluſhed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Every paſſion of the human mind was perſonified, and deified; ſtatues gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced every corner of their ſtreets. Yet were there not wanting ſome among them who made bold advances in ſearch of better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation—like benighted travellers they followed the moſt diſtant gleam of light, yet all they could obtain was doubt and obſcurity.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="unknown:022756_0086_0FBA5EDC14FFAFC8"/>
were no longer compelled to enquire "Where is God our Maker?" They knew him, and were inſtructed in his divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The doctrines which the divine Meſſiah taught, eminently tended to reſtore human nature to the rectitude and happineſs it had loſt—they were calculated to harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the paſſions—regulate the affections, and exalt the ſoul to a ſenſe of her own dignity, by revealing, in the cleareſt terms, the immortality of her nature—a point which philoſophy had long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>A curſory view of the tenets of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity is ſufficient to evince, that they are deſigned to eſtabliſh the happineſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind even in the preſent life.

Thus they call themſelves Chriſtians without having any thing of the ſpirit of Chriſt.—And thus the human race is ſtill obnoxious to a thouſand miſeries, for want of applying to themſelves the remedy which alone could put an end to moral evil.</p>
                     <p>May you, my dear girls, be effectually convinced of the ineſtimable value of this divine diſpenſation, and think with Dr. Young, that

                  <p>I Undertake this little work, under the ſuppoſition, that thoſe for whoſe benefit I write it, have been well educated; if it ſhall fall into the hands of ſuch as are unbleſſed with this advantage, I will ſtill preſume to hope, the counſels it contains, may in ſome degree correct, if not totally eradicate, ſuch errors as are the fruits of early neglect. On the other hand thoſe to whom their parents, guardians, or diſtant relations, ſhall have acquitted themſelves of this firſt of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant duties, will find my precepts more eaſy to purſue. The ſubject has been ſo frequently and ſo ably treated. I am conſcious that with inferior talents, it carries an appearance of temerity in me, to attempt to point out ſomething new, in ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eaten a path of inſtruction. But it is my intention to treat of ſuch minute follies and blemiſhes, on the firſt entrance of young perſons into the great and critical world, as are the leſs avoidable, as their conſequences do not ſtrike at firſt ſight. There are, among theſe miſtakes, (they do not all merit a ſharper epithet) ſome ſo blended with engaging quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that they too often attract and dazzle the eyes of innocence, ſo as to excite a deſire of imitation; and thus, by their pleaſing, but falſe colours, inſenſibly prove dangerous and fatal examples. Theſe maxims have been written at different periods, and were originally deſtined for the peruſal of a few, either relations, or acquaintances, on whoſe indulgence I preſumed to dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>HABITUATE yourſelf to that way of life, moſt agreeable to the perſon, to whom you are united; be content in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, or with ſociety, with the town, or the country.</p>
                  <p>If he ſhould prefer the country during your earlier years, a period when diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are moſt attractive, it may at firſt be painful: you may be ſenſible of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but your chance for durable hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is infinitely greater there, than where each ſide is ſurrounded with continual dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to domeſtic tranquillity.</p>
                  <p>Make choice of ſuch amuſements, as will attach him to your company; ſtudy ſuch occupations, as will render you of conſequence to him—ſuch as the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his fortune, and the conduct of his houſe; yet, without aſſuming a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority unbecoming your ſex.</p>
                  <p>If his turn of mind leads him to the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:022756_0092_0FBA5EE6AFC6B298"/>
inſpection and care of his eſtate, avoid to interfere with a branch of government, not properly your ſphere.</p>
                  <p>Should he be neglectful of his family intereſts, ſupply his place with redoubled attention.</p>
                  <p>If public employment demand frequent abſences from home, make his ſuppoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions there to be as much reſpected, as if he were preſent, by your own deference to them.</p>
                  <p>If the contagion of example gain too ſtrong an empire over him, if miſled by pleaſures, or hurried by paſſion, let not your impatience prevent his return to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Let an early examination of his temper, prepare you to bear with inequalities, to which all are more or leſs ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Do not attempt to deſtroy his innocent pleaſures, by pretexts of oeconomy; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench rather your own expenſes, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote them.</p>
                  <p>Should he ſometimes delight in trivial occupations, treat ſuch with complaiſance; as few, but the idle, have leiſure to be very ill-tempered.</p>
                  <p>Diſturb not the hours he may have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:022756_0093_0FBA5EF03AC67E58"/>
for amuſement, with the recital of domeſtic grievances.</p>
                  <p>Watch for, and profit of ſuch moments of his leiſure, as will allow him, without pain or chagrin, to redreſs them.</p>
                  <p>Let your attentions be ſo continued, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by no affectation, yet ſo eaſy, as may prove they flow from the heart.</p>

                  <p>Should you be ſo unfortunate as to be connected with a family, divided by diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or of various tempers, by ſtudying them early, you will diſtinguiſh ſuch among them, as merit cultivation, and are open to friendſhip—you will conſequently be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by the world, for want of ſucceſs,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:022756_0094_0FBA5EF34E1EEDE0"/>
with that part, to whom kindneſs would prove ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>During the education of men in ſchools, colleges, academies, friendſhips are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, perhaps too early ſometimes to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, but equally hard to diſſolve:—if in conſequence, you behold ſuch with pain, do not attempt to break them with precipitation.</p>
                  <p>When a perſon ſhall ſee his friends coolly received in his own houſe, he will natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeek occaſions to meet them abroad;—maintain therefore your intereſt with him, by a polite behaviour to thoſe he ſo prefers, though you may not.</p>
                  <p>From the moment you ſhall have formed an indiſſoluble engagement, avoid every path which leads to jealouſy; harbour not the dangerous gueſt with you; and, by every prudent caution, ſuffer it not to fix near you.</p>
                  <p>Unbounded demonſtrations of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though authorized by ſacred ties, are oft as productive of inconveniencies, as the moſt unwarrantable averſions.</p>
                  <p>Should you have too juſt cauſe for ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of a change of affection, and its diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to another object, let a ready and obliging indulgence attempt the work of
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:022756_0095_0FBA5EF69C1B7AF8"/>
reformation;—it promiſes better ſucceſs, than diſcontent and clamorous grief.</p>
                  <p>Jealouſly is oft ideal; it is capricious; its dictates inconſiderate; its ſuggeſtions fatal to mutual repoſe.</p>
                  <p>The allowed ſuperiority of the other ſex—the liberties of their education—de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand abundance of allowances from ours; if we aſpire at eſteem and influence.</p>
                  <p>It would be equally mean to diſſemble in a manner, that could increaſe the con-contempt of thoſe, who are the cruel cauſe of your ſufferings, by hurting your fortune, or by bereaving you of a friend.</p>
                  <p>If you diſcover, on the other ſide, a diſpoſition to this unhappy paſſion; treat the phantom as if it were a reality; try to remove the apparent cauſe, by every ſacrifice in your power, were it even to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ridiculous in the eyes of the world.</p>
                  <p>The moſt dangerous poſition for a young perſon to be thrown into, is for the world to be apprized of her harſh treatment; it expoſes her to every mode of ſeduction, that intereſted pity can deviſe; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires infinite virtue and fortitude, to guard her againſt its inſinuations.</p>
                  <p>The delicate, but firm counſels, of a friend, religion, and if poſſible, a ſpeedy

retreat for a while, are the ſafeſt remedies againſt the artful, but ſoothing attentions of real, or ſeeming admirers, at moments when the mind is irritated by reproach, or the ſeverities inflicted by unjuſt ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>If a rooted averſion ſhall appear to be directed to any one object, abandon the connection with decency and good breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in order that it may eſcape obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and, at the ſame time, exert all your endeavours, to eraſe that object from your own memory.</p>
