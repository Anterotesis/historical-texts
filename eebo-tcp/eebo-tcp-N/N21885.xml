            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>HAVING from early age been concerned in working mines, and smelting and refining ores in Europe, and also several years engaged in the same line in the United States, I wish to become useful in promoting the opening of mines in this country; being convinced from actual observation and experiment, that the United States contain many valuable mines of lead, copper, coal, &amp;c. which, on being properly worked, might perhaps be found equally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive to any in the world.</p>
            <p>And observing that American Gentlemen are in general but little acquainted with Mineralogy, for their information I propose giving a short Course of Practical Lectures on the most useful branches of Metallurgic Chemistry, on reasonable terms.</p>
            <p>TERMS for the whole Course, <hi>twenty dollars.</hi>—In London such a course would be twenty guineas.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen who subscribe to the whole of the Lectures, to have the privilege of consulting me <hi>free of expence,</hi> (postage excepted) on any matter relating to the mineral business, until the first of January, 1796. And in order to save them the trouble of making minutes, I now promise to have the lecture printed for their use. The lectures to commence as soon as ten Gentlemen have subscribed; and the time of the day, to be that which will best suit their own convenience.</p>

            <head>Syllabus on Mineralogy.</head>
            <p n="1">I. ON Minerals in general, and the nature of the soil in which they are always found in the greatest body.</p>
            <p n="2">II. On the use of Boring-rods in discovering mines; in particular, stone and coal. And to shew the folly of paying any attention to the impostors who run about the country with what they call <hi>divining</hi>-rods. In this lecture specimens of coal will be shown, and their various properties, as relates to their use in manufactories explained. Also some observations on the utility of turf as a fuel.</p>
            <p n="3">III. How to discover water, and to avoid rocks, in sinking wells; unless the whole country is one continued solid rock without any chasms; but if there are any, I will shew, by a certain and easy method, how to find them. With some useful observations on pump-making.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. On vitriolic waters; and how to explain the common error of the supposed transmutation of iron into copper, and how to try (by an easy method) any waters for copper, and how to precipitate the metal from the water; (an invaluable discovery) and to show how vitriols of iron and copper are obtained.</p>
            <p n="5">V. On lead, and its various ores.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. On gold and silver, and their ores.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. On copper, and its various ores.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. On tin, antimony, and lapis-caliminaris.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. On plumbago, molibdina, marles, &amp;c. with some useful directions for making mortar.</p>
            <p n="10">X. On iron; and steel and their various <hi>ores;</hi> and how to make cast-iron very hard or very soft; with some useful information respecting the hardening and tempering of steel.</p>
            <p>I engage to show how most of the above <hi>ores</hi> may be assayed in a common smith's fire, without crucible or flux of any sort; and in so simple a manner as not to require more than one hour to understand each process; an improvement of my own since I came to America.</p>
