            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AFTER the many eloquent orations, the many ſplendid eulogiums, which have ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attracted your attention, it is not without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme diffidence I now venture to appear before you; but I truſt your candor and generoſity will receive, with indulgence, the feeble efforts of one who never had before the honor to addreſs a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and mixed aſſembly.</p>
            <p>SCARCELY two months have elapſed ſince we received the melancholy and diſtreſſing tidings that <hi>our Waſhington</hi> was no more! that quitting its earthly manſion, his ſublime ſoul had fled to mingle with the ſpirits of Columbus and of Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:037547_0004_100ED267F551BFF0"/>GENIUS has already exerted her powers, and fancy has diſplayed her brighteſt colourings, in attempting to portray the character of him whoſe loſs we are now aſſembled to deplore. The venerable ſage and the youthful orator, have vied in extolling the virtues of this extraordinary man. But ſtill with tender anxiety, with filial ſolicitude, we liſten to and enquire after freſh teſtimonies of veneration and reſpect. Not content with the private effuſions of gratitude and affection, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority of our country, in honor to the memory of her deareſt ſon, has appointed this day, the anniverſary of his birth, to be obſerved as a day of mourning from one end of our empire to the other. Twice, my reſpected auditors, have you attended to hear from this place, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the language of piety and religion, the juſt praiſes of Waſhington; but if I may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to judge of the feelings which now poſſeſs you, you will think it no treſpaſs on your time if I ſhould recapitulate ſome of the moſt ſtriking and prominent periods in the hiſtory of this great man's life.</p>
            <p>THOSE who are converſant in the annals of our country will readily recollect the firſt glorious
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037547_0005_100ED29B21D93CC8"/>
inſtance that, in the dawn of manhood, marked our Waſhington as the firſt of men.—When ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to the military world, he reſcued from entire ruin the remnant of Braddock's defeated hoſt; 'twas then the Genius of America firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played her guardian care in protecting her future ſaviour from the ſecret ambuſcade and poiſoned arrow of Indian warfare. From this time, while he was maturing in years and acquiring that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience which expanded his opening mind, a revolution was preparing in the world that was to call forth all his powers. In the firſt liſt of American worthies we find enrolled the name of George Waſhington, from Virginia. 'Twas then, in the meridian of life, that his noble perſon, his ingenuous mind, his open and manly countenance, his firm and intrepid temper, pointed him to the diſcriminating wiſdom of his illuſtrious compeers; and with the univerſal conſent of the patriots of the day, they appointed him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the armies of his country.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>From hence to trace him would indeed require</l>
               <l>"An Angel's pencil, and a Seraph's fire!"</l>
            </lg>
            <p>With a modeſt diſtruſt of his talents, but with the firmeſt reliance on the juſtice of his cauſe, he
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037547_0006_100ED29CD411FC38"/>
entered foremoſt on the theatre of our revolution; not like ſome modern heroes confiding ſolely in human aid, but with an ardent and fervid zeal he implored the approbation and aſſiſtance of his GOD.</p>
            <p>AT Cambridge, in this Commonwealth, he commenced his conſpicuous career. Here he was called upon to paſs through the moſt difficult and trying ſcenes,—an army without diſcipline, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers without military ſkill, and no ſupplies but ſuch as were afforded by the precarious hand of uncertain fortune; but ſurrendering to no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, diſmayed by no appearances, he aſſumed the difficult duty, he reconciled the diſcordant minds of rival chiefs, he regulated the ſtrange fancies of unruly freemen, he brought them to act as one body, to unite in the capital blockade of Boſton; and thus drove the enemy from our ſtate.</p>
            <p>LET us now follow him to the next moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting and moſt diſtreſſing ſcene of all his life, to December 1776, when the gallant Howe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the veteran armies of Britain, arrayed in the ſplendor of military uniformity, fluſhed with the ſenſe of their ſuperior diſcipline, preſented the dreadful phalanx, while the poor followers of Waſhington trod with naked feet the frozen

                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>y—'twas then, my friends, our <hi>liberties</hi> lay gaſping—feeble minds were driven to deſpair—this was indeed "the time that tried men's ſouls;" every falſe and hollow friend then retreated from the ſcene—the ſunſhine patriot hid his head, while the portentous heavens ſhrouded their armory in black. Amidſt the jarring ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, amidſt the wreck of matter, in the cruſh of contending armies, Waſhington ſtood unmoved; his great ſoul felt no alarm—the eyes of the world were on him; in that perilous moment his mighty genius ſuggeſted, and he executed the maſterly feat that has forever eclipſed the victories of Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal and Caeſar. Moving in the rear of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, while they were pleaſing themſelves with the thought of ſoon ſwallowing up his little band, he captured 900 Heſſians, and filled with terror and diſmay his valiant and aſtoniſhed foe. Fain would I purſue this brave and illuſtrious man through the after viciſſitudes of an eight years war, recount all his glorious exploits, all his magnanimous ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles.—Fain would I drop a tear on the aſhes of the departed heroes who fell, while contending with him for the glorious prize.—Gladly would I condole with thoſe who will now renew the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of a father, a huſband, a ſon, a brother, who,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037547_0008_100ED2D72AEBDAA0"/>
fighting for their country, under the command of Waſhington, died nobly in the bed of honor; but I forbear. I will now come to that pleaſing and brilliant epoch when, at the head of triumphant armies, Victory placed his wide ſpreading ſtandard on the battlements of York town, when, with joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acclamations, we hailed him the conqueror of the great Cornwallis. Here the ſame magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mind is ſtill diſtinguiſhed—he is equally great in the hour of proſperity, as in that of adverſity—Not depreſſed with the difficulties of miſfortune, not dazzled with the brightneſs of ſucceſs, the weſtern gales wafted the intelligence abroad, and Great-Britain now learned that all attempts to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due America were idle and abſurd; that in Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington was a ſucceſsful Sir William Wallace; and that the ſpirit of her immortal anceſtors animated her ſons. Peace enſued, and the eagle of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, on the wings of independence, ſoared unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted to the ſkies; but the <hi>love of our country</hi> cooled. There was on foot a numerous army, whoſe long and ſevere ſervices called aloud for reſtitution; whoſe officers felt and expreſſed the feelings natural to men. They had toiled—they had waſted the prime of life—they had given eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to others, and they were without reward;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037547_0009_100ED3DFA5A275E0"/>
combining in a moment of unreflecting diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they determined never to lay down their arms till their claims were ſatisfied; but that could not be—Waſhington appeared among them—that rhetoric which had ſo often been employed to raiſe their drooping hopes—that countenance that had ſo often animated them in the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, again prevailed, and they ſolemnly pledged themſelves rather to relinquiſh their pay, than tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their dear earned honors.</p>
            <p>TAKING now an affectionate and long fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of his brave companions in arms, he moved on to the place where Congreſs were then holding their ſeſſion, not clad in the helmet of ſuſpicion, no impenetrable lining to his waiſtcoat, but cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the majeſty of conſcious virtue, and erect with patriotic pride, he entered the auguſt aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: no ſullen grenadier trod in his footſteps; no ruſſian with a dagger leaped forward to cut ſhort his thread of life; no cries of outlawry aſſailed his ears; but while ſilence reigned through the hall—while every heart beat high with hope—while every boſom ſwelled with gratitude and love, and the rolling tear betrayed the amiable weakneſs of humanity, Waſhington repoſed on the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037547_0010_100ED3E16C1B9870"/>
altars of his country that commiſſion which had enabled him to give liberty and empire to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca! What a ſpectacle for the admiring world! What a leſſon for conquerors! What an example for future heroes! That tongue which, on the pardon of Marcellus, ſhook the Roman ſenate with the praiſes of Caeſar, muſt here have been ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; the feelings of that moment were too big for utterance, tears only could ſpeak the gratitude and admiration of his country. Well might the orator exclaim,
<q>No flow of genius, no force of eloquence, no power of deſcription is ſufficient, I will not ſay, O Waſhington, to embelliſh, but even to recount your deeds; yet this I affirm, and this with deference inſiſt upon, that from none of them will you reap greater glory than from that of this day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>FROM this momentous criſis the philoſopher and the hiſtorian will go with him to the ſhades of private life, to his beloved retreat, the elegant abode of Mount Vernon; there contemplate him engaged in the moſt benevolent purpoſes, encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the arts and ſciences, promoting every uſeful improvement, and ſanctioning by his name and ſignature, every exertion to advance the honor
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037547_0011_100ED93A361B41E0"/>
and reputation of his country. He was truly the patron of American merit. But what was now the ſituation of America?—a government without energy, reduced to the humble ſtate of ſeeking ſupport by the futile means of requiſition; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of public virtue, diſorder and confuſion in many of the ſtates, and a rebellion in Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, ſpoke an empire falling to decay. All conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate men ſaw and lamented the exiſtence of ſo feeble an edifice. But thanks be to GOD, there was virtue yet enough: a ſtrong confederation under a general government was propoſed, was planned and adopted, and the conſtitution of the United States, that ſtupendous fabric, whoſe adamantine pillars will, I hope, reſiſt the mouldering hand of time, publiſhed to America, ſubſcribed by Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, proclaimed us ſaved.</p>
            <p>AND now once more, the voice of his country, ever heard with veneration and love, called Waſhington from retirement, a retirement which he had choſen with the fondeſt predilection as the aſylum of his declining years. The united and unanimous ſuffrages of his fellow-citizens, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him Preſident of the United States. How he conducted in this high and arduous ſtation is
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037547_0012_100ED93BF9945370"/>
well known to you all; domeſtic faction and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal diſcord were huſhed by his healing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. The ſupple politicians, the artful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing miniſter of a foreign nation, ſtood abaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before his penetrating eye. All their ſchemes to introduce among us the diſorganizing princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of France were baffled—all their plans were mildewed by his vigilance and virtue. As he had ſhone firſt in the ranks of war, he now ſhone firſt in the mild reign of peace. Having complet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nearly eight years of virtuous adminiſtration, ſeeing his beloved country greatly advanced in happineſs and proſperity, and feeling the hand of time, he ſummoned us to attend his ſolemn decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. What we felt at that moment may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be conceived, but can never be deſcribed. To attempt to abridge that excellent performance would be indeed preſumptuous. To ſelect a plant, to cull a flower, would deſtroy the ſymmetry of ſo beautifully decorated a parterre; but let it be read and repeated by the old and young, and let the liſping infant learn it with his prayers. Again Waſhington withdrew with the pleaſing expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he ſhould now realize, without alloy, the ſweet enjoyment of partaking, in the midſt of his fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037547_0013_100ED93D9FD1A140"/>
laws under a free government; but this pleaſing hope ſoon vaniſhed—the ſtorm gathered thick, and clouds and darkneſs once more hung around us. Our commerce, the life, the ſoul, the vital ſpring of greatneſs, could not be purſued with its neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary freedom. French cruiſers covered the ocean; and the acquieſcence of the French government, in their hoſtile attacks, was a ſilent acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it countenanced their unjuſt proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Our indignation at theſe unmerited inſults was not ſo great or ſo prompt, as they provoked; but it at length burſt forth, and a determined re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to any further hoſtilities was the order of the day. Our ſhips of war appeared as it were by enchantment on the ocean; and our gallant ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſoon told the enemies of their trade that they feared them not. It was alſo thought neceſſary that an army ſhould be organized and prepared to meet occurrences as they roſe. Every eye was turned to the man now to be appointed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that army. We heard the Genius of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica whiſpering the name of Waſhington—that his ſword, tho' ſheathed, ruſted not—that his ſpirit, indignant at the inſults offered to his country, glowed with its ancient ardor. The wiſdom of our Preſident ſelected him, and the approving voice of the Senate confirmed the choice; and ſoon the important communication was made to the Senate, to America, and to the World, that Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, after reviewing the conduct of France and the inſidious plans of her government, and reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that every thing we held dear and ſacred was ſeriouſly threatened, had finally determined to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the commiſſion of Commander in Chief of the

Armies of the United States. Every fear then vaniſhed, every arm was nerved, and we juſtly counted on ſucceſs. But whither, my friends, does this bring us? alas! approaching to that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſcene—to that awful period—to that never to be forgotten day, the 14th <hi>December,</hi> 1799, when the Sun of America, that had ariſen fair and clear, that advanced to and long ſhone in meridian ſplendor, that ſinking had illumined the weſtern world, ſet in glory—when Waſhington, parting forever from his country, aſcended to his GOD. While the deepeſt mourning covered the face of the earth there was joy in heaven, and angels, trumpet-tongued, ſounded their loudeſt hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs. Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord.</p>
            <p>THUS, my friends, I have made a weak at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to touch ſome of the outlines in the hiſtory and character of a man who, while living, was the greateſt ornament to the world, and who will ever be the theme of the virtuous and the good to the lateſt generations. To ſtrive to imitate his bright example, and even to bear in mind his conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate precepts, is the firſt duty of an American.</p>
            <p>I CANNOT take leave without congratulating you on the proſpect you have from the abilities of his great ſucceſſor—the pure integrity, the exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worth, the incorruptible patriotiſm of JOHN ADAMS—Oh! happy America! may thy guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian Angel hover round him, preſerve his invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life, and long, long continue him—PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</p>
