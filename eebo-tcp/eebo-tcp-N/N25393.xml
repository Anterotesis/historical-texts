            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>SO THIS DANIEL PROSPERED IN THE REIGN OF DARIUS, AND IN THE REIGN OF CYRUS THE PERSIAN.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE proſperity of this noble ruler, clearly appears from the whole hiſtory of his life. Though, in his youth, he was carried away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive from Judea to Babylon; yet that dark and diſtreſſing ſcene ſoon opened the way to a brighter proſpect. His high deſcent, his graceful appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and his ſhining talents, ſecured the royal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, and the peculiar privilege of a public educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Having finiſhed his academical courſe, he was preſented, in uſual form, before the reigning monarch; who, ſtrictly inquiring into his profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in learning, found him not only ſuperior to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033675_0005_0FF7C88856857508"/>
all his companions, but ten times better than all the magicians and aſtrologers in all his realm. Pleaſed with this promiſing youth, he took him into his own preſence, and employed him in his own ſervice. This was only a ſhort and eaſy ſtep to higher preferment. Being called to tell, and to interpret the king's dream, which no other man was able to do, he was immediately advanced above all the governors in the province of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. Though he had now ſcarcely reached the years of manhood, yet he faithfully and honorably diſcharged the duties of his office, during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, during the reign of Evil-Merodach, and until the cloſe of the reign of Belſhazzar. At that portentous period, he was ſent for, to read, and to explain the hand-writing on the wall, which contained the awful doom of that vile and impious, prince; for which he was raiſed to higher dignity, and made the third ruler in the kingdom. The following night, Babylon was taken, Belſhazzar was ſlain, and all his domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions thrown into the hands of Darius the Mede, by the victorious arms of Cyrus the Perſian. Upon this large acceſſion to his empire, Darius found it neceſſary to make a new arrangement in the departments of ſtate. And in this new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, he took particular notice of the cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebrated Daniel, and placed him at the head of an hundred and twenty princes. Here, in ſpite of all his enemies, he continued to proſper, until Cyrus took the full poſſeſſion of the Perſian monarchy. That auſpicious event gave him a free and eaſy acceſs to Cyrus, and a happy opportunity of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a juſt and honorable influence over that great and amiable prince. In a word, it was the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar lot of Daniel to enjoy the favor and confidence
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033675_0006_0FF7C88B25A74C28"/>
of four of the greateſt monarchs of the Eaſt; and to ſuſtain, with dignity and ſucceſs, ſome of the higheſt offices of ſtate, for more than ſixty years, in a conſtant, uninterrupted ſucceſſion. Such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other inſtance of long and increaſing proſperity, in public life, we preſume to ſay, cannot be found in the whole hiſtory of man.</p>
            <p>Succeſsful men have always been revered as well as admired. The Greeks and Romans held thoſe in high eſtimation, who appeared to enjoy the peculiar ſmiles of the inviſible powers. The ſame ſentiment univerſally prevails in the minds of men. They ſpontaneouſly conclude, that thoſe poſſeſs ſome extraordinary excellence, who are uncommonly ſucceſsful in any important ſtation of life. And if the Supreme Being governs the natural and moral world, according to a previous connexion between cauſes and effects; there ſeems to be a juſt foundation to ſuppoſe, that peculiar proſperity is a mark of peculiar merit. Under the impreſſion of this ſentiment, it is very natural to inquire what extraordinary qualities Daniel poſſeſſed, which mutually conſpired to promote his proſperity, in the management of public affairs. Here it may be proper to obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this excellent and proſperous ruler poſſeſſed ſuperior powers of mind. The Father of Spirits has been pleaſed to diſplay the ſame ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty in the beſtowment of intellectual facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as in the beſtowment of inferior favors. To ſome he has given ten talents; to ſome five; and to ſome fewer. The minds of different men are differently conſtructed. In one man, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory is the ſuperior power; in another, the imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination is the moſt brilliant talent; in a third, a clear and penetrating judgment is the moſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033675_0007_0FF783B152BDC290"/>
prominent faculty; but in Daniel, all theſe nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural powers were equally ſtrong and well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. His quick apprehenſion and retentive memory were happily united with a ſtrong and penetrating judgment, which formed him a great and noble genius. This appears from the account which we have of his mental improvements. He acquired knowledge with the greateſt eaſe and rapidity; which diſcovered a ſprightly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive mind. And he was able to excel in every branch of ſcience, to which he turned his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which equally diſplayed the ſtrength and ſymmetry of all his intellectual powers. Theſe, perhaps, ſome may chooſe to aſcribe to the plaſtic power of education: but taking education in the moſt extenſive latitude, in which Helvetius, or any other author uſes the term, it will not account for every mental diſtinction. It is readily admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that all the objects with which a man is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded, and all the connexions and circumſtances in which he is placed, will either ſtrengthen, or weaken his original powers. But to aſcribe theſe powers to any thing <hi>exterior</hi> to the mind itſelf, is no leſs abſurd, than to aſcribe the <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive</hi> power of the magnet to the needle, which only ſerves to <hi>diſcover</hi> that peculiar property. Daniel, like every other man in the morning of life, was unacquainted with the native ſtrength of his own mind; but by repeated mental exertions, in the courſe of his education, he <hi>diſcovered</hi> thoſe ſuperior talents, which qualified him to manage the affairs of government, with great reputation and ſucceſs. A party ſpirit, or the favor of friends, or a peculiar concurrence of circumſtances, may chance to raiſe a man to a public ſtation; but if his natural abilities are unequal to his office,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033675_0008_0FF7C86C02E58038"/>
he will moſt certainly fall, to riſe no more. But Daniel began to riſe, by the dint of merit, and, therefore, he continued to riſe from office to office, until he reached the next ſtep to imperial power. Like Julius Ceſar, he was born to govern, whether he lived in Judea, in Babylon, in Perſia, or in any other quarter of the globe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> Daniel poſſeſſed a large ſhare of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral information, which contributed to form him a great and ſucceſsful politician. Civil government is extremely complicated and extenſive, both in theory and in practice. It embraces all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in this world, and all the intereſts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of men, in this life. No ſpecies of human knowledge is foreign to the buſineſs of a ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who needs to be univerſally acquainted with men and things. This idea was early and deeply impreſſed on the mind of Daniel. He was born a prince, and received a princely education. Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence directed his firſt and ſupreme view to the affairs of ſtate. To be an able and ſucceſsful poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, was the ſingle object, which engroſſed his whole attention, and which guided all his exertions. And no perſon, perhaps, ever enjoyed more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple means and opportunities of attaining this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. His great capacity; his refined taſte; his ſtudious habit; his early acquaintance with the ſolid branches of learning; and more eſpecially his <hi>peculiar ſituation,</hi> prepared him to acquire the largeſt ſtock of general knowledge.</p>
            <p>Babylon ſtood on the plains of Shinar, which was the moſt venerable and moſt enlightened ſpot on the face of the earth. There the reſidue of men firſt ſettled after the flood; and there they continued and increaſed, until their abſurd and impious attempt to build the tower of Babel, proved the occaſion
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033675_0009_0FF7C88CB707A198"/>
of a general diſperſion. Though this gave a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſhock to human affairs, and naturally check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the progreſs of knowledge; yet the ſeeds of ſcience were happily preſerved by the children of Ham, who ſtill remained on the plains of Babylon. That city, therefore, was the fountain-head of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. There all the knowledge of both the old and of the new world concentred. There the arts and ſciences were firſt cultivated. And there a literary ſociety was firſt formed. The Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who compoſed that ſociety, devoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to the improvements of the mind, and made it their whole buſineſs to acquire and diſſeminate every ſpecies of rare and uſeful knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge. And for this purpoſe, we may preſume, they not only made deep reſearches into the works of nature, but alſo collected from every quarter, the moſt ancient and moſt valuable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries on every important ſubject. In ſuch a circle of learned men, and in poſſeſſion of ſo many means of information, ſuch a man as Daniel, who had a peculiar capacity and taſte for learning, muſt have amaſſed as large a ſtock of human literature, as could be derived from all the labors and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches of antiquity.</p>
            <p>But I muſt further obſerve, that Daniel had the beſt ſources of information in his own hands; I mean the ſacred books of divine Inſpiration. Theſe acquainted him with the creation and fall of man, and the univerſal corruption of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Theſe exhibited the Church of God, as the great object, to which all human governments ought to be ſubſervient. Theſe placed before him a form of government, which was abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Theſe preſented him with the lives and characters of the greateſt and beſt ſtateſmen, for
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033675_0010_0FF7C88EFA44CB38"/>
his conſtant imitation and encouragement. Theſe reminded him of the awful fate of wicked nations and of wicked rulers. And theſe inculcated upon his own conſcience his ſolemn obligations to live and act, like a dying and accountable creature. By reading and devoutly ſtudying theſe ſacred volumes, he obtained the beſt political as well as religious knowledge. Such a variety of books, however, would have been more injurious than beneficial to him, had he read without reflection, or thought without deciſion. But his ſtrong, capacious, diſcerning mind could net be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded with learning. Like Pericles, he was able "to turn and wind every thing to his own purpoſe," and to apply every ſpecies of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge to a political uſe. The ſtate phyſician needs an immenſe fund of political information, in order to preſcribe on all occaſions, a proper remedy for every political diſorder. Such a ſource of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal information Daniel poſſeſſed. He carried in his mind the hiſtory of the world, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of ages. This enabled him to act with propriety, in every ſituation, and always to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in all his public meaſures. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Daniel's extraordinary wiſdom was no leſs beneficial, than his great information. Neb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uchadnezzar pronounced him, even in his youth, to be ten times better "in all matters of wiſdom," than all the wiſe men in Babylon. And before he was thirty, his eminent wiſdom was univerſally known and celebrated, not only through the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,. but through all the neighboring nations.</p>
            <p>The haughty king of Tyrus had heard of the fame of his wiſdom, otherwiſe he could not have felt the force of that ſevere reproof of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired prophet: "Thou art wiſer than. Daniel."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:033675_0011_0FF7C86DB6182118"/>Wiſdom is a term of various and extenſive meaning. It includes not only invention, but foreſight and ſagacity. Wiſdom certainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the power of invention. It enables a man to take a clear and comprehenſive view of things; and, under that view, to form the nobleſt deſigns, and to adopt the beſt means to accompliſh the beſt purpoſes. But after a man has deviſed a great and complicated ſcheme, and made choice of the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er meaſures to carry it into execution, there is ſtill occaſion for what is commonly called fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight. This is that part of wiſdom, which looks forward to, and provides againſt, unforeſeen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies, which may poſſibly defeat a great and good deſign.

            <p>A large meaſure of wiſdom, in all its branches, is indiſpenſably neceſſary to form a great and good politician. Civil rulers are obliged, by the nature of their office, to be intimately concerned with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſcription of men. And unleſs they are "as wiſe as ſerpents and as harmleſs as doves," they are in the utmoſt danger of being betrayed into meaſures, which will be injurious :o themſelves as well as to the public. Rehoboam loſt the greateſt part of his kingdom, by hearkening to the evil advice of young and conceited counſellors. Polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical ſlorms and tempeſts often riſe, in which the ableſt ſtateſmen find occaſion to exert all their wiſdom, to diviſe the beſt meaſures, to prevent the political ſhip from foundering. Daniel fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently employed his wiſdom to great advantage. By his wiſe and prudent conduct, he ſecured the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033675_0012_0FF7C86F62BE4598"/>
favor and aſſiſtance of Cyrus, in reſtoring the Jews to their native land. By his great ſagacity, he obtained the liberty of living according to the laws of his own religion. When he preferred his requeſt to the ſuperintendant of the captives, he replied, that he could not grant it, without endangering his head to the king. But Daniel was ſo perfectly acquainted with every avenue to the human heart, that he brought his benefactor to a cheerful compliance, even at the riſk of his life. So, when the king had ſigned a raſh and cruel decree, to deſtroy all the wiſe men of Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ylon, he had the "wiſdom and counſel" to ſtop the executioner in the diſcharge of his office, to appeaſe the wrath of the king, and to preſerve the lives of many of his moſt valuable ſubjects. By virtue of ſuch extraordinary wiſdom, he was able to promote his own and the public good; and to ſucceed in the adminiſtration of the moſt deſpotic government, that ever exiſted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Daniel was a man of invincible firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This was but the natural effect of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. He was able to think for himſelf; to form his own opinions; and to comprehend the nature and tendency of his own deſigns. Having, therefore, once deliberately and wiſely concerted a meaſure, he expected to ſucceed, and eventually to gain the approbation of the public. This well-founded confidence inſpired him, with irreſiſtible vigor and fortitude, in the proſecution of all his public meaſures. If he met with difficulty, or oppoſition, he ſteadily purſued his object, and appealed to the <hi>end,</hi> to juſtify the <hi>propriety</hi> of the <hi>means.</hi> He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated Melzar to <hi>try</hi> his propoſed expedient, and promiſed to renounce it, if it did not eventually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a wiſe and valuable purpoſe. So, he beſought
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033675_0013_0FF7C8912E1B2578"/>
the king to ſuſpend the execution of his haſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, only upon the condition, that his dream ſhould be interpreted, and his wiſhes completely gratified. Being ever fully perſuaded of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and rectitude of his public conduct, he was always willing to ſuffer the oppoſition and clamor of the multitude, until <hi>his</hi> wiſdom and rectitude ſhould have a fair opportunity to triumph over all <hi>their</hi> prejudice and folly. Such a firmneſs of mind is the reverſe of a vain and fooliſh obſtinacy, which conſiſts in a wilful oppoſition to the dictates of wiſdom. This was the fault of Pharaoh, who ruined himſelf and his kingdom, by rejecting the advice of Moſes. This was the fault of Saul, who diſobeyed the voice of Samuel, and forfeited his title to the throne of Iſrael. And this was the fault of Ahab, who deſpiſed the admonition of the prophet, and died as a fool dieth, at Ramoth-Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ead. But Moſes, Joſhua, and Caleb, diſplayed a wiſe and noble firmneſs, in conducting the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael to the land of promiſe, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their unreaſonable oppoſition and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. If we conſult the hiſtory of rulers, we ſhall find firmneſs of mind to be one of the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing features of every great and proſperous ſtateſman. And how often did God enjoin it upon the rulers of Iſrael, "to be ſtrong and of a good courage," in the diſcharge of their difficult and dangerous duties? There is no one thing, perhaps, more conducive to ſucceſs in any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and difficult undertaking, than a firm, ſteady, unremitting ſpirit. And we have abundant reaſon to conclude, that this noble ſpirit had a large ſhare of influence, in promoting the ſucceſs and proſperity of Daniel, in ſome of the moſt crit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical mid hazardous ſituations of his public life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:033675_0014_0FF7C892B745BFF0"/>
               <hi>Fifthly.</hi> This ſame Daniel, who proſpered ſo much under the moſt arbitrary princes, was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect pattern of inviolable integrity. But this is meant, that he always aimed to do juſtice, and to treat every man according to the eternal rule of right. As a ruler, he acted upon principle, in guarding the lives, the properties, and the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters of his ſubjects. Of this, we have incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable evidence, even the united teſtimony of his moſt malicious enemies. "Then the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and princes ſought to find occaſion againſt Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occaſion nor fault; foraſmuch as he was <hi>faithful</hi>" It is very remarkable, that the moſt critical and malignant eyes could diſcover no blemiſh in the integrity of Daniel, through the whole courſe of his public conduct. But we are to remember, that he had derived his moral ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the pure ſource of divine Inſpiration. He had read, with ſerious attention, the ſolemn charge, which Moſes delivered to the judges of Iſrael. "Hear the cauſes between every man and his brother, and the ſtranger that is with him. Ye ſhall not reſpect perſons in judgment, but ye ſhall hear the ſmall as well as the great: ye ſhall not be afraid of the face of man; the judgment is God's." He had felt the force of that divine admonition to every civil officer in every civil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment: "That which is <hi>altogether juſt</hi> ſhalt thou follow." But, perhaps, no text in the Bible had a more ſteady, powerful, and practical influence upon his mind, than the laſt words which God put into the mouth of a dying ſtateſman. "The God of Iſrael ſaid, the rock of Iſrael ſpoke to me, <hi>He that ruleth over men muſt be juſt.</hi>"</p>
            <p>The promotion of <hi>juſtice</hi> is the ultimate object of every branch of civil government. This is
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033675_0015_0FF7C89512CB95A0"/>
clearly and forcibly expreſſed, by an eminent Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh writer. "We are," ſays he, "to look upon all the vaſt apparatus of our government, as having ultimately no other object or purpoſe but <hi>the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of juſtice,</hi> or in other words, the ſupport of the twelve judges. Kings and parliaments, fleets and armies, officers of the court and revenue, ambaſſadors, miniſters, and privy-counſellors, are all ſubordinate in their end to <hi>this part</hi> of adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration." If the ſupport of juſtice be the ultimate deſign of all civil governments, then the exerciſe of juſtice muſt be the indiſpenſable duty of all civil rulers. They are appointed, not ſo much to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,</hi> as to <hi>defend</hi> the public intereſt. Though they have the power of enacting laws; yet they have no right to diſſolve the ſolemn obligation of mutual contracts, nor to require any man to do a ſingle act, which is repugnant to that immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble juſtice, which is founded in the nature of things. And though they do, in a ſenſe, hold the purſe-ſtrings of the people; yet they have no right to diſpoſe of the public property for any other purpoſe, than the promotion of public juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. If they grant donations to particular corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, or to particular perſons, they ought to do it, not for the ſake of thoſe particular corporations, or particular perſons, but ſimply to promote the public good. Indeed, their whole public conduct ought to be regulated, by the infallible ſtandard of immutable juſtice. It is required of all ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, whether ſacred or civil, that a man be found faithful. Fidelity in civil rulers is, of all other virtues, the moſt acceptable to the people, who univerſally feel its happy influence, in every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life. Hence mankind have always mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted an uncommon attachment to, and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033675_0016_0FF7C872B62340C0"/>
for, thoſe eminent rulers who have given uniform and unequivocal proofs of their moral rectitude. Ariſtides among the Greeks, Cato among the Romans, and Daniel among the Jews, will be forever celebrated for their incorruptible integrity. This is that ſterling excellence in a ſtateſman, which needs no inſcription, nor crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned head, to give it a univerſal currency among all nations of the earth. It was this rare, ſhining, captivating virtue of integrity, that recommended Daniel to Jews and Babylonians; to Medes and Perſians; to Darius and Cyrus; and to every other prince, who employed him in public af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> The proſperity of Daniel, amidſt all the burdens and dangers of public life, muſt be principally aſcribed to his eminent piety and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Like other men, who ſtood upon the pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of power, he was continually expoſed to the ſevereſt ſtrokes of adverſity. He came into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration in troublous times; and had a clear prophetic view of the dreadful convulſions, which were juſt ready to ſeize an expiring empire. And whilſt he ſat in the king's gate, he was a ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of many of thoſe awful ſcenes, which were a fulfilment of his own predictions. He ſaw the haughty king of Babylon ſhook from his throne, driven from men, and degraded below the beaſts that periſh. He attended monarch after monarch to the ſilent manſions of the dead; and felt thoſe heavy ſhocks, which falling princes never fail to give. And he was perſonally involved in the horrors of that memorable night, which ſunk a mighty empire in perpetual ruin. But none of theſe things moved him, becauſe his heart was fixed, truſting in the Lord. Thoſe national convulſions
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033675_0017_0FF783B40D85D290"/>
and revolutions, which proved ſo fatal to others, all conſpired to promote <hi>his</hi> perſonal proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and ſucceſs. He ſecured the favor and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Heaven, by his ſincere and exemplary piety. He carried conviction to all around him, that he poſſeſſed a truly "divine and excellent ſpirit." His religion was neither a glowing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, nor a gloomy ſuperſtition; but a pure and ſteady principle of univerſal benevolence. He gave God the ſupreme affection of his heart; and was neither afraid nor aſhamed to proſeſs the true religion, in the midſt of a country and a court, that were involved in the groſſeſt idolatry. He extended his benevolent regards to all the children of men, whether Jews, or Gentiles. He zealouſly promoted the cauſe of religion; and ſpent days and weeks, in humble, ſervent, effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual prayers for the proſperity of Zion. He walked within his houſe with a perfect heart, and every day called upon God, at the head of his family. This he did; not becauſe it was a common and rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utable practice; but becauſe it was a plain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant duty, which he owed to God, and to thoſe whom God had committed to his care and inſtruction. His family devotion was known to his enemies as well as to his friends; and becauſe there was nothing elſe to take hold of, his enemies took hold of this, as the only poſſible engine to work his ruin. Accordingly, they conſpired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and obtained a royal decree, that "if any perſon ſhould aſk a petition of any God or man for thirty days, except of the king, he ſhould be caſt into the den of lions." As ſoon as he knew the writing was ſigned, he went to his houſe, opened his windows, fell upon his knees, and three times a day prayed and gave thanks to God. This
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033675_0018_0FF7C8986A86E6E0"/>
threw him into the hands of his enemies, and out of the protection of his prince, who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to expoſe him to the furious beaſts of prey. But his heroic faith and ſervent prayers ſtopped the mouths of lions, defeated the deſigns of his enemies, and ſmoothed the path of declining life with ſignal proſperity. For it is in immediate reference to this aſtoniſhing event, that it is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically ſaid in. the words of our text—"So this Daniel proſpered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Perſian."</p>
            <p>I have now delineated the moſt prominent fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of this great and amiable ſtateſman. His life is a bright aſſemblage of all the human virtues. And it is a juſt and beautiful remark, that "the <hi>collected</hi> virtues of one man, ſtrike the mind much more forcibly and advantageouſly, than the <hi>ſcattered</hi> vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of many." Permit me then to hold up the character of Daniel as a mirror, in which all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and eſpecialiy thoſe in places of power and truſt, may clearly and ſenſibly diſcover both what they <hi>are</hi> and what they <hi>ought</hi> to be.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing ſuggeſted by this excellent char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter is, that great and good rulers are worthy of the higheſt reſpect. Who can contemplate the pious, virtuous, and uſeful life of Daniel, without paying him the ſincere homage of the heart? Whilſt he was acting his noble part on the ſtage of life, the happy influence of his public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate virtues commanded univerſal admiration and eſtee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ond the bounds of duty, or even propriety. Nebuchadnezzar proſtrated himſelf at his feet, and payed him the exceſs of Eaſtern complaiſance. Darius gave him the ſtrongeſt marks of ſincere and ardent affection. Nor was he leſs eſteemed
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033675_0019_0FF7C8391FEBB120"/>
in the court of heaven. The ſupreme Ruler diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched an envoy extraordinary to aſſure him, "he was greatly beloved" by his Maker, and by all the principalities and powers above. This was no unmeaning compliment, but a divine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to his juſt deſert of univerſal love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. All civil rulers of the ſame character, are equally objects of the higheſt veneration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. They are miniſters of God for good to the people, and the principal inſtruments of all their temporal proſperity. Though the inventors of arts and ſciences, and the promoters of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and commerce, deſerve the public eſteem; yet wiſe and faithful rulers have a better claim to univerſal gratitude and reſpect. For it is ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately owing to their exertions, that mankind derive any real benefit from their labors, their ſtudies, or any of their natural advantages, A people may flouriſh in all the arts of Italy, or abound in all the wealth of the Indies; and yet drag out a poor, miſerable life, under the power and oppreſſion of a cruel and rapacious tyrant. But juſt men, ruling in the fear of God, give a people the full enjoyment of all the bleſſings of Providence. Thoſe rulers, therefore, who direct all their views to the public good, and exert all their power and influence to promote it, are great benefactors to the world, and deſerve to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally reſpected and revered. For this cauſe, therefore, God expreſsly commands every ſoul to be ſubject to the higher powers, not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake; rendering to all in authority their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due; cuſtom to whom cuſtom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.</p>
            <p>The pious and devout life of Daniel, in the next place, loudly admoniſhes civil rulers how
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033675_0020_0FF7C899F254DF58"/>
much they are capable of doing, to promote the <hi>religious</hi> as well as civil intereſts of the people. The children of Iſrael were extremely addicted to the worſhip of idols, from the time they made the golden calf, to the time of their captivity in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. But in that land of idols, the parent of idolatry, they were effectually and finally cured of their national ſin. This great and extraordinary reformation, we muſt conclude, was brought about by the inſtrumentality of Daniel. The captive tribes were ſtruck with his plous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary conduct, in the midſt of the worſhippers of idols. They ſaw him pay a ſtrict and ſacred regard to thoſe divine rites and ceremonies, which were deſigned to ſeparate <hi>them,</hi> from all the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous nations. They ſaw him daily and devoutly worſhip the true God, in his own family. They ſaw his faith and piety ſtop the lions' mouths. They heard, with deep conviction, proclamation after proclamation, publiſhed by the great mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs of Babylon, giving honor to the God of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iel, and pouring contempt upon every falſe and inferior deity. They were acquainted with his days of mourning, faſting, and prayer, for the revival of religion, and the proſperity of the Church. In a word, they ſaw the pureſt piety conſtantly diſplayed in the life of a man, who was ſeated in the king's gate, and univerſally loved and revered. And is it a thing incredible, that the pious example and influence of ſuch a great and renowned ruler ſhould awe the minds of a whole nation, and conſtrain them to caſt all their idols to the moles and to the bats forever? The living example of other religious rulers has had the ſame transforming influence upon the minds of their ſubjects. We read, "The people ſerved
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033675_0021_0FF7C83C935F0BA0"/>
the Lord all the days of Joſhua, and all the days of the Elders that outlived Joſhua."</p>
            <p>Among the pious kings of Judah, do we find one, who ever failed to bring about a viſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in piety and virtue? And is it not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, that pious rulers, by their perſonal exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and influence, have actually formed the moral and religious character of the people in this land? We know, that ſo long as all the governors, ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and repreſentatives of this Commonwealth, were public profeſſors and zealous promoters of religion, the ſabbaths were ſanctified; the houſes of God were filled; divine inſtitutions were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; family religion and parental authority were maintained; cards, and balls, and theatres were unknown, and all open vice and infidelity were treated with general and juſt contempt. Whether this was pure ſuperſtition, or pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it was certainly owing, in a great meaſure, to the example of civil rulers, who meant to form the people to virtue and piety. It is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that rulers ſhould form the character of the people, and not that the people ſhould form the character of rulers. It was never known, that the houſe of Iſrael reformed one of their looſe, ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious kings; but it was often known, that one pious, exemplary king reformed the whole nation. If <hi>Daniel</hi> had fallen into the corruptions of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, there is not the leaſt probability, that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could have prevented his ruin. But when <hi>they</hi> had forſaken the paths of virtue and piety, he was able, by his perſonal example and influence, to bring them back to the worſhip and ſervice of the God of their fathers. Civil rulers would find no occaſion of promoting religion, by their <hi>laws,</hi> if they would only heartily and unitedly promote it, by their <hi>lives.</hi> Let them only <hi>live religion,</hi> and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033675_0022_0FF7C89BBA1C4438"/>
they will do enough to diſcharge their duty; and I will venture to add, they will do enough to form this people to a virtuous and religious character. For if this effect ſhould not flow from the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their virtue and piety, it would be a ſingular inſtance, and ſuch an one as cannot be found in the hiſtory of any nation, from the beginning of the world to this day. If civil rulers carry the power of reformation in their own hands, then their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to reform the people, muſt be equal to that power. Let me, therefore, entreat the man of office, the man of honor, the man of influence, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to conſider, that "to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is ſin."</p>
            <p>It further appears from the character and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Daniel, that thoſe who ſit in the higheſt ſeats of government, have no excuſe to neglect the profeſſion and practice of vital piety. Real reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is neceſſary on their own account, as well as on account of thoſe, who live under the influence of their powerful example. It is hard to ſay, whether the moſt dignified characters deſerve our veneration, more than our tender compaſſion. They are certainly ſurrounded with peculiar temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to forget their Creator, and to neglect the one thing needful. But Daniel has told them by his example, that they are under a great deluſion, if they once imagine, their high ſtations and public employments, will afford them the leaſt excuſe for neglecting the duties of piety and devotion. They cannot ſeriouſly believe, that they have greater temptations to reſiſt, than Daniel reſiſted; nor greater difficulties and embarraſſments to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, than Daniel ſurmounted. He was born a prince, and ſpent his whole life in the preſence of princes. But whilſt he lived with the princes of Judah; whilſt he marched with the army of the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033675_0023_0FF7C87510DA54C0"/>
Chaldeans; and whilſt he reſided with the gay diſſolute youth, in Babylon, he remembered obeyed his Creator. When his office ſeated him in the king's gate, ſurrounded by profligate and infidel courtiers, he ſupported and adorned his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious profeſſion. When an hundred and twenty princes ſat at his feet, and the affairs of an hundred and twenty princes lay upon his hands, he found time and opportunity for the performance of every religious duty. And when propriety required him to ſubmit to the moſt public and pompous parade; to be clothed in the ſilks of Perſia, and adorned with the gold of Ophir; and to receive the incenſe of public honors; he could ſilently retire in the cloſe of the day, and humbly proſtrate himſelf, as a poor, guilty worm, before the ſupreme Majeſty of heaven and earth, and devoutly implore his mercy. He very well knew, that though ornaments and honors might dazzle the eyes of unthinking multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and conceal his imperfections from the view of men; yet they could by no means hide his heart, or conceal his criminal defects from the omniſcient eye of God, to whom he ſtood account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for all his internal feelings and external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;. If young politicians, if aged ſtateſmen, if the moſt dignified characters on earth, would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſurvey the pious and devout life of Daniel, they would be fully convinced, that neither the cares, nor honors, nor temptations of public life, can diſſolve their obligations to call upon God; to read his word; to reverence his ſanctuary; and to attend all his holy and ſacred inſtitutions. Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and devotion have been, and may be united. Rulers ove men have been, and may be, the moſt humble and faithful ſervants of God. "Be wiſe now therefore, O ye kings: be inſtructed, ye judges
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033675_0024_0FF7C876B9C68AE8"/>
of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice with trembling." Moreover,</p>
            <p>The faith and piety of Daniel reprove the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and preſumption of thoſe politicians, who profeſs and propagate the principles of infidelity. The infidels, in our Savior's day, were men of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior rank and figure. And it is well known, that infidelity has commonly been firſt imbibed and propagated, by profeſſed philoſophers and politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. Men of this exalted character have lately ſpread atheiſm and infidelity through a great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and attempted to diffuſe the poiſon of their irreligious and diſorganizing ſentiments among the people of America. Such champions of infidelity endeavor to ſhake our faith in natural and revealed religion, by carrying us back into the dark regions of antiquity. Hume, Voltaire, and Condorcet, repreſent mankind as being originally involved in ignorance and barbariſm. And they pretend to trace the progreſs of the human mind, in emerg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that primitive ſavage ſtate, and gradually riſing to a nobler ſtate of civilization, learning, and infidelity. But were <hi>they</hi> better acquainted with the dark regions of antiquity, and with the riſe and progreſs of human improvements, than the pious and learned Daniel? Did they ever live with him on the plains of Shinar? Did they ever ſearch the ſame records and traditions of antiquity, which he ſearched? Did they ever converſe with the Chaldeans, with whom he converſed? Were they ever perſonally acquainted, as he was, with the learned Amonians, who, as an incomparable wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has clearly proved,<note n="*" place="bottom">Bryant on Ancient Mythology.</note> ſpread every ſpecies of civil, political, and religious knowledge, through Egypt, through Greece, and through every part of the inhabited world? The moſt learned infidels

of the preſent age, who have ranſacked the bowels of the earth, and the dark corners of the globe, to pick up arguments againſt revealed religion, are but minute philoſophers, in compariſon with Daniel. Whilſt he ſtood on the plains of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, with the Bible in one hand, and all antiquity in the other, he ſaw, as clearly as the ſun at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>divinity</hi> of that holy religion, which came down from heaven, through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of divine Inſpiration. All his knowledge of the natural, moral, and political world, inſtead of weakening, confirmed his faith in the ſcriptures of truth. <hi>His</hi> ſtrong and cordial belief of divine rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elation, therefore, completely demonſtrates, what has often been juſtly aſſerted, that infidelity is not ſeated in the <hi>head,</hi> but in the <hi>heart</hi>; and flows not from profound knowledge, but from a meaner and more criminal cauſe. Is it not ſufficient to ſtrike any modern infidel entirely dumb, to aſk him this plain, pertinent, pointed queſtion, "Art thou wiſer than Daniel?"</p>
            <p>Another important reflection, naturally ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the conduct of this able ſtateſman, is, that civil rulers have no occaſion for the uſe of art or intrigue, in any of their public meaſures. Thoſe who conduct the intricate affairs of government ought to be wiſe and prudent; but yet they ſhould never be artful, or deſigning. There are, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, profeſſed politicians, who recommend this mode of conduct, by precept as well as example. They inſinuate, that no man can ſucceed in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical affairs without taking advantage of the weakneſs, folly, and caprice of human nature, and making uſe or meaſures, which are diametrically oppoſite to every idea of integrity. Some grave writers on moral and political philoſophy, plainly inculcate the firſt principles of injuſtice and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033675_0026_0FF7C89E56F8B8D8"/>
They lay it down as a maxim, that poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians may and ought to make <hi>utility,</hi> or what they conceive to be the general good the ſupreme rule of their conduct. But a great and good ruler will adopt and act upon a far more honeſt and noble principle; "Let <hi>juſtice</hi> be done, though the univerſe ſhould ſink." Daniel found wiſdom and integrity abundantly ſufficient to anſwer all his political purpoſes, without ever ſtooping to the low arts of intrigue. Theſe he was able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, and theſe he was able to defeat. In draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the characters of the king of the North and of the king of the South, he gave a lively and ſtriking picture of two profoundly artful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing politicians. "And both theſe kings' hearts ſhall be to do miſchief, and they ſhall ſpeak lies at one table; but it ſhall not proſper." Whilſt he preſided over an hundred and twenty princes, he clearly and ſenfibly perceived the nature and tendency of that diabolical policy, which they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to take away his life. But he oppoſed honeſty to diſhoneſly; juſtice to injuſtice; wiſdom to cunning; and open integrity to all their dark and deep deſigns. Nor did he fail of confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their counſels; and of turning their own artful and malicious devices to their own deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Truly wiſe and upright politicians will never find occaſion to employ any other weapon than perfect integrity, in order to defeat the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious purpoſes of their moſt ſubtile and malign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant enemies, whether at home or abroad. Be it ſo, that our preſent connexion with diſtant na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may expoſe us to the arts and intrigues of foreign courts; yet thoſe, who have the direction of our national concerns, may rely upon it, that a fair, open, upright conduct will be the beſt meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, to fruſtrate the art, the duplicity, and unjuſt
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:033675_0027_0FF7C87875107130"/>
policy of <hi>five,</hi> or of <hi>five hundred</hi> unprincipled poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians.</p>
            <p>This naturally leads me to obſerve, in the laſt place, that civil rulers have ſufficient <hi>encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to be faithful, in the diſcharge of all their public duties. Theſe, I ſfhall not go out of my province to preſcribe, nor even to ſuggeſt. If pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic men are but only faithful; there is no ground of anxiety about the wiſdom or propriety of their public meaſures. Faithfulneſs, however, cannot be too often nor too forcibly inculcated upon thoſe who have many opportunities, and of courſe many temptations to betray their truſts. But it is happy to reflect, that their <hi>encouragement</hi> to fidelity, is abundantly ſufficent to balance all their unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable circumſtances. The favor of God, and the eſteem of men, are the moſt animating motives to duty. Theſe had a commanding influence over the views and conduct of one of the moſt able and upright rulers. Daniel found by happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that honeſty was the beſt policy. For, his faithfulneſs to the Deity, ſecured <hi>his</hi> favor and aſſiſtance; and his fidelity to men, ſecured <hi>their</hi> ſincere and warm attachment to his perſon and intereſt. As he conſtantly perſevered and increaſed in integrity; ſo he conſtantly increaſed in wealth, in honor, and outward proſperity. Let who would fall, Daniel ſtood* Let who would ſink, Daniel roſe. Let who would be in power, Daniel was their favorite. Let who would combine againſt him, Daniel always ſucceeded and proſpered.</p>
            <p>Is not this example worthy of the notice and imitation of all who ſit in the ſeats of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And may I not, with great propriety, take occaſion from it, to preſs the duty of fidelity upon the Honorable Legiſlature of this Commonwealth, which holds the firſt rank in the United States,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033675_0028_0FF7C87ADA799E50"/>
for piety and virtue, as well as political im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance? This large and religious community, are devoutly wiſhing and praying for a faithful adminiſtration of government. They would ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the thought, that their rulers ſhould lift their hands to Heaven, and ſolemnly engage to adminiſter a government, which they meant to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine; and to protect a people, whom they meant to deſtroy. Their minds are alarmed at threatening dangers; and nothing can give them eaſe, but an unſhaken confidence in the fidelity of their rulers. They do not diſtruſt their abilities; but they may entertain ſome apprehenſions reſpecting their integrity, ſince their enemies boaſt of corrupting it. But if thoſe who direct our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs, would only diſplay the piety, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and firmneſs of Daniel, they would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly poſſeſs the entire affection and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this great and intelligent people. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſome of the firſt characters in this Legiſlature, have already merited and ſecured the eſteem and attachment of an enlightened part, and were it not invidious, I would add, of the moſt enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened part of this Commonwealth. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weakneſfs and prejudice of ſome, we eſteem it a favorable circumſtance, that his Excellency has heretofore filled a dignified ſtation; in which he had a peculiar opportunity of diſcovering his uprightneſs, and at the ſame time of forgetting the ſubtilties, and of imbibing the genuine ſpirit of the laws. This, and all the States in the Union, are much indebted to many eminent civilians, for the knowledge, the wiſdom, and the integrity, which they diſplayed, in framing the Federal Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which is not, and perhaps never will be, inferior to any one of mere human invention. This excellent conſtitution is the baſis of all our
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033675_0029_0FF783A478A2F278"/>
national ſafety and happineſs. And it is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficult to conceive, that a ſingle American, who is friendly to any good government, ſhould be unfriendly to his own; and wiſh to alienate the affections of the people from it. But it is very natural to conclude, that the framers of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and thoſe who were perſonally concerned in adopting it, ſhould cheriſh an uncommon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to it, and labor to ſupport it, with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed ardor and zeal. Upon this ground, the people have a juſt right to expect, that His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency will never mar the production of his own hands; nor renounce thoſe political principles, which he has publickly and ſolemnly ſanctioned, and which have had their proper influence in raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to the head of this Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, and the principal members of the Council, of the Senate, and of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gained the ſuffrages, but what is far more hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable and deſirable, the <hi>confidence</hi> of the people, who ſincerely eſteem them for their able and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervices.. May this operate as a powerful and endearing motive to future fidelity and zeal, in the diſcharge of their important truſts. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all the men of the Eaſt, was highly gratified and animated, by the ſincere affection of his grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dutiful ſubjects. "When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my ſeat in the ſtreet, the young men ſaw me, and hid themſelves; and the aged aroſe, and ſtood up. When the ear heard me, then it bleſſed me; and when the eye ſaw me, it gave witneſs to me: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I delivered the poor that cried, and the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and him that had none to help him. I put on righteouſneſs, and it clothed me: My judgment
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033675_0030_0FF7C8A4288BAB50"/>
was as a robe and diadem. I broke the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the ſpoil out of his teeth."</p>
            <p>Such, ſincerely reſpected rulers, are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoling reflections, which naturally flow from fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in public life. If, therefore, you have begun to be faithful in your various departments, be not weary in well-doing; but be ſtedfaſt, unmovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, always abounding in the ſervice of God, and of your generation. Cheriſh a warm attachment to the government, which you are called to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter, and do all the public good, which both the State and Federal Conſtitutions require and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able you to do. Guide this people in the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your hearts, and by the ſkilfulneſs of your hands. Exhibit before them a ſhining example of piety and virtue; and employ all your honor and influence to promote their <hi>ſpiritual</hi> as well as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good. This wife and faithful diſcharge of your public truſts, will finally put you into the full poſſeſſion of that tranſporting promiſe, which is emphatically yours—"They that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteouſneſs, as the ſtars for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever." But, if any of you ſhould be conſcious to yourſelves, that you have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, unjuſt, and unholy; let Daniel's counſel be acceptable to you, and break off your ſins by righteouſneſs, and your iniquities by ſhewing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the poor, that it may be a lengthening out of your tranquillity. For, it is moſt certainly true, that, if you caſt off fear, and reſtrain prayer before God, and deſpiſe all his warnings and admonitions, the day is coming, when that inviſible hand, which is now recording all your deeds, will write on the table of your hearts, in a language which will need no interpreter, this final and fearful ſentence: "You are weighed in the balances, and are found WANTING."</p>
