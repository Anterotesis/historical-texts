            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE COLONEL RECONNOITRED.</head>
            <p>AT length the Storm which was a-brewing is arrived; and I had Reaſon to expect it with Apprehenſion and Terrour, for a bitter Blaſt it is. Notwithſtanding the Deſire I expreſſed that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute between the Colonels and me might be confined within the Compaſs limited by the Merits of the Cauſe, I perceive my Soothings and Threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were equally vain, and the Controverſy between us muſt ſtill be not only political, but alſo logical, critical, perſonal, ſarcaſtical, and paraſitical. That I may keep up ſome Appearance of that Method which the Colonel's exuberant Genius diſdains to be cramped with, and blames me both for uſing and not uſing, I ſhall divide what I have to ſay into Sections, or Chapters.</p>

                  <p>The Colonel undertakes, what it ſeems he has performed already, to make it appear that the "Twopenny Act <hi>is calculated for a very general and good Purpoſe to the whole Community.</hi>" Should he not have excepted Landlords, Merchants, Parſons, Clerks, Sextons, poor People maintained by the Pariſh, white Servants, and black Slaves, or have baniſhed all theſe out of the Community before he entered upon ſuch an Undertaking? For what very general and good Purpoſe could it anſwer to the Landlord to have his Rents made liable to be diſpoſed of by any Body but himſelf; to the Merchant to be deprived of the Benefit of his advantageous Bargains, and obliged to ſtand to the Detriment of ſuch as turn out unfavourably; to the Parſon to be ſtripped of two Thirds of his Salary for one Year, and have the Whole rendered precarious for ever; to the reſt to be either damaged, or no Way benefited, by the Act? Whom then does the Colonel call the <hi>whole</hi> Community? No; the Act was profitable to Particulars; but it was a general Evil, by introducing or confirming deſpotick Notions, by erecting an arbitrary Power over private Property. Had it been more cautiouſly managed, and with leſs Injuſtice to Particulars, that would not have been ſufficient to excuſe the late Aſſembly for aſſuming a Power to diſpoſe <hi>ad libitum</hi> of private Property, not for the Sake of publick Uſes, but purely for the Sake of taking it out of ſome private Hands, and lodging it in others leſs obnoxious.</p>

                  <p>Having agreed that the Burthen of maintaining the Poor ought to lie upon the whole Pariſh, not that the Relief of Sufferers by Accidents ought to be raiſed by a voluntary Contribution, out of the publick Revenue, or by a general Tax, but leaving this Kind of Burthens to be ſuſtained by the Merchants and the Clergy, he ſays upon my firſt Remark it is not juſt that poor Slaves, white Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould come in for any Share of the Benefit by the Act, becauſe they are all excuſed from paying Tithes as it is called, becauſe the Act was calculated for the Relief of thoſe only who pay towards the Maintenance of the Miniſter; and if the Act had been made otherwiſe, it would have been a different Thing from what it is at preſent: It would have been extended beyond what I ſet down as its certain good Purpoſes. I agree with the Colonel that the Act was calculated, ſo far as
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009612_0005_0F76F60D7A3087B8"/>it relates to the Clergy, for the Relief only of thoſe who pay towards the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Miniſter; that is, unleſs the Poor are obliged by Law to pay more than the Rich, it was calculated for the Relief of the Rich abundantly more than for the Relief of the Poor, without any Reference to Gainers or Sufferers by Means of a ſhort Crop, and not at all for the Benefit of the Bulk of the Poor, compoſed of Slaves, white Servants, thoſe who are excuſed the Payment of Tithes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who I think we may be ſure are poor, notwithſtanding the Difficulties and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties ſometimes fallen into by the Colonel about the Meaning of the Word poor, and about who are poor and who are rich.</p>
                  <p>So far then the Colonel and I are agreed; and it is evident, I preſume, that he means nothing by the above Words <hi>it is not juſt,</hi> but that it does not come within the Scope and Intention of the Act to beſtow an Alms on thoſe who are undoubtedly poor, nay the pooreſt Part of the Community, becauſe he detects the Word poor to be a comparative Term. Inſtead of talking thus looſely, if the Colonel would have ſpoke to the Purpoſe, he ſhould have proved it juſt in an Act propoſed for the Eaſe of the Poor (or for no good Purpoſe at all) to exclude all the <hi>known</hi> Poor from the Benefit of it, to give as much Advantage to Gainers by Means of a ſhort Crop as to Sufferers, and to give the greateſt Advantages to the moſt rich and flouriſhing Perſons in the Colony, which is what I call Injuſtice; and however I may ſometimes call this Injuſtice the good Purpoſes of the Act I would not have him to be ſo cunning as to take my Word for the Goodneſs of the Act, concerning which I have over and over declared myſelf to entertain contrary Sentiments.</p>
                  <p>He ſays the annual Allowance of Tobacco for the Maintenance of the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> "is proportioned according to the governing Price of Tobacco in the Year in which each Levy is laid;" and therefore, he concludes, the Twopenny Act could not injure them. But he ought only to have concluded that therefore when the Price riſes between the Time of the Levy and the Time of Payment the Poor get a better Maintenance than ordinary, if no Twopenny Act interferes. Some of the Poor too are allowed Tobacco for maintaining other poor People; and ſurely theſe ought to be allowed the Benefit of their Contracts when the Market riſes, as well as be obliged to ſtand to the Loſs when it falls. If he would not have the Poor at any Time to get more than a bare Maintenance, then a certain
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009612_0006_0F76F60E31E018D0"/>Sum of Money ſhould be appointed for them, and Tobacco levied to raiſe that Money, the Surpluſage of Tobacco remaining every Year to be accounted for to the Pariſh; that if the Poor may not gain, neither may they loſe by the Uncertainty of the Market. But if this is to be the Caſe with Regard to the Pariſh Poor, then why ſo much Indulgence to another Kind of Poor, ſome Favourites of the Colonels, who are not to be ſpecified, as that for their Sakes the King's Authority, the Foundations of Trade and Property, muſt be encroached upon, broken up, and removed, to enable them to diſcharge their Debts, however contracted, without Inconvenience? Why muſt other poor People be deprived of a fair and juſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to get rid of theirs?</p>
                  <p>He argues that the ſtated Allowance of the Clerk and the Sexton cannot be hurt by the Twopenny Act, except when theſe Perſons are poſſeſſed of no Tithables; but their Allowance is affected in the ſame Manner by the Act, whether they have or have not any Tithables. If indeed they have any Tithables, they are ſo far Gainers by the Act; in which Reſpect they differ not from the Parſons, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, or Landlords. The great Gain of the latter, by their poſſeſſing a Number of Tithables, was I fear a Temptation to them to acquieſce under, or promote, an Act to diveſt themſelves of the Property of their own Lands; for in my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, if any Body of Men whatſoever can diminiſh in what Proportion they pleaſe the Rents of Lands, and diſpoſe of what is by this Means taken from the Landlords, the Property of the Land is placed in that Body, and becomes the Property of a few, which the Colonel will tell us by and by is not ſo ſacred as the Property of the many.</p>
                  <p>"In a Project (he owns) for the Relief of Sufferers by Accidents, the more any Man loſes by thoſe Accidents the Proportion in diſtributing a Contribution will be, and he hopes always is ſo." It is by no Means ſo in the Twopenny Act: The Colonel has therefore already owned that as the Act was not made for the Relief of the ordinary and known Poor, ſo neither was it made for the Relief of Sufferers by any Accident. What then it was made for, I think the Reader may eaſily judge.</p>
                  <p>He detects me in uſing the Word poor as a Term of Diſtinction between poor and rich; and adds, in Projects for the Relief of the Poor, generally ſo called,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009612_0007_0F76F60EF0221520"/>no Man ought to be thought poorer one than another. Yet he ſays when "a Veſtry contributes to the Relief of a poor Houſe-Keeper, there the Charity is proportioned to the Greatneſs of his or her Charge; but when it is contriving for the Poor of the Pariſh generally, there they only reſpect the Maintenance of each particular Perſon." If the Colonel means, by all this, that decayed Gentry, or Sufferers by Accidents, are entitled to a more liberal Allowance of Charity than the Poor who have been inured to a State of Poverty: Allowed; but then let not the decayed Gentry, or the Sufferers by Accidents, be ſaddled upon the Clergy, or any one poor and ſmall Body of Men. Let not one ſmall Part of the Community, in Order that decayed Gentry, and Sufferers by Accidents, may be ſure to be relieved, be obliged to relieve all the flouriſhing Gentry, and Gainers by Accidents, into the Bargain. Let theſe decayed Gentry, and Sufferers by Accidents, be pointed out, and diſtinguiſhed from their Oppoſites, and then relieved out of the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, by a general Tax, by voluntary Contribution, or by the more modiſh and genteel Way of Lotteries.</p>

                  <p>The Colonel tells us how an Overplus ought to be diſpoſed of, and to whom; but he ſhould inform us how two Thirds of the Parſons lawful and eſtabliſhed Stipend, of the Merchants private Contracts, and the Landlords Rents, came to be deemed an Overplus; how any Aſſembly, or Parliament, came by a Right to adjudge and condemn what aſſignable Proportion they pleaſe of the private Property of any of their Conſtituents, whether Landlords, Merchants, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whether poor or rich, to be an Overplus, and divide it accordingly among other private Men, whether poor or rich, diſtreſſed or ſucceſsful; and how the Exerciſe of ſuch an arbitrary Power is favourable to Juſtice, to Liberty, and Property.</p>
                  <p>The Colonel having caſt off his favourite Overplus, as it well deſerved, "will preſently demonſtrate that the Act was not made for the Diſpoſal of an Overplus, no nor was relative to any particular Kind of Charity whatever." Had he gone no further, I ſhould have readily acquieſced, without putting him to the Trouble of demonſtrating; but he makes an Exception of ſuch a particular Kind of Charity, as is "founded on the true Policy of all Nations, that of preſerving the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009612_0008_0F76F61094071EF8"/>greater Number of the Individuals of their Community from the <hi>Exorbitancy</hi> of the few," and ſays "the Act was only remedial in its Intentions (not I ſuppoſe in Effect) with Regard to this Exorbitancy of the few, which naturally attends in ſcarce Years." The Colonel we ſhall find, in more Places than one, lays great Streſs upon his being ranked among the greater Number. But how comes it to be <hi>Exorbitancy</hi> in the Landlord to take his full Rents, eſpecially where the Tenant happens to be as great a Gainer by Means of the ſhort Crop as the Landlord, and can well afford to pay his full Rents? What <hi>Exorbitancy</hi> is it in the Merchant to take the juſt Benefit of his Contracts when they turn out favourably for him, eſpecially if he be leſs able to loſe ſuch an Advantage than his Debtor is to pay what he owes? What Exorbitancy is it in the Parſon to take the Market Price for his Tobacco, eſpecially if he cannot otherwiſe pay his own Debts? And why was there no Proviſion in the Act for ſuch ſpecial Caſes, by no Means uncommon? If Exorbitancy is to be provided againſt, why not the Exorbitancy of the <hi>many</hi> as well as the Exorbitancy of the <hi>few?</hi> Why was not there a Price ſet upon all the Tobacco in the Colony? Why muſt Gentlemen of the beſt Fortunes, even though they ſhould raiſe as much Tobacco as uſual in a ſcarce Year, and get three Times a better Price for it, be enabled to purchaſe the Tobacco of the Merchants and the Parſons at one Third of the Value; and then ſell that, with their own, at the higheſt Price they can obtain? Is the Exorbitancy of the <hi>few</hi> really a greater Evil than the Exorbitancy of the <hi>many?</hi> And does not the Colonel himſelf politely tell us that <hi>Sauce for a Gooſe is Sauce for a Gander?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He goes on: <q>I ſay then the diſtinguiſhing the Rich from the Poor, by a Liſt of Tithables, may in ſome Caſes be very proper; but in this unhappy Country it ſeems to be almoſt otherwiſe.</q> Wonderfully gravelled here! How far is any Man wrong in judging, when the Thing of which he judges is not <hi>otherwiſe</hi> than what he judges it to be, but <hi>ſeems to be almoſt otherwiſe in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Country?</hi> Inſtead of <hi>almoſt,</hi> he ſhould have ſaid <hi>quite</hi> otherwiſe, and then he would have come up to the Nature of the Twopenny Act; for the Framers of that Act, by giving the beſt Share of their Bounty to thoſe who have the greateſt Number of Tithables, ſeem to have judged ſuch to be the pooreſt and moſt diſtreſſed Part of the Community, that is, thoſe who have the largeſt viſible Eſtates, to be poorer and more diſtreſſed than thoſe who have not any.</p>

                  <p>According to the Colonel we cannot know whether the Mr. <hi>Nelſons,</hi> Mr. <hi>Page,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nicholas, &amp;c.</hi> Gentlemen of the firſt Fortunes in the Country, be rich or poor; for who knows what Mortgages, Drawbacks, and the like, may have eaten out their Eſtates? This is bad News for the Merchants, and a terrible Blow to the Credit of the Country; for how will the Merchants be able to carry on Trade upon long Credit, if it be impoſſible for them to know who is rich and who poor by the Poſſeſſion of large viſible Eſtates, and if the Colonel has given them no other Criterion by which they may obtain ſuch neceſſary Knowledge? This Impoſſibility to diſtinguiſh the Rich from the Poor by the Poſſeſſion of large viſible Eſtates, he ſays, I have allowed, by ſpeaking of ſome in my Pariſh who have but one Tithable there, and conſiderable Poſſeſſions notwithſtanding, there or elſewhere; but with the Colonel's Leave, though the having but one Tithable in any one Pariſh is no certain Proof of Poverty, yet the having large Poſſeſſions in any one or more Pariſhes is a good poſitive Proof of Riches, ſuch a one as would content me for the Proof of my Riches, though it ſeems it will not content the leſs avaritious Colonel.</p>
                  <p>He takes Notice of my Comment on a fundamental Paſſage of his in a former Piece, about the general Poverty of the Country, and about the Abſurdity of thinking to relieve the Poverty of a whole Country by taking Property from ſome poor People to give it to other poor People, every Body being ſuppoſed to be poor.</p>

                  <p>He complains heavily of my having miſtaken the Import of the ſaid Paſſage, and is unable to make it ſpeak any other Language that I have done; for when he ſhould give us, what he calls the true Senſe of the Paſſage, he puts us off with telling us what it is like. <hi>It can only,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be properly comparea to a Conſultation of Phyſicians,</hi> ſome of whom ſhall adviſe one Thing, and ſome another, about the Treatment of a Patient. Now, in the Name of Obſcurity, what is the preciſe Meaning of a Paſſage which is like a Conſultation of Phyſicians divided in Opinion? Thoſe who have Abilities and Penetration enough to underſtand the Colonel's ordinary Preciſion and Plainneſs, may perhaps underſtand what he means by this Compariſon: For my Part, I ſee nothing here but Clouds and thick Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009612_0010_0F76F6132A1BE070"/>The Illuſtration is, in my Opinion, much more duſky than the Paſſage itſelf intended to be illuſtrated. However, the Colonel, as if he had performed Wonders in the Art of illuminating, has the Courage to compare the ſecret and inviſible Senſe of the Paſſage which he cannot diſcern himſelf, or enable others to diſcern, to a large Steeple for its Clearneſs; and the Senſe, which is obvious to every Body, to a ſmall Bird on the Top of that Steeple, for its Imperceptibility.</p>
                  <p>From my opening the Colonel's chief Argument, and ſhowing its Tendency to ſupport and encourage Gaming, and all Kinds of Extravagancy, at the Expenſe of the Church and the Clergy's Eſtabliſhment, in the Heat of Imagination he fancies that I have called him a Gameſter, and an extravagant, and what not; and raves accordingly about the Injury done him, in thus repreſenting a Man, known to the <hi>whole</hi> World (50 Miles round; that is, as much as the Colonel can in Conſcience deſire, nothwithſtanding his various Publications in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Liverpool</hi>) for a conſtant Enemy, to Gaming and Extravagancy. Be it ſo. If the Colonel uſe Arguments well qualified to ſupport and encourage what he has a Mind to diſcourage and aboliſh, who is to be blamed?</p>

                  <p>As if the Colonel had done nothing hitherto but flouriſh, he now ſolemnly enters upon the proper Conſideration of the Twopenny Act. Indeed he has done nothing more than talk about <hi>demonſtrating,</hi> and <hi>coming to the main Point:</hi> Like a Dog in a Wheel, who is continually climbing, without ſoaring any higher; or, that I may raiſe my Stile, and bring it to ſuit better with the Sublimity of the Subject, like the Image of a prancing Horſe, which never ſtirs a Foot from the fixed Pedeſtal.</p>
                  <p>He begins again with repeating that his Letter to the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable, in Point of Juſtice, &amp;c.</hi> the Truth of which would have been better proved by any other Teſtimony than his own. Pray, Gentlemen, take off his firſt Piece when you buy the ſecond: It is hard that a Man, who writes ſo much for the Good of his Country, ſhould be ſuffered to be a Loſer.</p>

                  <p>The Twopenny Act is a mere <hi>Proteus,</hi> and now aſſumes quite a new Shape; and, what is more ſtrange, ſuch a Shape as it cannot get quit of again. For,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009612_0011_0F76F613D00286A8"/>ſays he, <q>it can <hi>only</hi> be looked upon in the Light of an Aid to the royal Act; for the Scarcity of the Times (alias the Crop) had rendered the Payment of the Clergy's Salaries, ſtipulated in 1748, impoſſible to be made without ſome Compenſation ſettled in Lieu of them.</q> Did the Clergy ſue for this Aid? Were they ſenſible of the Want of any ſuch Aid? Muſt they be aided againſt their Inclinations? Aſk them now concerning this Aid: Will not moſt of them call it puſhing a weak Man down a Precipice under Colour of officiouſly ſtepping forward to keep him from falling? I make no Doubt but when the King of <hi>France</hi> changes the Value of Money, and makes 1<hi>

                     </hi> paſs for 18<hi>
                        <abbr>d.</abbr>
                     </hi> it is always for the Aid and Benefit of his <hi>poor</hi> Subjects, and to enable himſelf to pay them what he owes them with the <hi>greater Facility.</hi> Might not the Clergy, if any Aid had been neceſſary, have received the full market Price as a juſt Compenſation for their Tobacco? Might not their Debtors have paid them for their Tobacco what it was actually ſold at by theſe Debtors? He goes on: <q>This Compenſation was <hi>attempted</hi> by the Legiſlature, in Conſequence of the Conſtancy, as well as Reaſonableneſs, of the Practice of ſettling all Compenſations of a <hi>publick Nature</hi> by the higheſt publick Authority of that Country in which the Neceſſity for ſuch Compenſation ſhould ariſe.</q> Are the defective Compenſations for Rents, for private Contracts, for the eſtabliſhed Stipends of the Clergy, Compenſations of a <hi>publick Nature,</hi> or proper Compenſations at all? Are not theſe Rents, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and Stipends, <hi>private</hi> Property? Can any Authority whatſoever, an Aſſembly or a Parliament, in a free Government, make one Third of the Value a Compenſation? Now again the Act is deſigned for the Relief of the Poor againſt <hi>Exorbitancy,</hi> under the Title of "Exactions of private Avarice." Then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately it is a <hi>prodigious Difficulty to determine who is rich and who poor;</hi> and yet again we have the Poor ſeparated from the Wealthy, and the Act is for Relief of the latter againſt the former, though there is no diſtinguiſhing the one from the other. And by this Way of talking backwards and forwards, all the Arguments in my Diſtinct View that have any Senſe in them are anſwered, or, as the Colonel phraſes it, <hi>comprehended in Anſwer.</hi>

                  <p>As we were told in the laſt Page that the Twopenny Act was <hi>only</hi> an Aid to help the Clergy to get their Dues, but this was mixed with other heterogeneous
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009612_0012_0F76F614844765E0"/>Matter, ſo in this Page we are told the direct contrary, namely, that the Act was <hi>only</hi> an Aid, to hinder the Clergy from getting their Dues; this too being clouded with other heterogeneous Matter, like a ſmall Quantity of Silver in Ore not worth working. For hear the Colonel: <q>How weak then muſt all his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours (tending to repreſent the Legiſlature in the Light of raiſing a charitable Fund, by reducing the Miniſters Salaries in every Pariſh) appear, when the leaſt common Senſe in the World muſt diſcover that the Act extended its Views to all the Inhabitants of the Colony, as well Laity as Eccleſiaſticks, and was <hi>only</hi> remedial wit Reſpect to the Evil of <hi>Exorbitancy</hi> impending by the Means of a very ſhort Crop.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He aſks "whom I propoſe for Objects of Charity for the Deductions to be made on my Method of reaſoning out of every Tobacco Debt due to every Layman," and anſwers himſelf by ſaying <hi>"every Debtor the charitable Object of his Creditor."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To have reaſoned properly againſt the Act, he ſays, a Clergyman like myſelf ought to have ſhown <hi>that the Commodity was not ſo ſcarce as was repreſented.</hi> This I have already done in the Gazette <hi>Virginia</hi> Edition, at the Concluſion of my Obſervations on Colonel <hi>Bland</hi>'s Letter.</p>
                  <p>He adds I <q>ought to prove that no Debt in Tobacco due to any Layman was greater in Quantity than what ſuch Perſon muſt have been indebted as his Quota in the Pariſh towards the maintaining of the Miniſter.</q> If any Layman in any Pariſh was a greater Sufferer by the Act than the Parſon, the Act was more unjuſt to the Layman than the Parſon; and I think every Layman ought to receive what is juſtly owing to him, as well as every Clergyman.</p>

                  <p>He will have it that the Neceſſity for this particular Act, and a ſhort Crop, are one and the ſame Thing; becauſe he ſays his Brother <hi>Bland</hi> could uſe the Term in no other Senſe. But to ſay that the Crop was ſhort, therefore this very Act was neceſſary, is affirming, not proving: It is leaving out the intermediate Ideas which ſhould prove that from a ſhort Crop a Neceſſity for this very Act may be inferred. Whatever Diſtreſs a ſhort Crop might produce, if the Objects of Relief might have been diſtinguiſhed and relieved by conſtitutional Means, by a
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009612_0013_0F76F614F6A34248"/>Brief, or other Ways which I have mentioned, then there could be no Neceſſity, no Occaſion for any Act at all; but if there muſt be an Act, and one might have been framed which ſhould have ſeparated Gainers from Sufferers by Means of the ſhort Crop, Rich from Poor, Objects of Relief from thoſe who ought to have been found among the Relievers, then there could be no Neceſſity, no Occaſion for the Act in Queſtion. It is impoſſible, I think, for the Colonel, or any Body elſe, to ſhow any Neceſſity in a free Government for an Act which takes away the King's Authority, removes the Eſtabliſhment of the Church, undermines the known Principles of Commerce, and overturns the Foundations of Juſtice and Property; for, what will the Lovers of Compenſations give us in Lieu of ſuch Bleſſings? Is the temporary Advantage of ſome Particulars, or the Hurt of others, ſo charming an Acquiſition as to be deemed a ſufficient Compenſation for the Overthrow of ſuch fundamental and ineſtimable publick Felicities? And for the Pleaſure of preſent Benefit to ſome, and Maltreatment of others, muſt we ſuffer our Notions to be corrupted in the Eſſentials of civil Liberty?</p>
                  <p>He is at his <hi>Exorbitancy</hi> again, and takes Notice of my having mentioned the Fallibility of <hi>Virginia</hi> Aſſemblies; adding, that "the ſame Thing may be ſaid of Parliaments any where elſe." Very true: I know of no Difference, in Point of Security from Errour, between the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament and the Aſſembly of <hi>Virginia,</hi> but what ariſes from Superiority in Number, Learning, Education, Opportunities of Knowledge, and Application to Buſineſs <hi>in either.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He confeſſes Aſſemblies to be ſometimes ſo apprehenſive of <hi>Exorbitancy</hi> as to ſet a Price upon any Produce for which it cannot afterwards be ſold. They are then ſometimes impoſed upon by Accounts of the Shortneſs of the Crop, while it is growing, and ought not therefore to be too credulous in ſuch Matters. But will the Colonel tell me why in one Caſe a Price is ſet upon the <hi>whole</hi> Corn, in the other only upon a Part of the Crop of Tobacco? How comes it that the late Aſſembly, in Relation to Corn, provided againſt the <hi>Exorbitancy</hi> of the <hi>many;</hi> and in Relation to Tobacco, againſt the <hi>Exorbitancy</hi> of the <hi>few?</hi> A clear and candid Anſwer to this Qeſtion might lay the Foundation of a curious and uſeful enough Diſquiſition. I am afraid that the Property of the <hi>few</hi> is ſometimes held more ſacred by great Patriots than the Property of the <hi>many,</hi> which we ſhall find preſently the Colonel does not always approve.</p>

He inſiſts that the Shortneſs of the Crop in 1758 was <hi>real,</hi> under a Suppoſition that I have denied its Exiſtence, by denying the Exiſtence of a Neceſſity for the Twopenny Act, which he takes for granted are one and the ſame Thing. He goes on gravely proving the Shortneſs of the Crop, as if I had denied it, nay and owned it too.</p>

                  <p>He attributes the high Price in 1758 to the Shortneſs of the Crop, in Oppoſition to what he had formerly alleged in his Letter to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> pronounced ſeveral Times by himſelf to be unanſwerable. He means that he will not let any Body anſwer it but himſelf.</p>
                  <p>He obſerves that the Tobacco in 1758 did not ſell for ſo much in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Market as in the <hi>Virginia</hi> Market. How unjuſt and cruel then was the Twopenny Act to the Merchant, obliged to part with the Tobacco which belonged to him, which he had bought and paid for, at a low Rate; obliged to replace it at a high Rate; and obliged to ſell again at a low Rate! But he brings this as an Argument that the ſhort Crop was not ſo valuable as a plentiful One. However, he has proved afterwards that if the ſhort Crop had ſold as well in <hi>Britain</hi> as it did in <hi>Virginia,</hi> it would have been much more valuable than any plentiful One; and let me add, it is not peculiar to ſhort Crops to ſell better in <hi>Virginia</hi> than in <hi>Britain.</hi> Therefore, notwithſtanding his Remark, the ſhort Crop might ſtill be as valuable as any plentiful One.</p>
                  <p>The Colonel makes himſelf merry with my attributing any Diſtreſs that could ariſe rather to the Unevenneſs than the Shortneſs of a Crop, and calls it a Quibble; but inſtead of ſhowing that Diſtreſs comes not from Unevenneſs, he only contends that there may be a Degree of Unevenneſs without Diſtreſs, and that the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenneſs muſt be great to occaſion Diſtreſs. For hear him: <q>It can hardly be alleged that any but the covetous Hunks, or the deſpicably Invidious, ever talked about the Largeneſs of another's Crop, where he was not apprehenſive of Diſtreſs from the <hi>prodigious Shortneſs</hi> of it in the Country</q> (alias his own Plantation.) Again: <q>No Unevenneſs in Crops was ever deemed diſtreſsful, <hi>without its being very ſcarce in other Parts;</hi>
                     </q> that is, without the Crop was very uneven. Again: <q>We can have no Idea (he the Rector will ſay) of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009612_0015_0F76F6168F244050"/>of Unevenneſs in Crops without ſuppoſing them to be large in ſome Places, and ſmall in others." <hi>Yea verily.</hi> "I anſwer, that may be;" (ſay you ſo) but the Idea then of Smallneſs muſt be <hi>greatly lowered,</hi> as it is relative in its Nature, before we come to be <hi>diſtreſſed</hi> with it." Once more: "In my Notions of Things, it (<hi>Diſtreſs</hi>) certainly ariſes from the <hi>prodigious Smallneſs</hi> of the Crop in <hi>particular Places,</hi> and thoſe not a few.</q> When he ſays the Diſtreſs <hi>ariſes</hi> from <hi>Scarcity,</hi> he means <hi>particular Scarcity;</hi> which is what I call Unevenneſs, or Inequality of the Crop, if he like that Word better. When I ſay Diſtreſs does <hi>not ariſe</hi> from <hi>Scarcity,</hi> I mean the Shortneſs of the <hi>whole</hi> Crop taken collectively; ſo that the Colonel here, as in other Places, pretends to differ widely from me without being able to differ with me at all for his Life: For we both ſay the ſame Thing, in a ſomewhat different Form of Words. If this wants further Explanation, any Body I think may eaſily conceive that in a plentiful Year ſome Plantations may be diſtreſſed (in the Colonel's Language) by <hi>particular Scarcity;</hi> in mine, by the <hi>Unevenneſs</hi> or <hi>Inequality</hi> of the Crop: And in a ſcarce Year ſome Plantations may be in a very flouriſhing Condition (in the Colonel's Language) by <hi>particular Plenty;</hi> in mine, by the <hi>Unevenneſs</hi> or <hi>Inequality</hi> of the Crop. But, after all, as if he had been writing for Writing's Sake, the Colonel aſks, Why ſuch Nicety of Diſtinction? "What does it ſignify from which the Diſtreſs proceeds, the Scarceneſs or Unevenneſs of the Crops?" Ay marry, a ſhrewd Queſtion! It ſignifies thus much, that it is not ſufficient to ſay there will be a ſcarce Crop this Year; therefore all Gentlemen Planters, who chooſe (as if we were beating up for Volunteers to accept ſomething to their own Advantage) are Objects of Charity and Relief, and may be entitled to a great Bounty. A ſhort Crop may be a Good to one, and a Hurt to another. Therefore, if the Aſſembly will relieve, they ſhould make <hi>ſome</hi> Difference between Poor and Rich, the Diſtreſſed and the Succeſsful, thoſe who ought to be relieved and thoſe who ought to be the Relievers, to the Advantage of the former, not the latter; eſpecially as the Colonel does not deny but this might have been done, by Means of the publick Warehouſes. The late Aſſembly then, in not doing this, wantonly (to uſe no worſe Term) exceeded the Bounds of Neceſſity.</p>

                  <p>On Suppoſition that ſome are damaged, and ſome are benifited, by the Effects of a ſhort Crop, and in Order to bring Gainers and Sufferers more upon a Level,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009612_0016_0F76F6173053A4A0"/>it is impoſſible for any Legiſlature upon Earth, in preſcribing who ſhall give and who ſhall receive, to act juſtly: He will not allow that this is a good Reaſon why an Aſſembly ſhould not engage in a Buſineſs which may make Matters worſe inſtead of better, becauſe <q>the Property of the <hi>few</hi> can never be more ſacred than the Property of the <hi>many.</hi>
                     </q> What does he mean by the Property of the <hi>few</hi> and the <hi>many?</hi> Is not all Property, except a little that may belong to a Corporation or two, the Property of Individuals, and all equally ſacred? What can he mean by intimating that the Property of the <hi>many</hi> is more ſacred than the Property of the <hi>few,</hi> but that the Property of the Gentlemen Planters is more ſacred than that of Merchants or Parſons, becauſe the former are more numerous than the latter? Suppoſe a Merchant agrees with a Planter for a certain Quantity of Wheat to be delivered at a fixed Rate, for a Number of Years to come, the Money perhaps paid down before-hand; if the Merchant happens to have the worſt of the Bargain, muſt he be obliged to ſtand to it, becauſe Planters are more numerous than Merchants? If the Merchant has the better Side of the Bargain, muſt the Planter be freed from it for the ſame Reaſon? In the Place of Planter and Merchant, put the Man born in <hi>Virginia</hi> and a new Settler in this Colony, or <hi>Native</hi> and <hi>Foreigner,</hi> as they are ſometimes called; is the Native's Property more ſacred than the Foreigner's, for the above Reaſon? Inſtead of Native and Foreigner, write Layman and Parſon: Is the Layman's Property more ſacred than the Parſon's, for the above Reaſon? This Notion of Property is fitter to be entertained by the Head of a Company of Bandditti than the Member of a civil and free Government.</p>
                  <p>He ſays I am very erroneous in my Account of the Number of Hogſheads ſhipped to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> in the ſcarce Year, and begs us in the following Page to take his Word for it that there were only 20, 000 Hogſheads of a Thouſand Weight each ſhipped in that Year.

                  <p>He admits that the Twopenny Act interfered with private Property, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it by alleging <q>even that Property in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is often obliged to ſubmit to <hi>publick Utility.</hi>
                     </q> I will not ſay the Colonel here quibbles upon the Terms <hi>publick Utility,</hi> becauſe Quibbling belongs to me; but either deſignedly, or uncautiouſly (which I ſay not) he miſunderſtands, or miſapplies, the Terms <hi>publick Utility.</hi> When private Property ſubmits to <hi>publick Utility</hi> in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> it is for rendering the Streets of a City convenient, Rivers navigable, building Bridges, and the like, which is <hi>publick Utility;</hi> and a very full Compenſation is always allowed in Lieu of the <hi>private</hi> Property, which ſubmits. But the Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny 07 Act had for its Object <hi>no publick Utility,</hi> no rendering Cities convenient, Rivers navigable, no building Bridges, and the like: It was framed purely for removing Property out of ſome <hi>private</hi> Hands into others; and a <hi>ſmall Part</hi> of the Value of the private Property taken away was given inſtead of a Compenſation. Indeed, without this latter Circumſtance, the Act could not have anſwered the End propoſed; which was ſolely that of favouring one <hi>private</hi> Man more than another.</p>
                  <p>Towards the Bottom of this Page the Colonel informs us that he has been employed in removing ſome Rubbiſh that lay in his Way, "as it were;" and now he begins again manfully, and in earneſt, to juſtify the Twopenny Act, which I apprehend he will ſtill find to be waſhing the Blackamoor white.</p>

Where then but among the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of <hi>large viſible Eſtates,</hi> eaten out with <hi>Mortages</hi> and the like? Well, let the Colonel's Imagination create as many <hi>Thouſands</hi> of Poor of this Kind as it will, ſtill ſeveral material Queſtions recur; ſuch as, May not many of the Clergy be as poor as any of the Colonel's Thouſands of Poor? May they not have Debts to pay, and no Eſtates in Lands or Slaves to pay them with? Muſt the Burthen of relieving all the Colonel's Poor lie ſolely upon the Merchants and the Clergy? Muſt theſe two ſmall Bodies of Men relieve alſo thoſe who ſhould rather aſſiſt them in bearing the ſaid Burthen, that is, all the Rich as well as the Colonel's Poor? Muſt they relieve <hi>Proſperity</hi> as well as Diſtreſs? Muſt they relieve pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Sufferers, without knowing how or what they ſuffered, without knowing whether they be really Sufferers or Gainers? Muſt they relieve <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>inviſible</hi> Sufferers? I dare ſay if the Colonel was giving away Money of his own, he would think it neceſſary to aſk ſuch Queſtions before he parted with it; for there is an Economy in Charity, as well as other Matters. Why then did he not aſk ſuch Queſtions when he was beſtowing in Charity the Property of other Men by his <hi>illuſtrious Aye.</hi> On Suppoſition that I am right in judging whom the Colonel means by his Thouſands of poor rich People, I would adviſe them to part with their Coaches rather than their <hi>Beds,</hi> if indeed there be any <hi>preſſing Neceſſity</hi> for parting with either.</p>

                  <p>He ſeems inclinable again to make <hi>all</hi> the Country poor, and the <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Parſons</hi> the only fit and able Men to relieve this <hi>univerſal</hi> Poverty. He allows a Kind of Inequality in the Benefit received from the Act, which <q>could neither be <hi>foreſeen</hi> nor <hi>prevented</hi> by any Legiſlature in the World.</q> As to the firſt, it required great Foreſight truly to diſcern that the Act made no Difference between Gainers and Sufferers by the Means of a ſhort Crop, and favoured the Rich abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more than the Poor. As to the latter, all the publick Warehouſes are
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009612_0019_0F76F6199EB4DAE8"/>ſubſtantial and very intelligent, though but wooden, Evidences to the contrary. The Aſſembly it ſeems could not <hi>foreſee</hi> that the Act which obliges me to give three Shillings and Sevenpence Farthing to a <hi>poor</hi> Man obliges me to give ten Pounds and upwards to a <hi>rich</hi> Man, and that this Advantage in Favour of the ſame rich Man would frequently be repeated in ſeveral Pariſhes; and, if they had foreſeen this, they could not have framed an Act ſo as to have <hi>prevented</hi> it. What Straws will not a drowning Writer catch at for Support, while he ſinks, like the Breed of thoſe Hounds which the Colonel talks about, without ever opening his Eyes to have any Enjoyment of Light!</p>
                  <p>He calls the Aſſembly <hi>Guardians</hi> and <hi>Preſervers</hi> of the <hi>Poor,</hi> and repreſents it as their Duty to take <hi>Debtors</hi> under their Protection. Let us try what we can make of this, applied to an Aſſembly and the Parſons: The Aſſembly were all <hi>Debtors</hi> to the Parſons, and the Parſons the <hi>Poor,</hi> compared with the Aſſembly; if the Aſſembly be humane to the <hi>Debtors</hi> (themſelves) they will be cruel to the <hi>Poor</hi> (the Parſons.) Is not this ſomething of an Argument, from the Colonel himſelf, that ſo puzzling an Act ſhould have been foreborn? Would not the late Aſſembly have done better to have conſidered themſelves as Guardians and Protectors of <hi>private Property,</hi> of the <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> and <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> in Church and State, rather than as <hi>Guardians</hi> and <hi>Perſervers</hi> of the <hi>Poor?</hi> Is not the former a more honourable Style? Might they not have deduced from it a better Rule of Action than from their being Preſervers of the Colonel's <hi>inviſible</hi> Poor, with <hi>viſible</hi> Eſtates? Might not theſe, as well as other Poor, have been left to the Care of Pariſh Officers, or their Chriſtian Neighbours, beſt acquainted with their Circumſtances, in whatever Diſtrict they inhabit? But, after all, did not the late Aſſembly in the Twopenny Act behave more like Preſervers of the <hi>Rich</hi> than Preſervers of the <hi>Poor?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is, I ſuppoſe, from the Colonel's peeviſh Effuſions againſt the Unmercifulneſs of Creditors, as if the Debtor, by deſiring to enjoy more than his own, was not oftentimes more unmerciful than the Creditor, who deſires only his own; from his Rancour to the Clergy as <hi>Creditors,</hi> that is, becauſe they do their Work and are not paid for it until ſome Time after; and from his forgetting to commiſerate them as <hi>Poor, &amp;c.</hi> that he has in ſome Places, I underſtand, got the Name of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009612_0020_0F76F61A315889B0"/>Colonel <hi>Spitfire.</hi> Indeed, when he apprehends that he may poſſibly find himſelf at laſt, after a due Courſe of Law, under Obligation to pay a juſt Debt, he is ſo touchy and ſore upon the Head of Humanity to poor Debtors (which Humanity by the Bye is frequently their Ruin) together with the Avarice and Cruelty of Creditors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it is enough to make any Stranger, unacquainted with his Circumſtances, ſuſpect his belonging to that irritable, but I hope ſmall, Part of the Society, each of which deems Economy unneceſſary in this crediting Country; finds his Income thereby inſufficient, and is willing to ſupply the Deficiency out of that of other Men, not able to ſupport his Extravagancy, and perhaps their own too; who, when he ſhould rather be a <hi>Caca plata,</hi> to pay his Debts (blame-ably contracted) without diminiſhing his real Eſtate by Sale, chooſes to be a <hi>Caca fuego,</hi> to fright a <hi>poor</hi> Dun from boarding; like a Child, is willing to eat his Cake and have it by him too; like a Man, is ready to give hard Words for hard Coin, and to clear off as it were with Powder and Ball; that being as good a Secret as the Philoſopher's Stone for turning Lead into Gold.</p>

                  <p>He argues that a <hi>better Proviſion,</hi> made ſo by Accident, is not to be called a better Proviſion.</p>
                  <p>He compares the Clergy's aiming to get the Market Price for their Tobacco, that Price which every rich Man in the Country made no Scruple of taking for his own and the Clergy's Tobacco too, to cheating at a Gaming-Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>He will not allow that an Attempt to have Fees better ſecured implied any Willingneſs to obtain the full Value of them; though it be well known that they are ſmall enough, as well as not ſecured to the Satisfaction of thoſe to whom they belong. However, if he will return me a Compliment, by giving my Single and Diſtinct View a ſecond Edition, he has my Leave to mend my Logick in this momentous Circumſtance; and if he will let it be a <hi>London Edition,</hi> as that ſounds grander, and it will be moſt convenient to quote it when I write to <hi>Virginia</hi> Readers, he will for once in his Life return a full Compenſation, to which there can be made no Objection.</p>
                  <p>He now imagines that he has fully <hi>juſtified</hi> the Twopenny Act, has fully <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected</hi> the Rector, and <q>cannot avoid taking great Glory to himſelf that he ever
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009612_0021_0F76F61BE81AD880"/>had the Honour to contribute an <hi>Aye</hi> to ſo juſt an Act as the Twopenny Act really was.</q> If he would give up the <hi>Profit</hi> he got by the Act, we would willingly leave him to the quie? Enjoyment of all the <hi>Glory.</hi>

                  <p>Upon the Suppoſition that Twopenny Acts without a ſuſpending Clauſe can be defended by the <hi>moſt preſſing Neceſſity alone,</hi> the Colonel undertakes to ſhow that a Twopenny Act in 1755 was a defenſible as one in 1758. For why? Though the Crop was much ſhorter in the one Year than the other, yet any Degree of Scarcity is <hi>a moſt preſſing Neceſſity</hi> for Twopenny Acts; nay the <hi>general</hi> Repreſentation of any Degree of Scarcity, whether true or falſe, is a <hi>moſt preſſing Neceſſity</hi> for Twopenny Acts. This <hi>general</hi> Repreſentation was a Repreſentation from a <hi>few</hi> Planters; for ſome, to their Honour, refuſed to ſign any Petition of the Kind in 1758, as being <hi>unjuſt;</hi> and others were never applied to; and in Numbers of Pariſhes I never heard that there was a ſingle Hand to any ſuch Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. But ſurely ſome Repreſentation of this Kind may at any Time be had by a Colonel from his Conſtituents, intereſted in ſuch a Repreſentation, and liable moſt of them as Militia-Men to be whipped without the <hi>trifling Form</hi> of a Trial by a Court-Martial; for the Liberty, as well as Property, of the <hi>few,</hi> has ſometimes been held more ſacred than that of the <hi>many</hi> by great Patriots ſubject to human Frailties: So that <hi>moſt preſſing Neceſſities</hi> for Twopenny Acts, Penny Halfpeny Acts, three Farthings Acts, or what you pleaſe, are always ready upon Demand.</p>

                  <p>He takes Pains to prove <hi>the moſt preſſing Neceſſity</hi> for Penny Halfpeny and three Farthings Acts in the Frontiers. But what is all he ſays to the Purpoſe! What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Advantages he can imagine to have accrued from ſuch Acts, might they not all have been enjoyed as well <hi>with</hi> as <hi>without</hi> a ſuſpending Clauſe?</p>

                  <p>With Regard to the <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Princeſs-Anne</hi> Act, the Colonel deſerts Brother <hi>Bland,</hi> gives up the Plea of Juſtification from the <hi>moſt preſſing Neceſſity alone,</hi> and undertakes to defend that Act upon another Plea, full as valuable as the old One. Let us hear him: To have put a ſuſpending Clauſe in the <hi>Norfolk</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009612_0022_0F76F61CE62B4550"/>
                     <hi>Princeſs-Anne</hi> Act, he ſays, would have been <hi>conſtruing the Prerogative to the Deſtruction of the Prince's Virtue;</hi> which <hi>he ſticks not</hi> 
                     <q>to define to be that Goodneſs which inclines him to encourage and enjoy the Peace of his Subjects, mutually ſettled between themſelves.</q> And further he adds: <q>I ſay then it is a Virtue in a Prince to acquieſce at all Times in the Agreement of his Subjects among themſelves, in any Part of his Dominions, when that Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does not affect his own <hi>royal Right</hi> in any <hi>ſenſible</hi> Manner, or the Reſt of his Subjects of his Kingdom in any Manner <hi>whatever;</hi> and becauſe that ſome Form (though extremely conſtitutional and weighty in other Affairs, yet in this of the Agreement really trifling) was not complied with, I cannot help ſaying that the inſiſting upon the Compliance with ſuch Form, for Fear of a Precedent, is to draw a Conſequence of Evil really from no poſſible Reaſon. Now as the <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Princeſs-Anne</hi> Act certainly appeared to the Aſſembly to be the univerſal Deſire of the Inhabitants of thoſe Counties, I ſay it muſt be ſo far from being a Diſreſpect to the Prerogative in the Aſſembly, in paſſing it without a ſuſpending Clauſe, that I cannot help thinking it to be ſhowing the moſt dutiful Regard imaginable to the Sovereign, by concluding that his innate Goodneſs could not require ſuch a Clauſe in a Thing that tended only to the Satisfaction of but a few Subjects amongſt themſelves, unanimouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to it.</q> I take this Paſſage to be a ſtrong Inſtance of the Colonel's wrapping up warm in a cloudy Diction ſuch Sentiments as are entertained by him, but not fit to be expoſed to the Light too openly. Obſerve, this is ſaid of an Act already repealed, for Want of a ſuſpending Clauſe; of an Act that was not only in Danger of being made a Precedent for paſſing other more injurious Acts without a ſuſpending Clauſe, but was actually uſed as a Precedent for paſſing ſuch Acts by Governour <hi>Dinwiddie;</hi> and of an Act paſſed ſoon after a Petition for the Power of paſſing ſuch Acts had been preſented and refuſed. What can we gather from the above Paſſage but that to paſs Acts without a ſuſpending Clauſe, when the Aſſembly think proper, and when the Buſineſs could have been done as well with ſuch a Clauſe, is ſhowing a dutiful Regard to the Sovereign? Yes, juſt as diminiſhing and rendering the Stipends of the Clergy precarious is aſſiſting them to obtain their Dues. What can we gather from it but that if the two Counties of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Princeſs-Anne</hi> (by the Bye, I never heard that any of thoſe People petitioned for an Act <hi>without a ſuſpending Clauſe</hi>) be not allowed to ſettle a Peace
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009612_0023_0F76F61D3862CC98"/>among themſelves for the King to <hi>encourage</hi> and <hi>enjoy,</hi> if the Aſſembly be not allowed to determine when a ſuſpending Clauſe is a <hi>conſtitutional</hi> and <hi>weighty</hi> Point, and when a <hi>trifling Form</hi> beſt omitted, there is an End of the King's <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>innate Goodneſs.</hi> If ſo old and deep a Politician as the Colonel, ſo able a Writer, a Man ſo acute at Demonſtration, can expreſs himſelf in this unguarded Manner in Print on the Subject of the Prerogative, producing the Freedom he takes with the Power of the Crown as an Expreſſion of Regard to his Sovereign, no Wonder that an obſcure Lawyer, the other Day, when a Court had previouſly adjudged the Twopenny Act to be no Law, and a Jury was ſummoned on a Writ of Inquiry to ſettle the Damage which the Plaintiff had ſuſtained by the ſaid Act, adjudged no Law, ſhould tell the Jury that the King, by diſallowing the ſaid Act, <hi>had forfeited the Allegiance of the People of Virginia;</hi> and that the Parſons, for oppoſing the ſaid Act by <hi>legal Means,</hi> inſtead of obtaining Damages, deſerved to be <hi>ſeverely puniſhed.</hi> No Wonder that the Jury, in Oppoſition to unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Evidence, inſtead of bringing in the Difference between 50 <abbr>
                        <hi>ſ.</hi>
                     </abbr> a Hundred and 16 <abbr>
                        <hi>ſ.</hi>
                     </abbr> 8 <abbr>
                        <hi>d.</hi>
                     </abbr> upon 16, 000 Weight of Tobacco, which latter Price the Plaintiff had been paid, brought in 1 <abbr>
                        <hi>d.</hi>
                     </abbr> Damages for the Whole. No Wonder that the Court refuſed to let the Evidence be recorded. No Wonder that there was a ſmall Cry of Treaſon among the By-Standers. No Wonder that the Court, though called upon by the oppoſite Pleader to take Notice of his Adverſary's Behaviour, permitted the Offender to proceed in his treaſonable Harangue without any Reprimand or Interruption. No Wonder that though this Harangue was made in the Preſence of various Magiſtrates, and ſome Aſſembly-Men, yet no further Notice has been taken of this remarkable Tranſaction. No Wonder that after the Trial was over the Pleader excuſed himſelf to the Plaintiff for the Injury he had done him, alleging that what he had ſaid of the King's <hi>forfeiting the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance of the People,</hi> and the ill Behaviour of the Clergy towards ſuperiour Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, was only intended to render himſelf <hi>popular.</hi> I hope he is miſtaken; and that to <hi>inſult Majeſty</hi> is not the high Road to <hi>Popularity</hi> in this loyal Country, whatever it may be to <hi>abuſe and oppreſs the Clergy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since I have been led to make Mention of one Trial, I will not paſs by the two others that have been had upon the Twopenny Act. The Event of one of them was juſt the Reverſe of that already mentioned; for the Jury found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009612_0024_0F76F61E08271CC8"/>Damages, but the Court adjudged the Act to be Law. Ten of the Jury, were at firſt for allowing the Plantift's Tobacco to be ſettled after the Rate of 50 <g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g> a Hundred, but by the Obſtinacy of two that Rate was reduced to 37 <g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g> 6 <abbr>
                        <hi>d.</hi>
                     </abbr> that being found to be Sixpence more than the loweſt Price given for Tobacco in that Pariſh in the ſcarce Year, when 52 <g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g> 6 <abbr>
                        <hi>d.</hi>
                     </abbr> was the higheſt. Many of the By-Standers, and the Jurors themſelves, thought that the Parſon ought to have, and profeſſed themſelves willing, to pay him 50 <g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g> a Hundred. The Jury being directed by the Court to bring the Damage in one Sum, went out and made a Miſtake in caſting up, bringing in by this Means ſome Pounds Damages leſs than they intended; which Errour it was alleged could not be altered conſiſtently with the Rules of the Court, becauſe the Diſcovery of it was not made ſoon enough.</p>
                  <p>The Event of the other Trial was ſtill different; for the Court, not chooſing to meddle with the Matter at all, left the Whole of it to the Jury, who in a few Minutes after the Pleadings ceaſed ſaid We find for the Defendant, without ſaying any more. What is more obſervable is, it was hereupon entered on Record that the Plaintiff had actually received the Tobacco itſelf for which he ſued; though the Defendant attempted to prove no more than that the Plaintiff had received the Compenſation allowed by the Act, namely, 16 <g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g> 8 <abbr>
                        <hi>d.</hi>
                     </abbr> a Hundred in Money. And the above Entry, it is pretended, is agreeable to the Nature of pleading. In this Trial the Price of Tobacco was proved to be 50 <g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g> a Hundred during <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> in 1758, and for Tobacco not delivered until <hi>Auguſt</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> by the Evidence of Merchants of the firſt Rank and Character.</p>
                  <p>Now of all theſe Affairs we ſay no more but that, if there be any Thing amiſs in them, we have the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Liberty and Spirit to hope that it will be rectified by the General-Court.</p>

                  <p>He labours to ſcrew ſome Diſreſpect to the Speaker, out of what I ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an Application of ſome of the Clergy to be heard upon the Twopenny Bill; but he is not able to ſucceed, for he allows all that I ſaid of this Application to be true. On the other Hand, I allow that the Speaker was a Friend to the Clergy in the Debates upon this Kind of Bills. Some of the Clergy had heard that it was the Opinion of the Speaker, declared during theſe Debates, that if
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009612_0025_0F76F61EB12348E0"/>ſuch Bills were to paſs into Acts of Aſſembly they could not be deemed Laws. And as the Opinion of the Speaker in the one Caſe was ſufficient to deter the few Clergy on the Spot from troubling the Houſe with a Petition in Form that was certain to be rejected, ſo the Opinion of the Speaker in the other Point was no ſmall Encouragement to the Clergy to ſeek a Remedy elſewhere. From hence the Colonel may collect that there are ſome that in their <hi>Hearts</hi> think in the ſame Manner of Twopenny Acts as the Clergy do, whom he will not dare to number with <hi>ſhallow Brains</hi> and <hi>Grinners.</hi> And what then becomes of his fine Account of the Aſſembly, in comparing them to a Pack of Hounds, and calling a ſmall Minority the <hi>babbling Dogs,</hi> when it is evident that it may be the Lot of the ableſt and moſt ſenſible Men in the Houſe to figure ſometimes among a ſmall Minority! Nay, if I miſtake not, it has before now been the Turn of this leading Member, the Colonel himſelf, to act what <hi>he</hi> calls the <hi>babbling Dog</hi> and <hi>the angry Man in the Lobby.</hi>

                  <p>He takes Notice of the Diſtinction I made between Loyalty to the Perſon of the Sovereign, and Attachment to the Power of the Crown; and recommends it to the King to have an implicit Faith in the Obedience of his Subjects, in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to well known Facts. For I do not yet diſcern how the Loyalty of the People of <hi>Virginia</hi> in 1745 will prove that the Aſſembly did not make free with the Prerogative in 1758, and ſeveral Times before, any more than the Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Colonel's Houſe for the Defeat of the Rebels by his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Cumberland</hi> will prove that the Lawyer mentioned above did not a few Months ſince charge the late King with having <hi>forfeited the Allegiance of the People of</hi> Virginia.</p>

                  <p>He affectedly laments a Piece of ordinary Juſtice to the Merchants as a heavy Misfortune to his Country, but comforts himſelf under the Thoughts that he is too old to live long and ſee many ſuch ſevere Strokes upon his Country.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have endeavoured to unravel the Colonel's new Web. I have paſſed once through the fiery Ordeal prepared for me by him, with what Safety or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs muſt be left to the Reader's Judgment; for it would be an Inſtance of the moſt unpardonable Vanity in me to boaſt of conquering ſuch doughty Writers
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009612_0026_0F76F61F78305E70"/>as the Colonels, who fetch their Water from the <hi>clear Fountain of Truth,</hi> deal in nothing but <hi>Demonſtrations,</hi> and fail not to celebrate their own Victories, though they have Moderation and Generoſity enough to leave the Field in Poſſeſſion of the Vanquiſhed.

Before he entered upon the Juſtification of the Twopenny Act he ſhould have ſettled with himſelf ſome ſuch trifling Points as the following: What is the certain Meaning of the <hi>Country,</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> Country, the <hi>Aſſembly, Demonſtration, Neceſſity,</hi> and every complex Term that he uſes; without which he will never make an able Diſputant. Whether the <hi>whole</hi> Country be <hi>poor;</hi> or it conſiſts, like other Countries, of <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Rich.</hi> Whether thoſe who have large <hi>viſible Eſtates,</hi> or thoſe who having none depend upon the Pariſh for a Maintenance, are the <hi>pooreſt.</hi> Whether the <hi>Poor can</hi> be diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Rich,</hi> or <hi>cannot.</hi> What the Twopenny Act was framed for; whether it was to relieve <hi>Thouſands</hi> of poor People from their Poverty, or was relative to <hi>no</hi> particular Kind of Charity <hi>whatever.</hi> Whether it was only to direct in the Diſpoſal of an <hi>Overplus.</hi> Or only <hi>remedial</hi> with Reſpect to the <hi>Exorbitancy</hi> of the <hi>few.</hi> Or only to ſhow that the Property of the <hi>few</hi> is not to be held more ſacred than that of the <hi>many.</hi> Or for ſome <hi>publick Utility,</hi> opening Streets, building Bridges, and the like. Or only to <hi>help</hi> the Clergy to their Dues. Or to make the <hi>King</hi> a Compliment. What Difference there is between Diſtreſs occaſioned by the <hi>Scarcity</hi> of a Crop in <hi>particular Places</hi> and Diſtreſs occaſioned by the <hi>Unevenneſs of the Crop.</hi> Above all, whether <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice</hi> can ever ſet their Horſes together. And whether the Poor ought to be <hi>compelled</hi> to relieve the <hi>Cravings</hi> of the Rich, or the Rich <hi>begged</hi> and <hi>intreated</hi> to <hi>do Juſtice</hi> to the Poor, and conſider their <hi>Neceſſities.</hi> Whether the Laws of the Country, which he ſays (Page 26th) provide a good Remedy againſt the Collectors for <hi>not paying</hi> the Miniſters <hi>in Time,</hi> have not alſo provided as a good Remedy againſt them for <hi>defective Payment</hi> in Point <hi>of Value;</hi> and whether there is any more Harm in making Uſe of the one Remedy than the other, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> To aim at defending the Act upon various and irreconcileable Plans is an Attempt worthy of its Author, it is true; yet I deſire no better Proof of an Adverſary's having undertaken a Poſt, which he is unable to maintain, than
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009612_0027_0F76F620315B5488"/>to ſee him entangled, ſtruggling, ſweating, ſwelling, raging, and roaring, in the Not of ſuch unconquerable Embarraſſment.</p>
                  <p>I cannot help taking Notice of two of the Colonel's grave Paſſages: One, wherein he puts me in Mind of the <hi>laſt Day</hi> of Accounts: The other, wherein he tells me that I have the Pattern of One to walk by, who when he was <hi>reviled, reviled not again.</hi> With Reſpect to the firſt, it is my Comfort that I am not to be judged by the Colonel. With Regard to the ſecond, the Colonel tells us News indeed; namely, that my Conduct will not bear to be compared with Perfection itſelf. Neither his nor mine, nor that of any of our Acquaintance, I conceive, will ſtand this Teſt. It is the Duty of us all to labour a nearer Approach to this Standard the longer we live, which by <hi>me</hi> (I gueſs the Colonel will agree to it) may be done eaſily enough. But this learned Textuary ſhould have remembered that the divine Perſon of whom he ſpeaks uſed a conſiderable Degree of Severity on fit Occaſions; that he adviſed the Payment of the <hi>Tithes of Mint, Aniſe, and Cummin,</hi> when agreeable to the Laws and <hi>Stipulations</hi> of the Country; that he adviſed to give <hi>Caeſar</hi> his Due; and even literally ſcourged the Money-Changers out of the Temple; that by his Doctrine the Performance of the greater Works cannot excuſe the Omiſſion of the leſſer, much leſs will a ſingle Act of Charity, much and frequently <hi>vaunted,</hi> give any Man a Licenſe to be <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>oppreſſive</hi> in other Inſtances; that there are Seaſons when it may become a Clergyman's Duty to <hi>reprove</hi> and <hi>rebuke,</hi> however diſagreeable theſe Words may found; and that ſuch a One is not always at Liberty to uſe that profitable Suppleneſs, and thoſe beneficial rewarded fawning Ways, with which the Colonel may like to ſomething <hi>about throwing the firſt Stone;</hi> and perhaps, when he is calm, he will be able to ſee that at the worſt the <hi>Reviler again</hi> is ſomething nearer the divine Standard than the <hi>original Reviler.</hi> Upon the Whole, the Queſtions on this Head, ſo far as they concern me, are Whether I have found improper Objects of Reproof in the Colonels? Whether my Reproofs have been too ſharp, and carried to Exceſs, againſt the Oppoſers of ſuch publick Bleſſings as a free <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subject, who underſtands his Situation, will always value himſelf upon; ſuch as the King's Authority, the Eſtabliſhment of the Church, the Rights of fair Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009612_0028_0F76F62148EC5CE0"/>civil Liberty, private Juſtice and Property? Or whether, in the Colonel's ſofter Language, when he gently touches upon his own diſreſpectful Behaviour to a <hi>Peer of the Realm,</hi> I have ſhown too much <hi>Spirit</hi> or too much <hi>Mirth</hi> in my <hi>Replications?</hi> Obſerve the Colonel's Way of reaſoning, fairly deduced from his Averſion to be evil-ſpoken of, and from his Love of Evil-ſpeaking. The Parſon has a Maſter to follow, who when he was reviled reviled not again: The Colonel has no ſuch Maſter. The Parſon may not be contentious, fight, or return any provoking Language: The Colonel is at Liberty in all theſe Points to uſe his Pleaſure. The Colonel therefore may trample upon the Parſon, and treat him as he thinks proper. Such are the Sentiments of — <hi>a Gentleman</hi> in every Thing but his Language, Notions, and Manners; but the Gentleman may learn, from what has happened, not to place too much Security upon ſuch Notions for the future.</p>
                  <p>I thought to have ended here, but I muſt not take my Leave, though only for the preſent, without having a <hi>Heat</hi> at the Pig. He ſeems offended at the Pig's ſqueaking <hi>twice,</hi> inſtead of ſelicitating himſelf, as he had good Reaſon for doing, upon its ſqueaking <hi>no oftener.</hi> When a Gentleman of <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Mirth,</hi> like the Colonel, has a Mind to carry off his Neighbour's Pig by Way of a Frolick, if it be too roughly handled, it will <hi>ſqueak.</hi> It is the Nature of the Beaſt, when it thinks itſelf in Danger of being killed and devoured, to make a piteous, grating, and inceſſant Noiſe. What is to be done in ſuch Circumſtances? Suppoſe the Colonel teach the Pig <hi>better Manners,</hi> as in a former Piece he profeſſed the Art of <hi>teaching better Manners</hi> to <hi>perverſe Cows.</hi> If his Art does not extend ſo far as to teach better Manners to unruly Pigs, and he aſks my Advice in this <hi>weighty Punctum,</hi> it follows thus: Let the troubleſome Pig go! Return it to the right Owner for Shame! eſpecially if the Owner be ſo <hi>poor</hi> as to ſet a Value upon ſuch a Trifle. But if your longing for the Pig be ſo very great that you muſt ſteal the Pig to cure the ſaid Longing, as ſome Folks ſteal Beef to cure Warts, why then obſerve what I ſay: Hold the Pig faſt by the Tail, letting its Body ſwing thereby; which, I have good Authority for it, is not <hi>only remedial,</hi> but a ſovereign Remedy to cure the Pig of <hi>ſqueaking.</hi> Take then the Pig by the Tail, as you did the Line which I am now going to handle: <hi>Sus atque Sacerdos,</hi> ſays the witty <hi>mutilating</hi> and <hi>ſuppreſſing</hi> Colonel. For why not go one Word further? What
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009612_0029_0F76F621AEDD7F60"/>has <hi>honeſt Fur</hi> done, that he muſt be excluded from the Society of his old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions <hi>Sus atque Sacerdos?</hi> The whole Line in <hi>Lilly</hi> runs thus:
<q>Ut Bifrons, Cuſtos, Bos, Fur, Sus, atque Sacerdos.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which a Boy in his Grammar, under the Care of a Friend of mine, conſtrues backwards, for the Uſe of the Colonel, thus: <hi>Sacerdos,</hi> a Parſon; <hi>atque,</hi> and; <hi>Sus,</hi> a Tithe-Pig; <hi>Fur,</hi> a Colonel who merrily ſteals the Tithe-Pig, leaving Twopence behind him to keep the Parſon from making a Noiſe; <hi>Bos,</hi> the Colonel that roars like an Ox, Bull, or Cow, when he finds <hi>himſelf detected,</hi> and the Parſon unſatisfied; <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> the Colonel that will keep Poſſeſſion of the Pig right or wrong; <hi>Bifrons,</hi> the Colonel with a double Forehead, who will ſteal the Pig under Colour of Charity, and calls it Juſtice to ſteal the Pig; <hi>ut,</hi> as; as what? Why, as the Colonel ſays, <hi>Sauce for a Gooſe is Sauce for a Gander,</hi> and may ſometimes ſerve well enough as Sauce for a Pig.</p>
                  <p>As to Miſrepreſentation, Scurrility, Vanity, Petulancy, Reſtleſſneſs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, Contempt of Authority, Art, Blindneſs, Inſanity, Wit and Ridicule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which the Colonel condemns in the Enemy, and takes, or endeavours to preſs, into his own Service, theſe Things may furniſh Matter enough for the ſecond Part of this Review; wherein I hope to ſhow that this is not the firſt Time that the Colonel has ſat for his Picture, drawn it himſelf, and <hi>archly,</hi> as well as ſatyrically, put under it the Name of his Opponent; or that he has acted the ſat Man, who bitterly inveighed againſt that filthy Crowd to which he himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed more than any other greaſy and broiling Member of the Concourſe.</p>
