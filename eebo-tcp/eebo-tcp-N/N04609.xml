            <title>An address to the inhabitants of North-Carolina; occasioned by the difficult circumstances the government seems to labour under, for want of a medium, or something to answer in lieu of money; for the encouragement of the people, in regard to business: : to which is added, a proposition for a paper-currency, whereby the possessors of the soil may, in a very honourable manner, and with cheerful hearts, discharge their quit-rents and publick taxes: and whereby, also, new life may be given to trade and commerce, so far as is necessary; which will be a natural inducement to the fair trader to settle and reside in the government, as well as the only means to propagate navigation (that necessary branch of business) in all its proper parts.</title>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The one, perhaps, in his Streights, sells a Plantation, and another a Yoke of Oxen, the Third a breeding Mare or Cow, under a Notion of getting those Bills of Credit; which Manner of trafficking and trifling away their Time, neither adds to their Lands, nor increases their Cattle, nor cultivates the Earth; the Consequence of which is, that what the one gets, the other must loose: And by thus neglecting their proper Business, their Houshold comes to Poverty and Shame.</p>
            <p>But the other Housholder, wisely considering, that Food and Raiment were all that they wanted to support this Life, and inasmuch as Bills of Credit had no intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick Value in themselves, and, of Consequence, would be of no Service, except they were made to answer in lieu of Money, to make an even Ballance between Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Neighbour, for proper Utensils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to encourage Industry, whereby to procure Necessaries of Life; he therefore, neither obliged them, nor yet encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged them, to pursue those Bills of Credit, (as pursuing Birds in the Air) neither did he make those Bills their Mark or Center, which, when caught, afforded them neither Food nor Feathers; but wisely made the Necessaries of Life their Mark, and Gold and Silver their Center; obliging them to bring in the said Necessaries of Life, at their just Value, whereby the Houshold were plentifully and cheerfully fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the Comforts of Life, and all were encouraged together.</p>
            <p>Well, if this be a proper Comparison, that conveys any Idea, is it not Time then to consider well of what is already written, together with the Tendency of it? and also of the great and mighty Handy-works of the Creation, which are evident to our View, and may teach to any People Knowledge? It is evidently seen that all Sorts of Creatures, of what Kind soever, have, in some Sort, a Scrabble in the World to live and support their Species; some Beasts, in the Wilderness, feed upon Grass, and other Herbs, and some upon other Fruits of the Earth; the Catterpiller spins her Webb on the Oak or Apple Tree, and depends for Food on the Leaves thereof, which come by Nature, (without any Cultivation or Propagation of their

               </gap>; some Sort of Birds find Use for Hair and Feathers, to build their Nests, others make Use of Sticks; the fishing Hawk is diligent (after her Kind) to get Fish for the Support of hers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In a peculiar Manner, we may behold the industrious Bees; it may be observed of them, that so soon as they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uietly hived and got settled, and not confused in their own Government, they immediately set to work with Courage, and gather their Wax, and draw Honey from almost all Sorts of Flowers: We may obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rve also the Toad, which is an Annimal that often lies partly hid under Ground, whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Food is Worms, Flies, and Fleas; notwitstanding which, at Times, they will hop round those Hives of Bees, and when they find them engaged in their Wax and Honey, they are so avaricious and hungry after them, (whether by Instinct or ill Habit I leave) that without any Thought how, or wherewith they shall be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported for the future, they make those industrious Bees their Prey; and those Bees, with their Honey in their Bowels, (when eaten by them) altho' extracted from spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Flowers, yet it's the Nature of that under-ground Animal to convert it to Poison, yea, of a poisonous Quality to all those who suffer their Hands to partake thereof or their Heads to be infused with it: And it is even further worth our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, that when diligent Bees multiply and swarm, the young Swarms, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incline to assume to themselves their native Manner and Form of Government; notwithstanding which, many of them (through Loss of their native Guide or Want of proper Aid) get shatter'd, confused, and become useless in the Creation, even unworthy of Notice, although surrounded with rich and spacious Flowers: How apt are such ill-governed, shattered, and confused Swarms (for want of regular Guides to lead them in a native and free Manner) to grow lazy, contentious and quarrelsome? In and amongst such Swarms, Strife is often created, (no doubt with some seeming, though rude, Authority) whereby they are prompted, in an angry Humour, to sting, poison, and kill each other, to the total Destruction and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of themselves, even in their own Hives. Now, were it given to those Bees (which are created innocent in their own Nature) to conceive and see clearly, that the Reason of their lazy, indolent, contentious, and quarrelsome State, was owing to a poisonous Disposition in their unnatural Guides, by which they have suffered th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But Mankind (the most noble of all in the Creation) seeing the Weakness and Frailty of all those Creatures, it may be reasonably thought and expected of and from them, That they will act upon more rational Principles, in getting the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of Life, and supporting their Specie in the World, than either the dumb Beasts of the Field, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In order that it may be so, I am willing (if it may be so received) to cast in a Mite, in some proper Structure or Building, furnished with all necessary Proposals, founded upon Reason, that may invite the Governor, Council, and House of Burgesses to view it; tending strictly to the mutual Benefit and Welfare of the Province of <hi>North-Carolina</hi>; having due regard to the King's Honour and Interest therein, which consists in the Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hath it not been for themselves? Is it not evident, that they borrow the Money of themselves? Do they not set themselves up in the World upon their own Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even upon the Value and Credit of their Lands; and by one Consent have improved those Bills to their own Advantage, without Use or any other significant Incumbrance, saving only the Charge of making them; which is paid also out of the same Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus, the Author is of Opinion, It may be clearly seen, that the Province of <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> from its miserable State of Poverty, (saving the solid Soil, which is immoveable) may not only provide itself with a credible <hi>Medium,</hi> to stand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Hence may also be seen, on due Consideration, That the Streams formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which are running out on every Hand, to the impoverishing both Publick and Private, may, by this Scheme, (if honestly pursued and improved) be turned and brought home, proportionably, to every of our Doors; whereby the Welfare of the Country may be credibly recovered, to the Honour of the King, and to the common Comfort of all the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>And further to evince, That such a Scheme, improved in such a Manner, would have such a Tendency; the following explanatory Accounts are formed, under a Supposition, that a Hundred Thousand Pounds were granted, by Act of Assembly, as aforementioned; and that Ten Thousand Pounds, of the same, were alotted as a proportionable <hi>Quota,</hi> to be negociated by an Agent or Trustee in <hi>Craven</hi> County, for the Account, common Benefit, and Use of the Province of <hi>North-Carolina</hi>; and the Formation of the aforementioned Accounts is introduced by an Account

Will it not evidently appear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that such Opposition must be owing to either Prejudice, Ignorance, or some selfish Views? How can it be construed otherwise? I would therefore offer a Proposition to the Governor, Council, and House of Burgesses, for their Perusal and Consideration:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:005726_0028_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>Firstly,</hi> I would propose, That an Agent or Trustee be appointed (by a Majority of Votes) in each County, to provide suitable Store-houses for Merchandize.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Each Tithable to bring in (annually) for a Term of Years, such a Part of the Produce of his Labour, as you may, discr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let the Agent or Trustee afore-mentioned, for each County, be autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to receive the Produce, aforesaid, from each Tithable, in such as shall be good and merch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let these Agents or Trustees be so qualified and furnished with Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, That (as they receive those annual Tithables, in Country Produce, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) they have Orders to exchange or barter the same away, to and with any Ship Masters and Merchant Traders, as shall or may import suitable Goods and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize into the Government, always observing, duly, to contract with said Ship Masters and Merchant Traders, that such a Proportion of the Pay, for the said Country Produce, as you may think proper, be in Silver and Gold, and the other in Goods and Merchandize by Wholesale, agreeable as it is purchased in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments afore-named, for the Account and Benefit of the Publick, even such Goods and Merchandize as may be adjudged the most suitable for the Use and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Inhabitants; and when the said Goods and Merchandize are so pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by the Agents or Trustees, that they be impowered further to deliver to every of the Inhabitants (in Proportion to their Tithables) the said Goods and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, at prime Cost, as purchased by the Agents or Trustees aforesaid, as also their Proportions of Silver and Gold; reserving only a certain <hi>Quota</hi> or Proportion, for defraying the Charges of Commissions of Porter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>By thus negociating Trade and Commerce, in a publick Manner in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for a certain Term of Years, I humbly conceive, that by a reasonable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation it will appear, that fifty Pounds, then, will be f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
