            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DISQUISITION Concerning Ecclesiastical Councils.</head>
            <p>AN <hi>Ecclesiastical Council,</hi> or <hi>Synod,</hi> is a Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of duly qualified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, called to Consult, and judge about Affairs, in which Churches, one or more are concerned. There have been great Disputes on that Question, <hi>Who has Power to Convoke a Synod?</hi> Whether it belongs to Magistrates, or to Pastors. I shall not insist upon that Enquiry, only say, that if we keep to Scripture, Churches have this Power Belonging to them. There have likewise been some who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried <hi>all Ecclesiastical Councils</hi> as useless,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001836_0023_0FB9163881C2A730"/>
nay, pernicious; and as having always done hurt to the Interest of Religion. <hi>Nazianzen'</hi>s <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

               </note> Expressions Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, are famously known. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> Charges <hi>Luther</hi> with being of that Opinion, but he wrongs him. If <hi>Luther</hi> was against all Councils, why does <hi>Bellarmine</hi> complain of his being <hi>President</hi> of a Council, Convened at <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> in the Year 1536. in which there were (as he says) <hi>Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pastors.</hi> I know not of one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Writer of any Fame, that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes all <hi>Synods, Grotius</hi> only Excepted: It cannot be denied, but that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of Ecclesiastical <hi>Convocations,</hi> have done more against the Truth then for it, as any man that Consults <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted'</hi>s Chronology of Councils, will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily perceive. But this has proceeded not from the nature of Councils, but from the faultiness of the Persons, of whom they were Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001836_0024_0FB9163AB244F908"/>
ought not to prejudice Men against Magistracy, and Ministry, and Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. The same is to be affirmed of Synods, of which also there have been more than a few that have been blessed for the Suppression of Errors, and Establishment of the Churches in the Truth. Several Particular and Provincial Synods have given a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Testimony against Errors, both in Judgment and Practice.

The Church in <hi>Antioch,</hi> and that at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Apostles, Convened in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Consulting on a Question, which was of common Concernment to them.

            </p>
            <p>The Affirmative I can in no wise Concur with.

            <p n="1">1. In the Synod at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (the first and only Council of Churches mentioned in the Scripture) The Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, but Brethren acted in that Council; and that Brethren, and not Pastors only should be sent to Synods, it acknowledged by us all. It has been disputed between <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> whether the Brethren, or Pastors only have a definitive Suffrage in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods. <hi>Papists</hi> are for Pastors only, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001836_0030_0FB9164758A3D4B0"/>
so are our <hi>Prelatical</hi> Writers; one of them lately giveth it for the definition of a Synod, <hi>That it is an Assembly of the Hierarchical Order in Consult for the Conduct of the Churches.</hi> But our most Eminent Protestant Divines maintain, that Ruling Elders and Brethren have equally a definitive Voice with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and this they prove, because it was so in the Synod at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> they argue strongly; Why was the Cause brought to the Brethren, and not to the Pastors only if they had not power to judge and to determine concerning the Question before them?

Here we must Crave Leave to Dissent from our Master. So if Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> has happened to drop a Notion, which does not well Suit with <hi>Congregational Principles,</hi> which we take to be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripture, we are not bound to write after him. If the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Men were to decide the Question, there is as much reason to submit to Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> as to any Man; who says, that others besides Pastors may have <hi>Authority</hi> in Ecclesiastical Councils, which is contrary to saying Pastors <hi>only</hi> have Authority. 2. Let his words be taken in a right sense, and I shall say as my Venerable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cotton</hi> does.

Judgment concerning it, as that which is not only lawful, but absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Establishment of these Churches. The Light of natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as well as Scripture, teaches Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Common with other Societies, to <hi>Associate</hi> and Combine for their Common Safety.
