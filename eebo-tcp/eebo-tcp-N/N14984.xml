            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The WAY to Wealth, AND A PLAN by which every MAN MAY PAY HIS TAXES.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>COURTEOUS READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE heard that nothing gives an author ſo great pleaſure as to find his works reſpectfully quoted by others. Judge, then, how much I muſt have been gratified by an incident I am going to relate to you. I ſtopped my horſe lately, where a great number of people were collected at an auction of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants goods. The hour of ſale not being come, they were converſing on the badneſs of the times, and one of the company called to a plain clean Old Man, with white locks,—<q>Pray, <hi>Father Abraham,</hi> what think you of the times? Will not theſe heavy taxes quite ruin the country? How ſhall we be ever able to pay them? What would you adviſe us to?</q> Father Abraham ſtood up, and replied, <q>If you would have my advice, I will give it you in ſhort, "for a word to the wiſe is enough," as <hi>Poor Richard</hi> ſays.</q> They joined in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to ſpeak his mind, and gathering round him, he proceeded as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <q>FRIEND, ſays he, the taxes are indeed very heavy; and if thoſe laid on by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment were the only ones we had to pay, we might more eaſily diſcharge them; but we have many others, and much more griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſome of us. We are taxed twice as much by our idleneſs, three times as much by our pride, and four times as much by our folly; and from theſe taxes the commiſſioners cannot eaſe or deliver us, by allowing an abatement. However, let us hearken to good advice, and ſomething may be done for us; "God helps them that help themſelves," as Poor Richard ſays.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <q>It would be thought a hard government that ſhould tax its people one tenth part of their time, to be employed in its ſervice: but idleneſs taxes many of us much more; ſloth, by bringing on diſeaſes, abſolutely ſhortens life. <q>Sloth, like ruſt, conſumes faſter than labour wears, while the uſed key is always bright,</q> as Poor Richard ſays.— <q>But doſt thou love life, then do not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> time, for that is the ſtuff life is made of,</q> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> is neceſſary do we ſpend in ſleep; forgetting that <q>The ſleeping fox catches no poultry, and that there will be ſleeping enough in the grave,</q> as Poor Richard ſays.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If time be of all things the moſt precious, waſting time muſt be,</q> as Poor Richard ſays, "the greateſt prodigality," ſince, as he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where tells us, <q>Loſt time is never found again; and what we call time enough, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways proves little enough:</q> Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the purpoſe; for by diligence we ſhall do more with leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity. <q>Sloth makes all things difficult, but induſtry all eaſy; and, he that riſeth late, muſt trot all day, and ſhall ſcarce overtake his buſineſs at night; while lazineſs travels ſo ſlowly, that poverty ſoon overtakes him. Drive thy buſineſs, let not that drive thee; and early to bed, and early to riſe, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wiſe,</q> as Poor Richard ſays.</p>
            <p>
               <q>So what ſignifies wiſhing and hoping for better times? We may make theſe times better, if we beſtir ourſelves. <q>Induſtry need not wiſh, and he that lives upon hope will die faſting. There are no gains with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pains; then help hands, for I have no lands,</q> or, if I have, they are ſmartly taxed. <q>He that hath a trade, hath an eſtate; and he that hath a calling, hath an office of profit and honour,</q> as Poor Richard ſays; but then the trade muſt be worked at, and the calling well followed, or neither the eſtate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes. If we are induſtrious we ſhall never ſtarve; for, <q>at the working man's houſe hunger looks in, but dares not enter.</q> Nor will the bailiff or the conſtable enter, for, <q>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry pays debts, while deſpair encreaſeth them.</q> What though you have found no treaſure, nor has any rich relation left you a legacy, <q>Diligence is the mother of good luck, and God gives all things to induſtry. Then plow deep, while ſluggards ſleep, and you ſhall have corn to ſell and to keep.</q> Work while it is called to-day, for you know not how much you may be hindered to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. <q>One to-day is worth two to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,</q> as Poor Richard ſays; and farther, <q>Never leave that till to-morrow, which you can do to-day.</q>—If you were a ſervant, would you not be aſhamed that a good maſter ſhould catch you idle? Are you then your own maſter? Be aſhamed to catch yourſelf idle, when there is ſo much to be done for yourſelf, your family, and your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.—Handle your tools without mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens; remember, that <q>The cat in gloves catches no mice,</q> as Poor Richard ſays. It is true, there is much to be done, and, perhaps, you are weak handed; but ſtick to it ſteadily, and you will ſee great effects; for <q>Conſtant dropping wears away ſtones; and by diligence and patience the mouſe ate in two the cable; and little ſtrokes fell great oaks.</q>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Methinks I hear ſome of you ſay, "Muſt a man afford himſelf no leiſure?" I will tell thee, my friend, what Poor Richard ſays; <q>Employ thy time well, if thou meaneſt to gain leiſure, and, ſince thou art not ſure of a minute, throw not away an hour.</q> 
                  <hi>Leiſure</hi> is time for doing ſomething uſeful; this lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the diligent man will obtain, but the lazy man never; for, <q>A life of leiſure, and a life of lazineſs are two things. Many, without labour, would live by their wits only, but they break for want of ſtock;</q> whereas induſtry gives comfort, and plenty, and reſpect. <q>Fly pleaſures, and they will follow you. The diligent ſpinner has a large ſhift; and now I have a ſheep and a cow, every body bids me good-morrow.</q>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <q>But with our induſtry we muſt likewiſe be ſteady, ſettled, and careful, and overſee our own affairs with our own eyes, and not truſt too much to others; for as Poor Richard ſays,
<q>
                     <l>"I never ſaw an oft removed tree,</l>
                     <l>"Nor yet an oft removed family,</l>
                     <l>"That throve ſo well as thoſe that ſettled be."</l>
                  </q>
And again, <q>Three removes is as bad as a fire,</q> and again, <q>Keep thy ſhop, and thy ſhop will keep thee;</q> and again, <q>If you would have your buſineſs done, go; if not; ſend.</q> And again,
<q>
                     <l>"He that by the plough would thrive,</l>
                     <l>
                        <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 line">
                           <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </l>
                  </q>
And again, <q>The eye of a maſter will do more work than both his hands;</q> and again, <q>Want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge;</q> and again, <q>Not to overſee workmen, is to leave them your purſe open; truſting too much to others care is the ruin of many;</q> for, <q>In the affairs of this world, men are ſaved, not by faith, but by the want of it:</q> But a man's <hi>own</hi> care is profitable; for, <q>If you would have a faithful ſervant, and one that you like, ſerve yourſelf. A little neglect may breed great miſchief; for want of a nail the ſhoe was loſt; for want of a ſhoe the horſe was loſt; and for want of a horſe the rider was loſt,</q> being overtaken and ſlain by the enemy; all for want of a little care about a horſe-ſhoe nail.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <q>So much for induſtry, my friends, and attention to one's own buſineſs; but to theſe we muſt add frugality, if we would make our induſtry more certainly ſucceſsful. A man may, if he knows not how to ſave as he gets, <q>keep his noſe all his life to the grindſtone, and die not worth a groat at laſt. A fat kitchen makes a lean will;</q> and
<q>
                     <l>"Many eſtates are ſpent in the getting,</l>
                     <l>"Since women for tea forſook ſpinning and knitting,</l>
                     <l>"And men for punch forſook hewing and ſplitting."</l>
                  </q>
                  <q>If you would be wealthy, think of ſaving, as well as of getting. The Indies have not made Spain rich, becauſe her outgoes are greater than her incomes.</q>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Away, then, with your expenſive follies, and you will not then have ſo much cauſe to complain of hard times, heavy taxes, and chargeable families; for
<q>
                     <l>"Women and wine, game and deceit,</l>
                     <l>"Make the wealth ſmall, and the want great."</l>
                  </q>
And farther, <q>What maintains one vice, would bring up two children.</q> You may think, perhaps, that a little tea, or a little punch now and then, diet a little more coſtly, cloaths a little finer, and a little entertainment now and then, can be no great matter; but remember, "Many a little makes a mickle." Beware of little expences; <q>A ſmall leak will ſink a great ſhip,</q> as Poor Richard ſays; and again, <q>Who dainties love, ſhall beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars prove;</q> and moreover, <q>Fools make feaſts, and wiſe men eat them.</q> Here you are all got together to this ſale of fineries and nick-nacks. You call them <hi>goods;</hi> but, if you do not take care, they will prove <hi>evils</hi> to ſome of you. You expect they will be ſold cheap, and, perhaps, they may for leſs than they coſt; but, if you have no occaſion for them, they muſt be dear to you. Remember what Poor Richard ſays, <q>Buy what thou haſt no need of, and ere long thou ſhalt ſell thy neceſſaries.</q> And again, <q>At a great pennyworth pauſe awhile.</q> He means, that perhaps the cheapneſs is apparent only, and not real; or the bargain, by ſtraitening thee in thy buſineſs, may do thee more harm than good. For in another place he ſays, <q>Many have been ruined by buying good penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths.</q> Again, <q>It is fooliſh to lay out money in a purchaſe of repentance;</q> and yet this folly is practiſed every day at auctions, for want of minding the Almanack. Many a one, for the ſake of finery on the back, has gone with a hungry belly, and half ſtarved their families; <q>Silks and ſattins, ſcarlets and velvets, put out the kitchen fire,</q> as Poor Richard ſays. Theſe are not the neceſſaries of life; they can ſcarcely be called the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies; and yet only becauſe they look pretty, how many want to have them? By theſe, and other extravagances, the genteel are reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow of thoſe whom they formerly deſpiſed, but who, through induſtry and frugality, have maintained their ſtanding; in which caſe it appears plainly that <q>A ploughman on his legs, is higher than a gentleman on his knees,</q> as Poor Richard ſays.— Perhaps they have had a ſmall eſtate left them, which they knew not the getting of; they think. "It is day, and will never be night;" that a little to be ſpent out of ſo much is not worth minding; but <q>Always taking out of the meal-tub, and never putting in, ſoon comes to the bottom,</q> as Poor Richard ſays; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> have known before, if they had often his advice: <q>If you would know the value of money, go and try to borrow ſome; for he that goes a borrowing goes a ſorrowing,</q> as Poor Richard ſays; and, indeed, ſo does he that lends to ſuch people, when he goes to get it in again. Poor Dick farther adviſes, and ſays,
<q>
                     <l>"Fond pride of dreſs is ſure a very curſe;</l>
                     <l>"Ere fancy you conſult, conſult your purſe."</l>
                  </q>
And again, <q>Pride is as loud a beggar as Want, and a great deal more ſaucy.</q> When you have bought one fine thing, you muſt buy ten more, that your appearance may be all of a-piece; but Poor Dick ſays, <q>It is eaſier to ſuppreſs the firſt deſire, than to ſatisfy all that follow it:</q> And it is as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich, as for the frog to ſwell, in order to equal the ox.
<q>
                     <l>"Veſſels large may venture more,</l>
                     <l>"But little boats ſhould keep near ſhore."</l>

"It is, however, a folly ſoon puniſhed:" for, as Poor Richard ſays, <q>Pride that dines on vanity ſups on contempt: Pride breakfaſted with plenty, dined with poverty, and ſupped with infamy.</q> And, after all, of what uſe is this pride of appearance, for which ſo much is riſked, ſo much is ſuffered? It cannot promote health, nor eaſe pain; it makes no increaſe of merit in the perſon, it creates en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, it haſtens misfortune.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But what madneſs muſt it be to <hi>run in debt</hi> for theſe ſuperſluities? We are offered, by the terms of this ſale, ſix months credit; and that, perhaps, has induced ſome of us to attend it, becauſe we cannot ſpare the ready money, and hope now to be fine without it. But ah! think what you do when you run in debt; you give to another power over your liberty. If you cannot pay at the time, you will be aſhamed to ſee your creditor; you will be in fear when you ſpeak to him; you will make poor, pitiful, ſneaking excuſes, and, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, come to loſe your veracity, and ſink into baſe downright lying; for <q>The <hi>ſecond</hi> vice is lying, the firſt is running in debt,</q> as Poor Richard ſays; and again to the ſame purpoſe, "Lying rides upon Debt's back:" whereas a free born American ought not to be aſhamed nor afraid to ſee or ſpeak to any man living. But poverty often deprives a man of all ſpirit and virtue.</q> 
               <q>It is hard for an empty bag to ſtand upright.</q> 
               <q>What would you think of that prince, or of that government, who ſhould iſſue an edict for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding you to dreſs like a gentleman or gentlewoman, on pain of impriſonment or ſervitude? Would you not ſay that you were free, have a right to dreſs as you pleaſe, and that ſuch an edict would be a breach of your privileges, and ſuch a government tyrannical? And yet you are about to put yourſelf under that tyranny when you run in debt for ſuch dreſs! Your creditor has authority, at his pleaſure, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive you of your liberty, by confining you in gaol for life, or by ſelling you for a ſervant, if you ſhould not be able to pay him. When you have got your bargain, you may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, think little of payment; but as Poor Richard ſays, <q>Creditors have better me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories than debtors; creditors are a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſect, great obſervers of ſet days and times.</q> The day comes round before you are aware, and the demand is made before you are prepared to ſatisfy it; or, if you bear your debt in mind, the term which at firſt ſeemed ſo long, will, at it leſſens, appear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſhort. Time will ſeem to have added wings to his heels as well as his ſhoulders. <q>Thoſe have a ſhort Lent who owe money to be paid at Eaſter.</q> At preſent, perhaps, you may think yourſelves in thriving circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and that you can bear a little extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance without injury: but
<q>
                     <l>"For age and want ſave while you may,</l>
                     <l>"No morning ſun laſts a whole day."</l>
                  </q>
Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but ever, while you live, expence is conſtant and certain; and, <q>It is eaſier to build two chimneys, than to keep one in fuel,</q> as Poor Richard ſays: So, <q>Rather go to bed ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perleſs than riſe in debt.</q>

            <p n="4">IV. <q>This doctrine, my friends; is reaſon and wiſdom: But, after all, do not depend too much upon your own induſtry and fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and prudence, though excellent things; for they may all be blaſted without the bleſſing of heaven; and, therefore, aſk that bleſſing humbly, and be not uncharitable to thoſe that at preſent ſeem to want it, but comfort and help them.

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And now, to conculde, <q>Experience keeps a dear ſchool, but fools will learn in no other,</q> as Poor Richard ſays, and ſcarce in that; for, it is true, <q>We may give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but we cannot give conduct:</q> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, remember this, <q>They that will not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            <p>Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. The people heard it, and approved the doctrine, and immediately practiſed the contrary, juſt as if it had been a common ſermon; for the auction opened, and they began to buy extravagantly—I found the good man had thoroughly ſtudied my Almanacks, and digeſted all I had dropt on theſe topics during the courſe of twenty-five years. The frequent mention he made of me muſt have tired any one elſe; but my vanity was wonderfully delighted with it, though I was conſcious, that not a tenth part of the wiſdom was my own, which he aſcribed to me; but rather the gleanings that I had made of the ſenſe of all ages and nations. However, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be the better for the echo of it; and, though I had at firſt determined to buy ſtuff for a new coat, I went away, reſolved to wear my old one a little longer. Reader, if thou wilt do the ſame, thy profit will be as great as mine. I am, as ever,</p>
