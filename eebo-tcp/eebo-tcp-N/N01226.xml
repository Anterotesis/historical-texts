            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Occaſion &amp; Intention of the <hi>ES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAY</hi> now before us, is to be declar'd.

            <p>And now, Your FAITH! You Read, Heb.

of your Anguiſh, Let your Cry be of that importance; Pſal. XXVI. 11. <hi>Oh! Redeem me, and be Merciful unto me.</hi> Or, Pſal. XXX. 10. <hi>Hear me, O Lord; Have Mercy upon me; Lord, Be thou my Helper.</hi> Your Omnipotent Redeemer, is One who <hi>Commands Deliverances,</hi> for them who <hi>Weep and Make Supplication;</hi> That is, He <hi>Commands</hi> His Good Angels, to bring and work <hi>Deliverances; Deliverances</hi> come as the Effects of His <hi>Commands</hi> unto His <hi>Miniſters.</hi> No <hi>Mid-wives</hi> can do, what the <hi>Angels</hi> can!</p>

            <p>One of the Firſt Things to be done, is to Give up your <hi>New-born Child</hi> unto the Lord, in His Holy <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> Thus reſcue the Child, from the <hi>Great Red Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> who is watching to Devour it.

Either of them, if it be a <hi>Perfect Child,</hi> brings ten Thouſand Mercies with it. And, if it may be a <hi>Child</hi> of God the Father, a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of God the Son, a <hi>Temple</hi> of God the Spirit, think, <hi>This is enough; Lord, I have

brought One of thy Children into the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a Declaration of this Intention in you, Send the Child abroad, unto the Congregation of the Faithful, where it ſhall be <hi>Waſhed,</hi> and <hi>Bleſſed</hi> in the Name of the Glorious One, and laid under E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting <hi>Bonds</hi> to be the Lords. But at the ſame time, Look on your ſelf as laid under <hi>Bonds,</hi> to bring up the Child for Him; and <hi>in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will <hi>Suckle your Infant your Self</hi> if you can; Be not ſuch an <hi>Oſtrich</hi> as to Decline it, meerly becauſe you would be One of the <hi>Careleſs Women, Living at Eaſe.</hi> Of ſuch we read, They are <hi>Dead while they Live.</hi> But if you have the Calamity of <hi>Dry Breaſts;</hi> or your Health will not permit you to <hi>Give Suck;</hi> Entertain it with Submiſſion to the will of God; but as a <hi>Calamity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally; Being well Recovered, you will Rejoyce in your Freſh Opportunities to Repair unto the Worſhip of God in His <hi>Congregations.</hi> Thither you will now Repair with ſuch Diſpoſitions as thoſe;
