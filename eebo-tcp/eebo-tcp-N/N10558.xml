            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S man was formed a ſociable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, capable of the delights and advantages of ſocial life; to be enjoyed in purſuing his own good, with that of others at the ſame time; conſequently, his happineſs in degree muſt conſiſt, in the exerciſe of thoſe ſocial virtues eſſential to his nature. And that theſe may be gratified, there muſt be opportunity had therefor. Which is obtained in ſome meaſure, by men's forming into ſociety and connections; each individual
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013382_0005_0F90576A8A7C6ED8"/>
becoming a member of the community; whereby, they may be mutually ſerviceable to each other; and promote the good of the whole collectively.—For the ſtrength of each member united, forms the ſtrength of the whole body: deſigned for general ſecurity and publick happineſs. And capacitates all, both rulers and ſubjects, to ſerve GOD and their generation, better than their condition would permit them to do, while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected individuals.</p>
            <p>THIS appears to be an obvious dictate of nature. For 'tis ſuppoſed that all, even the moſt ignorant and barbarous nations on earth, entirely deſtitute of the light of divine revelation, are under at leaſt, ſome general political rules of government. Nor can a people ſubſiſt in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity, with any tolerable ſafety without it. For 'tis obſerved, that a ſtate of mere anarchy, is a ſtate of perpetual war; where no ſecurity, or ſocial happineſs can be expected.</p>
            <p>VARIOUS are the forms of civil government, that have obtained in different countries, through ſucceſſive ages. 'Tis evidently the will of GOD, and agreeable to the nature of man, to form into ſocieties; not only of a religious, but likewiſe
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013382_0006_0F90576AA5203238"/>
of a political nature; for mutual good and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick benefit. But he has not been pleaſed to give us the particular form of it, to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually obſerved by all generations. This appears to be left among the diſcretionaries to the ſons of men. As all are born free, therefore antecedent to all combinations, no one has an inherent, independent, underived power and right of <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> over his neighbour.</p>
            <p>BUT in an unconnected ſtate of independent liberty, nothing forbids a people, by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent incorporating, and becoming a body politick, conſiſting of rulers and ſubjects; which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in the <hi>idea</hi> of civil government. And the ſubjects may give up of their rights, liberties and properties; and put all that power into the hands of the rulers, <hi>ſo far,</hi> as is neceſſary to anſwer the good ends of government: the publick ſafety and happineſs. And when this is done by free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and mutual compact, it becomes the moddle of government—the band of ſociety:—it limits the power of the rulers—ſecures the rights of the people—is the ſtandard of juſtice for rulers, and ſubjects—and the regulating meaſure of duty to both, mutually.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:013382_0007_0F90576B58BD1D58"/>THERE is (probably) no human form of government on earth, free of all poſſible inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies. And perhaps no one form can ſute the ſtate and genius of every nation (if of any one) at all times. Which probably is one reaſon of that multifarious government that obtains in the world of mankind.</p>
            <p>BUT, the <hi>Britiſh legiſlature,</hi> conſiſting of three branches; <hi>to check, moderate, and temper each other</hi>; it is imagined is preferable to any other, we have the knowledge of. GOD grant, the Britiſh conſtitution may long continue!—the juſt claims of the <hi>crown</hi> and <hi>ſubject,</hi> be mutually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and fully enjoyed: without which the good ends of government may not be looked for.</p>
            <p>WHEN men in free ſtates, (under the direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſpoſing providence of GOD) are, by the ſuffrages of electors, put into ſeats of power and government, (ſo far as it correſponds with the divine will,) GOD as it were ratifies it; whereby they become civil miniſters of GOD: and as ſuch are to be acknowledged, and treated by the ſubjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:013382_0008_0F90576C1FE63AB0"/>THUS the context: <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject unto the higher powers. For there is no power, but of GOD: the powers that be are ordained of GOD. Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of GOD.</hi> But leſt any ſhould be filled with unneceſſary apprehenſions from the civil ſword, St. Paul adds, <hi>wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame.</hi> For civil power, as an ordinance of GOD, was never deſigned to hurt the innocent; but to protect and defend them; as well as to puniſh offenders. For as in the text <hi>he</hi> (that is the civil magiſtrate) <hi>is the miniſter of GOD to thee for good.</hi> As this will be the effect and conſequenct of wiſe government, duly exerciſed, and chearfully ſubmitted to for conſceience ſake.</p>
            <p>THE words thus introduced, invite our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>to three things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. CIVIL rulers are an ordinance of GOD. —He is the miniſter of GOD.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE ſubject, concerning and over whom, civil government is to be exerciſed; <hi>i.e.</hi> the people under government. For he is the miniſter of GOD to thee.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:013382_0009_0F90576D705949F0"/>III. THE great, and primary end of government, (ſubordinate to GOD's glory) is the good of mankind, or the publick intereſt, He is the miniſter of GOD to thee for good.</p>
            <p>Of theſe in order.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>CIVIL rulers are an ordinance of GOD. —He is the miniſter of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To evidence which we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>FIRST,</p>
            <p>THAT it is apparently agreeable to the will of GOD, as his ordinance, evidently pointed out, and preſcribed in the ſacred oracles; that there ſhould be rulers and ſubjects, with expreſt duties enjoined upon rulers, by divine authority, to act in character, as civil miniſters of GOD. And I need not depart from the <hi>text,</hi> and context, fully to eſtabliſh the point in view. St. Paul expreſsly ſays, <hi>There is no power but of GOD:</hi> (i. e. no juſt power that GOD will ever own) <hi>the powers that he, are ordained of GOD. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore reſiſteth the power,</hi> (with which the civil magiſtrate is properly inveſted, and duly exerciſes), <hi>reſiſteth the ordinance of GOD. For
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013382_0010_0F90576DA17961B8"/>
he is the miniſter of GOD.</hi> For which reaſon, rebellion againſt juſt authority, properly exerciſed, is reſiſting an ordinance of GOD; and not of man only. The civil magistrate is a revenger in GOD's ſtead, <hi>to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</hi> For this he does, not in a private capacity, but as GOD's miniſter and ſervant. This chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is called by ſome, the politicks of St. Paul, ſuffici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tly confirms the truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. But as this point has often been largely diſcuſſed in this deſk, on a like occaſion, I ſhall but touch upon it: and proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY,</p>
            <p>THAT the directing and over-ruling provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of GOD, is ſpecially concerned, in the diſpoſal of civil power and authority; into the hands of individuals for publick uſe. This is ſo manifeſt a truth, that it cannot be denied; without denying GOD's government over his own world: to do which, is no better than ſaying there is no GOD. For there is <hi>no event</hi> can take place in the univerſe, unconnected with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, and diſpoſing providence of GOD.</p>
            <p>AND as it is the pleaſure of HEAVEN, that there ſhould be magiſtrates, to protect the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent—puniſh the guilty—and guard the peace of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013382_0011_0F90576E61155858"/>
ſociety; ſo there is evidently <hi>the hand of divine Providence,</hi> in directing to the particular perſons for rulers. Which ſeems to be more eſpecially concerned in this, than in many other matters. For the ſupreme Ruler himſelf, has been wont ſometimes, to intereſt himſelf, ſo far, as to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and appoint the individuals: as Saul, David, Solomon and others. Thus, he called Cyrus by name, at leaſt two hundred years before he was born, to rule over the Perſian empire; and to do ſignal ſervice for GOD, and his people. <hi>Thus ſaith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whoſe right-hand I have holden, to ſubdue nations before him: For Jacob my ſervant's ſake, and Iſrael mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſaiah xlv.1, 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>INDEED, the diſpoſing providence of GOD is evidently concerned in events, to men, the moſt contingent and fortuitous. As the wiſe man obſerves, <hi>The lot is caſt into the lap: but the whole diſpoſing thereof is of the LORD.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xvi.33.</note> With great truth and propriety then we may ſay, that the providential hand of the <hi>ſupreme Ruler</hi> of the world, is very ſpecially concerned in the diſpoſal of government over men: and that equally ſo, even in the moſt free elective ſtates. For GOD
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013382_0012_0F90576F6C8BCB18"/>
has the hearts of all men, as well as of kings, in his hand: and as the rivers of water, he turneth them whitherſoever he will.</p>
            <p>And to ſay,</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, Civil miniſters are an ordinance of GOD, in as much as it is by direction and aſſiſtance from GOD, they are enabled to act up to their character, in diſcharging the truſt repoſed in them. The divine ſyſtem of moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, holds forth much light and direction to civil rulers: and the more they conform to it, in heart and in life, the better will they anſwer to the appellation given them as <hi>Gods</hi>; and more effectually reach their character, as civil miniſters of GOD, for publick good to mankind.</p>
            <p>AND we find wiſdom itſelf, (or CHRIST) expreſsly ſays, <hi>Counſel is mine, and ſound wiſdom: I am underſtanding; I have ſtrength. By me kings reign, and princes decree juſtice. By me prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</hi>

            <p n="2">II. General propoſition, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:013382_0014_0F905771490BCBC0"/>THE ſubject, concerning and over whom, civil government is to be exerciſed: <hi>i. e.</hi> the people under government. He is the miniſter of GOD to <hi>THEE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is the next, and immediate object, that claims the attention of civil rulers. 'Tis expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the <hi>text</hi> by the word THEE; which altho' it be of the ſingular number, yet in this connexion it admits of a plural conſtruction. It means the ſubjects over whom civil miniſters of GOD are ſet.</p>
            <p>RULERS and ſubjects are correlates, in free elective ſtates (like this colony), they have a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary relation to, and mutual dependence on each other: Nor can it be otherwiſe in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, ſo long as that relation ſubſiſts.</p>
            <p>GOD never ordained magiſtracy, and by his diſpoſing providence advanced men to ſeats of dignity and authority over others, to have <hi>ſelf,</hi> and their own private intereſt, the grand object to aim at. Such a thought, would be a diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable reflection upon the wiſdom and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the <hi>ſupreme Ruler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NO one can pretend that civil government, as an ordinance of GOD, was ever deſigned to advance men to ſeats of dignity and rule, to plume themſelves with the gilded feathers of ſtate; in order to indulge ſloth—luxury—and avarice, at
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013382_0015_0F9057716AB26F68"/>
publick expence. Much leſs wantonly to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the power with which they are inveſted, in acting the tyrant. Nor yet, to improve fawning dependents and parricides, to oppreſs the ſubjects with unconſtitutional decrees, and unrighteous meaſures, which they will greedily execute, for a low title, and a piece of bread. <hi>Surely no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD's inſtitutions are all worthy of himſelf.</p>
            <p>CIVIL RULERS are to fix their eyes, and their hearts too, upon the intereſting concerns of their ſubjects; ſo far as they are found within the province of rulers. And if they looſe ſight of that object, they will miſs the mark; and fail of reaching the end of their inſtitution. For it muſt be remembred, that, rulers (as an ordinance of GOD,) are <hi>made for the people</hi>; and not people for the rulers. And they are by divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>to attend continually upon this very thing.</hi> And in return, a tribute of honour, love, fear, ſubjection and reward; in proportion to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their reſpective departments and ſervices, is their due from the ſubject. Thus ſays the Apoſtle to the Gentiles: <hi>Wherefore, ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake. For, for this cauſe, pay you tribute alſo: for they are GOD's miniſters, attending continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon this very thing. Render therefore to all

            <p>AND this turns our attention to the</p>
            <p n="3">III. GENERAL obſervation, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> great and primary end of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (next to the honour of GOD,) is the good of mankind; or the publick intereſt. For he is the miniſter of GOD to thee for <hi>GOOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS <hi>is the very end,</hi> for which the GOD of Heaven inſtituted the order. It is an expreſſion of <hi>divine benevolence</hi> to the children of men; whereby they are put into a capacity of acting agreeable to their ſocial nature; and thereby of promoting their own, and each others happineſs. And what lower end can render it expedient, or beneficial for men born free; to give up certain native rights to others, and ſubject themſelves to government; by incorporating into civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>SURELY no people, who have taſted the ſweets of liberty, and enjoyed the happineſs of freedom, would ever do it; but from a rational
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013382_0017_0F905777045B1108"/>
proſpect of benefit to the whole, and to each individual. <hi>Not to looſe, but with a ſpecial view to ſecure and perpetuate their perſonal liberties and properties, unmoleſted</hi>; as well as to enjoy the pleaſure of ſocial life, to be found in ſociety only.</p>
            <p>AND how <hi>this</hi> may be effected by the civil magiſtrate, comes now immediately under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p>AND this depends,</p>
            <p>FIRST, Upon civil rulers themſelves being <hi>good</hi>; fearers of GOD, and haters of covetouſneſs. —<hi>The GOD of Iſrael ſaid, the rock of Iſrael ſpake to me; he that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of GOD.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">II Sam. 23.3.</note> This qualification GOD himſelf requires in civil rulers; that they be men of ſtrict probity, vertue and religion; who pay a ſacred regard to the honour of GOD; by whom kings reign, and princes decree juſtice.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Chriſtian ſyſtem,</hi> (and that only) can fully inſtruct us in our duty: which conſiſts in the love, fear, and veneration of the DEITY. From this <hi>root,</hi> the moral and ſocial vertues ſpring, with univerſal benevolence to mankind. When civil rulers are influenced by this ſpirit, nothing can intimidate, nothing obſtruct them in their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013382_0018_0F905778D3300490"/>
progreſs. For he whoſe heart is warmed with <hi>divine love,</hi> or (in the emphatic language of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration) <hi>toucht with a coal from the holy altar,</hi> is above frowns or flatteries; and moves in an exalted ſphere, calm and unſhaken: uninfluenced with bribes, and ſuperior to oppoſition. <hi>Vice,</hi> tho' it has his ſcorn, yet has his pity too: for his charity, his benevolence, is univerſally extended to all. With this ſpirit there is a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful coalition of ſelf-love and benevolence: for both are gratified in promoting the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. When this is the governing temper in civil rulers, it will effectually induce them, to make the <hi>divine oracles</hi> the man of their counſel; and fetch their maxims of government from thence, where the <hi>beſt</hi> are to be found.</p>
            <p>WICKED rulers, who fear not the LORD; are a curſe to a people, over whom they are ſet. King David ſays, <hi>The wicked walk on every ſide, when the vileſt men are exalted.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm xii.8.</note> GOD has ſometimes given ſuch; but it was in anger, and in judgment; to puniſh the madneſs of the times, and chaſtiſe a rebellious people. As were ſome of the kings of Iſrael and Judah; who did evil in the ſight of the LORD, and cauſed the people to tranſgreſs. For it is an undoubted truth, that when corruption lies at, or near the fountain; it
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013382_0019_0F905778F0296438"/>
is much more dangerous and hurtful in its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences and effects, than when found in ſome remote ſtreams only.</p>
            <p>THUS, we find the impure ſtream, opened by Jeroboam the king of Iſrael, in eſtabliſhing idolatry, took a wide ſpread; and run to the end of that unhappy kingdom. Hence that ſtigma is fixt upon him by GOD himſelf; <hi>Jeroboam the ſon of Nebat, who made Iſrael to ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE might inſtance likewiſe in wicked Haman, that prime miniſter in the Perſian empire; who had ſo great aſcendency over the king his maſter, as to induce him to a compliance with, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of, his impolitic and deteſtable plan; for cruſhing, and extirpating all the Jews in the realm, by a general carnage: which would have been <hi>much</hi> to the king's damage. The unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and murderous edict, was ſealed with the royal ſignet, and forwarded with haſty diſpatch, to the remoteſt colonies in the empire: to be executed, within a preſcribed limited time. But GOD, in his good providence, by the wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Mordecai, and interceſſion of the queen; defeated the execrable deſign, of that corrupt miniſter; and brought him, through much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, to a condign puniſhment: for he ſought himſelf, and not the publick emolument.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:013382_0020_0F9057799F8F3940"/>BUT good rulers, are a publick bleſſing: and in a proper ſenſe may be called a gift of GOD:—a token of the divine favour to a people, over whom they are ſet. For ſuch have the good of their ſubjects at heart, and exerciſe their political wiſdom and underſtanding, to diſcern the ſigns of the times: and their judgment with prudence, in concerting the moſt ſalutary measures: together with ſtedfaſt and unſhaken fortitude, purſue them for the publick good: improving every favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opportunity, to promote the intereſt and happineſs of their ſubjects.</p>
            <p>WHEN civil miniſters keep their eye upon the proper object, and wiſely purſue the true end of government, diſcharging the duties of their reſpective departments; not with contracted ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh views, but with a ſpirit of true patriotiſm; a people under ſuch government, can hardly fail of being happy: except, by a perverſe and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful neglect, or vile abuſe, of what, in its own nature, if duly improved, would conduce to their real advantage.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY,</p>
            <p>THAT civil miniſters of GOD may reach the end of their appointment, (<hi>the publick good</hi>), it is neceſſary that they be zealous promoters of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013382_0021_0F90577B055F59D8"/>
religion; and ſteady upholders of the publick worſhip of GOD.</p>
            <p>AS religion is the higheſt glory of a people, and morality and vertue, neceſſary for the good of the ſtate; it is not aſide from the character of civil rulers, but the nobleſt branch of it; to be zealous promoters of vertue and the publick ſervice of GOD: as nurſing fathers to his church and people.</p>
            <p>KING David's heart was warmly engaged in this <hi>matter.</hi> What an extaſy was he in? <hi>Leaped for joy: yea danced with all his might,</hi> at the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the ark. And again he ſays, <hi>I was glad when they ſaid unto me, let us go into the houſe of the LORD.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>HEZEKIAH, from the moment he began to reign, expreſſed his zeal for the ſervice of GOD; <hi>he brought in the prieſts and levites to cleanſe the houſe of the LORD.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>AND good Joſiah reſtored the true worſhip of GOD; not only in Judah, but in the ten tribes alſo: <hi>he repaired the LORD's houſe, and ordered the book of the law to be read.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">II Chron. xxxiv. chap.</note>
            </p>
            <p>NO one, who allows religion to be beneficial to the ſtate, can heſitate a moment, whether it be conducive to the publick intereſt, and good of mankind; for civil rulers zealouſly to concern themſelves in promoting religion and vertue. And examples, eſpecially in high characters, ſeem to carry in them the force of commands; for they are, eagerly copied by thoſe in lower rank.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY,</p>
            <p>THAT civil miniſters of GOD may reach the end of their inſtitution, <hi>the good of mankind</hi>; 'tis requiſite that they enact ſuch laws, and form ſuch political regulations agreeable to the conſtitution of the community, as are found neceſſary for
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013382_0023_0F90577BECA32B78"/>
the ſafety, peace, and good order of the ſtate. For no community of any kind, however well formed, can exiſt in character; without laws and regulations ſuited to the ſtate, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the body: whereby, every wholſome member of ſociety, may find protection, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive benefit. For in a community wiſely formed, and duly provided with laws, and all needful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations for publick good; the weakeſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are ſecure as the ſtrongeſt; the poor as the rich; each having the ſtrength of the whole community, for his defence and ſafeguard. To provide which, is doubtleſs within the province of the legiſlature; and the nature and well-being of ſociety renders it neceſſary. And when this is done, and provided for by the legiſlative body; a good baſis is laid, for ſocial happineſs, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick advantage;—eſpecially, if to this there be added,</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY,</p>
            <p>A wiſe, able, and faithful adminiſtration.— Which conduces much to the publick emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, —the peace and happineſs of ſociety; and is abſolutely neceſſary, to anſwer the great and good ends of government. When adminiſtration or executive power, is lodged in the hands of diſcerning, wiſe, and underſtanding men; who
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013382_0024_0F90577CCD9E4078"/>
execute the truſt repoſed in them, with ſkill, fidelity, and unſhaken fortitude, in the impartial adminiſtration of juſtice; they become a terror to evil-doers: as well as defend the cauſe of the juſt. They act then in character. For they bear not the ſword in vain; but are ſervants, or miniſters of GOD for publick good. For when a ſpirit of <hi>mercy and truth, by which iniquity is purged,</hi>
               <note n="¶" place="bottom">Prov. xvi.6.</note> runs through all ranks and orders of men, in civil truſt and power, even down to the loweſt informing officer; it ſenſibly beats down the head of vice, and checks the abounding of iniquity. Tranſgreſſors will be afraid of the <hi>ſword</hi>; nor dare reſiſt the <hi>power.</hi> For there are doubtleſs many perſons, of a vicious diſſolute character; who do not ſubmit and obey for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, yet would do it for wrath.—But if a ſyſtem of the beſt laws be enacted and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, yet if treated with neglect, or undue exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them; the good ends of government cannot be obtained.</p>
            <p>'TIS therefore <hi>neceſſary</hi> that there be ſet thrones of judgment: and they who ſit thereon, be not only endowed with wiſdom &amp; underſtanding; but likewiſe <hi>deſpiſe the gain of oppreſſion, and ſhake their hands from holding of bribes:</hi> and thence admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter juſtice with an impartial hand; whence
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013382_0025_0F90577D61F0A110"/>
the ſubject has a conſtitutional right to look for it. <hi>For he is the miniſter of GOD to thee for good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HENCE ſaith the prophet Amos; <hi>let judgment run down as waters, and righteouſneſs as a mighty ſtream.</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Amos v.24.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THUS does the due adminiſtration of civil power, in the executive branch of it, diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and puniſh vice; and eſtabliſh righteouſneſs and truth: which conduceth much to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good.—No doubt, but king Jehoſhaphat viewed it in this light: who not only provided good laws, but looked well to the execution of them. <hi>He ſet judges in the land, throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city; and ſaid to the judges, take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherefore now, let the fear of the LORD be upon you, take heed and do it.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">II Chron. xix.5, 6, 7.</note> — A noble example this, <hi>worthy</hi> of imitation.</p>
            <p>And FIFTHLY,</p>
            <p>THAT civil rulers may reach the end of their inſtitution, <hi>(the publick good),</hi> 'tis expedient, that they countenance and encourage ſobriety, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, frugality and induſtry; ſo neceſſary for the publick peace, wealth and happineſs. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013382_0026_0F90577EA3365010"/>
duly frown upon, and check the oppoſite vices; ſuch as intemperance, idleneſs, prodigality and diſſoluteneſs; ſo hurtful to the publick and deſtructive to individuals. For theſe have a train of other vices, they are either connected with, or productive of; which prey upon the vitals of the ſtate, ſap the foundation of government, and produce much diſorder tending to a general ruin. Theſe are ſome of the ſins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which brought down the judgments of Heaven, to the overthrow of the city, and the deſtruction of its incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wicked inhabitants. <hi>Pride, fullneſs of bread, and abundance of idleneſs was in her.</hi>
               <note n="¶" place="bottom">Ezek. xvi.49.</note> To frown upon, and correct ſuch vices and deſtructive evils, is within the magiſtrates claim; whoſe end is the publick peace and happineſs.</p>
            <p>GOOD rulers, aſſiduouſly attentive to their work, will view themſelves under ſacred obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to exerciſe their vigilance and authority, to ſuppreſs vice; and encourage vertue in every ſpecies of it. <hi>For they are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. If thou do that which is evil, be afraid</hi>; (ſays the Apoſtle), <hi>for he beareth not the ſword in vain</hi>; but is by office (as GOD's civil miniſter;) <hi>a revenger, to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To obſerve once more,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:013382_0027_0F90F4BFECBB62B0"/>SIXTHLY,</p>
            <p>CIVIL miniſters, (as an ordinance of GOD) are for publick good, when they are ſuitably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the duties of their reſpective depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; devoting their time and talents, ſo far, as the buſineſs of government requires, to ſecure and advance the publick intereſt. St. Paul calls them GOD's <hi>miniſters, attending continually upon this very thing.</hi> Being induſtrious to know the ſtate of the community; and feel their relation to the ſubjects with a tender affection for them.</p>
            <p>THUS did Jehoſhaphat, by viſiting his kingdom through all his dominions, in his own perſon; after he had done it by his officers. And by this practice, he became perſonally acquainted with the ſtate of his ſubjects; corrected the diſorders he found; and provided what he judged needful, for their future peace and happineſs.<note n="‡" place="bottom">II Chron. xix.4, and 9, &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>WISE rulers will not fail of being publick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors, when they feel a benevolency of heart to their ſubjects; as nurſing fathers, and guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of their rights and privileges:—when they are eaſy of acceſs, by the loweſt of the people in their diſtreſſes:—ready to redreſs their grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:—defend the poor, protect the widow and the fatherleſs.</p>
            <p>THE buſineſs of government, becomes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritively
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013382_0028_0F90577FFA459658"/>
eaſy, when they rule in the hearts of the people: who will then find it their pleaſure, as well as duty, to yield a chearful ſubjection; <hi>not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake</hi> — When this is the happy caſe, government is well eſtabliſhed. The ſubject will love, honour, and revere the magiſtrate. And rulers will hold the reins with caſe, and govern the affair of ſtate with pleaſure: proving themſelves, to be civil miniſters or GOD, for publick good to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And when their whole character is brought into view, it evidently appears, that the great and primary end of civil rulers as a divine ordinance, is, <hi>(next to GOD's glory)</hi> the good of mankind.</p>
            <p>I HAVE now gone through with my propoſed plan, in a doctrinal way; and the body of the diſcourſe being ſo much of a practical nature, that I ſhall throw all the improvement I make, into thoſe uſual addreſſes, which cuſtom has rendered decent on this occaſion.—</p>

            <p>WITH all due deference to dignified charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and yet with a freedom becoming a chriſtian miniſter: I ſhall addreſs the honorable, the GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNOR, the DEPUTY-GOVERNOR, the ASSIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANTS
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013382_0029_0F90578083C23820"/>
in council, and the REPRESENTATIVES of the freemen, convened in general court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Honoured, and much reſpected</hi> SENATORS;</p>
            <p>I HAVE attempted in miniature to bring into view, the nature and end of magiſtracy. The end for which you are advanced to ſeats of dignity, above your brethren; and the civil ſword put into your hands as an ordinance or GOD: not indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to ſleep in the chair of government; much leſs, wantonly to exerciſe your power, for ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratification and perſonal intereſt: but rather to improve it, with wiſdom, vigilance and fidelity, for the public emolument.</p>
            <p>THIS is the great, the worthy object, you are conſtantly to hold in view, as civil miniſters of GOD, deſigned for publick uſefulneſs—<hi>the good of mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND we would this day, gratefully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſmiles of <hi>Heaven</hi> upon us; that our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical fathers and guardians, hitherto, have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued that noble object, with ſo deſirable ſucceſs: for that many worthy deeds have been done by them.</p>
            <p>WE confide in your known abilities, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of heart; that your patriotick fire will yet burn: ſo that the community of which you are
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013382_0030_0F905781D8F89BD0"/>
a part, may long feel your benign influence, to their ſenſible happineſs and real advantage. Then will they ſit under your political ſhadow, with great delight.</p>
            <p>THE return of this anniverſary day of election, refreſhes our minds with our ELECTIVE PRIVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEGES: when the ſuffrages of the freemen are brought into publick view; and the chief ſeats of government, filled, <hi>(by the good hand of our GOD yet upon us)</hi> not with ſtrangers; but with our brethren; who will naturally care for our ſtate.</p>
            <p>HONORED <hi>ſirs,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE rely on your integrity and wiſdom; and have a right to look to you, (under GOD the ſupreme RULER) and expect to receive benefit from the exerciſe of that power, with which you are inveſted. That according to your political ſkill, you will purſue thoſe ſalubrious meaſures; beſt adapted to promote the publick weal, and reach the good ends of government; <hi>(ſecurity, to the perſons and properties of the ſubjects:)</hi> for which purpoſe you are now convened, in your le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative character.</p>
            <p>'TIS not for me, (I am ſenſible) to put on dict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator-ſhip. However, may I be permitted to aſk, whether the ſtate of the college, does not merit a ſhare in your political deliberations; and claim
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013382_0031_0F905782979769D8"/>
your friendly aſſiſtance, to put it into a reputable condition: beſt adapted to anſwer the important <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ds of its inſtitution?</p>
            <p>THIS honorable General Court, need not be informed, of the apparent neceſſity of a new edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice being erected, for the accommodation of the ſtudents; and thereby relieving them, of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſity, and great inconveniency, of crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into private families as boarders.—</p>
            <p>HAVE not both church and common-wealth, received ſignal advantage, from that ſource of light and knowledge; and might not more be yet expected, with growing increaſe; if that ſeminary, <hi>(the glory of the colony,)</hi> meets with ſufficient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and relief, from the civil board?</p>
            <p>IT is therefore, earneſtly recommended to this honorable legiſlature, <hi>that they would form ſome plan,</hi> or come into ſome meaſures, as their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall direct, for the building of a new col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; and the granting ſuch other favours, as are found needful; for the future proſperity, of that ſchool of the prophets. In doing of which, ('tis apprehended), rulers, would act in character, as civil miniſters of GOD, for publick good to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.—</p>
            <p>But to proceed;</p>
            <p>WOULD it be unſeaſonable on this occaſion, to aſk; Is there not a growing evil in this colony,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013382_0032_0F905785AEDFC568"/>
worthy of the attention of our civil guardians, to provide a remedy for? <hi>I mean the ſurprizing number of law-ſuits; and their iſſues ſo often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.</hi> The diſadvantages of which, are too numerous and manifeſt, to need a rehearſal at this time. But ſhould this wiſe legiſlature, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a remedy, for ſo deſtructive an evil; 'tis ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, they would do real ſervice to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general; and merit the thanks of the publick.</p>
            <p>ONCE more, (with indulgence). Do not the times beſpeak the attention of this honorable board; to deviſe ſome method, to prevent the multiplying of vagrant beggars, and idle perſons, ſtroling up and down the colony? <hi>indangering our properties if not our lives too.</hi> Many of whom, are well able to ſupport themſelves, and benefit the publick, if put to labour: which it appears they have no diſpoſition for, if they can find but a <hi>ſlender</hi> ſupport without it.</p>
            <p>THEIR beggary, and idle manner of ſpending time, breeds many vices, detrimental to the ſtate: particularly, the temptation is ſtrong, for lying and theſt: which lead on to high-way robbery and murder. To prevent which, might not the civil fathers of the people act in character, and ſerve the publick to good purpoſe; by ordering ſuch vagrants to be taken up, and put to ſervice
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013382_0033_0F9057872CD6B2E0"/>
for a maintenance? Or if this be judged impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick: May I yet aſk, Is tranſportation acroſs the atlantick, practicable only from <hi>eaſt</hi> to <hi>weſt</hi>? Can there be no ſuch thing, as remittances made of a ſpecies, the greater part of which has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably croſſed the ſeas; in the deſpicable character of convicts? But 'tis readily ſubmitted, to the ſuperiour wiſdom of this honorable legiſlature, to adopt the moſt ſalutary meaſures, for redreſſing our publick grievances.</p>
            <p>WORTHY ſenators, whom I honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere; we confide in your pious regard for the honour of GOD; that you will carefully provide, all within your province, for the due obſervation of the LORD'S-DAY; with a conſtant attendance on the publick worſhip of GOD.</p>
            <p>GREAT and important is the publick truſt in your hands:—You will need the exertion of your ſuperiour wiſdom, and tried abilities; in your ſeveral departments; to comport with your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as civil miniſters of GOD, for publick good: and above all other dependencies, to make Him your truſt and helper, who is Wiſdom itſelf; and ſays, <hi>By me kings reign, and princes decree juſtice. By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. viii.15, 16.</note> You will profitably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the meſſage, which GOD ſent to king

And if you are faithful to ſerve GOD, and your generation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will, until death; he will not fail, to beſtow upon you, a crown of <hi>life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the next place, I ſhall turn to the miniſters of CHRIST convened on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MY reverend Fathers, and dear Brethren:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IS the great and primary end of the <hi>civil</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, (next to the honour of GOD) the good of mankind? <hi>it is of ours,</hi> more emphatically ſo, by divine deſignation and appointment, as miniſters of <hi>religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INDULGE me then, a brief attempt, to warm your hearts and my own, with a ſenſe of the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013382_0035_0F905787E50F1F20"/>
peculiar obligations upon us, to fulfil the ſacred miniſtry, we have received in the LORD.</p>
            <p>THE honour of GOD our SAVIOUR, who has bled and died for the ſheep, is deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it: our own, and the beſt good to the ſouls of men, depends much, on our hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with the benevolent deſigns of redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love; and in advancing the honour of divine grace, in the ſalvation of men.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>important and arduous embaſſage we have undertaken, demands our attention</hi>; our ſtrict ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the ſacred inſtructions given us: and with perſevering fidelity purſue our work, while we have a ſtanding in the LORD'S vineyard.</p>
            <p>WE are to preach like dying men, to dying creatures; bound into the eternal world, to appear before GOD <hi>the judge of all</hi>: knowing that we may not long continue by reaſon of death. And ſhall not <hi>this,</hi> be a powerful <hi>ſtimulus,</hi> to redouble our diligence, with fervent application, to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever our hands find to do, that will turn to a good account, in the day of the LORD JESUS?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'TIS true,</hi> we are ſet for the defence of the goſpel; <hi>and upon occaſion,</hi> muſt earneſtly contend for the faith. But we have no time to waſte, in warm debates, about things not eſſential to a ſtate of grace—divine conſolation—an holy life—or eternal ſalvation. Which are apt to gender ſtrife, and create alienation and diſunion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:013382_0036_0F905789449E1160"/>MAY we not more profitably, for GOD and man; unite our efforts, to bring the divine cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter into view, and that of fallen man?—to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the terrors of the LORD, againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men:—to alarm the ſecure in ſin—and point them to the city of refuge:—to unfold, and evince the doctrines of grace, the grand peculiarities of the goſpel of JESUS:—to open to the view of our hearers, the goſpel way of life;—acquaint them, with the terms of peace and acceptance with GOD, thro' the blood and merits of JESUS CHRIST; upon the plan of the new and well-ordered covenant; and beſoech ſinners in CHRIST's ſtead, to be reconciled to GOD; yea, compel them to come in, that CHRIST's houſe may be filled.</p>
            <p>WE are to preach CHRIST, and <hi>his unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches</hi>: and urge the importance of holineſs, both in heart, and in life. And in order to which, evidence the neceſſity of a new heart;—<hi>of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards GOD, and of faith in our LORD JESUS CHRIST.</hi> We are likewiſe, to inculcate the duties of ſocial life; with every ſpecies of chriſtian morality; and preſs the neceſſity of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the civil magiſtrate, as an ordinance of GOD: and that, not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake.</p>
            <p>LET us, reverend ſirs, by united endeavours,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013382_0037_0F90578970D9BCC0"/>
               <hi>ſtrengthen the things which remain that are ready to die:</hi> And <hi>diligently watch for ſouls, as they who muſt give an account.</hi> And may we be honoured, as humble inſtruments, in turning many to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. And when we are diſmiſſed, from our labours in the LORD'S vineyard; may we then meet the rewards of the faithful, in GOD's eternal kingdom.</p>
            <p>THE addreſs will now cloſe, with a few words to the aſſembly in general.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ARE civil rulers an ordinance of GOD, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by HEAVEN for good to mankind? Then they are to be known and treated in character. Let none imagine, that 'tis characteriſtick of good rulers, to be all lenity and mercy; for ſuch would not be for the publick emolument: the peace and good of ſociety. <hi>But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for be beareth not the ſword in vain.</hi> Nor may he do ſo. But he is the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of GOD by office; <hi>a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS you are members of ſociety, you are under obligations, as well as the rulers, to ſeek its good; in promoting the publick wealth, peace, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;—to ſhun faction, and diſcountenance
