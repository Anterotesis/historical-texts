            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </p>
               <p>In many in≈øtances one ≈øtatute is virtually repealed by another, and the judiciary mu≈øt decide which is the law, or whether both can exi≈øt together.</p>

               </p>
               <p>With re≈øpect to the idea that for the judiciary to declare an act of the legi≈ølature void,‚Äîis to claim a ≈øuperiority to the legi≈ølature,‚Äîif the legi≈ølative authority is derived from the Con≈øtitution, and ≈øuch a deci≈øion be a judicial act (as I have endeavoured to prove) this objection ≈øeems to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</p>
               <p>For the rea≈øons which I have given, I am of opinion that the fundamental act of government controuls the legi≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who owe their exi≈øtence and powers to it‚Äîthis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the fir≈øt point‚Äî</p>

               <p n="2">II. The ≈øecond point‚Äîwhether it be uncon≈øtitutional is next to be con≈øidered.</p>
               <p>By the fourteenth ≈øection of the Con≈øtitution, "the two hou≈øes of A≈ø≈øembly ≈øhall, by joint ballot, appoint Judges of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027777_0012_0FD63DC0C928C5B8"/>
the Supreme Court of Appeals, and general court, <hi>Judges</hi> in Chancery, Judges of Admiralty, &amp;c."</p>
               <p>I was at fir≈øt inclined to think that the in≈øertion of the word <hi>Judges</hi> between the <hi>General Court</hi> and <hi>Chancery,</hi> evinced an intention that the judges of the general court and tho≈øe in chancery ≈øhould be di≈øtinct per≈øons; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it would be unju≈øtifiable to re≈øt ≈øuch an opinion on ≈øo critical a con≈øtruction.</p>
               <p>However this opinion is ≈øupported by the ≈øixteenth and ≈øeventeenth ≈øections.</p>
               <p>By the ≈øixteenth the governor and others offending again≈øt the ≈øtate, by mal-admini≈øtration, corruption, &amp;c. are impeachable before the general court. And‚Äî</p>
               <p>By the ≈øeventeenth the judges of the general court are to be impeached before the court of appeals.‚ÄîThis might prove then that a judge of the general court could not according to the Con≈øtitution be a judge of the ≈øupreme court of appeals, becau≈øe all officers (except the judges of the general court,) are to be tried before the general court; but Judges of the general court are to be tried before the court of appeals‚Äîand the Con≈øtitution intended to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a man being tried in that court of which he is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; becau≈øe in cau≈øes which might give ri≈øe to an impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the judges of a court might act jointly, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of partiality or an <hi>e≈øprit du Corps</hi> was to be guarded again≈øt.</p>
               <p>However to decide whether a judge of the general court could be a judge of the court of appeals, would be extraju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial as that que≈øtion is not before the court, but this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øearch enables me to decide the que≈øtion that is before the court‚Äîthat is, whether the ≈øame per≈øon can under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution be a judge in chancery, and a judge of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral court?‚ÄîI think that he cannot for the≈øe rea≈øons‚Äî</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:027777_0013_0FD63DC539AC2130"/>A judge in chancery is to be tried before the general court.‚ÄîA judge of the general court cannot be a judge in chancery, becau≈øe a judge in chancery mu≈øt be tried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the general court; but if a judge of the general court be a judge in chancery, then he (a judge of the general court) will be tried in the general court which is again≈øt the ≈øeventeenth article, which declares that a judge of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral court ≈øhall be impeached before the court of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals.</p>
               <p>My inference is that a judge in chancery and a judge of the general court were intended under the Con≈øtitution to be di≈øtinct individuals.</p>
               <p>This is one rea≈øon again≈øt the law; but there are others al≈øo of force‚ÄîWhoever is appointed a judge in chancery under the Con≈øtitution mu≈øt be elected by joint ballot, and commi≈ø≈øioned by the governor; neither of which requi≈øitions have been complied with.</p>
               <p>On the whole, I am for certifying to the court below, That the motion for an injunction be over-ruled, the clau≈øe under which it is prayed being uncon≈øtitutional.</p>

               <p>THIS great que≈øtion was adjourned by me from the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict court of Dumfries. I thought it nece≈ø≈øary to obtain the opinion of this court, for the government of the ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral di≈øtrict courts, who might otherwi≈øe have differed in their con≈øtruction of the clau≈øe in que≈øtion, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtration of the law in this in≈øtance been con≈øequently partial.</p>
               <p>My opinion then was upon a ≈øhort con≈øideration, that the di≈øtrict courts ought to execute this law; for I doubted
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027777_0014_0FD63DC638724588"/>
how far the judiciary were authorized to refu≈øe to execute a law, on the ground of its being again≈øt the ≈øpirit of the Con≈øtitution.</p>
               <p>My opinion, on more mature con≈øideration, is changed in this re≈øpect, and I now think that the judiciary may and ought not only to refu≈øe to execute a law expre≈øsly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Con≈øtitution; but al≈øo one which is by a plain and natural con≈øtruction, in oppo≈øition to the fundamental principles thereof.</p>
               <p>I con≈øider the people of this country as the only ≈øovereign power.‚ÄîI con≈øider the legi≈ølature as not ≈øovereign but ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, they are ≈øubordinate to the great con≈øtitutional charter, which the people have e≈øtabli≈øhed as a fundamental law, and which alone has given exi≈øtence and authority to the legi≈ølature. I con≈øider that at the time of the adoption of our pre≈øent Con≈øtitution, the Briti≈øh government was at an end in Virginia: it was at an end, becau≈øe among many other weighty rea≈øons very emphatically expre≈ø≈øed in the fir≈øt ≈øection of our Con≈øtitution, <q>George the third heretofore entru≈øted with the exerci≈øe of the kingly office in this colony had abandoned the helm of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and declared us out of his allegiance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The people were therefore at that period, they were at the period of the election of the Convention, which form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Con≈øtitution, ab≈øolved from the former kingly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and free, as in a ≈øtate of nature, to e≈øtabli≈øh a government for them≈øelves. But admitting for a moment that the old government was not then at an end, I a≈ø≈øert that the people have a right by a convention, or otherwi≈øe, to change the exi≈øting government, whil≈øt ≈øuch exi≈øting government is in actual operation, for the ordinary purpo≈øes thereof. The example of all America in the adoption of the federal government and that of ≈øeveral of the ≈øtates in changing their ≈øtate con≈øtitutions in this temperate and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027777_0015_0FD63DC7B3F5F8B0"/>
peaceable manner, undeniably proves my po≈øition. The people of Virginia, therefore, if the old government ≈øhould not be con≈øidered as then at an end, permitted it to proceed, and by a convention cho≈øen by them≈øelves, with full powers, for they were not re≈øtrained, e≈øtabli≈øhed then a con≈øtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>This Convention was not cho≈øen under the ≈øanction of the former government; it was not limited in its powers by it, if indeed it exi≈øted, but may be con≈øidered as a ≈øpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a≈ø≈øemblage of the people of Virginia, under a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of a former convention, to con≈øult for the good of them≈øelves, and their po≈øterity. They e≈øtabli≈øhed a bill of rights purporting to appertain to their po≈øterity, and a con≈øtitution evidently de≈øigned to be permanent. This con≈øtitution is ≈øanctioned by the con≈øent and acquie≈øence of the people for ≈øeventeen years; and it is admitted by the almo≈øt univer≈øal opinion of the people, by the repeated ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judications of the courts of this commonwealth, and by very many declarations of the legi≈ølature it≈øelf, to be of ≈øuperior authority to any oppo≈øing act of the legi≈ølature. The celebrated Vattel in a pa≈ø≈øage of his, which I will not fatigue this audience by quoting, denies to the ordinary legi≈ølature the power of changing the fundamental laws "for, ≈øays he, it is nece≈ø≈øary that the Con≈øtitution of the ≈øtate be fixed."</p>
               <p>But if the legi≈ølature may infringe this Con≈øtitution, it is no longer fixed; it is not this year what it was the la≈øt; and the liberties of the people are wholly at the mercy of the legi≈ølature.</p>
               <p>A very important que≈øtion now occurs, viz. who≈øe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince it is to decide in ≈øuch ca≈øes. It is the province of the judiciary to expound the laws, and to adjudge ca≈øes which may be brought before them‚Äîthe judiciary may clearly ≈øay that a ≈øub≈øequent ≈øtatute has not changed a former for want of ≈øufficient words, though it was perhaps intended it
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027777_0016_0FD63E7F70545468"/>
≈øhould do ≈øo. It may ≈øay too that an act of a≈ø≈øembly has not changed the Con≈øtitution though its words are expre≈øs to that effect, becau≈øe a legi≈ølature mu≈øt have both the power and the will (as evidenced by words) to change the law, and it is conceived for the rea≈øons above mentioned that the legi≈ølature have not power to change the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental laws. In expounding laws the judiciary con≈øiders <hi>every</hi> law which relates to the ≈øubject: would you have them to ≈øhut their eyes again≈øt that law which is of the highe≈øt authority of any, or again≈øt a part of that law, which either by its words or by its ≈øpirit, denies to any but the people the power to change it? In ca≈øes where the controver≈øy before the court, does not involve the private intere≈øt or relate to the powers of the judiciary, they are not only the proper, but a perfectly di≈øintere≈øted tribunal; ‚Äîe. g. if the Legi≈ølature ≈øhould deprive a man of the trial by jury‚Äîthere the controver≈øy is between the legi≈ølature on one hand, and the whole people of Virginia (through the medium of an individual) on the other, which people have declared that the trial by jury ≈øhall be held ≈øacred.</p>
               <p>In other ca≈øes where the private intere≈øt of judges may be affected, or where their con≈øtitutional powers are encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, their ≈øituation is indeed delicate, and let them be ever ≈øo virtuous they will be cen≈øured by the ill di≈øpo≈øed part of their fellow citizens: but in the≈øe ca≈øes, as well as others, they are bound to decide, and they do actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide on behalf of the people‚Äîfor example, though a judges is intere≈øted privately in pre≈øerving his independence, yet 'tis the right of the people which ≈øhould govern him, who in their ≈øovereign character have provided that the judges ≈øhould be independent; ≈øo that it is in fact a controver≈øy between the legi≈ølature and the people, though perhaps the judges may be privately intere≈øted. The only effect on the judges in ≈øuch ca≈øe ≈øhould be, to di≈øtru≈øt their own
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027777_0017_0FD624D8746D43C0"/>
judgment if the matter is doubtful, or in other words to require clear evidence before they decide in ca≈øes where intere≈øt may po≈ø≈øibly warp the judgment.</p>
               <p>From the above premi≈øes I conclude that the judiciary may and ought to adjudge a law uncon≈øtitutional and void if it be plainly repugnant to the letter of the Con≈øtitution, or the fundamental principles thereof. By fundamental principles I under≈øtand, tho≈øe great principles growing out of the Con≈øtitution, by the aid of which, in dubious ca≈øes, the Con≈øtitution may be explained and pre≈øerved inviolate; tho≈øe land-marks, which it may be nece≈ø≈øary to re≈øort to, on account of the impo≈ø≈øibility to fore≈øee or provide for, ca≈øes within the ≈øpirit but without the letter of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution.</p>
               <p>To come now more immediately to the que≈øtion before the court; can tho≈øe who are appointed judges in chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, by an act of a≈ø≈øembly, without ballot, and without commi≈ø≈øion during good behaviour, con≈øtitutionally exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe that office?‚ÄîThe fourteenth article of the Virginia Con≈øtitution recites <q>that the people have a right, to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form government; and therefore, that no government ≈øeparate from, or independent of, the government of VIRGINIA, ought to be erected or e≈øtabli≈øhed within the limits thereof.</q> Here then is a general principle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading all the courts mentioned in the Con≈øtitution‚Äîfrom which without an exception we ought not to depart‚Äî If tho≈øe may be judges who are not appointed by joint ballot, but by an act of a≈ø≈øembly, the ≈øenate have in that in≈øtance more power than the Con≈øtitution intended; for they control the other branch, by their negative upon the law, whereas if they mixed with that branch in a joint ballot, a plurality of votes of ≈øenators and delegates would decide.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027777_0018_0FD63DCD81C9AC10"/>
at the will of the legi≈ølature, and they con≈øequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are not independent. The people of Virginia intended that the judiciary ≈øhould be independent of the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments: they are to judge where the legi≈ølature is a party, and therefore ≈øhould be independent of it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe they might judge corruptly in order to plea≈øe the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølature, and be con≈øequently continued in office. It is an acknowledged principle in all countries, that no man ≈øhall be judge in his own cau≈øe; but it is nearly the ≈øame thing, where the tribunal of ju≈øtice is under the influence of a party. If the legi≈ølature can transfer from con≈øtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal to legi≈ølative courts, all judicial powers, the≈øe depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent tribunals being the creatures of the legi≈ølature it≈øelf, will not dare to oppo≈øe an uncon≈øtitutional law, and the principle I ≈øet out upon, viz. that ≈øuch laws ought to be oppo≈øed would become a dead letter, or in other words, this would pave the way to an uncontrolled power in the legi≈ølature. The con≈øtitution requires the concurrence of the legi≈ølature to appoint, and the executive to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion a judge:‚Äîbut an appointment by act of a≈ø≈øembly, will inve≈øt with this high power one who has not the ≈øanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the executive; and will throw a new office upon a man, without the liberty of declining ≈øuch appointment, if he thinks proper. For the≈øe rea≈øons, and others which it would be tedious to enumerate, I am of opinion, that the clau≈øe in que≈øtion, is repugnant to the fundamental princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Con≈øtitution in as much as the judges of the general court have not been ballotted for and commi≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as judges in chancery, pur≈øuant to the fourteenth arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Con≈øtitution.</p>
               <p>Mr. ROANE then ≈øaid, "Although it is not in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion now nece≈ø≈øary to decide, whether the offices of a judge in chancery and of the general court, may be united in the ≈øame per≈øon or not, ≈øuppo≈øing a con≈øtitutional appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have been made of the ≈øame per≈øon to each‚Äîyet in
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:027777_0019_0FD63DD055615F98"/>
as much as this que≈øtion is in ≈øome mea≈øure involved in the one ju≈øt di≈øcu≈ø≈øed, I will give my pre≈øent impre≈ø≈øions upon it, leaving my≈øelf free to decide hereafter the one way or the other, ≈øhould it come judicially before me.</p>
               <p>The con≈øtitution has declared that the three departments of government ≈øhould be ≈øeparate and di≈øtinct.‚ÄîThere are great political evils which would ari≈øe from their union:‚Äî for example, if according to Monte≈øquieu, the members of the legi≈ølature were al≈øo members of the judiciary, the ≈øame man would as a legi≈ølator make a tyrannical law, and then as a judge would enforce it tyrannically.‚ÄîThis union it is evident would produce a complete de≈øpoti≈øm.</p>
               <p>It is therefore a fundamental principle not only of our con≈øtitution, but acknowledged by all intelligent writers, to be e≈ø≈øential to liberty, that ≈øuch an union ≈øhould not take place.</p>
               <p>But is there any great political evil re≈øulting from the ≈øame per≈øons being a judge in chancery, and of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral court?</p>
               <p>Is there any con≈øtitutional impediment?‚ÄîIt would be wi≈øe in the legi≈ølature to keep the offices ≈øeparate; for an union of ≈øeveral functions in one per≈øon, will put it out of his power to be perfect in either, and the commonwealth will be better ≈øerved by dividing than by accumulating the public duties.</p>
               <p>But it has been ≈øaid, and I confe≈øs with great force, that in as much as the judges in chancery are to be tried, on impeachment, before the general court, if the judges of the general court are al≈øo judges in chancery, they in their latter character mu≈øt be tried before them≈øelves in their former, and con≈øequently there will be a defect of an impartial tribunal. I can only an≈øwer this objection by ≈øaying, that the former court of appeals was compo≈øed of the judges of the general court, court in chancery, and admiralty.‚ÄîThe legi≈ølature might have ≈øo organized the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027777_0020_0FD63DD1801C61A0"/>
                  <hi>≈øaid Courts</hi> as to have had nine-tenths of the court of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals members of the general court.</p>
               <p>The judges of the general court are by the con≈øtitution to be tried before the court of appeals, i. e. <hi>under that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization,</hi> before them≈øelves;‚Äîand the judges of appeals before the general court, which would produce the ≈øame dilemma.</p>
               <p>This ca≈øe then is preci≈øely ≈øimilar to the ca≈øe before us.‚Äî And yet the judges of the court of appeals did in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrance of May, one thou≈øand ≈øeven hundred and eighty eight, declare <q>that the forming the court of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, ≈øo as to con≈øi≈øt of all the judges is <hi>no violation</hi> of the con≈øtitution;</q> thereby over-ruling the objection which mu≈øt have occurred in that ca≈øe as will as in this.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole I mu≈øt ≈øay, that however inconvenient and unwi≈øe it might be to unite the≈øe di≈øtinct offices in the ≈øame per≈øon;‚Äîhowever in the ca≈øe that has been ≈øuppo≈øed, there might be a defect of an impartial, tribunal to try an offending chancellor upon an impeachment;‚Äî≈øtill not ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any expre≈øs provi≈øion in, or fundamental principle of, the con≈øtitution, re≈øtricting the power of the legi≈ølature in this re≈øpect; and grounding my≈øelf upon the above recited opinion of the former court of appeals as to the con≈øtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality of the union of offices which then exi≈øted in that body;‚ÄîMy pre≈øent impre≈ø≈øions are, that there is no con≈øtitutional impediment, plainly apparent, again≈øt uniting the two offices in the ≈øame per≈øon.</p>

               <head>JUDGE HENRY.</head>
               <p>THIS is an adjourned ca≈øe from the Dumfries Di≈øtrict, and the que≈øtion <hi>(new and difficult)</hi> referred to this court is, ‚ÄîOught the di≈øtrict judges to exerci≈øe that branch of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027777_0021_0FD63DD2F3CE67C8"/>
chancery juri≈ødiction committed to them by the la≈øt di≈øtrict law, of hearing and deciding all cau≈øes brought before them by injunction according to the rules pre≈øcribed by law for conducting ≈øimilar ≈øuits in the high court of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</p>
               <p>The difficulty and novelty of this ca≈øe is, that the law in que≈øtion requires of the common law judges, to exerci≈øe chancery juri≈ødiction, and that without a legal appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and without a commi≈ø≈øion.</p>
               <p>The di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of this ≈øubject is no le≈øs delicate than it is important.‚ÄîIt is important as it brings in que≈øtion the rights of the legi≈ølature on one of the particular ≈øubjects committed to them by the plan of government: It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, as the judges are compelled to examine their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, their duties, and the regularity of their appointments, and therefore, they may be con≈øidered, in ≈øome ≈øen≈øe, as judges in their own cau≈øe.‚ÄîBut be the ≈øubject as delicate as can be ≈øuppo≈øed po≈ø≈øible, and as important as any which can ever come before a court, it is now before us, and I embrace the opportunity, now offered me for the fir≈øt time, of publicly declaring my opinion.</p>
               <p>The importance of the ≈øubject requires a particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and thorough examination. We will then have recour≈øe to the revolution and ≈øome of the hi≈øtory.</p>
               <p>In the year 1776, the people of this country cho≈øe depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to meet in general convention, to con≈øult of, and take care for, their mo≈øt valuable intere≈øts. The≈øe deputies ≈øeem to have been complete repre≈øentatives of the people, and ve≈øted with the mo≈øt unlimited authority. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, having taken a careful review of the ≈øtate of their country, they found a number of in≈øtances of mi≈ørule in the then exi≈øting government, and that our prince by abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the helm of government, and declaring the people to be out of his allegiance and protection, had produced a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal di≈ø≈øolution of the ≈øocial band.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:027777_0022_0FD63DD4B7D384E8"/>When this was found to be our unhappy ≈øituation, our deputies proceeded, (as of right they might), to prepare that form of government for us they judged be≈øt.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, a plan of government was agreed upon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged, and accepted by the people, which has been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly acquie≈øced under from that day to this time.‚ÄîBut previous to the promulging the plan of government, the≈øe deputies declared that certain rights were inherent in the people, which the public ≈øervants who might be intru≈øted with the execution or this government, were never to be permitted to infringe‚Äîfor example‚Äîthe legi≈ølative branch were declared to be re≈øtrained from interfering, with the right of trial by jury in criminal ca≈øes; from meddling with the rights of con≈øcience, in matters of religion, and each of the three branches into which the government was to be divided was declared incompetent to any of the duties of either of the other two.</p>
               <p>The judiciary, from the nature of the office, and the mode of their appointment, could never be de≈øigned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine upon the equity, nece≈ø≈øity, or u≈øefulne≈øs of a law; that would amount to an expre≈øs interfering with the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølative branch, in the clau≈øe where it is expre≈øsly forbidden for any one branch to interfere with the duties of the other. The rea≈øon is obvious, not being cho≈øen immediately by the people, nor being accountable to them, in the fir≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, they do not, and ought not, to repre≈øent the people in framing or repealing any law.</p>
               <p>There is a propo≈øition which I take to be univer≈øally true in our con≈øtitution, which to gentlemen who≈øe ideas of parliament, and parliamentary powers were formed under the former government, may not be always obvious‚Äî'tis this‚ÄîWe were taught that <hi>Parliament</hi> was <hi>omnipotent,</hi> and their powers beyond control; now this propo≈øition, in our con≈øtitution, is limited, and certain rights are re≈øerved as before ob≈øerved;‚Äîif this were always kept in mind, it
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:027777_0023_0FD63DD7E7CC08B8"/>
might free the mind from a good deal of embarra≈ø≈øment in di≈øcu≈ø≈øing ≈øeveral que≈øtions where the duty, and the power of the legi≈ølature is con≈øidered.</p>
               <p>Our deputies, in this famous convention, after having re≈øerved many fundamental rights to the people, which were declared not to be ≈øubject to legi≈ølative control, did more;‚Äîthey pointed out a certain and permanent mode of appointing the officers who were to be intru≈øted with the execution of the government.‚ÄîThough the choice of the officers was intru≈øted to the wi≈ødom of the legi≈ølature, yet the manner of conducting this choice was fixed; hereby declaring in the mo≈øt ≈øolemn manner, the public will and mind of the people to be, that the laws, when made, ≈øhould be executed by officers cho≈øen and appointed, as therein is directed, and not otherwi≈øe, whereas under the former go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the legi≈ølature ≈øeemed to have had no bounds to their authority but the negative of the crown, and the public officers were appointed and di≈øplaced at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of the governing powers which then were.</p>
               <p>I come now to the particular ca≈øe before the court. Kamper applied to the di≈øtrict court of Dumfries, for an injunction to a judgment obtained at law in that court by Hawkins, under the law which directs the di≈øtrict judges to hear and determine all ≈øuits commencing by injunction, under the ≈øame rules and regulations as are now pre≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by law, for conducting ≈øimilar ≈øuits in the high court of chancery.</p>
               <p>The permanent will of the people, expre≈ø≈øed in the con≈øtitution, is that the legi≈ølature, by joint ballot of both hou≈øes, ≈øhall appoint judges of the ≈øupreme court of appeals and general court, judges in chancery, &amp;c. to be commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øioned by the governor, and to hold their offices during good behavior.</p>
               <p>'Tis alledged by ≈øome of my brethren, that the legi≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are not warranted in appointing the ≈øame men to be
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:027777_0024_0FD63DDB7AEE1EE0"/>
judges both at common law and in chancery. The words of the plan of government are, <q>they ≈øhall appoint judges of the high court of appeals and general court, judges in chancery, &amp;c.</q>‚ÄîThe≈øe words, <hi>Judges in Chancery,</hi> are ≈øuppo≈øed to de≈øign different per≈øons from the judges of the general court, and an argument to inforce this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is drawn from ¬ß 16 and 17, where it is provided, that any judge of the general court, offending again≈øt the ≈øtate, may be pro≈øecuted in the high court of appeals; but a chancery judge offending mu≈øt be pro≈øecuted in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral court; therefore it is alledged, a common law judge cannot be a chancery, nor a chancery a common law judge in our government.</p>
               <p>This que≈øtion has heretofore been alledged as one of the rea≈øons of the high court of appeals for declining to execute a very important law of the land;‚Äîwithout ≈øaying any thing about the propriety or impropriety of that bu≈øine≈øs, it is ≈øufficient for my pre≈øent purpo≈øe to ob≈øerve, that the que≈øtion did not then come before the court in a judicial manner,‚Äîit was taken up as a general propo≈øition, and when publi≈øhed, contained an appeal to the people; this looked like a di≈ø≈øolution of the government,‚Äîtherefore I cannot view it as an adjudged ca≈øe, to be con≈øidered as a binding precedent.</p>
               <p>It is much to be wi≈øhed that the que≈øtion had been then decided, by calling a convention of the people.‚ÄîBut unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately the legi≈ølature neither yielded the point nor in≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but adopted an expedient.‚ÄîThey new-modelled the courts.‚ÄîThe que≈øtion then went to ≈øleep, but the legi≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture pre≈øerved the principle; they appointed judges of the high court of appeals, with unlimited juri≈ødiction, both in law and equity; they appointed judges of the general court, and a judge in chancery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:027777_0025_0FD63DDD77FA94E8"/>If the common law and chancery juri≈ødiction ought not to be united in the ≈øame per≈øons in the fir≈øt in≈øtance, I do not ≈øee how it can be ju≈øtified in the appellate juri≈ødiction.‚Äî If the form of government has provided that ju≈øtice at common law ought to be admini≈øtered by one ≈øet of men, and in chancery by another, it ≈øeems to me to follow as a nece≈ø≈øary inference, that the appellate, as well as the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal juri≈ødiction, ought to be ≈øeparate and di≈øtinct, and that tho≈øe gentlemen who now exerci≈øe the appellate ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈ødiction have admitted the legi≈ølative con≈øtruction of the form of government formerly objected to.</p>
               <p>But I do not re≈øt the que≈øtion on this ground. Where I am not bound by regular adjudications of the ≈øuperior court, I cannot re≈øt on other men's opinions. I mu≈øt and will think for my≈øelf.</p>
               <p>Our government is declared to be founded on the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the people. The people, in convention, have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that a legi≈ølature ≈øhall be cho≈øen, a governor and council ≈øhall be cho≈øen, judges ≈øhall be appointed.‚ÄîAll the≈øe different characters are ≈øervants of the people, have different duties, and are amenable to them. When the legi≈ølature were intru≈øted with the appointment of judges, I can find no particular characters, or any de≈øcription of men, declared to be ineligible, but tho≈øe holding legi≈ølative or executive authority, who are forbidden to interfere. To the di≈øcretion of the legi≈ølature is committed the choice of the judges, who ≈øhall fill all the ≈øuperior courts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if they have cho≈øen, or ≈øhall hereafter chu≈øe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the ≈øame ≈øet of men to admini≈øter ju≈øtice to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, both at common law and in chancery, I cannot find any thing in the form of government to re≈øtrain them.‚Äî They are to appoint judges in chancery at their di≈øcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;‚Äîand for me to ≈øay I cannot act as a chancery judge in any ca≈øe, becau≈øe if I ≈øhould offend, I am to be pro≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027777_0026_0FD63DDEF160F208"/>
for ≈øuch offence before my brethren in the general court, ≈øeems to be a ≈øtrange rea≈øon for me to a≈ø≈øign for declining the office.</p>
               <p>I am therefore very clear and decided in my opinion, that the legi≈ølature were fully authori≈øed by the form of government, to appoint the di≈øtrict judges to exerci≈øe a chancery juri≈ødiction in the ca≈øe before us, and I do chearfully embrace this public opportunity of declaring my hearty approbation of the mea≈øure, and my willingne≈øs to act when the appointment is regularly made.</p>
               <p>This brings me to the ≈øecond point in the ca≈øe. Have the legi≈ølature made the appointment in the manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed by the form of government?‚Äî</p>
               <p>I wi≈øh mo≈øt ≈øeriou≈øly I could give an affirmative an≈øwer to this que≈øtion. 'Tis provided by the form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ≈øo often alluded to, that judges in chancery ≈øhall be cho≈øen by joint ballot of both hou≈øes, ≈øhall be commi≈ø≈øioned by the governor, ≈øhall hold their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice during good behaviour, and to ≈øecure their inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence and remove them from all temptation to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their ≈øalaries ≈øhall be adequate and fixed.‚ÄîIf a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor in any ca≈øe mu≈øt be cho≈øen by ballot, be commi≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and hold his office during good behavior, ≈øurely it is proper, it is nece≈ø≈øary in all ca≈øes, that every judge ≈øhall be ≈øo cho≈øen, ≈øhall be ≈øo commi≈ø≈øioned, and hold his office ≈øo long as he behaves well.‚ÄîThe bu≈øine≈øs of hearing cau≈øes originating in that court by injunction, is of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent nature.‚ÄîTo exerci≈øe this duty without the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and commi≈ø≈øion pre≈øcribed by the con≈øtitution, would be an exerci≈øe of a power according to the will of the legi≈ølature, who are ≈øervants of the people, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but expre≈øsly again≈øt the will of the people.‚ÄîThis would be a ≈øoleci≈øm in government,‚Äîe≈øtabli≈øhing the will of the legi≈ølature, ≈øervants of the people, to control the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:027777_0027_0FD63DE1F78418E0"/>
will of their ma≈øters, if the word may be permitted.‚Äî 'Till the appointment is made agreeable to the directions of the con≈øtitution, I cannot think my≈øelf duly authori≈øed to take upon me the office.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude, I wi≈øh to embrace the pre≈øent oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ≈øaying ≈øomething about what may be called incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtency in my conduct.‚Äî'Tis well known I ≈øat in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer court of appeals, not being particularly balloted for and commi≈ø≈øioned. I have latterly obeyed the commands of the legi≈ølature, by ≈øitting in the ≈øpecial court of appeals without any ≈øuch appointment or commi≈ø≈øion.</p>
               <p>When I was appointed a judge of the court of admiralty there was a ≈øtanding law of the land, that every ≈øuch judge ≈øhould of cour≈øe be a judge of the court of appeals, and an oath of office in both courts was pre≈øcribed. When I was ballotted for, I con≈øidered my≈øelf as having a general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to both the courts, and acted accordingly: and had a commi≈ø≈øion been applied for as a judge of the court of appeals, 'tis probable, it might have been granted. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the legi≈ølature, on reviewing this ≈øubject, availing them≈øelves of what was then in their opinion judged to be an incomplete appointment, thought them≈øelves authori≈øed to garble the commi≈ø≈øion, and di≈ømi≈øs one half of the judges, without either giving them notice, or a≈ø≈øigning any rea≈øon, a≈ø≈øuming a right from their own omi≈ø≈øion, if it was one, to di≈ømi≈øs their judges.‚ÄîIf the legi≈ølature were autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øed to take this ≈øtep at that time, it ≈øurely furni≈øhes all ≈øucceeding judges, as they value their reputation and their independence, to ≈øee that their appointment be regular, before entering upon the duties of their office, in future.</p>
               <p>This di≈ømi≈ø≈øion was ≈øubmitted to, though, in a ≈øhort time afterwards, the legi≈ølature ≈øeem to have forgotten the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple on which they grounded the di≈ømi≈ø≈øion of the judges; for when public convenience ≈øeemed to require a ≈øpecial court of appeals, in ca≈øes where a majority of the judges of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027777_0028_0FD63DE3F80CF020"/>

               <p>In order to protect and defend the common cau≈øe then, a ≈øy≈øtem of ≈øocial duties were formed.‚ÄîWithout this what obedience could have been expected, and how could a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular defence have been made?</p>

Can the legi≈ølature rightfully pa≈øs a law taking away the≈øe rights from the people?

               <p>But who is to judge of this matter? the legi≈ølature only? I hope not.‚ÄîThe object of all governments is and ought to be the faithful admini≈øtration of ju≈øtice‚ÄîIt cannot, I hope, be le≈øs the object of our government, which has been founded on principles very different from any we read of in the world, as it has ingrafted in it a better knowledge of the rights of human nature, and the means of better ≈øecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tho≈øe rights.‚ÄîAnd were I inclined to borrow a ≈øenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from any man, in ≈øupport of my opinion, (not as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but merely argumentative) I ≈øhould make u≈øe of the following one from the celebrated Hume, in his e≈ø≈øay on our government‚Äîviz. <q>We are therefore to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the va≈øt apparatus of our government, as having ultimately no other object, or purpo≈øe, but the di≈øtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ju≈øtice, or in other words the ≈øupport of the judges.

of the court and revenue, amba≈ø≈øadors, mini≈øters, and privy-coun≈øellors, are all ≈øubordinate in their end to this part of admini≈øtration.</q>‚ÄîHence it may rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be inferred that if the commonwealth it≈øelf is ≈øubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to this department of government at times, ≈øo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will nece≈ø≈øarily be the acts of the legi≈ølature, when they ≈øhall be found to violate fir≈øt principles, notwith≈øtanding the ≈øuppo≈øed <hi>"omnipotence of parliament,"</hi> which is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable in≈øult upon the honour and good ≈øen≈øe of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as nothing is omnipotent as it relates to us, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious or political, but the <hi>God of Heaven</hi> and our con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</p>
               <p>I will not in an extra-judicial manner a≈ø≈øume the right to negative a law, for this would be as dangerous as the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before us; but if by any legal means I have juri≈ødiction of a cau≈øe, in which it is made a que≈øtion how far the law be a violation of the con≈øtitution, and therefore of no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ≈øhall not ≈øhrink from a compari≈øon of the two, and pronounce ≈øentence as my mind may receive conviction.‚Äî To be made an agent, therefore, for the purpo≈øe of violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the con≈øtitution, I cannot con≈øent to.‚ÄîAs a citizen I ≈øhould complain of it; as a public ≈øervant, filling an office in one of the great departments of government, I ≈øhould be a traitor to my country to do it. But the violation mu≈øt be plain and clear, or there might be danger of the judiciary preventing the operation of laws which might be productive of much public good. The≈øe premi≈øes being admitted, as I think they mu≈øt, I will now draw a compari≈øon of the law before us with the con≈øtitution. The con≈øtitution declares there ≈øhall be judges in chancery, judges of the general court, &amp;c. &amp;c. and the fir≈øt que≈øtion that occurs is this‚Äî Can the office of a judge in chancery and common law be rightfully ve≈øted in the ≈øame per≈øons, provided the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be regular?‚ÄîTo which I an≈øwer, I ≈øee no incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027777_0033_0FD63DF2B726D1F8"/>
in the exerci≈øe of the≈øe offices, by the ≈øame per≈øons ‚Äîfor although they be di≈øtinct offices, po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing di≈øtinct powers, they do not nece≈ø≈øarily blend and run together, becau≈øe they are placed in the ≈øame hands. The judge who knows the powers and duties of both, will well know how to keep them apart‚Äîlike the rays of the ≈øun, they radiate from one common centre, and may run parallel for ever, without an interference.‚ÄîBut to this, an ingenius and ≈øubtile argument is offered, and taken from the 17th article of the con≈øtitution, wherein it is directed, that when the judges of the general court are impeached, the court of appeals ≈øhall ≈øet in judgment‚Äîbut all other officers of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ≈øhall be impeached before the general court. Therefore, the con≈øtitution meant to keep the offices di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, in di≈øtinct hands, becau≈øe it is po≈ø≈øible that they may try one another, and perhaps form a combination, in favour of the fraternity. This is too nice a deduction, and is a better argument in favour of an amendment of the con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, than of the que≈øtion under con≈øideration. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ≈øupply defects; nor can we reconcile ab≈øurdities, if any there be; this mu≈øt be done by the people; and were we about the bu≈øine≈øs of amendments duly authori≈øed, it might be well to con≈øider this point.‚ÄîBut I cannot ≈øee why a judge in chancery, if he be a judge al≈øo of the general court, may not be tried by the court of appeals; for if he be convicted of ≈øuch a crime, as he ought to be di≈øplaced office in either capacity, he would hardly be allowed to hold the other‚Äînor do I ≈øee why the judges of the general court, cannot try their brothers in chancery.</p>
               <p>The Legi≈ølature having a knowledge of this ca≈øe, cho≈øe to tru≈øt the powers in our hands, as in the ca≈øe of the high court of appeals who po≈ø≈øe≈øs both chancery and common law powers, and are yet impeachable before the general court, who ought not to have a ≈øtronger ≈øympathy or fellow-feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

for each other than for all the judges.

               <p>The next inquiry we are to make, brings us pointedly to the compari≈øon of the law now under contemplation, and the con≈øtitution, and how does it ≈øtand? the con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ≈øays that judges in chancery ≈øhall be appointed by joint ballot of both hou≈øes of a≈ø≈øembly, and commi≈ø≈øioned by the governor during good behaviour‚Äîand for the mo≈øt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble purpo≈øes; to ≈øecure the independence of the judiciary. ‚ÄîContrary to this expre≈øs direction, which admits of no doubt, implication or nice con≈øtruction, that bane to poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical freedom, the legi≈ølature has made the appointment by an act mandatory, to the judges, leaving them not at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to accept or refu≈øe the office conferred, which is a right every citizen enjoys, in every other ca≈øe‚Äîa right too ≈øacred to be yielded to any power on earth‚Äîbut, were I willing to do it as it relates to my≈øelf, as a judge I ought not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it would fru≈øtrate that mo≈øt important object before-mentioned‚Äîintended by the con≈øtitution to be kept ≈øacred, for the wi≈øe≈øt and be≈øt of purpo≈øes‚Äîto wit, that ju≈øtice and the law be done to all manner of per≈øons without fear or reward.‚Äî</p>

Neverthele≈øs, they met, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and re≈øolved for the <hi>common good.</hi> They were the <hi>people,</hi> a≈ø≈øembled by their deputies; not a <hi>legal,</hi> or <hi>con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional a≈ø≈øembly,</hi> or <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>government</hi> as then organiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.‚ÄîHence they were not, nor could be deemed the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary legi≈ølature; that body being compo≈øed of the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, council, and burge≈ø≈øes: who ≈øat in <hi>≈øeveral di≈øtinct chambers,</hi> and <hi>characters:</hi> while the other was compo≈øed of a <hi>≈øingle</hi> body, having neither the character of governor, council, or legitimate repre≈øentative among them: they were, in effect, <hi>the people them≈øelves,</hi> a≈ø≈øembled by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates, to whom the care of the commonwealth was e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, as well as unboundedly confided.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:027777_0039_0FD63DFAC022AB00"/>To prove this di≈øtinction ≈øtill farther. The power of convening the <hi>legal</hi> a≈ø≈øemblies, or the ordinary con≈øtitutional legi≈ølature, re≈øided ≈øolely in the executive: they could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be cho≈øen without writs i≈ø≈øued by it's authority, nor a≈ø≈øemble when cho≈øen, but under the ≈øame authority. The conventions, on the contrary, were cho≈øen, and a≈ø≈øembled, either in pur≈øuance of recommendations from Congre≈øs, or from their own bodies, or by the di≈øcretion, and common con≈øent of the people. They were held, even whil≈øt a legal a≈ø≈øembly exi≈øted. Witne≈øs the convention, held in Richmond in March, 1775: after which period, the legal, or con≈øtitutional a≈ø≈øembly was convened in William≈øburgh, by the governor, lord Dunmore; and continued fixting until finally di≈ø≈øolved by him in June or July 1775.‚ÄîNo other legal a≈ø≈øembly was ever cho≈øen, or convened under the Briti≈øh government.</p>
               <p>The convention then was not the ordinary legi≈ølature of Virginia. It was the body of the people, impelled to a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øemble from a ≈øen≈øe of common danger, con≈øulting for the common good, and acting in all things for the common ≈øafety. It could not be the legitimate legi≈ølature, under the then e≈øtabli≈øhed government, ≈øince that body could only be cho≈øen under the permi≈ø≈øion, and a≈ø≈øembled under the authority of the crown of Great Britain.</p>
               <p>But although the exerci≈øe of the authority of the excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive government under the crown of Great Britain cea≈øed altogether with the di≈ø≈øolution of that a≈ø≈øembly in June 1775, yet a con≈øtitutional dependence on the Briti≈øh government, was never denied, until the ≈øucceeding May, nor di≈ø≈øolved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the moment of adopting the pre≈øent con≈øtitution, or form of government; an event, which took effect by the <hi>unanimous voice</hi>

               <p>It ≈øeems to me an ob≈øervation of great importance, that the <hi>declaration of independence</hi> by <hi>this ≈øtate,</hi> was <hi>fir≈øt made</hi> in that in≈øtrument which <hi>e≈øtabli≈øhes our con≈øtitution.</hi> The in≈øtant that the declaration of independence took effect, had the convention proceeded no further, the government, as formerly exerci≈øed by the crown of Great Britain, being thereby totally di≈ø≈øolved, there would neither have been an ordinary legi≈ølature, nor any other organized body, or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Virginia. Every man would have been utterly ab≈øolved from every ≈øocial tie, and remitted to a perfect ≈øtate of nature. But a power to demoli≈øh the exi≈øting fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric of government, which no one will, I pre≈øume, at this day, deny to that convention, without authority to erect a new one, could never be pre≈øumed. A new organization
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:027777_0041_0FD63DFF72004EE8"/>
of the fabric, and a new arrangement of the powers of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, mu≈øt in≈øtantly take place, to prevent the≈øe evils which the ab≈øence of government mu≈øt infallibly produce in any ca≈øe; but more e≈øpecially under circum≈øtances ≈øo aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and pro≈øpects ≈øo threatening, as tho≈øe which ≈øurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people of America, at that alarming period. Is would therefore have been ab≈øurdity in the extreme, in the people of Virginia, to authorize the convention to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolve them from the bonds of one government, without the power to unite them under any other, at a time when the utmo≈øt exertions of government were required to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve both their liberties and their lives: but ≈øince they are <hi>both</hi> in <hi>form,</hi> and <hi>effect</hi> only <hi>different clau≈øes of the ≈øame act,</hi> and nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequences of each other, to que≈øtion the validity of the one, is to deny of the effect of the other. The <hi>declaration of independence,</hi> and the con≈øtitution, as the ACTS OF THE PEOPLE, mu≈øt therefore ≈øtand, or fall together.</p>
               <p>Here let me cite the opinion of an eminent lawyer on the one hand, and of an enlightened politician on the others on the ≈øubject of two national revolutions, the mo≈øt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to us of any, except our own.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The revolution of 1688, ≈øays judge Black≈øtone, 1 Corn. 211, was not a defeazance of the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, and a new limitation of the crown by the king, and both hou≈øes of parliament: it was the act of the nation alone, upon the conviction that there was no king in being.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The national a≈ø≈øembly of France, ≈øays the ingenious M'Kinto≈øh, p. 60. was a≈ø≈øembled as an ordinary legi≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture under exi≈øting laws. They were transformed by events into a national convention, and ve≈øted with powers to organize a new government. It is in vain that their adver≈øaries conte≈øt this a≈ø≈øertion by appealing to the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of forms. It is in vain to demand the legal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument that changed their con≈øtitution, and extended
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:027777_0042_0FD63E02749B4900"/>
their powers. Accurate forms in the conveyance of power are pre≈øcribed by the wi≈ødom of the law, in the regular admini≈øtration of ≈øtates. But great revolutions are too Immen≈øe for technical formality. All the ≈øanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that can be hoped from ≈øuch events is the voice of the people, however informally and irregularly expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed.</q> (Def. of Fr. Revo. 60.)</p>
               <p>Our ca≈øe was much ≈øtronger than either of tho≈øe. There was at lea≈øt the ≈øhadow of legal, con≈øtitutional authority in the convention parliament of England in 1688, as the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary legi≈ølature, and the national a≈ø≈øembly of France, was con≈øtitutionally a≈ø≈øembled under the authority of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment it ≈øubverted. The convention of Virginia had not the ≈øhadow of a legal, or con≈øtitutional form about it. It derived it's exi≈øtence and authority from a higher ≈øource; a power which can ≈øuper≈øede all law, and annul the con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution it≈øelf‚Äînamely, the <hi>people,</hi> in their <hi>≈øovereign, unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and <hi>unlimitable</hi> authority and capacity.</p>
               <p>From what I have ≈øaid, I am inclined to hope, that it will appear that our con≈øtitution was not the act of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary legi≈ølature: a few words concerning it's operation<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> authority, and effect, as the act of the people, may not be improper.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>A con≈øtitution, ≈øays the celebrated Paine, is not a thing in name only, but in fact. It has not an ideal, but a real exi≈øtence; and wherever it cannot be produced in a vi≈øible form, there is none. A con≈øtitution is a thing antecedent to government, and a government is only the creature of a con≈øtitution. It is not the act of the government, but of the people con≈øtituting a government. It is the body of elements to which you can refer, and quote article by article, and which contains the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples on which the government ≈øhall be e≈øtabli≈øhed, the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:027777_0043_0FD63E071DD24318"/>
manner in which it ≈øhall be organized, the powers it ≈øhall have, &amp;c. See Rights of Man, part I. p. 30.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Vattel, in treating of the fundamental laws of a ≈øtate, ob≈øerves, <q>that a nation may entru≈øt the exerci≈øe of the legi≈ølative power to the prince, or to an a≈ø≈øembly, or to that a≈ø≈øembly and the prince, jointly; who have then a right of making new, and of abrogating old laws. It is here demanded, whether if their power extends as far as the fundamental laws, they may change the con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ≈øtate? to this he an≈øwers, we may decide with certainty, that the authority of the≈øe legi≈ølators does not extend ≈øo far, and that they ought to con≈øider the fundamental laws as ≈øacred, if the nation has not in <hi>expre≈øs terms given them power to change them.</hi> For the con≈øtitution of the ≈øtate ought to be fixed; and ≈øince that was fir≈øt e≈øtabli≈øhed by the nation, which afterwards tru≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certain per≈øons, with the legi≈ølative powers, the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental laws are excepted from their commi≈ø≈øion. In ≈øhort, the≈øe legi≈ølators derive their power from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution: how then can they change it, without de≈øtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foundation of their authority?</q> Vattel, p. 31.</p>
               <p>That the legi≈ølature of this commonwealth have regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our con≈øtitution in this light, will appear from more than one authority. I ≈øhall ≈øelect the preamble of an act pa≈ø≈øed in May ≈øe≈ø≈øion, 1783. c. 32. Rev. Co. 204. entitled an act to amend an act, entitled an act concerning the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ≈øheriffs, which recites <q>that the former act was contrary to the con≈øtitution, or form of government,</q> for which rea≈øon it was repealed.‚ÄîA ≈øecond in≈øtance may be found in the acts of 1787, c. 23. which recites <q>that a former act, entitled an act to extend the powers of the governor and council, Rev. Co. 81. appears to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent general a≈ø≈øembly to be contrary to the true ≈øpirit of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:027777_0044_0FD63E08DC5F88D8"/>
the con≈øtitution:</q> wherefore it was repealed.‚ÄîTwo other in≈øtances may be found, the fir≈øt in the repeal <note n="*" place="bottom">1788, <hi>ch.</hi> 67.</note> of the act of 1787, c. 39. for e≈øtabli≈øhing di≈øtrict courts, whereby the <hi>judges of the court of appeals</hi> were required to act as <hi>judges of the di≈øtrict courts:</hi> the ≈øecond, in an act of the la≈øt ≈øe≈ø≈øion, 1792, ch. 28. providing for the republication of the laws of this commonwealth, which directs <q>that the bill of rights, and con≈øtitution, or form of government, ≈øhall be prefixed to the code of laws.</q>‚ÄîOther in≈øtances doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs may be found in our laws where the legi≈ølature have either expre≈øsly, or tacitly, recognized the con≈øtitution as paramount to their own legi≈ølative acts; ≈øo that rea≈øoning, in this in≈øtance, is confirmed by precedent.</p>
               <p>But here an objection will no doubt be drawn from the authority of tho≈øe writers who affirm, that the con≈øtitution of a ≈øtate is a rule to the <hi>legi≈ølature only,</hi> and not to the <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary,</hi> or the <hi>executive:</hi> the legi≈ølature being bound not to tran≈øgre≈øs it; but that neither the executive nor judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary can re≈øort to it to enquire whether they do tran≈øgre≈øs it, or not.</p>
               <p>This ≈øophi≈øm could never have obtained a moment's cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with the world, had ≈øuch a thing as a written con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion exi≈øted before the American revolution. <q>All the governments that now exi≈øt in the world, ≈øays a late writer,<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">M'Kinto≈øh on the Er. Rev. <hi>155.</hi>
                     </note> except the United States of America, have been fortuitou≈øly formed. They are the produce of chance, not the work of art. They have been altered, impaired, improved, and de≈øtroyed, by accidental circum≈øtances, beyond the fore≈øight or control of wi≈ødom; their parts thrown up again≈øt pre≈øent emergencies, formed no ≈øy≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic whole.</q> What the <hi>con≈øtitution</hi> of any country <hi>was,</hi> or rather <hi>was ≈øuppo≈øed to be,</hi> could only be collected from what the <hi>government had at any time done;</hi> what had
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:027777_0045_0FD63E0ACFA38E28"/>
been <hi>acquie≈øced</hi> in by the people, or other component parts of the government; or what had been <hi>re≈øi≈øted</hi> by either of them. Whatever the government, or any branch of it had <hi>once done,</hi> it was inferred they had a <hi>right</hi> to do <hi>again.</hi> The union of the legi≈ølative and executive powers in the ≈øame men, or body of men, en≈øured the ≈øucce≈øs of their u≈øurpations; and the judiciary, having no <hi>written con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to refer to, were obliged to <hi>receive</hi> whatever <hi>expo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of if the legi≈ølature might think proper to make.‚ÄîBut, with us, the con≈øtitution is not an <q>ideal thing, but a real exi≈øtence: it can be produced in a vi≈øible form:</q> its principles can be a≈øcertained from the living letter, not from ob≈øcure rea≈øoning or deductions only. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore, and all its branches mu≈øt be governed by the con≈øtitution. Hence it becomes the fir≈øt law of the land, and as ≈øuch mu≈øt be re≈øorted to on every occa≈øion, where it becomes nece≈ø≈øary to expound <hi>what the law is.</hi> This expo≈øition it is the duty and office of the judiciary to make; our con≈øtitution expre≈øsly declaring that the legi≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, executive, and judiciary, ≈øhall be ≈øeparate and di≈øtinct, ≈øo that neither exerci≈øe the powers properly belonging to the other.‚ÄîNow ≈øince it is the province of the legi≈ølature to make, and of the executive to enforce obedience to the laws, the duty of expounding mu≈øt be exclu≈øively ve≈øted in the judiciary.‚ÄîBut how can any ju≈øt expo≈øition be made, <hi>if that which is the ≈øupreme law of the land be withheld from their view?</hi> Suppo≈øe a que≈øtion had ari≈øen on either of the acts before cited, which the legi≈ølature have di≈øcovered to be uncon≈øtitutional, would the judiciary have been bound by the act, or by the con≈øtitution?</p>
               <p>But that the con≈øtitution is a rule to all the departments of the government, to the judiciary as well as to the legi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, may, I think, be proved by reference to a few parts of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:027777_0046_0FD63E0BEEC0F2C8"/>The bill of rights, art. 8. provides, that in all capital and criminal pro≈øecutions, the party accu≈øed ≈øhall be tried by a <hi>jury of the vicinage,</hi> and cannot be found guilty without their <hi>unanimous</hi> con≈øent.</p>
               <p>Suppo≈øe any future act of the legi≈ølature ≈øhould abridge either of the≈øe privileges, what would be ≈øaid of a court that ≈øhould act in conformity to ≈øuch an act?</p>
               <p>Again; art. 9. declares that exce≈ø≈øive bail ought not to be required. The act <note n="*" place="bottom">1785, <hi>ch.</hi> 80.</note> concerning bail, I apprehend, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to the ≈øuperior courts; perhaps not even to the county courts. Is this injunction a mere dead letter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the legi≈ølature have not yet pa≈ø≈øed a law equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten≈øive in its obligation?</p>
               <p>Art. 10. declares that general warrants are illegal and oppre≈ø≈øive, and ought not to be granted. Is this too a dead letter, becau≈øe we have no act of the legi≈ølature to enforce the obligation?</p>
               <p>Art. 16. ≈øecures the free exerci≈øe of our religious duties, according to the dictates of every man's own con≈øcience. Should the legi≈ølature, at any future period, e≈øtabli≈øh any particular mode of wor≈øhip, and enact penal laws to ≈øupport it, will the courts of this commonwealth be bound to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force tho≈øe penalties?</p>
               <p>Art. 15. of the con≈øtitution, declares that the clerks of courts ≈øhall hold their offices during good behaviour, to be judged of and determined in the general court. Can any legi≈ølative act give any other court cognizance of ≈øuch a ca≈øe?‚ÄîOr can any impeachment be tried in any court of this commonwealth, except this court, and the court of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, even ≈øhould an act of the legi≈ølature (as was once contemplated) erect a court for that e≈øpecial purpo≈øe?</p>
               <p>From all the≈øe in≈øtances it appears to me that this deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion clearly follows, viz. that the <hi>judiciary</hi> are <hi>bound</hi> to take notice of the con≈øtitution, <hi>as the fir≈øt law of the land;</hi> and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:027777_0047_0FD63E0F0B3969C0"/>
that what≈øoever is contradictory thereto, is <hi>not</hi> the law of the land.</p>
               <p>And here I ≈øhall avail my≈øelf of the rea≈øoning of one of the able≈øt political writers that has appeared in America.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pub. v. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>293.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Some perplexity re≈øpecting the right of the courts to pronounce legi≈ølative acts void, becau≈øe contrary to the con≈øtitution, has ari≈øen, he ob≈øerves, from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a ≈øuperiority of the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary over the legi≈ølative power. It is urged that the power which can declare the acts of another void, mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily be ≈øuperior to the one who≈øe acts may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared void.</p>
               <p>But there is no po≈øition which depends on clearer prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, than that every act of a delegated authority, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the tenor of the commi≈ø≈øion under which it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øed, is void. No legi≈ølative act therefore, contrary to the con≈øtitution, can be valid. To deny this would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than the principal; that the ≈øervant is above his ma≈øter; that the repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the people are ≈øuperior to the people them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>If it be ≈øaid that the legi≈ølative body are them≈øelves the con≈øtitutional judges of their own powers, and that the con≈øtruction they put upon them is conclu≈øive upon the other departments, it may be an≈øwered that this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the natural pre≈øumption, where it is not to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from any particular provi≈øions in the con≈øtitution. It is not otherwi≈øe to be ≈øuppo≈øed that the con≈øtitution could intend to enable the repre≈øentatives of the people to ≈øub≈øtitute their will to that of their con≈øtituents. It is far more rational to ≈øuppo≈øe that the courts were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned to be an intermediate body between the people and the legi≈ølature, in order, among other things, to keep
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:027777_0048_0FD63E115C946800"/>
the latter within the limits a≈ø≈øigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar province of the courts. A con≈øtitution is in fact, and mu≈øt be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to a≈øcertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legi≈ølative body. If there be an irreconcileable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance between the two, that which has the ≈øuperior ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation and validity ought of cour≈øe to be preferred; or, in other words, the con≈øtitution ought to be preferred to the ≈øtatutes; the intention of the people to the intention of their agents.</p>
               <p>Nor does this conclu≈øion by any means ≈øuppo≈øe a ≈øupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of the judiciary to the legi≈ølative power. It only ≈øuppo≈øes that the power of the people is ≈øuperior to both; and that where the will of the legi≈ølature, declared in its ≈øtatutes, ≈øtands in appo≈øition to that of the people, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the con≈øtitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter, rather than the former.

the ≈øubject, and ≈øhall now proceed to the ≈øecond point, viz.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether, according to the con≈øtitution of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, a judge of the general court can exerci≈øe the functions of a judge in chancery?</p>
               <p>There again I mu≈øt recur to one of the fundamental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our government, a principle e≈ø≈øentially and indi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øably nece≈ø≈øary to its exi≈øtence as a free government, exerci≈øed by the immediate authority of the people, dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to the ≈øervants of their own choice, viz. the ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the legi≈ølative, executive, and judiciary depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The≈øe departments, as I have before ob≈øerved, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution declares ≈øhall be for ever ≈øeparate and di≈øtinct. To be ≈øo, they mu≈øt be independent one of another, ≈øo that neither can control, or annihilate the other.</p>
               <p>The independence of the judiciary re≈øults from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of their office, which the con≈øtitution declares ≈øhall be <hi>during good behaviour.</hi> The offices which they are to fill mu≈øt therefore in their nature be permanent as the con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution it≈øelf, and not liable to be di≈øcontinued or annihilated by any other branch of the government. Hence the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution has provided that the judiciary department ≈øhould be arranged in ≈øuch a manner as not to be ≈øubject to legi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative control. The court of appeals, court of chancery, and general court, are tribunals expre≈øsly required by it; and in the≈øe courts the judiciary power is either immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or ultimately ve≈øted.</p>
               <p>The≈øe courts can neither be annihilated or di≈øcontinued by any legi≈ølative act; nor can the judges of them be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from their offices for any cau≈øe, except a breach of their good behaviour.</p>
               <p>But if the legi≈ølature might at any time di≈øcontinue or annihilate either of the≈øe courts, it is plain that their tenure
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:027777_0050_0FD63E12B46139B8"/>
of office might be changed, ≈øince a judge, without any breach of good behaviour, might in effect be removed from office, by annihilating or di≈øcontinuing the office it≈øelf.</p>
               <p>This has been proved in the ca≈øe of the former court of appeals.<note n="*" place="bottom">Virg. Acts <hi>vi. 1788,</hi> ch. <hi>68.</hi>
                  </note> The moment that it was di≈øcovered that that court was not con≈øtituted according to the directions of the con≈øtitution, the legi≈ølature, without any charge of a breach of good behaviour by any one of that court, <hi>removed a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority</hi> of the judges from their office, as judges of that court, <hi>by new-moddelling the court altogether.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am far from con≈øidering this act of the legi≈ølature as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øtitutional, for rea≈øons that I ≈øhall hereafter mention.</p>
               <p>But it proves that the judiciary can never be indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ≈øo long as the exi≈øtence of the office depends upon the will of the ordinary legi≈ølature, and not upon a con≈øtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al foundation.</p>
               <p>The di≈øtrict courts con≈øidered as independent of the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ral court,</hi> and not a modification of it, are merely <hi>legi≈ølative</hi> courts, and con≈øequently may be di≈øcontinued, or annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, whenever the legi≈ølature may think proper to aboli≈øh them.‚ÄîAnd if the judges of tho≈øe courts held their offices only as judges of the di≈øtrict courts, they might be virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in fact, removed from office, as the judges of the former court of appeals were, by a legi≈ølative act, di≈øconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the courts, and transferring their juri≈ødiction to other tribunals, <hi>without any breach of good behaviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence ari≈øes a mo≈øt important di≈øtinction between <hi>con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional</hi> and <hi>legi≈ølative</hi> courts. The judges of the former hold an office co-exi≈øtent with the government it≈øelf, and which they can only forfeit by a breach of good behaviour. The judges of the latter, although their commi≈ø≈øions ≈øhould import upon the face of them, to be during good behaviour,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:027777_0051_0FD63E14B5AC6310"/>
may be at any time di≈øcontinued from their office, by aboli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the courts.‚ÄîIn other words, con≈øtitutional judges may be an independent branch of the government, legi≈ølative judges mu≈øt ever be dependant on that body at who≈øe will their offices exi≈øt.</p>
               <p>If the principles of our government have e≈øtabli≈øhed the judiciary as a barrier again≈øt the po≈ø≈øible u≈øurpation, or abu≈øe of power in the other departments, how ea≈øily may that principle be evaded by converting our courts into le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølative, in≈øtead of Con≈øtitutional tribunals?</p>
               <p>To pre≈øerve this principle in it's full vigour, it is nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary that the con≈øtitutional courts ≈øhould all be re≈øtrained within tho≈øe limits which the con≈øtitution it≈øelf ≈øeems to have a≈ø≈øigned to them re≈øpectively.</p>
               <p>What tho≈øe limits are, may be collected from the 14th article, <note n="*" place="bottom">Con≈øt. Virg. ar. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> which provides for the appointment of <q>judges <hi>of the ≈øupreme court of</hi> appeals, <hi>and</hi> general court, judges <hi>in</hi> chancery, judges <hi>of</hi> admiralty,</q> &amp;c. This ≈øpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of judges of <hi>≈øeveral tribunals,</hi> would lead us of it≈øelf to conclude, that the tribunals them≈øelves were meant to be ≈øeparate and di≈øtinct <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Since every word in that in≈øtrument, the con≈øtitution of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, ≈øhould be con≈øtrued to have its effect; a rule applied to all written in≈øtruments what≈øoever, and more peculiarly applicable, I ≈øhould pre≈øume, to that which expre≈ø≈øes the collective, and ≈øovereign will, and intention of the people.</note>. This conclu≈øion ≈øeems to be warranted by two circum≈øtances, the one extrin≈øic, the other ari≈øing out of the con≈øtitution it≈øelf. Tho≈øe who recollect the ≈øituation of our juri≈øprudence, at the time of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, will remember that the union of civil and criminal, common law, and equity juri≈ødiction, all in the general

court, was one of the mo≈øt obvious defects of that ≈øy≈øtem. In truth, nothing can be more dangerous to the citizen, than the union of criminal courts, and courts of equity. On the European continent, where≈øoever the civil law has been adopted, criminal and civil proceedings have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted upon the like principles: the defendant in <hi>civil</hi> ca≈øes might be examined upon oath by interrogatories, to which if he gave not ≈øatisfactory an≈øwers he might be committed until he did<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> this principle being extended to <hi>criminal</hi> ca≈øes, was denominated by the moderate term of putting the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon accu≈øed to the <hi>que≈øtion:</hi> but ina≈ømuch as the forcing a criminal to accu≈øe him≈øelf on <hi>oath,</hi> might prove a <hi>≈ønare to his con≈øcience,</hi> the obligation to an≈øwer to the que≈øtion, <hi>was inforced by torture.</hi> To ≈øeparate forever, courts, who≈øe principles and proceedings are ≈øo diametrically oppo≈øite, as tho≈øe of the common and civil law, was, I ≈øhould pre≈øume, one of the fundamental principles which the framers of our con≈øtitution had an eye to. They, therefore, di≈øtributed the powers of the <hi>then exi≈øting general court</hi> into three di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct branches, viz. the court of appeals, the court of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, and the court of general juri≈ødiction, at common law. The repetition of the term, judges, ≈øhews that it was in contemplation that both the tribunals, and the judges ≈øhould be di≈øtinct and ≈øeparate. This is farther confirmed by art. 16 and 17:<note n="*" place="bottom">Con≈øt. Virg. arts. <hi>16.</hi> and <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note> the former of which provides that impeachments in general ≈øhall be pro≈øecuted in <hi>this</hi> court, the latter that impeachments again≈øt the judges of <hi>this court,</hi> ≈øhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecuted in the <hi>court of appeals.</hi> Nothing, then, can be clearer than that the con≈øtitution intended they ≈øhould be di≈øtinct judges of di≈øtinct courts. And hence I am ≈øatisfied, that the former court of appeals was uncon≈øtitutionally or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:027777_0053_0FD63E1DA44AF078"/>
This rea≈øoning, I apprehend will apply no le≈øs forcibly to the ≈øeparation of the general court from the court of chancery. A judge of the general court, if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, can be pro≈øecuted in the <hi>court</hi> of <hi>appeals only;</hi> a judge in chancery <hi>only</hi> in the <hi>general court:</hi> if the≈øe offices be united in the ≈øame per≈øon, it mu≈øt be by ≈øeparate commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions; a judgment on impeachment in the general court, cannot vacate the commi≈ø≈øion of a judge of that court, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the con≈øtitution has a≈ø≈øigned another tribunal, where a judge of that court ≈øhall be tried; a judgment in the court of appeals cannot vacate the commi≈ø≈øion of a judge in chancery, becau≈øe he mu≈øt be tried, <hi>as ≈øuch,</hi> in the general court. Hence it ≈øeems to me we are driven to conclude that the con≈øtitution meant that the two offices ≈øhall be ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and di≈øtinct. This con≈øtruction removes every difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the contrary, I apprehend, creates a multitude, and tho≈øe in≈øurmountable<note n="*" place="bottom">A curious que≈øtion might here be propounded. Suppo≈øe a judge of the general court, holding al≈øo a commi≈ø≈øion as a judge in chancery, and ≈øitting as a judge of a di≈øtrict court, where his functions were unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ≈øhould receive a bribe from one of the parties to a ≈øuit depending there before him: that on the trial at law he ≈øhall endeavour to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the jury, and ≈øhall after grant an injunction to the party from who he received the bribe: Mu≈øt there be two impeachments and two trials, in different courts in this ca≈øe, or could one trial, and one judgment vacate both commi≈ø≈øions?</note>. In pur≈øuance of this direction, contained in the con≈øtitution, the legi≈ølature, when it ≈øet about organizing the courts, di≈øtributed them as above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The criminal and common law court, was ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the court of equity; and both from the court of appeals, in form, though not in reality, until the legi≈ølature, by the act of 1788, c. 68. corrected it's former error. And
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:027777_0054_0FD63E1EB86082A8"/>
thus di≈øtinct have they remained, until the act of the la≈øt ≈øe≈ø≈øion, which hath not indeed united the con≈øtitutional courts, but hath blended them in effect, by a≈ø≈øigning the functions of a judge in chancery to the judges of this court; and if carried into effect may lead to the total annihilation of all the courts which the con≈øtitution had in contemplation to e≈øtabli≈øh.</p>
               <p>I have ≈øaid before (pa. 52,) that the di≈øtrict courts con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as independent of the general court, and not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of it, are mere legi≈ølative, and not con≈øtitutional courts. If they are a modification only of the general court, it flows from what I have already ≈øaid, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution prohibits the exerci≈øe of chancery juri≈ødiction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. If they be mere legi≈ølative courts, it cannot be the duty of any judge of a con≈øtitutional court, <hi>merely as ≈øuch,</hi> to exerci≈øe the functions of a judge of the≈øe courts: and it is, I conceive, expre≈øsly contrary to the duty of a con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional judge of one court, to exerci≈øe the functions of a con≈øtitutional judge of another di≈øtinct con≈øtitutional court.</p>
               <p>It appears then immaterial, whether, on the pre≈øent que≈øtion, the di≈øtrict courts are to be con≈øidered as branches of the general court, or not: yet it would be ea≈øy to ≈øhew, that as they are at pre≈øent modified and organized, they are nothing more than branches of that court; and not di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, independent, legi≈ølative courts; unle≈øs the operation of the act in que≈øtion ≈øhould be con≈øtrued to affect and change their whole ≈øy≈øtem, and con≈øtitution.</p>
               <p>But, if they are mere legi≈ølative courts, they may, at any time, be organized at the will of the legi≈ølature: le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølative judges may be appointed, the tenor of who≈øe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion may import that their office ≈øhall be during good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and yet that office be di≈øcontinued whenever the legi≈ølature may think fit. If the juri≈ødiction of the court of chancery can be con≈øtitutionally transferred to them, ≈øo
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:027777_0055_0FD63E202F6E8078"/>
may that of the general court, and of the court of appeals. In fine the≈øe legi≈ølative courts may ab≈øorb all the juri≈ødic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, powers and functions of the con≈øtitutional courts. The≈øe la≈øt then mu≈øt either be ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed, as u≈øele≈øs, which the con≈øtitution forbids<note n="*" place="bottom">Art. <hi>14.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. I ≈øhall now proceed to take a ≈øhort view of the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as founded upon a ≈øolemn deci≈øion of the court of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, on a ≈øimilar occa≈øion.</p>
               <p>It will not, I pre≈øume, be denied that the deci≈øions of the ≈øupreme court of appeals in this commonwealth, upon any que≈øtion, whether ari≈øing upon the general principles of law, the operation or con≈øtruction of any ≈øtatute or act of a≈ø≈øembly, or of the con≈øtitution of this commonwealth, are to be re≈øorted to by all other courts, as expounding, in their true≈øt ≈øen≈øe, the laws of the land; and where any deci≈øion of that court applies to a ca≈øe depending before any other tribunal, that tribunal is bound to regulate its deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions conformably to tho≈øe of the court of appeals. This po≈øtulatum I conceive to be too obviou≈øly founded upon the principles of our government to require an attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrate it. Proceeding upon this ground, I ≈øhall take up
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:027777_0056_0FD63E221A6483F8"/>
the que≈øtion upon the authority of a previous deci≈øion of that court, on a ≈øimilar que≈øtion.</p>
               <p>In the year 1787, the fir≈øt act e≈øtabli≈øhing di≈øtrict courts was pa≈ø≈øed. This act <q>declared it to be the duty of the judges of the high court of appeals to attend the ≈øaid courts, allotting among them≈øelves the di≈øtricts they ≈øhould re≈øpectively attend; three judges to be allotted to each di≈øtrict; any two of whom ≈øhould con≈øtitute a court.</q> ch. 39. ¬ß 3.</p>
               <p>It ≈øhould be remembered, that at that time the court of appeals was compo≈øed of the judges of the high court of chancery; judges of the general court; and judges of the court of admiralty. The office of the judge of the court of appeals was, at that time, as it were, incidentally annexed to their appointment to a ≈øeat on either of the other tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</p>
               <p>A part of the duty a≈ø≈øigned to the court of appeals by that act was the appointment of clerks to the di≈øtrict courts, which the act required ≈øhould be done at the next ≈øucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øe≈ø≈øion of the court of appeals. Ib. ¬ß 2.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of May following, the court made the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing entry upon their records. <q>On con≈øideration of a late act of a≈ø≈øembly, entitled an act e≈øtabli≈øhing di≈øtrict courts, after ≈øeveral conferences, and upon mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, the court do <hi>adjudge</hi> that clerks of the ≈øaid courts ought not now to be appointed, for rea≈øons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a remon≈øtrance to the general a≈ø≈øembly:</q>‚Äî which remon≈øtrance is likewi≈øe entered on record, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, among other things, the following important pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øages.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in di≈øcu≈ø≈øing the act e≈øtabli≈øhing di≈øtrict courts, the court found it unavoidable to con≈øider, whether the principles of that act do not violate tho≈øe of the con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:027777_0057_0FD63E23A88536F8"/>
or form of government, which the people, in 1776, when the former bands of their ≈øociety were di≈ø≈øolved, e≈øtabli≈øhed as the foundation of that government which they judged nece≈ø≈øary for the pre≈øervation of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons and property; and if ≈øuch violation were apparent, whether they had power, and it was their duty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the act mu≈øt yield to the con≈øtitution?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they found them≈øelves obliged to decide, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever temporary inconveniencies might ari≈øe, and in that deci≈øion to declare, that the con≈øtitution and the act were in oppo≈øition, and could not exi≈øt together, and that the former mu≈øt control the latter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the propriety and nece≈ø≈øity of the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the judges is evident in rea≈øon, and the nature of their office, ≈øince they are to decide between govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the people, as well as between contending citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; and if they be dependent on either, corrupt influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be apprehended.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That this applies more forcibly to exclude a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the legi≈ølature, a branch of whom, in ca≈øes of impeachment, is it≈øelf a party.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To obviate a po≈ø≈øible objection that the court, while they are maintaining the independence of the judiciary, are countenancing encroachments of that branch upon the departments of others, and a≈ø≈øuming a right to control the legi≈ølature, it may be ob≈øerved, that when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide between an act of the people, and an act of the legi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, they are within the line of their duty, declaring what the law is, and not making a new law.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That although the duties of their office wer not a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained at the time of e≈øtabli≈øhing the con≈øtitution, yet in re≈øpect thereto, the con≈øtitution gives a principle, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that "no future regulation ≈øhould blend the duties of the judges of the general court, court of chancery,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:027777_0058_0FD63E25CDFD6FA8"/>

               <p>The≈øe declarations, according to my weak apprehen≈øions, comprehend the pre≈øent que≈øtion in the fulle≈øt extent. I ≈øhould therefore be of opinion, upon the ground of this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as well as upon the conviction of my own mind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent thereof, which, unle≈øs ≈øo fortified, I might have mi≈øtru≈øted, that we ought to certify to the di≈øtrict court of Dumfries <q>That in the opinion of this court, a judge of the general court cannot con≈øtitutionally exerci≈øe the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a judge in chancery.</q> But the judges who have already delivered their opinions, although ≈øome of them ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pear to di≈ø≈øent from me upon this point, having unanimou≈øly concurred in another, viz.

            <head>THE RESPECTFUL REMONSTRANCE OF THE COURT OF APPEALS.</head>
            <p>THE remon≈øtrants finding them≈øelves called upon by a late act of the general a≈ø≈øembly, intituled, "an act e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhing di≈øtrict courts," to proceed at this ≈øe≈ø≈øion to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of clerks to the ≈øaid courts, that whole act was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øarily brought into their view; in con≈øidering which they encountered many difficulties, of an ordinary nature, ≈øuch as whether their power of appointing now, though directed by the 2nd ≈øection, was not controled by the 116th, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the act ≈øhould take effect, and be in force, from and after the fir≈øt day of July, in the year 1788, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whether the di≈øtrict courts have juri≈ødiction of any ≈øuits now depending in the general court, of above thirty pounds value; whether any, and what, provi≈øion was made
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:027777_0075_0FD63E4AF368CFF8"/>
for the trial of criminals who might remain in the public jail after the ≈øe≈ø≈øion of the general court in June next, or who might be examined and committed prior to the ≈øaid fir≈øt day of July; and whether for want of preci≈øion in ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other parts of the law, it was, in the re≈øpective ca≈øes to operate from the time of pa≈ø≈øing, or from the fir≈øt day of July.</p>
            <p>(In other in≈øtances, particularly in the con≈øtruction of the late execution law, regularly brought before the court this term, they have to lament the la≈øt difficulty, which they found ≈øo great that nothing but the repo≈øe of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the nece≈ø≈øity of having one uniform ≈øy≈øtem in that re≈øpect could have induced the court to decide upon it at la≈øt without further con≈øideration.)</p>
            <p>But in the progre≈øs of their di≈øcu≈ø≈øion, they found it unavoidable to con≈øider more important que≈øtions, viz: whether the principles of this act do not violate tho≈øe of the con≈øtitution or form of government, which the people in 1776, when the former bands of their ≈øociety were di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved, e≈øtabli≈øhed as the foundation of that government which they judged nece≈ø≈øary for the pre≈øervation of their per≈øons and property; and if ≈øuch violation were apparent, whether they had power, and it was their duty, to declare that act mu≈øt yield to the con≈øtitution.</p>
            <p>And here they have again to lament, that there ≈øhould be occa≈øion to decide tho≈øe important que≈øtions in any ca≈øe, e≈øpecially at a time when the minds of the citizens are agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated upon other que≈øtions of great and national concern, more ≈øo that the nece≈ø≈øity ≈øhould occur in a ca≈øe wherein their individual intere≈øts are involved, and ≈øtill more that a deci≈øion one way might ≈øu≈øpend, though for a ≈øhort time, the beneficial effects of a law tending to promote the ≈øpeedy and ea≈øy admini≈øtration of ju≈øtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="unknown:027777_0076_0FD63E4CD5095C58"/>On this view of the ≈øubject, the following alternative pre≈øented them≈øelves to the court; either to decide tho≈øe que≈øtions, or re≈øign their offices. The latter would have been their choice, if they could have con≈øidered the que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as affecting their individual intere≈øts only; but viewing them as relating to their office, and finding them≈øelves cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by their country to ≈øu≈øtain an important po≈øt as one of the three pillars on which the great fabric of government was erected, they judged that a re≈øignation would ≈øubject them to the reproach of de≈øerting their ≈øtation, and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øacred intere≈øts of ≈øociety entru≈øted with them, and on that ground found them≈øelves obliged to decide, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their delicacy might be wounded, or whatever tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary inconveniencies might en≈øue, and in that deci≈øion to declare that the con≈øtitution and the act are in oppo≈øition and cannot exi≈øt together, and that the former mu≈øt control the operation of the latter. If this opinion declaring the ≈øupremacy of the con≈øtitution needed any ≈øupport, it may be found in the opinion of the legi≈ølature them≈øelves, who have in ≈øeveral in≈øtances con≈øidered the con≈øtitution as pre≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing limits to their powers as well as to tho≈øe of the other departments of government.</p>
            <p>In forming their judgment upon both que≈øtions they had recour≈øe to that article in the declaration of rights, that no free government, or the ble≈ø≈øings of liberty can be pre≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any people but (among other things) by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles; an article worthy to be written in letters of gold. The propriety and nece≈ø≈øity of the independence of the judges is evident in rea≈øon, and the nature of their office, ≈øince they are to decide between government and the people as well as between contending citizens, and if they be dependent on either, corrupt influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be apprehended, ≈øacrificing the innocent to popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar prejudice; and ≈øubjecting the poor to oppre≈ø≈øion and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecution
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:027777_0077_0FD63E51D3D69148"/>
by the rich, and this applies more forcibly to exclude a dependence on the legi≈ølature, a branch of whom in ca≈øes of impeachment, is it≈øelf a party. This principle ≈øuppo≈øed, the court are led to con≈øider, whether the people have ≈øecured, or departed from it, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution or form of government. In that ≈øolemn act they di≈øcover the people di≈øtributing the governmental powers, into three great branches, legi≈ølature, executive, and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, in order to pre≈øerve that equipoi≈øe which they judged nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øecure their liberty, declaring that tho≈øe powers be kept ≈øeparate and di≈øtinct from each other, and that no per≈øon ≈øhall exerci≈øe at the ≈øame time an office in more than one of them. The independence of the two former could not be admitted, becau≈øe in them a long continuance in office might be dangerous to liberty, and therefore they provided for a change, by frequent elections at ≈øtated periods; but in the la≈øt from the influence of the principle before ob≈øerved upon, they declared that the judges ≈øhould hold their offices during good behaviour. Their independence would have been rendered compleat, by fixing the quantum of their ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries, which perhaps would have been done, if the duties of office had been at that time a≈øcertained. But although it was not then done, yet in re≈øpect to this, the con≈øtitution gives a principle, not to be departed from, declaring that the ≈øalaries ≈øhall be adequate and fixed, leaving it to the legi≈ølature to judge what would be adequate when they ≈øhould appoint the duties. And when they had ≈øo done, they exerci≈øed their whole power over the ≈øubject, and the ≈øalary was thenceforth to be con≈øidered as fixed, while the duties ≈øhould continue the ≈øame. And when public utility ≈øhould require an increa≈øe or diminution of duty, there ≈øhould be an analogous alteration of ≈øalary, with this re≈øtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion however, that ≈øuch regulation ≈øhould not blend the duties of the judges of the general court, court of chancery,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:027777_0078_0FD63E549AE7B9D0"/>
and court of admiralty, which the con≈øtitution ≈øeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be exerci≈øed by di≈øtinct per≈øons; and the legi≈ølature appear to have ≈øo con≈øidered it in the arrangement of tho≈øe courts.</p>
            <p>The court of appeals of whom≈øoever con≈øtituted, mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily act upon the ≈øubjects referred to all the others, and therefore the forming it ≈øo as to con≈øi≈øt of all the judges is no violation of the con≈øtitution; and that mode, a≈ø≈øimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to adjournments of ca≈øes before all the judges of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in the exchequer chamber, may have been dictated by nece≈ø≈øity.</p>
            <p>The court then proceeded to con≈øider what had been done by the legi≈ølature in con≈øequence of the con≈øtitution. In the October ≈øe≈ø≈øion of 1777, they pa≈ø≈øed two acts, orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing the general court and court of chancery, giving to the former juri≈ødiction at common law, in civil ca≈øes as well as criminal, and to the latter juri≈ødiction in all ca≈øes in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The duties of each were di≈øtinctly pointed out, and a ≈øalary of five hundred pounds to each judge was thought by the legi≈ølature to be an adequate reward for tho≈øe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and this previous to the appointment of any judges. The election of the judges followed, when four of tho≈øe at pre≈øent in office were of the number elected; who, thinking as they ≈øtill think the ≈øalary was adequate to the ≈øervices, declined other pur≈øuits, and accepted their appointments, under a confidence that the con≈øtitution <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>„Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> them to that ≈øalary, ≈øo long as they ≈øhould perform the duty, in an upright manner.</p>
            <p>The nominal ≈øum they conceived was to be paid them in ≈øpecie, or in ≈øomething equivalent thereto, and they have rea≈øon to believe the legi≈ølature ≈øo under≈øtood it, from laws in force at that period, making it penal to demand an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the difference between ≈øpecie and paper money.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:027777_0079_0FD63E5731930A40"/>And though the other judges have been called into duty by ≈øub≈øequent appointments, they may be ≈øuppo≈øed to ≈øtand upon the ≈øame ground of original compact. The court of admiralty, indeed, was not permanently con≈øtituted 'till the year one thou≈øand ≈øeven hundred and ≈øeventy-nine, and the judges then appointed; yet by being made judges of the court of appeals, they have ever ≈øince been put upon the ≈øame footing with their brethren in point of ≈øalary. The various ≈øub≈øtitutions of paper money and tobacco for ≈øpecie, which was not to be had, the judges con≈øidered as temporary expedients, which, though operating greatly to the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of their ≈øalaries, were not de≈øigned to affect their independence; and therefore they acquie≈øced, content to ≈øhare in the public calamities, in hopes of a recurrence to the con≈øtitutional principle in better times. And they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered in the ≈øame light the act of one thou≈øand ≈øeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighty-one, ≈øtating the ≈øalary at three hundred pounds, as dictated by nece≈ø≈øity, and not proceeding from de≈øign, and therefore, did not conceive it to be their official duty to interpo≈øe.</p>
            <p>But the act now under con≈øideration, pre≈øenting a ≈øy≈øtem, which a≈ø≈øigns to the judges of the chancery and admiralty juri≈ødiction in common law ca≈øes, which ≈øo far may be con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a new office, the labour of which would greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that of the former, without a corre≈øpondent reward, and to the judges of the general court duties, which though not changed as to their ≈øubjects are yet more than doubled, without any increa≈øe of ≈øalary, appeared ≈øo evident an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack upon the independency of the judges that they thought it incon≈øi≈øtent with a con≈øcientious di≈øcharge of their duty to pa≈øs it over. For vain would be the precaution of the founders of our government to ≈øecure liberty, if the legi≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture though re≈øtrained from changing the tenure of judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al offices, are at liberty to compel a re≈øignation by reducing
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:027777_0080_0FD63E58A06A8DB0"/>
≈øalaries to a copper, or by making it a part of the official duty to become hewers of wood and drawers of water, or if in ca≈øe of a contrary di≈øpo≈øition, they can make ≈øalaries exhorbitant, or by le≈ø≈øening the duties render offices almo≈øt ≈øinecures; the independency of the judiciary is in either ca≈øe, equally annihilated. The court, however, willing to hope, that in the pre≈øent in≈øtance the legi≈ølature had no ≈øuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign, but that inattention or ≈øome other circum≈øtances might occa≈øion the deviation, and that upon a revi≈øion of the ≈øubject, this law will be placed upon unexceptionable ground, had only to con≈øider what ought to be their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the mean time. The re≈øult of which was that they ought not to do any thing officially in execution of an act which appeared to be contrary to the ≈øpirit of the con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore they declined to appoint the clerks of the di≈øtrict courts, under the ≈øaid act.</p>
            <p>To obviate a po≈ø≈øible objection, that the court, while they are maintaining the independency of the judiciary, are countenancing encroachments of that branch upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments of others, and a≈ø≈øuming a right to control the legi≈ølature, it may be ob≈øerved that when they decide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an act of the people and an act of the legi≈ølature, they are within the line of their duty, declaring what the law is, and not making a new law. And ever di≈øpo≈øed to maintain harmony with the other members of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary to promote the happine<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
