            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THE public will naturally be inquiſitive as to the authenticity of the following letters. For every thing elſe, they will ſpeak for themſelves: and, for their genuineneſs, the Editor conceives himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to give only ſuch vouchers as he himſelf has received. By the laſt pacquet he was ſavoured with a letter from a friend, now ſerving in a loyal corps under Brigadier-General De Lancey of New-York, of which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſy to withhold it from the public at large: inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as, in his judgment, it exhibits a fairer and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler view of American politics, than the world has yet ſeen.</p>
               <p>— "Among the priſoners at Fort-Lee, I eſpied a mulatto fellow, whom I thought I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and who confirmed my conjectures by gazing very earneſtly at me. I aſked him, if he knew me. At firſt, he was unwilling to own it; but, when he was about to be carried off, thinking, I ſuppoſe, that I might, perhaps, be of ſome ſervice to him, he came and told me, that he was Billy, and the old ſervant of General Waſhington. He had been left there on account of an indiſpoſition which prevented his attending his maſter. I aſked him a great many queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:015868_0003_0F9A2FEF0EE36E90"/>
as you may ſuppoſe; but found very little ſatisfaction in his anſwers. At laſt, however, he told me that he had a ſmall portmanteau of his maſter's; of which, when he found that he muſt be put into confinement, he intreated my care. It contained only a few ſtockings and ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rts; and I could ſee nothing worth my care, except an Almanack, in which he had kept a ſort of a journal, or diary of his proceedings ſince his firſt coming to New-York: there were alſo two letters from his lady, one from Mr. Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>is, and ſome pretty long ones from a Mr Lund Waſhington. And in the ſame bundle with them, the firſt draughts, or foul copies, of anſwers to them. I read theſe with avidity; and being highly entertained with them, have ſhewn them to ſeveral of my friends, who all agree with me, that he is a very different character from what they had ſuppoſed him. I never knew a man ſo much to be pitied. If I remember right, you have ſeen, and have ſome knowledge of him; but it is impoſſible you could form ſo juſt an eſtimate of him, as theſe letters will give you. They contain alſo, as you will find, a deal of information, not to be had any where elſe: I aſſure myſelf therefore, you will thank me for the trouble I have taken in copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for your peruſal."</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THOUGH I wrote to you but a very few days ago, and have nothing new of much moment to communicate, I cannot deny myſelf the comfort of unburthening my mind to you, whenever I have a little leiſure, amid the thouſand anxieties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes that almoſt diſtract me. I know the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your heart, and that you will attend to me with indulgence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſympathy, though it be not in your power any otherwiſe to afford me relief. There

cannot, in the nature of things, be a ſituation ſo truly irkſome to an ingenuous mind, as the being perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obliged to act a part foreign to our true feelings; yet this alas! as you know, is, and muſt be my lot. I wear a countenance dreſſed in the calm ſerenity of perfect confidence, whilſt my heart is corroded with infinite apprehenſions, and I have no boſom friend near me, to whom I dare lay it open. Tell me Lund, for you have long been privy to my moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughts,—truſting to thy native candour, I have never heſitated to lay my heart bare and open to thy inſpection; tell me then, am I, do you think, more ſubject to fears than other men? For I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it from you, that, at this moment, I feel myſelf a very coward. Do not miſtake me—I thank my God, I have never yet known what it was to fear for any perſonal danger that might befal me. I am not afraid to die — why ſhould I? I am afraid only to die with infamy and diſgrace. And, if I am afraid ſo to die, need I tell you that I am ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more afra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Heaven, knows how truly I love my country; and that I embarked in this arduous enterprize on the pureſt motives. But we have overſhot our mark: we have graſped at things beyond our reach: it is impoſſible we ſhould ſucceed; and, I cannot with truth, ſay that I am ſorry for it; becauſe I am far from being ſure that we deſerve to ſucceed. That the Britiſh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry had meditated ſchemes fatal to the liberties of America; and that, if we had not oppoſed their firſt efforts to impoſe taxes upon us, without our conſent, we might have bid adieu to every idea of conſtitutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſecurity hereafter, I have not a doubt. Nay, I am ſo thoroughly perſuaded of the unworthineſs of their deſigns, and of the duty of every honeſt American to oppoſe them, that, diſſatisfied as I am with my ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, were it to do over again, I would rather be even as I am than tamely crouch, whilſt chains were faſtening round my neck. For there is not in my

On theſe principles, and theſe only, I firſt took up arms; but my misfortune, and the true ſource of all my uneaſineſs is, that though in good policy, as well as honour, theſe ought to be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of every American, I have long ago diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they are not. And on this account alone, that I dread our defeat. Our want of ſkill, our want of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, in ſhort, our want of every thing which an army ought to have, are all, no doubt, exceedingly againſt us: but, they are all nothing to our want o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> virtue.—Unuſed to the many arts and devices, by which deſigning men carry their points, I unwillingly liſtened to my own apprehenſions, when early in the firſt Congreſs, I thought I ſaw a tendency to meaſures which I never could approve of. I reaſoned myſelf, however, out of my fears, with no ordinary reproach on my own meanneſs, in having given way to ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, which could not be true, unleſs we had men amongſt ourſelves more flagitious than even thoſe we were oppoſing. At length, however, when a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental army came to be voted for, my fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s returned with redoubled force: for then, for the firſt time, I clearly ſaw our aims reached farther than we cared to avow. It was carried with an unanimity that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aſtoniſhed me; becauſe I knew many wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And they even ridiculed me for my apprehenſions on that account: and, indeed, when they ſuggeſted that Great-Britain, ſeeing us appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently determined to riſque every thing rather than that they ſhould tax us, would never think of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in a civil war with us, which muſt neceſſarily coſt her more than even America could repay her, I could not but hope, that I was miſtaken; and that our military preparations might be a good political movement. In one thing, however, we all agreed, that, as the forces were chiefly to be raiſed in New-England, it would be extremely raſh and imprudent
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015868_0006_0F9A2FF150FB4E28"/>
in the ſouthern delegates to leave them in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of ſo formidable a power without any check. I need not tell you, that it was this conſideration which, if I am to be credited, ſorely againſt my will, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined me to accept of the command of this army. We ſet out with bad omens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was miſtruſtful of them in every thing; and they were taught to look upon me with jealouſy. This ſoon mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſted itſelf in forming them to any thing like decent diſcipline. But I have, long ago, peſtered you more than enough with complaints on this head. I knew not, however, certainly, that I had been appointed to this high ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only to be diſgraced and ruined, till about the middle and latter end of laſt February: when contrary to my wiſhes, I found it abſolutely neceſſary that we ſhould come to open hoſtilities againſt our fellow ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the miniſterial army: doubtleſs, common pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence required that when we did attempt it, we ſhould, if poſſible, do it ſpeedily and effectually. And, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the reaſon in the world to believe that large armies would be ſent againſt us early in the ſummer, I reſolved, coſt what it would, to cut off thoſe already here, which would have given us ſuch infinite advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages over any future reinforcements that might be ſent. And this I believed was eaſily in our power; but, as I have already told you, noth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng is to be done with our New-England allies, unleſs they are let into all your ſecrets. I could not advance a ſtep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out communicating my intentions to the gentlemen in the civil department; a thing even ruinous in war. It ſoon got wind, as I had foreſeen; and it appeared, that the General of the enemy was appriſed of my deſign. Still, however, I perſevered in my purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; which in ſpite of all his care and caution, I was confident muſt ſucceed, and reduce him to the utmoſt extremity. But (as every military man muſt know) ſo capital a blow was not to be ſtruck without the loſs both of many men, and much property; for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was, if they would not ſurrender by an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble capitulation, to burn the town about their ears, and ſo ruſh in, and cut them off in their attempts

to eſcape to the ſhips. And this, with our ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of numbers, we certainly could have effected though, no doubt, it would have been a bloody buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if they had not ſurrendered, as I think they would. But when, as I was obliged, I laid this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council and Repreſentatives, they not only found a thouſand objections to it but abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained me and I could not have got a man that would have gone on what they called ſo deſperate a ſcheme. Hence was I under a neceſſity of proceeding in that poor, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

There is no forming an idea of the importance of ſuch a ſtroke at that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture. If any thing upon earth could have made America independent and glorious, that was the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den opportunity. I confeſs to you, I had worked my imagination up to ſuch a pitch of high expectation, that my diſappointment has diſpirited me in a manner I never can recover. For, from that moment, I have deſpaired of our ever doing any thing truly great. Any little gleams of ſucceſs, or fairer proſpects we have ſince had, ſerve but to make our inferiority the more conſpicuous. For what incidents can fall out to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize us, who can be made great only by great and ſpirited efforts, when we have ſhewn that we want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both the underſtanding and the virtue to purchaſe to ourſelves immortal glory on better and cheaper terms than ever we can hope hereafter to have it? But, the worſt remains yet to be told. Some of thoſe very men who were the moſt forward to thwart me in this meaſure, had diſcovered a different way of thinking on other occaſions, and, I am purſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>After all this, you will again, I doubt not, as you often have, aſk why I continue in a ſituation ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to me?

long as I can is dictated by my feelings, which I neither can deſcribe to you, nor wholly juſtify on paper; but which, however, I find it impoſſible for me to diſregard. The eyes of all America, perhaps, of Europe, of the world are fixed on me. It has been our policy, (and, at the time, I thought it well founded) to hold out falſe lights to the world. There are not a hundred men in America that know our true ſituation; three fourths of the Congreſs itſelf are ignorant of it; your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf excepted, their lives not a man at all acquainted with my peculiar circumſtances. The world looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us as in poſſeſſion of an army all animated with the pure flame of liberty, and determined to die ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than not be free. It is in poſſeſſion of proofs, that it is ſo, under my own hand: I have always ſo ſpoken of it and I ſtill do. But, you know how remote in my judgment all this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> from the truth; though I am not ſure that that there is another man in the army, beſides myſelf, that thinks ſo. I ſhould gueſs, however, that there are many. But, tied up as my own mouth is, it is little to be wondered at that theirs are ſo too, at leaſt to me.</p>
               <p>—Thus circumſtanced, can you point out a way in which it is poſſible for me to reſign, juſt now as it were, on the eve of action, without the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cowardice? There is no ſuch way. Beſides, diffident and deſponding as I am, how do I know, that it is not ſo with thoſe we have to oppoſe? they certainly have reaſon. The events of war depend on a thouſand minu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

You learn not this from the hiſtory; nor was it to be expected you ſhould. Yet, he ſucceeded at laſt. And, who knows, what an over-ruling Providence, who often brings about the greateſt revolutions by the moſt unlikely means, may intend for America? If it be the will of God, that America ſhould be independent of Great-Britain, and that this be the ſeaſon for it, even I and theſe unhope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

               <p>YOU have exceedingly obliged me by your letter which I received by yeſterday's poſt. It diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers an attention to the great affairs now carrying on, and an information concerning them, which I own to you I had not given you credit for. Your youth and inexperience pleaded your excuſe: and though you gave me no opportunity to praiſe you for any active ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your rank, fortune, and education, whenever it is proper for you to come forward on the theatre, it muſt not be any underpart that you act. You are, therefore, certainly, in the right to decline taking any part at all, till you are fit for a firſt and leading cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. And you have my full and perfect approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your reſolution to perſiſt in your purpoſe, for the preſent, not to accept of any rank civil or military.

I ſee your anxiety, left the preſent opportunity for ſignalizing your juſt love for your country ſhould, by your not unneceſſary cautions, be ſuffered to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lip by you, unimproved. Your ardour is commendable; and far be it from me to diſcourage in you a ſpirit I ſo much love. But, whilſt you retrain theſe honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able principles, there is little danger of your wanting opportunities to call them forth into action. The momentous enterprize, in which your country is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged is not to be accompliſhed in this or that year. If, in no longer a period than the ſiege of Troy, we bring all our mighty ſchemes to bear, it will be the greateſt work that ever was perfected in ſo little a time. You have ſet your heart, you tell me, on a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary employment. This is the uſual bent of young men; and, as it was my own, it will be with an ill grace that I reprehend it in you. But with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that I have had of it, I ſhould be wanting in that love and eſteem I owe you, ſhould I heſitate to tell you that, as your Father, there is not a profeſſion you could have choſen in which I ſhould not more cordially have concurred with you. Yet, I love arms; I am married to my ſword, as well as to your moſt amiable mother: and, herein is my witneſs, that I am in earneſt when I ſay, death alone ſhall divorce me from either. I am not ſo blindly devoted, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to my profeſſion, as not to ſee by how frail a tenure I hold the little reputation I have in it. As a ſtateſman, as a ſenator, it is in the general, ſufficient that you mean well, that you are careful to qualify yourſelf to form a right judgment of the true intereſts of your country, and that, with the honeſt impartiality of a free man, you have ſtill exerted your beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to promote thoſe intereſts. But, with a ſoldier, ſucceſs alone is merit; and there is nothing that can atone for the want of it. The world is a worſe judge military of matters, than any other. It would aſtoniſh you, to find, on a minute compariſon, how very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle difference there was in the ſkill and ſpirit which guided Braddock and Wolfe in the laſt actions of their lives. But, how different has been their fate!— I think, I am not without ſome talents for the line
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015868_0011_0F9A2FF50FC936C8"/>
of life which has fallen to my lot. But, oppoſed as I muſt be by men, probably, of infinitely ſuperior ſkill, and encompaſſed moreover with ſuch hoſts of other difficulties and diſcouragements as I am, it is not mine to command ſucceſs. And when either my cotempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries, or future hiſtorians, ſhall ſit in judgment on my conduct, if, haply, ill fortune ſhould overtake me, ſeeing our miſcarriages, only, and having neither curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity nor ability to inveſtigate the thouſand cauſes which led to them, am I not too well warranted in concluding, that they will be attributed to miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Have I not then reaſon to wiſh that your choice had fallen on the quieter but not leſs important calling of a private gentleman; in which, as a ſenator, you might have given proof of your abilities, in a way in which fortune would not have had ſo great a ſhare? But notwithſtanding all this, and if after all, you be irrevocably determined to try your fortune in the field, and you can gain your mothers and your wife's conſent, I here give it you under my hand, that you ſhall not want mine. Moſt certainly there cannot be a more honorable employment: and if (which Heaven avert) Fortune ſhould declare againſt you, my conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation will be, than I can aſſure myſelf, you will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be ſucceſsful. I will, on the opening of the next campaign, procure you an appointment to the command of a regiment, either here, or in the ſouthern wing. And, if my opinion may have any weight with you, you will, for many reaſons, prefer the being ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in ſome of the ſouthern ſtates. There is no fear of its being an inactive ſtation. I have little expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that this year will cloſe with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aught conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deciſive on either ſide: and if our enemies be able to hold out another campaign, it is moſt likely their policy will be, by means of their naval ſuperiority, to carry on a kind of an incurſive war, by making unexpected deſcents in different and diſtant places. Mean while, permit me to preſs you to preſevere in your attention to military matters. The manual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, which you were ſo juſtly diligent to learn, whilſt I was with you, is but the A, B, C, of your profeſſion. Neither will you profit ſo much as you
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015868_0012_0F9A2FF5D013AD48"/>
might reaſonably expect, from the ſtudy of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe authors, who have written profeſſedly on the art of war. This is like the learning the game of Whiſt by reading Hoyle. I have been witneſs to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous effects of it. A man, book-learned only, does very well in the ſtill ſcenes of marchings and encampments. But when, in the various buſtles of actual war, a cauſe ariſes, as muſt often be the caſe, not deſcribed in his books, he is utterly at a loſs. I would not, however, have you to underſtand me as if I meant to diſcourage your reading theſe books, at all, ſo far from it, I would have you read them very often, and make yourſelf acquainted with the ſubject as much as you can, in theory My caution meant only to guard you againſt placing too much reliance on them. Their beſt commentators, next to your own experience, will be the hiſtorians of Greece and Rome; which it is your happineſs to be able to read in the originals. But, the main and moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial qualification is an high ſenſe of honour, an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſentiment, and a certain dignified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tile of behaviour, that diſtinguiſhes, or ſhould diſtinguiſh, a ſoldier from every other man. It is a ſhame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if he who undertakes to command others, has not firſt learned to command himſelf: I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any thing mean or ſordid either in your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or your manners; having determined, if it were left with me, to be as a ſtrict and rigorous in theſe particulars, as were the knights of old, when a candidate was to be inveſted with the orders of chivalry. I cannot diſſociate the ideas between a ſoldier and a gentleman: and however common it may be to give that laſt appellation to perſons of every character, it yet conveys to me an idea of worths I want words to expreſs. I am not ſolicitous to pay you compliments, even by implication; but, I may certainly be permitted to ſay, that if I had not known you to be a gentleman, you never ſhould have had my conſent to your becoming a ſoldier.</p>
               <p>Your obſervations on this important conteſt are juſt and accurate, and diſcover a reach of thought, and a
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015868_0013_0F9A2FF68FC644E0"/>
penetration beyond what I had expected of you. What you ſay on the ſubject of independency is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udicious, and, no doubt, highly worthy of all our moſt ſerious conſideration. Yet, I have a prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiment, that it will take place, and ſpeedily. Open and unreſerved as my conduct towards you has ever been, I have no reluctance to confeſs to you, that the meaſure is diametrically oppoſite to my judgment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, for I have not yet deſpaired of an honorable recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation; and whilſt I can entertain but an hope of that, both intereſt and inclination lead me to prefer it to every thing elſe upon earth. Human affairs are oddly ordered: To obtain what you moſt wiſh for, you muſt often make uſe of means you the leaſt approve of.</p>
               <p>As in bargaining, to obtain a fair and equal price, you muſt frequently aſk more than you wiſh to take. I do not really wiſh for independence. I hope there are few who do; but, I have never heard the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thoſe, who have proved that, if we did not declare for it, we ſhould fail to obtain the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſubordination to which we are entitled, fairly refuted. I would not have you, therefore, haſtily conclude that if, in this ſtruggle, we fall ſhort of every thing we have claimed; we are worſted: perhaps, the very worſt thing that could befal us, is that we ſhould gain all. I do aſſure you that, in my opinion, the next misfortune to that of being thruſt from our juſt rank in the order of freemen, would be the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us up, and leaving us to ourſelves. But, this Great-Britain will never do, voluntarily: for, if even ſhe does, whatever may become of us, from that moment, ſhe may date the commencement of her own downfall.</p>
               <p>I am exceedingly happy in the becoming modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which you obſerve and endeavour to introduce towards the unhappy men whoſe political creeds differ from ours. But for this blot in her ſcutcheon, thrown on her by too many of her raſh and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy advocates, by a contrary conduct, this effort of America would have done her honour, even though ſhe had failed. I am ſhocked at the inſtances of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerance
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015868_0014_0F9A2FF7CA269260"/>
I daily hear of, and have no power to prevent. But, like the other evils of war, it is a calamity that unavoidably grows out of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion; and one might as well hope to ſtem the fury of a torrent, as to give laws to an enraged people. It is, however, the duty of every true friend to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by every gentle and conciliatory means in his power, to reſtrain it. And, I am happy to find this ſentiment daily becoming more general amongſt us. All things conſidered, I cannot but think it not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to our honour that things have not been carried to a ſtill greater heighth in this way.</p>
               <p>Remember me affectionately to Nelly, and tell her that though I ſhould be happy to ſee her, I may not hope for that happineſs ſpeedily: as the din of arms, I imagine, would be but unpleaſing entertainment to her; and I have little proſpect of any leiſure, at leaſt before we go into winter quarters. I hope Mr. Calvert, and all the family are well: I beg to be remembered to them. I will write to your mother in a few days. You are very good in leaving her alone as little as may be. Continue to write to me frequently, freely, and fully: the hearing of my deareſt friends and family's welfare being the only true happineſs I have any chance to enjoy amidſt the perpetual hurry in which I live.</p>

                  <salute>Dear Lund,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WE are ſtill going on with all imaginable briſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſucceſs with our works, which, I think are already impregnable. It would really aſtoniſh you to ſee the progreſs we have made. I do not believe that all hiſtory can furniſh a precedent of ſo much being done in ſo little time, or in ſo maſterly a manner, where you had ſo little right to look for conſummate ſkill. If in every thing elſe, we could but come up to our exertions in theſe fortifications, I ſhould hardly know how to doubt the judgment of thoſe who think that we may bid defiance to the world. But, I know not how it is, I am diffident of every thing. Whilſt almoſt every body elſe ſeem to have perſuaded themſelves, that we have nothing to fear, I alone torment myſelf with thinking that every thing is againſt us. Even from theſe very works, which have inſpired us with ſuch confidence, I anticipate only misfortune and diſgrace. By this time the die is caſt, and America is authoritatively declared free and independent; and unleſs we can be contented to appear ridiculous in the eyes of all the world, we muſt reſolve to ſupport this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a ſuitable conduct;—we muſt fight our way to freedom and independency; for in no other way, ſhall we be permitted to obtain it, farther than words.</p>
               <p>A war, therefore, and a moſt ſerious one, is now inevitable. Next to good finances, which it is not my province to provide for, a good army is, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, a main requiſite to the carrying on a ſucceſsful war. And a good army, is by no means ſecured, as ſome ſeem to reckon, by ſecuring a large number of men. We want ſoldiers, and between theſe, and raw, undiſciplined men, there is a wide difference.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015868_0016_0F9A2FF8D0B924A8"/>
The queſtion then is, how are theſe raw and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined men to be formed into good ſoldiers? And I am free to give it as my opinion, that ſo far from contributing to this, will ſtrong holds, fortified poſts, and deep intrenchments be found, that they will have a direct contrary effect. To be a ſoldier, is to be inured to, and familiar with danger; to dare to look your enemy in the face, unſheltered and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to their fire, and even when repulſed, to rally again with undiminiſhed ſpirit. The Indian maxim i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that it is equally your duty to take care of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to annoy your enemy. To a General, this may not be an unuſual caution; but I will venture to aſſert, that whenever a private centinel allows himſelf to act on this principle, the odds are, that, in the moment of trial, in his exceeding ſolicitude not to forget the former, the latter will be but little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to. Now, what I aſk, are all theſe mighty ditches and breaſt-works, but ſo many leſſons and admonitions to our men of what prodigious impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it is to take care of themſelves? It would be almoſt worth our while to be defeated, if it were only to train us to ſtand fire, and to bear a reverſe of fortune with a decent magnanimity. If it had not been for this ill-judged humour of fighting from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a ſcreen, the 19th of April and 17th of June laſt year, might have been the happieſt days Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica ever ſaw. All theſe things have I, again and again, repreſented to my maſters; I am aſhamed to ſay, to how little purpoſe. They return me anſwers and inſtructions, which, though I cannot refute, have not yet convinced what I would call the feelings of my own mind.</p>
               <p>This day week, the enemy's fleet was firſt deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off Sandy-Hook. They have been employed ſince then in debarking their troops on Staten-Iſland, where they are cantoned, as far as I can judge, in a very uncompact and unguarded manner. I cannot exactly aſcertain their number, but I have reaſon to believe, that they fall ſhort of ſeven thouſand. It is more extraordinary ſtill, that I am not able to inform you of the exact number of forces under my own
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015868_0017_0F9A2FF98FE3AC38"/>
command: I fancy however, we might bring into the field, at this place, double their number at a minute's warning; and with this ſuperiority of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, making all poſſible allowances for our other diſadvantages, one would hope we might be able to give a good account of them. You, who are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine in the extreme, and all impatience, will eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſk, why we ſuffered them to land unmoleſted, and to remain ſo ever ſince. What excellent expeditions your fire-ſide generals can inſtantly plan and execute! But you forget that they are poſted on an iſland, and that we have no way at coming at them unleſs they would lend us their ſhips and boats, which I have not preſumed to aſk of them. Aware, however, of the importance of falling on them, whilſt there is a chance of doing it with ſucceſs, and e're they become a match for us, by reinforcements, which they daily expect, I have formed a ſcheme, which, at leaſt, is plauſible, and promiſes fair to be ſucceſsful. I have ſubmitted it to Congreſs, and every moment expect their anſwer; and if they will but ſupport me with alacrity, and in good earneſt, my next, I truſt will not be ſo deſponding. I expect to be all ready to put my plan in execution on Tueſday, or at fartheſt, on Wedneſday night; ſo that probably, at the very moment you are reading this, we may be engaged in a very different ſervice. You will, no doubt, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to hear from me as ſoon as may be after Wedneſday, and I will not diſappoint you. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, I ſhall not need to tell you, that end how it will, all that I freely chatter to you, is to remain a profound ſecret to every body elſe.</p>
               <p>Doctor, now Brigadier General Mercer is here, and is a great comfort to me. Like myſelf, he wants experience; but he is very ſhrewd and ſenſible, and though a Scotſman, is remarkably humane and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. I have communicated the whole of my deſign to him alone; and am not aſhamed to own, that I have received much aſſiſtance from him. I know not how it may turn out; but though neither he nor I are very apt to be ſanguine, we have both confeſſed to be ſo on this occaſion. Animated, however, as I feel my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015868_0018_0F9A2FFA541D3350"/>
with the near proſpect of at length doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, not unworthy the high rank to which I am raiſed, I own to you, I take a ſerious pleaſure in it, only as it flatters me with the hope of thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a ſpedier and happier peace. Let us, ſince war muſt be our lot, diſtinguiſh ourſelves as freemen ſhould, in fields of blood, ſtill remembering, however, that we fight not for conqueſt, but for liberty.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>HOW cruelly are all my hopes in one ſad moment blaſted and deſtroyed! I am poſitively ordered to wait for the enemy in our lines; and leſt I ſhould be made enough not to obey their mandates, not a ſingle tittle of any thing I had aſked for, is granted. Thus has a ſecond opportunity of rendering my country an eſſential ſervice, in the way of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, been unwiſely, and in the moſt mortifying manner denied me. I profeſs, I hardly know how to bear it: having to regret not only, that two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, ſuch as may never again occur, have been ſuffered to paſs by us unimproved, but that none can happen, we can improve. Managed as matters are, we neither are, nor ever ſhall be a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary people; and yet, in the train in which things are now put, unleſs we are, it were idiotiſm to hope for either freedom or independence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:015868_0019_0F9A2FFB0FEA7298"/>I remember well, in a converſation I once had with a friend, now moſt unjuſtly as well as unwiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, driven from his friends and his home, on the ſubject of monarchies and republics, he objected to the unavoidable ſlowneſs and dilatorineſs of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power in the latter. Aiming to anſwer him in his own way, I replied that, if popular councils were ſlow, they yet were ſure, and that in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of counſellors there is ſafety. His anſwer was prophetical If ever (he ſaid) we of theſe countries ſhould raſhly put theſe things to the proof, it would be found that, however true this adage might be in the cabinet, it was not ſo in the field. Convinced, by melancholy experience, that this is the caſe, and, that without ſome different ſyſtem, we ſhall but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ourſelves to contempt and ruin, I reſolve this evening honeſtly &amp; openly to ſay ſo to the Congreſs. I will go farther, and add, that if they cannot in fact, as well as in appearance, truſt me with the uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed command of their army, I will no longer be their puppet. Why ſhould I? it being now morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that by going on as we have hitherto done, I can neither bring honour nor profit to them; and yet am ſure to loſe all the little of either which I either have, or might have, poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>I want words to expreſs to you what I have felt, and ſtill do feel on this diſappointment of all my hopes: I had allowed myſelf to build too much on my ſcheme I and I ſeem to be in the ſituation of one who ſhould be allowed to riſe, on purpoſe only to be thrown down. The enemy, in the midſt of all our bluſterings, muſt deſpiſe us; and did not ſhame, or ſome better principle reſtrain them, I ſhould be but little ſurprized to find General Howe, even with his preſent little handful attacking us,—yes, attacking us in our entranchments.— What ſhall I do? to retreat is to entail on myſelf the curſes of every public man in my country; and to go on is certain ruin and diſgrace.

my reſolving to tell a tale, which, conſidering the rank I now hold in it, muſt involve my country in ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal broils and quarrels, as muſt be fatal to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe in which we have embarked. And this, I truſt, I ſhall have the virtue never to do, be my private wrongs and ſufferings ever ſo great.</p>
               <p>I have finiſhed my letter to the Congreſs, to whom I have at length, ſpoken in a more peremptory tone, than, I fancy, they have been uſed to. It was abſolutely neceſſary; and I ſhould ill deſerve their confidence, if through any miſtaken complaiſance or diffidence, I heſitated to point out to them the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous conſequences of their interference. I have alſo inſiſted on preciſe inſtructions in what manner I am to conduct myſelf towards the Britiſh commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, if peradventure, as is probable, their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhall be made through me. Their anſwer will have a great influence on all my future meaſures; as I ſhall then know, (and ſurely it is time I ſhould) on what ground I ſtand. The very decided and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous meaſure, which Congreſs itſelf has juſt taken, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'Tis all fearful expectation: Every man I ſee ſeems to be employed in preparing himſelf for the momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous rencontre, which every man perſuades himſelf muſt ſhortly come on. There is an offenſible ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs and impetuoſity amongſt us, I could willingly have excuſed: I ſhould have been better pleaſed with that ſteady compoſure which diſtinguiſhes veterans. One thing is in our favour, the paſſions of our ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery are ſeldom ſuffered to ſubſide; being conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agitated by ſome ſtrange rumour o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I wrote to Mrs. Waſhington lately, and ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in a week or two, if I do not hear of her ere that in Philadelphia. It has ſurprized me that, after what I wrote, ſhe ſhould heſitate. I beg of you if ſhe be ſtill fearful, to ſecond my perſuaſions by every means in your power. Expoſed as ſhe muſt be to ſo many interviews with people in the army all of whom are in the way of the ſmall-pox, I have the moſt dreadful apprehenſions on her account. I know not well how the notion came into my head, but it is certain, I have, for ſeveral days, purſuaded myſelf that ſhe is already inoculated, and that out of tenderneſs and delicacy, ſhe forbears to inform me of it, till ſhe can alſo inform me ſhe is out of danger.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>LAST Friday, the Britiſh fleet was ſeen off Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten-Iſland; they have ſince been employed, uninterrupted by us, in debarking their men, ſtores, &amp;c. And as they muſt now, I ſhould imagine, be pretty nearly as ſtrong as they expect to be this cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, no doubt we ſhall ſoon hear of their motions. I have reaſon to believe, their firſt eſſay will not be on this, but on Long-Iſland; where injudiciouſly I think, we alſo are, or ſoon ſhall be in force. Yet, if we do but act our parts as becomes us, be the iſſue as it may, we ſhall at leaſt give them no pleaſing ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of what they have to expect in the courſe of the war. But there is no relying on any plan that is to be executed by raw men.</p>
               <p>You have heard much of the powers with which commiſſioners were to be in veſted, for the purpoſe of ſettling this diſpute. Like moſt other things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, theſe too have made a much greater figure in talk, than they do in fact. There are but two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, the two Howes; and their powers are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely vague and undefined. It is a pity, methinks, that Congreſs had not had better information on this ſubject; if they had, it is to be preſumed, they would not have precipitated the declaration of independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſo as to preclude all poſſibility of negociation. I may venture to whiſper in your ear, that this except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I firmly believe, that America might have carried every other point; and certainly, there was a time, when this would have been deemed a conqueſt beyond the warmeſt w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſhes of the warmeſt American. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the preſent poſture of affairs, it ſtill be ſo, is another queſtion: I can anſwer only for myſelf, that I would not even aſk ſo much.—Different men will judge differently with reſpect to this conduct, on the part of Great-Britain; I own I am bewildered and puzzled to account for it. After ſuch an aſtoniſhing
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015868_0023_0F9A2FFE0EFFDBE8"/>
expence as they have been at, and with ſuch fair proſpects as they have before them of being ſoon in a capacity to preſcribe their own term<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, it certainly is extraordinary to find them condeſcending to be friends with us, on conditions as mortifying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading to them, as they are flattering to us. I can account for it but in one way; I really aſcribe it to their magnanimity. It muſt be an unpleaſing conteſt to the nation: I ſay the nation; for however expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient it may be for us to have it called a miniſterial war, no man who knows any thing of the Engliſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, can imagine, that the miniſtry could have moved a ſtep in it, if it had not been the ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the nation. It muſt, too, be a moſt fruitleſs and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable war; ſince every advantage they can gain, muſt in fact be a loſs, as being gained over themſelves. No wonder, therefore, they have been ſlow and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to enter into it; no wonder they would be glad to be well rid of it, on almoſt any terms. I have ever been of this opinion, and it was this perſuaſion alone that reconciled me to the meaſure of taking up arms. I ſee, however, the world around me viewing it in a different light; every conceſſion that is made to us, they attribute to timidity only, and deſpondency. I own appearances make for this conjecture; and, no doubt, Congreſs will give it its ſanction.</p>
               <p>I have not adopted this opinion, that we might have peace with Great-Britain, on terms which would once, have been thought moſt honorable, on ſlight grounds. Yeſterday, a letter was bro't to me, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king overtures for a nego<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iation, from Lord Howe. —I had expected it; and had my inſtructions. It was addreſſed, as I had foreſeen, to me as in my private character only. On the ground of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, if we choſe to maintain it, this was not a mere matter of punctilio; it was the critical moment of trial, whether we would aſſert, or recede from our pretenſions. Never did men ſit in debate on a queſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on of higher magnitude: and when they had once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to declare their country free, I ſee not why they might not ſupport this their declaration, by this as well as other means. A contrary conduct would
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015868_0024_0F9A2FFED03D3A00"/>
certainly have indicated ſome want of firmneſs. Yet, I confeſs to you, I felt aukward upon the occaſion. The puncti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>io ſeemed, and it could not but ſeem, to be my own: and as ſuch it looked, methought, as though I were proud of my titles. Put yourſelf in my place, and ſee me, longing as you know I do moſt earneſtly for peace, yet turning my back on a gentleman, whom I had reaſon to conſider as the harbinger of it, only becauſe he aſked for Mr. and not, GENERAL WASHINGTON. How often it is my lot to find it my indiſpenſible duty to act a part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to both my own ſentiments and inclinations! But, if I miſtake not, it is in ſuch inſtances only, that, properly ſpeaking, we manifeſt our fortit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de and magnanimity.</p>
               <p>I ſhall aſtoniſh you, when I inform you, that this firſt rebuff abated not the ardour of the noble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner. His Deputy paid as a ſecond viſit, and vouchſafed to honour me with the appellation of General. What name will you give to this condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion? I own it hurt me; and has well nigh led me into a train of thinking very different from all my former opinions. The gentleman who brought the meſſage, is a Colonel Patterſon, Adjutant General, and a ſenſible well informed man. He requeſted to ſpeak to me alone; and I was glad he did. After the firſt ſalutations, he told me the purport of the letter which had been refuſed; and his errand now was to aſk me to point out the moſt eligible means of opening a negociation, for the purpoſe of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating the unhappy diſpute. I replied, that I knew but of one way; and that was by application to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. He ſaid, the King's Commiſſioners would have no objection to treating with the members who compoſed the Congreſs, provided only that they came with legal authority from the regular legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of their reſpective countries. I anſwered, they, doubtleſs would come with ſuch authority; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they could come with no other. I evidently ſaw his drift in the exception, as he did mine: and ſo put a ſtop to all poſſibility of miſtake; he declared it impoſſible for his maſters ever to acknowledge the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015868_0025_0F9A3000072669F0"/>
Congreſs, as ſuch, a legal, and conſtitutional body of men; and as it ſeemed to be rather a punctilio of pride, than of any real importance, he hoped it might be waved. I ſtared: How, Sir, have you not already acknowledged the powers of Congreſs, by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the honourable rank I hold, and which I hold from them, and them only? That ſaid he, was the conceſſion merely of politeneſs; and made for the purpoſe only of getting acceſs to me; and he was perſuaded, I was too ſenſible a man to lay any ſtreſs on ſo m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re a trifle; I thanked him for his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but aſſured him, that I meant to lay the moſt ſerious ſtreſs on it. If he really had had that opinion of my underſtanding which he was pleaſed then to expreſs, he muſt have ſuppoſed, that though a trifle in itſelf, it ceaſed to be ſo after I had made a point of it.</p>
               <p>Words could not have told him more ſtrongly that our reſolutions were to aſſert and maintain our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency. And if the commiſſioners of the King of Great-Britain found themſelves either unable or unwilling to give up this, as a preliminary article, they, &amp; he muſt pardon me for ſaying, that I could but think them very idly employed in ſoliciting an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view with me. On this he prepared to take his leave, firſt adding with a degree of ſharpneſs and animation, that I own affected me. Sir, ſaid he, you are pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be cavalier with me: I conſider you as a well-meaning —I wiſh I could ſay, well-informed man; yet, I am miſtaken, if your head, as well as your heart, would not, at this moment, dictate a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent language. There may be heroiſm, for ought I know, in deſperately reſolving to go all length<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That the mean and narrow-minded leaders of your councils may diſſeminate ſuch opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in your unhappy country, I can eaſily ſuppoſe; but remember, Sir, you, and your party, owe ſome account to the world! and when the world ſhall come to know your infatuated inſolence in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance before us, as know it they muſt, think how you will excuſe yourſelves? I replied with no leſs warmth, nor I truſt, dignity. I was, indeed, flung: for after once having owned me as a General, you muſt confeſs there was ſomething ſingularly contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous in preſuming thus to ſchool me. A few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal civilities put an end to the conference.</p>
               <p>I have tranſmitted a faithful account of it to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; but, as I can hardly ſuppoſe, they will judge it expedient to make it public, I thought I owed to you, not wholly to diſappoint your curioſity. You will not, however, need me to caution you to be ſecret, as well on this as on other things, which I write to you.</p>
               <p>One thing more I muſt not omit to mention to you. In my conference with Colonel Patterſon, I thought I could diſcover that it was intended I ſhould be impreſſed with a perſuaſion that the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thought not unfavourably of our pretenſions, as urged in the beginning of the diſpute. This is to be accounted for. They are whigs; and if I am right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed, the General owes his ſeat in Parliament to the intereſt of the diſſenters. But why approve of our firſt pretenſions only? Surely if we were then right, we are not now wrong: I mean as to what we have a right to, by the principles of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the expediency of our meaſures is now out of queſtion. I cannot diſſociate the ideas between our having a right of reſiſtance in the caſe of taxation, and the ſame right in the caſe of legiſlating for us. You know I am no deep caſuiſt in political ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but having happily been brought up in revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion principles, I thought I trod ſurely when I traced the footſteps of thoſe venerable men.

               <p>I WISH I could ſay I thoroughly approved of all the new regulations in the new inſtitution of government in my native ſtate. It could, however, hardly have been expected that a reformation ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital and comprehenſive ſhould be perfect at firſt; the wonder is, it is not ſtill more exceptionable. My heart glows with unuſual warmth, when I advert, as I often do, to that pure and diſintereſted ardour which muſt have animated the bulk of my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men throughout the whole of this controverſy. There may be exceptions amongſt us, and no doubt, there are; but it is not fair to infer this from our uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon impetuoſity and violence. This one would wiſh reſtrained, but, by no means extirpated; for is it not the effect of a highly agitated public ſpirit; the mere efferveſcence of good principles thrown into a ſtate of ſtrong fermentation? And, ſurely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy is preferable to the ſpirit-breaking cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of chill deſpondency. Yet I am no advocate, in general, either for raſh meaſures, or raſh men; but at ſuch a conjuncture as this, men had need to be ſtimulated by ſome more active principle than cool and ſober reaſon. They muſt be enthuſiaſts, or they will continue to be ſlaves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:015868_0028_0F9A3001CFFB3F60"/>I give this in anſwer to my friend Mr. Carter's objections to the firſt procedures of the new govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No doubt, Henry is, in many reſpects, the unfitteſt man in the ſtate for Governor of Virginia. He has no property, no learning, but little good ſenſe, and ſtill leſs virtue or public ſpirit; but he is the idol of the people; and, as it is by their means only that you can hope to effect the grand ſchemes which you have meditated, you muſt humour them, and indulge them with their rattle. They will ſoon tire of him; and the opportunity muſt then be watched gently to lead them to a better choice; for they may be led, though they cannot be driven. And though it be, alas! but too true, that they often miſtake their real intereſts, I am of opinion they never miſtake them long. Sooner or later, they will judge and act from their ſettled feelings; and theſe I take it are generally founded in their ſettled intereſts. When great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes are to be performed, we may well diſpenſe with ſome little errors in judgment: when without that, we have, in its ſtead, that which perhaps, we could not have with it; I mean, that undiſciplined ardour which is infinitely better adapted to our purpoſes.</p>
               <p>There cannot be a more ſtriking inſtance that the judgment of the people may, in general, be ſafely truſted, in the long run, than is to be met with in Virginia. Very few countries have to boaſt of more men of reſpectable underſtandings; I know of none that can produce a family, all of them d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is, indeed, a poor and pitiful performance; and yet I can believe, that ſet off by his ſmooth and oily delivery, it would appear clever when he ſpoke it. Why did he not aſk Mr. Page to prepare it for him? There is not a man in America more capable. The Counſellors of ſtate are certainly irreproachable, and will do honor to thoſe who appointed them.

As you are ſoon to go down the country, you will ſee him, and therefore ſpare me the trouble of writing, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him. My friends muſt now be ſo indulgent to me, as to wave the matter of compliment; I think myſelf happy, whenever I can write, as I ſhould, on urgent buſineſs. You know how tickliſh my ſituation is; little as one would think, there is to be envied in it, I yet am envied. And though, in all good reaſon; their fears ſhould take a direct contrary courſe, there are who are for ever ſuggeſting ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and jealouſies of the army and its commander. My own heart aſſures me, I mean them no ill; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if I really have the influence and aſcendency which they ſuppoſe, I will, for their ſakes as well as my own, hereafter maintain it at ſome little coſt. A thouſand conſiderations determine me to ſtrain every nerve to prevent the army's being under any other controul, whilſt I live. Let a perſuaſion of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this, if occaſion ſhould ariſe, be ſeaſonably urged in my native ſtate: and, in the mean while, let ſome more than ordinary pains be taken to make me po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular. Their own honor and intereſt are both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in my being ſo. Shew this to Mr. Dandridge; and, as you both can enter into my meaning, even from the moſt diſtant hints, I can reſt ſatisfied, that you will do every thing I wiſh you.</p>
               <p>We have lately had a general review; and I have much pleaſure in informing you, that we made a
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015868_0030_0F9A3003511FE170"/>
better appearance, and went through our exerciſes more like ſoldiers, than I had expected. The Southern ſtates are raſh and blameable in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they generally form of their brethren of the four New-England ſtates; I do aſſure you, with all my partiality for my own countrymen, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices againſt them, I cannot but conſider them as the flower of the American army. They are a ſtrong, vigourous, and hardy people, inured to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and toil; which our people ſeldom are. And though our hot and eager ſpirits may, perhaps, ſuit better in a ſudden and deſperate enterpriſe: yet in the way in which wars are now carried on, you muſt look for permanent advantages only from that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and perſevering temper, which is the reſult of a life of labour. The New-Englanders are cool, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate and ſenſible; whilſt we are all fire and fury: like their climate, they maintain an equal tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, whereas we cannot ſhine, but we burn. They have a uniformity and ſtability of character, to which the people of no other ſtates have any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions; hence they muſt, and will always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their influence in this great Empire. Were it not for the drawbacks and the diſadvantages, which the influence of their popular opinions, on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of government, have on their army, they ſoon might, and probably would, give law to it. If General Putnam had the talents of Mr. S. Adams, or Mr. Adams had his, perhaps, even at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this had not been matter of conjecture. But, Putnam is a plain, blunt, undeſigning old fellow, whoſe views reach no farther than the duties of his profeſſion. He is, indeed, very ignorant; yet, I find him a uſeful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet the overbearing virtues of this laſt named gentleman are uſeful to us, eſpecially at our ſetting out: we want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the ſober and ſlow deductions of argument and reaſon: and Lee, like the author of Common Senſe, has talents perfectly formed to dazzle and confound.</p>

Have we lived, now almoſt a ſcore of years, in the cloſeſt and deareſt congugal intimacy to ſo little purpoſe that, on an appearance only of inattention to you, and which you might have accounted for in a thouſand ways more natural and more probable, you ſhould pitch upon that ſingle motive which alone is injurious to me? I have not, I own, wrote ſo often to you as I wiſhed, and as I ought. But think of my ſituation and then aſk your heart, if I be WITHOUT EXCUSE. We are not, my deareſt in circumſtances the moſt favourable to our happineſs: but let us not, I beſeech you, idly make them worſe, by indulging ſuſpicions and apprehenſions which minds in diſtreſs are but too apt to give way to.

               <p>I congratulate you moſt cordially on the fair proſpect of recovery of your amiable daughter-in-law; nor can I wonder, that this ſecond loſs of a little one ſhould affect you, I fear the fatigues of the journey, and the perpetual agitations of a camp, were too much for her. They are, however, both young and healthy; ſo that there can be little doubt of their ſoon repairing the loſs.</p>
               <p>And now will my deareſt love permit me, a little more earneſtly than I have ever yet done, to preſs you to conſent to that ſo neceſſary, ſo ſafe &amp; ſo eaſy, though ſo dreaded a thing—the being innoculated? It was always adviſeable; but at this juncture it ſeems to be almoſt abſolutely neceſſary.</p>

The only true intereſt of both ſides is reconciliation; nor can there be a point in the world clearer, than that both ſides muſt be loſers by war, in a manner which even peace will not ſoon compenſate for.

For all theſe reaſons, which cannot but be as obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Engliſh commiſſioners, and ours, as they are to me, I am at a loſs to imagine how any thing can ariſe to obſtruct a negociation, and, of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, a pacification. You, who know my heart, know that there is not a wiſh nearer to it than this is; but I am prepared for every event, one only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed — I mean a diſhonourable peace. Rather than that, let me, though it be with the loſs of every thing elſe I hold dear, continue this horrid trade, and, by the moſt unlikely means, be the unworthy inſtrument of preſerving political ſecurity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to them, as well as to ourſelves.—Pity this cannot be accompliſhed, without fixing on me that ſad name, Rebel. I love my king; you know I do: a ſoldier, a good man cannot but love him. How peculiarly hard then is our fortune to be deemed traitors to ſo good a King! But, I am not without hopes, that even he will yet ſee cauſe to do me juſtice: poſterity, I am ſure, will.

the matter Upon the return of the committee of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, appointed to confer with Lord Howe, I ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned their whole intentions. The different accounts which each member gave of this conference, the time they took to make up the matter for public view, and the amazing diſagreement between the newſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per accounts and the relation I myſelf had from the mouth of one of the committee, convinced me there muſt have been ſome unfair and ungenerous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure. This determination, to treat on no other ſtrain than that of independency, which put it out of his Lordſhip's power to mention any terms at all, was ſufficient proof to me, that independency was the idol they had long wiſhed to ſet up, and that, rather than ſacrifice this, they would deluge their country with blood. From this moment I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon my reſignation, and, in the beginning of October 1776, ſent it in form to Mr. Hancock, after having officiated only two months and three weeks; and from that time, as far as my ſafety would permit, I have been oppoſed to all their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. This circumſtantial account of my conduct, I think due to the friendſhip you were ſo obliging as to expreſs for me, and I hope will be ſufficient to juſtify any ſeeming inconſiſtencies in the part I have acted. And now, dear Sir, ſuffer me, in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of truth and real affection, to addreſs myſelf to you. All the world muſt be convinced you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the ſervice of your country from motives perfectly diſintereſted. You riſked every thing that was dear to you, abandoned the ſweets of domeſtic life, which your affluent fortune can give the unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted enjoyment of. But, had you, could you have had, the leaſt idea of matters being carried to ſuch a dangerous extremity? Your moſt intimate friends ſhuddered at the thought of a ſeparation from the mother country, and I took it for granted that your ſentiments coincided with theirs.

Take an impartial view of the preſent Congreſs, and what can you expect from them? Your feelings muſt be greatly hurt by the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of your natural province. You have no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a Randolph, a Bland, or a Braxton, men whoſe names will ever be revered, whoſe demands never ran above the firſt ground on which they ſet out, and whoſe truly glorious and virtuous ſentiments I have frequently heard with rapture from their own lips.— Oh! my dear Sir, what a ſad contraſt of characters now preſent—others whoſe friends can ne'er mingle with your own.—Your Harriſon alone remains, and he diſguſted with the unworthy aſſociates. As to thoſe of my own province, ſome of them are ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, that their very names were never in my ears before, and others have only been diſtinguiſhed for the weakneſs of their underſtanding, and the violence of their tempers.

of this you muſt be fully ſenſible.

Have they not frequently abandoned you yourſelf, in the hour of extremity? Can you, have you the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in a ſet of undiſciplined men and officers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them have been taken from the loweſt of the people without principle, without courage; take away them who ſurround your perſon, how very few are there you can aſk to ſit at your table?—As to your little navy, of that little, what is left? Of the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware fleet part are taken, the reſt muſt ſoon ſurrender: Of thoſe in the other provinces ſome are taken, one or two at ſea, and others lying unmanned and unrigged in your harbours; and now where are your reſources? Oh! my dear Sir, How ſadly have you been abuſed by a faction void of truth, &amp; void of tenderneſs to you and your country? They have amuſed you with hopes of a declaration of war on the part of France. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, from the beſt authority, it was a fiction from the firſt.— Early in the year 1776, a French gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was introduced to me, with whom I became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately acquainted. His buſineſs to all appearance, was to ſpeculate in the mercantile way. But, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will be found, that in his country he moved in a higher ſpher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.—He ſaw your cauſe.—He became acquainted with all your military prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He was introduced to Congreſs, and engaged with them in a commercial contract.—In the courſe of our intimacy, he has frequently told me, that he hoped the Americans would never think of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency; he gave me his reaſons.—Independency
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:015868_0042_0F9A300C4E83AAF0"/>
can never be ſupported unleſs France ſhould declare war againſt England. I well know the ſtate of her finances, years to come will not put them in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to enter upon a breach with England.—At this moment there are two parties in the court of Verſailles; one inliſted under the Duke De Choiſeul, the other under Count Maurepas. Choiſeul has no chance of ſucceeding, tho' he is violent for war; Maurepas muſt get the better; he is for oeconomy and peace; this was his information, which I mentioned to ſeveral members of Congreſs, they treated it as a fable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending entirely on Doctor Franklin's intelligence. The truth of the matter is this: Dr. Franklin built upon the ſucceſs of Choiſeul. Upon his arrival in France he found him out of place, his councils repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and his party dwindled into an inſignificant faction: This you may depend upon to be the true ſtate of affairs in France, or the court of Dr. Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. And further, by vaſt numbers of letters found on board prizes taken by the King's ſhips, it appears, that all commerce with the merchants, through whom all your ſupplies have been conveyed, will be at an end; the letters being full of complaints of no remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances from America, and many individuals having generally ſuffered.—From your friends in England you have nothing to expect, their numbers have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed to a cypher; the ſpirit of the whole nation is in activity, a few ſounding names among the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, though perpetually ringing in your ears, are without character, without influence. Diſappointed ambition has made them deſperate, and they only wiſh to make the deluded Americans inſtruments of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. All orders and ranks of men in Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, are now unanimous and determined to riſque their all with content. Trade and manufactures are found to flouriſh, and new channels are continually offering, that will perhaps more than ſupply the loſs of the old. In America your harbours are blocked up; your cities fall one after another; fortreſs after fortreſs, battle after battle is loſt. A Britiſh army after having paſſed unmoleſted through a vaſt extent of country, have poſſeſſed themſelves of the capital of

America. How unequal the conteſt! How fruitleſs the expence of blood! Under ſo many diſcouraging circumſtances, can virtue, can honour, can the love of your country prompt you to ſucceed? Humanity itſelf, and ſure humanity is no ſtranger to your breaſt, calls upon you to deſiſt.—Your army muſt periſh for want of common neceſſaries, or thouſands of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent families muſt periſh to ſupport them; wherever they encamp, the country muſt be impoveriſhed; wherever they march, the troops of Britain will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, and muſt complete the deſtruction which Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca herſelf has begun; perhaps it may be ſaid, it is better to die than to be made ſlaves. This indeed is a ſplendid maxim in theory, and perhaps in ſome inſtances may be found experimentally true; but when there is the leaſt probability of an happy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, ſurely wiſdom and humanity call for ſome ſacrifices to be made, to prevent inevitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. You well know there is but one invincible bar to ſuch an accommodation, could this be removed, other obſtacles might readily be removed.</p>
               <p>It is to you, and you alone, your bleeding country looks and calls aloud for this ſacrifice, your arm alone has ſtrength ſufficient to remove this bar; may hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven inſpire you with this glorious reſolution of exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſtrength at this criſis, and immortalizing yourſelf as a friend and guardian to your country; your penetrating eye needs not more explicit language to diſcern my meaning; with that prudence and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy therefore, of which I know you poſſeſſed, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to Congreſs the indiſpenſible neceſſity of reſcind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the haſty and ill-adviſed declaration of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.

"This, indeed, is a ſplendid maxim in theory," but the ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>periment applies ſo ſtrongly to the ſenſes, that even you, Sir, have not Stoiciſm to reduce it to practice.</p>
               <p>I paſs by your remarks on the reſult of the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between Lord Howe, his Britannick Majeſty's Commiſſioner, and the Committee of Congreſs, not being concluſive arguments againſt the neceſſity of independency.</p>
               <p>"All the world," you ſay, "are convinced that the illuſtrious perſonage to whom you write, is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Service of his country from motives per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly diſintereſted." It is a catholic faith, that no action can be praiſe-worthy, whoſe principles are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and cruel, and which is not only MALUM IN <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

On the other hand, it is acknowledged by you, for yourſelf and the whole world, that he is engaged to ſerve his country, and that from the moſt laudable motives; how then can you be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent, after ſuch declaration, to diſſuade from that honourable ſervice? To bring ruin and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on our country, or to ſuffer others to do it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainly be called SAVING IT; but an oppoſite conduct implies benefits, favours, and every good gift that can be conferred, and which at this very time you amply confeſs, are the motives of action in the Perſonage to whom you write.</p>
               <p>"But," you again ſay, "could you have had the leaſt idea of matters being carried to ſuch a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous extremity as they are now? Or in words tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, Had you any proſpect of the hardſhips of war, of marching and counter-marching, cold and heat, wet and dry, hunger and thirſt; but above all, of coming to battle?

And now to prove, that from the meaſure of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, has flowed a degeneracy of repreſentation, confuſion of councils and numberleſs blunders; that the moſt worthy characters have withdrawn, and are ſucceeded by fools and madmen, we have your ample teſtimony: And who had a better opportunity of knowing the characters of thoſe Gentlemen, than their own Chaplain, after preaching up Liberty for two months and three weeks to them?</p>
               <p>No candid perſon can diſcern, from the general tenor of your letter, you ever meant it ſhould have the effect propoſed, otherwiſe you would not have begun with ſuch illiberal, falſe, ungentleman-like aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions on the greateſt body politick in America, the only power which could bring about that important change for which you ſolicit. The firſt who met the fire of your pen, are the Delegates from Virginia. You recapitulate the virtues of the deceaſed and ſuperanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, or perſons who, after long and faithful ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, had retired to manage their private affairs, which had ſuffered by their abſence, or to be more immediately aiding the public buſineſs of their own States: I ſay, ſome of theſe aforeſaid cauſes affect every Gentleman whom you have thought proper to diſcriminate from the reſt, and daub with fulſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation. Even the members of your own State, or the catholic Carroll, do not hold you in a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temtible view than thoſe very men who have been the ſubjects of your flattery. In the New-England ſtates, it is well known, even by our enemies, that the general voice is for ſupporting our independency at all events; thoſe people being unanimous, their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections cannot be called the reſult of a low faction. Certainly then, under ſuch circumſtances, men of virtue and property, men of wiſdom and experience would be choſen to repreſent them—men, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the real intereſts of their country at heart, would be the propereſt guardians of their rights and privileg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

following circumſtance will prove to be falſe—The paper currency circulates freely under their credit, the camp is ſtored with every neceſſary; their troops have taken one powerful army, and ſtrongly block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aded the other—Theſe are facts among thouſands, that give the lye to your aſſertions.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding our illuſtrious General is the idol of his army, and though by his death or captivity we ſhould experience a moſt heavy and ſenſible loſs, yet the principles upon which we have taken up arms, are ſuch as indiſſolubly cement our intereſts and conſequently our powers. The merits of our cauſe are the ſame now as at firſt, only our oppoſition is more confirmed by accumulated injuries and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated inſults. Be aſſured, we never mean to quit the field, to expoſe our country to the ravages of a foe, whoſe tender mercies are death and cruelty. Happy for America we have officers amongſt us, who, by imitating the conduct of our great General, (if under the circumſtances you mention) would arrive at ſuch a military perfection, as might in a great meaſure ſupply ſo capital a loſs.</p>
               <p>To your bitter ſarcaſms on our army, I reply— That ſome of our men are, and all have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplined, is a truth that needs no controverting, only that our oppoſition thereby becomes more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. True it alſo is, that we have ſometimes given way before ſuperior numbers and advantageous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks; but our misfortunes, therefore, are not to be imputed to cowardice. No, Sir, every gentleman of candor in the Britiſh army muſt acknowledge that we are not cowards: Mr. Duche himſelf, was he not under the influence of fear, muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it. And though many of our officers and men who heretofore never ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:015868_0051_0F9A30130F5F7878"/>As to our little fleet, which you have already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated in idea; believe me, that does not form the nerves of our oppoſition. Your arguments againſt the probability of a French war, and the fine-ſpun anecdote of a certain ſpeculative French trader, I purpoſely omit, leaving the event in the hands of all-revealing time, which doubtleſs we ſhall have no cauſe to be diſſatisfied with. We do not court the friendſhip of England, its inhabitants have never done us any material ſervices; on the contrary, they have voted ample ſupplies to hire foreigners to ſpill our blood unjuſtly: they never exerted themſelves to effect; it was once in their power to have ſpared the lives of our butchered countrymen,—to have prevented the tears of many widows and orphans, now deprived of their deareſt connections by a band of hireling Scotch and German ruffians. We know that the ſpirit of the whole nation is in full activity againſt us, and we have already experienced the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of that humane ſpirit, which you ſay is united and determined. Some few noble patriotic ſouls are yet left in both Houſes of Parliament, though you have the conſummate aſſurance to ſay they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out character, and without influence, whoſe ſteady oppoſition has no other motive than deſpair, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and diſappointment.—But America will ever have a grateful ſenſe of their merits, in ſpite of the calumny of their and our enemies.</p>
               <p>Since the Declaration of Independency, the ground of our conteſt is materially changed; and it is not rights and priviledges for which we now fight, but dominion and empire are the objects of both parties. Britain is endeavouring to reduce us to conquered provinces, and again to monopolize our trade. Why then this immenſe expence of blood and treaſure? when you tell us that "new channels are continually opening, that will perhaps more than ſupply the loſs of the old."—It is only changing the navigation from America to Europe, and the loſs of our trade and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nafactures will never be felt by England.</p>
               <p>The whole navy of Great-Britain is not ſufficient to block up all our harbours; and though fortreſſes
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:015868_0052_0F9A3013D1964220"/>
are taken, and battles loſt, the victors have ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to lament the conqueſt. Every day their army moulders away, whilſt ours, like the Hydra, encreaſes two-fold; and notwithſtanding they now poſſeſs our unfortunate capital, I may juſtly cry out with you, "How unequal the conteſt! how fruitleſs the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of blood!"</p>
               <p>After recapitulating every diſcouragement calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to terrify weak minds, like an able logician, you draw an inference as foreign from the premiſes as probably you and I will be, before this letter reaches you. Ergo, "Under ſo many diſcouraging circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, can virtue, can honour, or the love of your country, prompt you to perſevere? Humanity itſelf, (and then a ſtroke of flattery) calls you to deſiſt." The very idea of virtue implies difficulties and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments; was it not ſo, patriotiſm would degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into licentiouſneſs, and liberty be of no real value.</p>
               <p>True it is, that where-ever our army encamps, it becomes ſomewhat burthenſome to the inhabitants of the vicinage: But obſerve the progreſs of the Britiſh ſpoiler—murder, rape, robbery, and burning, mark their footſteps. And though ſometimes they may purſue, they as often ſhamefully retreat, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the devaſtation which they (not we) have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
               <p>Wiſdom dictates a glorious and happy peace, and humanity wiſhes for it, but accommodation ſeems to imply dependance: A ſacrifice which I am confident America will never make. You call upon his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in the name of the whole Continent, to make this deſtructive ſacrifice, and to become "the friend and guardian of his country"—by withdrawing his protection.</p>
               <p>As a full and concluſive anſwer to the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paragraphs, I refer you to a ſerious peruſal of Lord Chatham's ſpeech in the Houſe of Lord's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> June third, 1777.</p>
               <p>That you did not write this letter under the eye, or immediate inſpection of any Britiſh officer, or any perſon connected with the Britiſh army or miniſtry,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:015868_0053_0F9A30148E943168"/>
is the only aſſertion in your whole performance which is believed; but that you wrote it at the inſtigation of ſome, and for the peruſal and eclat of all ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, appears very evident. This is a maſter piece of caſuiſtry, and would do honour to the eldeſt ſon of St. Ignatius himſelf.</p>
               <p>After caſting he fouleſt aſperſions on Congreſs, ſcandalizing the officers and the army, and affronting his Excellency with the moſt villanous propoſitions, you ſay, "I would fain hope, that I have ſaid noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by which your delicacy can in the leaſt be hurt, if ſo, 'twas without intentention, and your candour will lead you to forgive me." O moſt conſummate aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance! You would not offend the meaneſt perſon on earth; I believe you, Sir—you cannot offend, your obſcurity hides you, and your inſignificance renders harmleſs the ſhafts of your malice.</p>
               <p>I never before ſaw a diſcrimination between the love of truth, of peace, of our God, and the love of our country. The end of war is peace—'tis for that we are now contending. Peace promotes truth and Religion; your principles would annihilate both. 'Tis for our country we fight, for her we dare bleed —Religion and juſtice approve to conflict.</p>
               <p>In fine, your whole performance is a rhapſody, without pathos to ſoften, or arguments to convince; and your laſt propoſition is of ſuch a horrid, villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous nature, that I bluſh to think o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Indeed, Sir, I ſincerely lament your departure from virtue, from honour, from your country which, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! you have for-ever ſold. This, perhaps, may be ſaid in your excuſe,—

Theſe ſhores, as well as your own reflections, will be forever hoſtile to you. You are now going to a country where you muſt flatter for a ſubſiſtance, and exiſt upon the ſmiles of the great.
