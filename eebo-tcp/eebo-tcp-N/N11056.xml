            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PRAYER before SERMON.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>O THOU eternal and exhauſtleſs ſource of light, and life, and love! In thee we live and move and have our being! Every moment deals to us a portion of thy boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and demands the tribute of unceaſing praiſe! Thy name is</hi> LOVE! <hi>And</hi> LOVE <hi>the eſſence of thy nature! The religion thou haſt taught us is a religion of love! And love is the principle and end of all thy diſpenſations!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NEVER <hi>doſt thou ſend thy judgments abroad into the world, never doſt thou ſuffer thy chaſtiſing hand to fall heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy children, but when they become inſenſible of that endearing relation, in which they ſtand to thee and to each other, and thus violate thy eternal living law of love!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE <hi>acknowledge, therefore, and adore thy wiſdom and goodneſs in the infliction
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:014012_0003_0F92877CAFE82130"/>
of national puniſhments upon national guilt! Our eyes muſt be blinded, and our hearts hardened indeed, if we do not ſee and feel, under our preſent viſitation, the manifeſt tokens of thy divine diſpleaſure!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE <hi>own and lament, that the dark cloud of judgment, which now hangs over our heads, hath riſen from our unnumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſins and rebellions againſt thee! Againſt thee only have we ſinned! To thee only have we been diſobedient and ungrateful. We have neglected to improve under thy paſt corrections. We have ſhamefully ſlighted thy paſt loving-kindneſſes. Our proſperity hath rendered us forgetful of thee our</hi> GOD, <hi>regardleſs of thine holy ordinances, inattentive to the precepts of thy goſpel!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT <hi>yet, ſpare us, good</hi> LORD, <hi>ſpare thy people, whom thou haſt redeemed, and let not thine heritage be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion! Recall thy miniſters of vengeance!
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:014012_0004_0F92877F71CA0C48"/>
And put a ſtop to the unnatural effuſion of chriſtian blood!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM <hi>our preſent grievous calamities, not our merits, but thy mercy, not our foreſight but thy providence alone can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us. Accept, therefore, the prayers and ſupplications, that have this day been offered at the foot-ſtool of thy throne! Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, for thy</hi> WELL-BELOVED'<hi>s ſake, our public acts of penitence and humiliation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GIVE <hi>us grace ſeriouſly to lay to heart the great danger we are in from our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unhappy diviſions! Take away all hatred, bitterneſs and reſentment from our breaſts. Enable us to forgive our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending</hi> BRETHREN, <hi>even as we ourſelves look for forgiveneſs at the hands of our offended</hi> GOD!</p>
            <p>AND <hi>O thou, who alone canſt make men to be of one mind in an houſe! Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore that brotherly union and concord,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:014012_0005_0F92878508874DC8"/>
which ought ever to ſubſiſt inviolate in the great family to which we belong! And as there is but one body, and one ſpirit, and one hope of our calling, one</hi> LORD, <hi>one faith, one baptiſm, one</hi> GOD <hi>and</hi> FATHER <hi>of us all, ſo may we henceforth be all of one heart and of one ſoul, united in one holy bond of truth and peace, of faith and charity!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR <hi>this purpoſe we pray, that thou wouldſt give thy bleſſing to a preached goſpel! Enable thy miniſtring ſervants of every denomination to be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, in promoting the great work of chriſtian love: And whilſt they are faithfully employed in planting and watering, do thou,</hi> LORD <hi>of the harveſt! crown their labours with a bleſſed increaſe!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL <hi>this we aſk for the ſake and through the merits of thy well-beloved ſon</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>our</hi> LORD, <hi>in and through
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:014012_0006_0F928786313F44F0"/>

able to diſcern in almoſt every human event, the marks of Sovereign Wiſdom, the energy of Infinite Power, and the prevalence of Almighty Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and ſhould thereby be led to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the immediate influence and operation of the great moral Governor.</p>
            <p>NOT only the courſe of all public tranſactions, the riſe and fall of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and kingdoms app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar to be directed by his omnipotent hand; but his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is known to extend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of individuals, to things of the minuteſt nature, ſo that, according to the language of inſpiration, NOT A SPARROW FALLS TO THE GROUND WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE, AND THE VERY HAIRS OF OUR HEADS ARE NUMBERED.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:014012_0009_0F92878804447FB0"/>
WHAT a ſcene of diſorder, ruin and deſolation would ſoon be exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the theatre of the world, was the ALMIGHTY to withdraw his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling influence! Men, ſavage in ſome degree by nature, and more ſavage by the growth and indulgence of their evil luſts and paſſions, would ſoon fall upon each other with a violence and ferocity equal to that of beaſts of prey. Ambition, tyranny and vengeance would rage without controul, and the whole world would, ere long, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luged in blood.</p>
            <p>HAPPY, however, for mankind, this is not the caſe. An all-wiſe and all-powerful Being ſits at the helm. He preſides, unſeen, in the councils of Princes. He proſpers or diſappoints them in their projects and undertakings; and renders all the thoughts, intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014012_0010_0F928788E04419F0"/>
and actions of men ſubſervient to the completion of his own moſt wiſe and benevolent purpoſes.</p>
            <p>CONQUEST and defeat, the ſhouts of the victor, and the cries of the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed are from him. The proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of nations and the happineſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, public misfortunes and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate diſtreſſes, plentiful harveſts and years of famine, the ravages of war, and the ſmiles of peace, are all dealt forth by him to the ſons of men, at ſuch times and in ſuch degrees, as in his wiſdom and goodneſs he finds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for their real welfare. Happy, therefore, that people, who, amid all the variety of changes to which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments as well as individuals are expoſed, have placed their ſole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon the KING OF KINGS!</p>

WITH theſe principles in our hearts, and with a ſincere purpoſe of HUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLING OURSELVES UNDER THE MIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY HAND OF GOD, and imploring his gracious interpoſition under our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent public diſtreſſes, I would fain hope, that we have all THIS DAY EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERED THE COURTS OF THE LORD'S HOUSE.</p>

might prevail, that the Lord of mercy would incline his ear, and ſay to the deſtroying Angel: IT IS ENOUGH—STAY NOW THINE HAND.</p>
            <p>IN the Pſalm from whence my text is taken, the Royal Author, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enumerated the many diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favours, with which Heaven had heretofore bleſſed his church and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, proceeds in the moſt earneſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to deprecate ſome grievous calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with which they were at that time oppreſſed:</p>

WHY HAST THOU THEN BROKEN DOWN HER HEDGES, SO THAT ALL THEY THAT PASS BY THE WAY DO PLUCK HER. THE WILD BOAR OUT OF THE WOOD DOTH WASTE IT; AND THE WILD BEAST OF THE FIELD DOTH DEVOUR IT. RETURN, WE BESEECH THEE, O GOD OF HOSTS! LOOK DOWN FROM HEAVEN, AND BEHOLD AND VISIT THIE VINE!</p>
            <p>IN applying this paſſage of ſcripture to the preſent ſolemnity, my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will turn chiefly upon the bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by which we have hitherto been diſtinguiſhed, the ungrateful returns

we have made to the God of Heaven, for his unmerited goodneſs, and the only means by which, as a people, we can be re-inſtated in his favour.</p>
            <p>I. GREAT and aſtoniſhing have been the bleſſings of Providence, by which theſe American colonies have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from their very firſt ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the preſent period. They have indeed been a VINEYARD PLANTED BY THE LORD'S RIGHT HAND. And though ſome gloomy ſcenes have now and then ſhaded the brightneſs of the proſpect, yet even theſe have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contributed to their proſperity and enlargement.</p>
            <p>IF we look back a little into the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of America, we ſhall find, that this very ſpot, on which our large and populous city now ſtands, was, leſs than a century ago, a wild unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated deſart. The arts and cuſtoms of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014012_0015_0F92878C833DD968"/>
civilized life were here unknown. Nought elſe was viſible, but the ſad effects of ignorance, ſuperſtition and idolatry. The untutor'd ſavage roamed the wood, like a beaſt of prey, ſtranger to the comforts and advantages of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal culture, involved in Pagan dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with ſcarcely one ray of heavenly truth to irradiate the gloom of nature.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the dark and dreary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, when Providence conducted our Forefathers to this new world. He took the tender ſlip from the PARENT VINE. HE CAST OUT THE HEATHEN AND PLANTED IT. THE HILLS WERE SOON COVERED WITH THE SHADOW OF IT, AND THE BOUGHS THEREOF WERE LIKE THE GOODLY CEDARS. SHE SENT OUT HER BOUGHS UNTO THE SEA, AND HER BRANCHES UNTO THE RIVER.—From NORTH to SOUTH he ſtretched the extenſive line.—From EAST to WEST he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad the proſpect open—
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014012_0016_0F92878D3AEEFD88"/>
THE WILDERNESS AND SOLITARY PLACE WERE MADE GLAD, AND THE DESART REJOICED AND BLOSSOMED LIKE THE ROSE.</p>
            <p>OUR ſober Anceſtors brought over with them, not only the ſeveral uſeful arts and improvements, of which the natives were ignorant, but a treaſure of infinitely greater value, even the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of TEMPORAL FREEDOM, and the records of ETERNAL TRUTH. The banners of CHRISTIAN and BRITISH Liberty were at once unfolded, and theſe remote parts of the earth were thereby added to the MESSIAH'S king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>NUMBERLESS, indeed, were the toils, difficulties, and dangers, to which the firſt founders of theſe colonies, as well as their ſucceſſors were expoſed, before they arrived at their preſent height of opulence and ſplendor. So
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014012_0017_0F92879158E19548"/>
remarkable, however, were the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Providence, that the moſt inattentive mind muſt have frequently diſcerned them.</p>
            <p>SCARCELY is there recorded in the annals of hiſtory a more rapid ſeries of ſucceſſes of every kind in the ſettlement and population of any country on the globe. Whilſt favoured with the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing care and protection of the mother country, whoſe fleets and armies, in conjunction with our own, have ever been faithfully and ſucceſsfully employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our defence, our common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have looked with aſtoniſhment and envy upon our riſing glory, nor have dared for years to interrupt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, purchaſed, under the ſmiles of Heaven, by virtue, induſtry, and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh and American valour.</p>
            <p>AND happy, my dear brethren, ſhould we ſtill remain, if the parent
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014012_0018_0F92879288E9E410"/>
would be ſatisfied with ſuch returns from the children, as filial duty would always prompt them to pay, and not exact ſuch an illegal and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tribute, as by weakening and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing them, muſt in the end weaken and diſtreſs the parent too.</p>
            <p>HERE then our preſent calamities commence. Our MORNING JOYS are paſt—and a NIGHT Of HEAVINESS ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds—The HEDGES OF LIBERTY, by which we hoped our VINEYARD was ſecured, ARE BROKEN DOWN, and THEY THAT PASS <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>Y THE WAY, ARE ſeeking to PLUCK OUR GRAPES.</p>
            <p>'TIS not indeed THE WILD BOAR OUT OF THE WOOD, OR THE WILD BEAST OF THE FIELD, that are ready to WASTE AND DEVOUR IT. 'Tis not now a foreign enemy, or the ſavages of our own wilderneſs, that have made the cruel and unrighteous aſſault—But
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014012_0019_0F9287932C56D868"/>
it is even, thou, BRITAIN, that with mercileſs and unhallowed hands, wouldſt cut down and deſtroy this BRANCH of thine own VINE, the very BRANCH, which Providence HATH MADE STRONG even FOR THYSELF!</p>
            <p>II. INJURED and oppreſſed as we are, unmeriting the harſh and rigorous treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we have received from ſuch an unexpected quarter, let us, however, look up to an higher cauſe for the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful infliction; and whilſt we are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perſevering in the defence of our TEMPORAL RIGHTS, let us humble our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before God, lay our hands upon our hearts, and ſeriouſly and impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquire, what returns we have made to Heaven for its paſt favours, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its preſent chaſtiſements have not been drawn down upon us by a groſs neglect of our SPIRITUAL PRIVILEG<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

HATH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS, then, SHONE FORTH AS THE LIGHT, AND OUR JUST DEALINGS AS THE NOON DAY?—Hath a ſenſe of GOD'S unnum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered and unmerited mercies awakened in our ſouls an ardent affection for our divine Benefactor? Have we been more zealous for the honour of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and the obſervance of his laws? Have we teſtified our zeal by a correſpondent practice? By works of piety, beneficence, and public virtue? Have our heads of families been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>HAVE we been careful to check that overweening fondneſs of gaiety and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014012_0021_0F928794B35F7958"/>
pleaſure, which frequently diſcovers itſelf in the diſpoſitions of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?—to check it did I ſay—yea, to endeavour to root it out of their hearts, and plant and nouriſh in its room the love of GOD and of goodneſs?—In a word, have we been induſtrious, in our ſeveral ſtations and according to our reſpective abilities, in propagating the goſpel of JESUS CHRIST, as well in ſound doctrine as in ſound practice? Hath OUR LIGHT for this purpoſe, ſo SHONE BEFORE MEN, THAT THEY SEEING OUR GOOD WORKS, have been led TO GLORIFY OUR FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN?—</p>
            <p>ALAS! my brethren, have we not rather been ſo far carried away by the ſtream of proſperity, as to be forgetful of the ſource from whence it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived? So elevated by the proſpect, which peace and a ſucceſsful commerce have opened to us, as to neglect thoſe
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014012_0022_0F9287958B2CA050"/>
impreſſions of goodneſs, which former afflictions had left upon our hearts? Have not luxury and vice, the common attendants of wealth and grandeur, too ſoon made their appearance amongſt us, and begun to ſpread a dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection through our hitherto healthy and thriving ſtate? Amid the hurry and tumult of the paſſions, hath not conſcience fallen aſleep? Hath not a falſe ſecurity gained ground? And a worldly ſpirit too generally prevailed?</p>
            <p>AND is it not for this, that the AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY hath bared his arm againſt us?—Is it not for this, that he now ſpeaks to us in thunder? And, as we would not be drawn by the cords of his love, that he is now chaſtiſing us with the rods of his wrath? Is it not for this, that the flames of an UNNATURAL WAR have burſt forth in the very bowels of our native land? And that
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014012_0023_0F9287964E19F088"/>
our garments have been already ſtained with kindred blood?—</p>
            <p>O MY GOD! let this ſuffice!—let MERCY interpoſe, and ſtay the aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand of JUSTICE!</p>
            <p>FOR behold! we now deſire to TURN UNTO THEE WITH ALL OUR HEARTS, WITH FASTING, AND WITH WEEPING AND WITH MOURNING! We know, that MERCY is thy darling attribute, and that JUDGMENT is a STRANGE WORK to thee!—RETURN then, WE BESEECH THEE, O GOD OF HOSTS! LOOK DOWN FROM HEAVEN! And once more BEHOLD AND VISIT THIS VINE!</p>
            <p>III. BUT WHEREWITHAL, my dear brethren, SHALL WE COME BEFORE THE LORD, AND BOW OURSELVES BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE THE HIGH GOD? With what ſacrifice ſhall we approach his altar?
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014012_0024_0F928796F5AFB6A0"/>
With what language, or by what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſhall we invite him to return?</p>
            <p>THE SACRIFICE OF GOD IS A BRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KEN SPIRIT: A BROKEN AND A CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRITE HEART, O GOD, THOU WILT NOT DESPISE. PRAYER and SUPPLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATION, is a language, which he will not refuſe to hear: And REPENT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANCE and REFORMATION of life, through the redeeming power of his EVER-BLESSED SON, is the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that will reinſtate us in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>LET us adore, then, the divine wiſdom and goodneſs, for putting it into the hearts of that Honourable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, now entruſted with the great cauſe of American Liberty, to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole people, whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, in the moſt ſolemn and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate manner, to join in deprecating the Divine diſpleaſure, by one general
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014012_0025_0F928797EE497CC0"/>
act of religious humiliation. Heaven be praiſed, that they have hereby ſhewn their attention and zeal for our eternal as well as temporal welfare.</p>
            <p>Go on, ye choſen band of Chriſtian Patriots! Teſtify to the world, by your example as well as by your counſels, that ye are equally the foes of VICE and of SLAVERY—Baniſh the Syren LUXURY, with all her train of faſcinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſures, idle diſſipation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive amuſements from our borders. Call upon honeſt induſtry, ſober fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſimplicity of manners, plain hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality and chriſtian benevolence to throw down the uſurpers, and take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their ſeats. Recommend every ſpecies of reformation, that will have a tendency to promote the glory of GOD, the intereſt of the Goſpel of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, and all thoſe private and public virtues, upon the baſis of which alone,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014012_0026_0F928798706459F8"/>
the ſuperſtructure of true Liberty can be erected.</p>
            <p>To ſecond your virtuous attempts, let the MINISTERS of the everlaſting goſpel, the embaſſadors of JESUS CHRIST, ſtep forth with freſh zeal and courage to their duty. Let them remember, that they are not only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for their own ſouls, but for the ſouls of thoſe under their care. "They are ſet as watchmen over the houſe of Iſrael."—Let them, therefore, CRY ALOUD AND SPARE NOT: let them LIFT UP THEIR VOICE AS A TRUMPET, AND SHEW ISRAEL THEIR TRANSGRESSION, AND THE HOUSE OF JACOB THEIR SIN.</p>
            <p>FROM theſe let the MAGISTRATES take the alarm—Let them boldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke vice—Let them puniſh immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and profaneneſs without reſpect to rank or fortune—Let them become MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISTERS
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014012_0027_0F928799899FBAD8"/>
of the GOSPEL as well as MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISTERS of JUSTICE—Let them incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, as far as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and authority extends.</p>
            <p>WHEN MAGISTRATES and MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISTERS ſhall ardently conſpire for ſuch pious and benevolent purpoſes—Heaven will ſurely ſmile upon their labours of love; and the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge will GROW IN GRACE, and become eminent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of every divine and ſocial virtue.</p>
            <p>WE cannot expect, my dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that the GOD OF HOSTS WILL RETURN, LOOK DOWN FROM HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEN, AND BEHOLD AND VISIT OUR VINE; that he will cauſe his ſun to ſhine, and his refreſhing dews and rains to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:014012_0028_0F92879A1DB721C8"/>
weed, that will impede its growth. By neglecting this, we ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of incurring the dreadful ſentence denounced againſt the barren fig-tree, CUT IT DOWN: WHY CUMBERETH IT THE GROUND?</p>
            <p>BUT whilſt I am recommending in general thoſe eſſential branches of a true reformation, piety and gratitude to GOD, repentance and humiliation for paſt neglects, together with the revival of every private and public virtue, which can adorn and dignify the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen and the chriſtian, let me not forget to remind you, at this awful ſeaſon in particular, of the great goſpel duty of CHARITY, which will ever prompt us to ſympathize with the diſtreſſes, and to relieve the wants of our brethren.</p>
            <p>WHILE proſperity ſtretches her ſilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en banner over our heads, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters a continual ſupply of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts

and enjoyments of life, let us not be content to repoſe at eaſe beneath her friendly ſhade, and ſelfiſhly and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarily reach forth our hands to take her cup of bliſs, whilſt thouſands are ſuffering, neglected beſide us, and ten thouſands at our right-hand. In theſe calamitous times at leaſt, let us deem it BETTER TO GO TO THE HOUSE OF MOURNING THAN TO THE HOUSE OF FEASTING. Let us chearfully ſacrifice our hours of entertainment and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial mirth, and be willing to contract our uſual expences, that we may have leiſure TO WEEP WITH THEM THAT WEEP, and have ſomewhat to ſpare for the relief of them that want.</p>
            <p>FOR, alas! if arms muſt decide the unnatural conteſt, and Heaven ſhould even ſmile upon our righteous cauſe, our ſucceſs cannot be purchaſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many a tear, on the part of the victor as well as the vanquiſhed. An
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:014012_0030_0F92879C4B883D70"/>
anxious parent may be afflicted with the melancholy tidings of the death of an only Son—A fond wife may be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into all the bitterneſs of woe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reading the name of her affectionate ſpouſe among the number of the ſlain—A beloved child may liſten with an heart-felt anguiſh to the ſad ſtory of his father's fall—And all this load of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may be dreadfully accumulated by the languors of diſeaſe, and the frowns of poverty.</p>
            <p>OUR faſting and humiliation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, will ſtand us in no ſtead, unleſs, whilſt we are ſeeking TO LOOSE THE BANDS OF WICKEDNESS in our own hearts, we endeavour likewiſe TO UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DO THE HEAVY BURDENS OF OTHERS, AND TO LET THE OPPRESSED GO FREE—unleſs we DEAL OUR BREAD TO THE HUNGRY, AND BRING THE POOR THAT ARE CAST OUT INTO OUR HOUSES—WHEN WE SEE THE NAKED,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:014012_0031_0F92879CEAFFBC78"/>
THAT WE COVER HIM, AND HIDE NOT OURSELVES FROM OUR OWN FLESH.</p>
            <p>IF our hearts and hands are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſuch deeds of beneficence and love, OUR LIGHT SHALL BREAK FORTH AS THE MORNING, AND OUR HEALTH SHALL SPRING FORTH SPEE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DILY: OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS SHALL GO BEFORE US: THE GLORY OF THE LORD SHALL BE OUR REAR-WARD.</p>
            <p>IN a word, if we would wiſh THE GOD OF HOSTS TO RETURN, TO LOOK DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOLD AND VISIT our American VINE, we muſt be prepared to meet him by ſuch heavenly tempers and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as alone can teſtify our vital uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and communion with him. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if we find him a reconciled GOD in CHRIST JESUS! Thrice happy, if our faith has fixed us to the ROCK OF AGES! Then indeed the rude winds
