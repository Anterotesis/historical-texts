            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Some OBSERVATIONS relating to the Circumſtances of the Province.</head>
            <p>IF an Inhabitant of this Province, who is much intereſted in its Happineſs, will but caſt his Eye back on the three or four paſt Years, and view his Country ſinking under an inſupportable Burden of Taxes and a Decay of Trade, his Mind muſt feel a very ſenſible Shock: and even any one who is poſſeſſed of but the common Principles of Humanity, and so ways intereſted in the Fate of this Province, would be excited to a generous Pity for its unhappy Circumſtances, when he view'd it in ſuch a Situation.</p>
            <p>IT is ſome Alleviation however of ſuch a Misfortune, that it proceeded from heavy Charges, conſequent on a long expenſive War, carried on by Subjects, who have diſtinguiſhed themſelves by Loyalty to the beſt of Kings, and by a firm Attachment to the Liberty and Priviledges of the happieſt of Governments.</p>
            <p>WHILE the Neighbouring Provinces have, as it were, lain baſking in the Sunſhine of Peace and Security, ſmiling in their Eaſe and defended from the Incurſion of an Indian Enemy, by us as their Barriers; we on the contrary have been obliged, for the common Safety, to garriſon our Frontiers and to be at the Expence of our Blood and Treaſure, to ſecure ourſelves from the Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which even a ſmall Number of the Indian Enemy could always ſpread around us; when at the ſame time ſome of theſe Provinces have happily felt, in a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Degree, the good Effects of the exerting of our Strength during the Courſe of this War.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:006612_0004_102951E7C896E210"/>BY our Zeal and Loyalty (carried almoſt to a Pitch of Enthuſiaſm) we have not only prevented the breaking up of the Settlements of ſome of the more neighbouring Provinces, but we have alſo ſaved that very important Fortreſs of <hi>Annapolis,</hi> when on the very Brink of being ſurrendered to the <hi>French,</hi> who always prove the worſt of Neighbours; in Peace eternally encroaching upon the Rights of Mankind, and in War not always behaving in the moſt generous Manner: And even at this Time, notwithſtanding the moſt ſolemn Treaties, inſtigating the <hi>Indian</hi> Enemy to ſpread Murders and Deſolation among the new Settlements in <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> when (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their national Perfidy) they dare not appear as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Actors in this Scene of Villainy. Nay ſuch an Abhorrence have even ſome of the Prieſts of their own Nation, at their late horrid Act of ſending Miſſionaries among ſome of the <hi>Eaſtern Indian</hi> Tribes, in order to inſtigate them to this Cruelty, that one of them was humane enough to ſay, that he would not be concerned in ſuch a Miſſion for all the Riches in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the beginning of the <hi>Spaniſh War</hi> our Expence was very great, in raiſing Levies for what is called the <hi>Cuba</hi> Expedition; and notwithſtanding the Diſtance of that Iſland from this Province, and the little Proſpect that the Succeſs of that Expedition would immediately affect us, yet from a Principle of Loyalty, <hi>five hundred</hi> Men from this Government were embarked upon it, at no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Charge, of which not above <hi>fifty</hi> returned.</p>
            <p>BUT the moſt chargeable Expedition was that to <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> in which we expended almoſt <hi>two Millions</hi> old Tenor, a Sum vaſtly exceeding our Ability, and which nothing but the laſt Extremity could excuſe us the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of; an Extremity which not only very nearly affected us, but alſo the whole Continent beſides, and in which the Trade of the Engliſh Nation both with Regard to that great Branch of it the Cod-Fiſhery, as alſo its Navigation to the Northern Colonies was deeply
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006612_0005_102951EAB335E4D0"/>
intereſted. In this Expedition we almoſt made ourſelves Bankrupts, not only with Reſpect to Money, but alſo with Regard to Labour, the worſt Bankruptcy that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity can ſuffer; for we expended ſome thouſands of Lives, which were loſt by a Mortality conſequent on the ſurrender of <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> who were ſome of the Flower of the People; and whoſe Loſs to a Country that wants Inhabitants, can be repaired neither in a ſhort Time nor without great Charge and Difficulty.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Expedition in which we were at great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, was that deſigned for <hi>Canada,</hi> and recommended from the <hi>Crown</hi>; and although the Scheme was not executed, yet Bounty Money and Billetting <hi>two thouſand</hi> Men, could be very ill ſpared by a People, who were already ſo much drained of both Men and Money.</p>
            <p>THIS was the late unhappy Situation of this diſtreſſed Province; whilſt its remaining Inhabitants were groaning under a Burden of Taxes, which had almoſt ſunk them into Ruin; and which they would not have been able to have ſupported, had not the Parliament of <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> (as a Reward of our Loyalty and Services) diſcharged our Provincial Debt, by a Grant enabling us to ſink our Paper Currency.</p>
            <p>THIS Slavery we are redeemed from, almoſt inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly, inſtead of lingring out a few unhappy Years: And to this agreeable Proſpect I now chearfully turn my Eyes, and ſincerely congratulate my fellow Subjects of this Province on ſo ſudden a Tranſition from a State of Perplexity to a Scene opening to ſocial Happineſs, if we are not wanting to ourſelves; which ſurely we cannot be, after ſo happy a Deliverance.</p>
            <p>THE Wiſdom of our Legiſlature in providing a ſalutary Method to make the Parliamentary Grant as beneficial as poſſible, by paſſing a Law to call in our bad Paper Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, is a Conduct highly to be applauded: And the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006612_0006_102951EC469CC3A8"/>
Firmneſs and Reſolution which the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> in their laſt Seſſions, ſhewed, in confirming that Law (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Quibbling and Chicanery of ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning Men to invalidate it, in order to demand Silver according to the Face of thoſe Province Bills which they were Poſſeſſors of) is what expreſſes the higheſt Regard to the good of the Society, and what is like to have a moſt happy Influence on our Political and Commercial Affairs, if as ſteadily purſued.</p>
            <p>IT was ſurprizing to ſee the little Arts, and to hear the Sophiſtry of ſome deſigning Mock Patriots, to evade the Force of this Law; but it was more affecting to ſee honeſt well meaning Perſons deluded by them. The ſtanding Argument was Oppreſſion; that the Province could never bear ſo ſudden a Change of its Medium, and that the Silver would be immediately ſhipped off; by which Means there would be no Currency to ſupport the Trade of the Province. This looked plauſible and popular, but the Veil was too thin to conceal the Artifice from the leaſt penetrating Eye; for the propoſed Effect from this Argument was, that Individuals who had for ſome little Time paſt cloiſtered the Paper Bills, rendering them uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to the Community, ſhould have that Quantity of Silver for thoſe Bills which they were worth at the Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them. Unhappily, a great Number of Well-wiſhers to their Country ſtruck in with this Scheme and raiſed a popular Clamour; which had they ſeen through, I dare affirm they never would have done; for the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable Conſequence of it would have been, the raiſing <hi>eight or nine hundred thouſand Pounds Tax</hi> Old Tenor upon the Inhabitants of this Province; which had it been raiſed, I believe the Projectors of it would almoſt have been curſed for. This Tax we are now diſburthened of, by the Firmneſs of ſome, who ſincerely wiſhed their Country's Happineſs.</p>
            <p>SUFFERERS there are and will be without the leaſt Doubt; and this occaſions ſome ſevere, unjuſt, and give
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006612_0007_102951F1A659A080"/>
me leave to ſay, libellous Cenſures on the Government: but ſuch Perſons ought to remember, that in a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity where Affairs are ſo unhappily complicated as they have been in ours, the general Good of that, as well as of every other Society, ought to be the firſt Principle of Action in each of its Individuals: and to promote the Ruin of <hi>Nine Tenths</hi> of a Community to enrich the other <hi>Tenth,</hi> is the worſt Hereſy in Politicks, and which no wiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would ever be guilty of. Such Perſons ought farther to conſider, that it has not the leaſt Affinity to Juſtice, to ſuffer a Number of Perſons who have been ſo lucky, as within a few Months to have filled their Cheſts with Province Bills, when in ſo ſhort a Time their Value is not altered one Farthing; I ſay, it would be even In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to ſuffer ſuch Perſons to make a Prey of the reſt of the Community, by demanding two Ounces of Silver for but one Ounce Value in other Commodities, which they have ſo lately exchanged for thoſe Bills.</p>
            <p>AS I ſaid before, real Sufferers there will be; but had this Affair been conducted agreeable to the avaritious Views of ſome; where there is <hi>one</hi> Sufferer now, there would then have been at leaſt <hi>twenty.</hi> I take that Maxim to be founded on eternal Truth, viz. <hi>Salus Populi eſt ſuprema Lex,</hi> i. e, the Safety of the People is the ultimate End of Society. But I forbear enlarging here, as all the Exceptions that have been made to this Act, have been fully and ſenſibly anſwered, in a Pamphlet publiſhed laſt Year, entitled, <hi>A brief Account of the Riſe, Progreſs and preſent State of the Paper Currency of New England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SINCE Things are brought to this Criſis, it certainly muſt be the Duty of every Member of Society to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote its Welfare to the utmoſt of its Power, and to make its Peace and Plenty flow in an <hi>even, ſteady</hi> Channel; which it is certainly in our Power to do, and we ſhall have none to blame but our ſelves, if our Affairs ſhould be diverted into a <hi>wrong</hi> one.</p>
            <p>PARTICULARLY are our Eyes turned to the <hi>General
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006612_0008_102951F4D472E8B8"/>
Aſſembly</hi> in their preſent Seſſion; and it is to You the <hi>Fathers of our Country,</hi> that we addreſs our ſelves, for it is on you more immediately that we depend for future Happineſs. It is in your Power, by the Steadineſs and Prudence of your Conduct in making ſalutary <hi>Laws,</hi> and in giving proper Encouragement to our <hi>Trade</hi> and to the Produce of our <hi>Soil,</hi> to lay the Foundation of our Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare ſo deep, that the Envy of our Neighbours ſhall not be able to undermine it. Peace we are now bleſſed with, and if we do not make Plenty the Attendant on it, let us never murmur at Providence for what future Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes may befall us; ſince our preſent Circumſtances are ſuch, that we have it very much in our Power to prevent them. The Conduct of Providence with Regard to our political Affairs has been too ſingular to be paſs'd by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved; and it ſeems, that whatever Inconveniencies we have ſuffered by engaging in that very chargeable Expedition againſt <hi>Cape Breton,</hi> they are more than fully recompenced by the Deſtruction of a depreciating Paper Medium: and had it not been for that Expedition, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we ſhould not have ſo convincingly felt the wretched Detail of Vice and Miſery, which always follows large Emiſſions of it: There has one Inconvenience always gone Hand in Hand with thoſe large Emiſſions, which I believe is very little conſidered; and that is, the Minds of many ſeem to be ſo much debauched by it, that the Notions of Right and Wrong are quite indiſtinct and are excluded from other Parts of their Conduct in Life: And whatever affects the Morals of a Community ought ſurely to be regarded, in Proportion to the Degree in which they are ſo affected.</p>
            <p>BUT beſides the alteration of our Currency, many other things ſeem to require the cloſeſt Attention and moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Proſecution, in order to introduce and eſtabliſh the publick Happineſs and Proſperity.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> Place, as Nature has calculated our Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a beneficial <hi>Trade,</hi> ſuch Trade ought to be nurſed in the moſt tender Manner; for unleſs we can by good
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006612_0009_102951F86350C198"/>
Economy export larger Quantities of Commodities than we import, we muſt neceſſarily be reduced to Poverty. We are now free from our Provincial Debt, and it is generally imagined by thoſe who have examined moſt critically the Commerce of the Province, that upon ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling the whole Account, the Ballance is in our Favour: But taking it for granted that we were <hi>one hundred thouſand Pounds</hi> Sterling in Debt, yet it would be no great Misfortune; for we have at this Time <hi>two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions</hi> Old Tenor in Silver in the Province; and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing we ſhould immediately diſcharge that <hi>one hundred thouſand Pound</hi> with Part of it, yet we ſhould have <hi>eight hundred thouſand Pound</hi> Old Tenor remaining for a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium amongſt us, at the loweſt Computation; which Sum is allowed by thoſe who are well acquainted with the Courſe of our Trade, to be fully ſufficient to anſwer all the Purpoſes of a Medium for it. And I think this ought to remove all Fears of the Silver's being exiled the Province; for beſides the above State of the Caſe, there are conſiderable Quantities of Silver and Gold imported from the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> and other Places; ſo that if we at laſt looſe that which is generally agreed upon by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind for a Medium of Trade and ought to be the only one with us, it will certainly be our own Faults; and the only Way which it can be loſt in, is by our own <hi>Luxury</hi> and <hi>Extravagance,</hi> which if we do not retrench, and give up that Part of our Trade which indulges them, it will be in vain to attempt the retaining Silver with us; And if we had ten thouſand Times as much as we now have, yet ſuch ill Conduct would infallibly make it uſeleſs to us, and thoſe who ſupplied this Luxury and Extravagance of ours would reap the Benefit of our Loſs of the Silver in Exchange for their gratifying our Vice and Folly. The Caſe is eaſily reduced to Demonſtration: only ſubſtitute a private Perſon in the Room of the Province, and let that Perſon be poſſeſſed of <hi>ten thouſand Pound</hi> clear from all Debt, yet if that Perſon will expend annually the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his <hi>ten thouſand Pound</hi> and <hi>one thouſand Pound</hi> per Year of the Principle beſides, (having no other Means of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006612_0010_102951F9EDB7C028"/>
Support) he muſt certainly in the Courſe of a Few Years, prove a Bankrupt: On the contrary, ſuppoſing this ſame Perſon ſhould expend the Intereſt of only <hi>nine thouſand Pound</hi> of this Money Annually, he muſt neceſſarily add to his Eſtate and grow rich in a Courſe of Years. Theſe ſuppoſed Facts are too plain to be denied by the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Examiner, and this is the State of every Society. An <hi>Advantageous Trade</hi> ought therefore in every Manner to be encouraged, and a <hi>diſadvantageous one</hi> by all Ways to be diſcouraged; what Laws may burden the former ſhould be repealed, and any Sumptuary ones that may clog the latter be enacted. For if the Ballance upon the whole of the Trade of any Country is in its Favour, that Country muſt grow <hi>rich,</hi> ſince the Ballance in its Favour, whatever it be, muſt be paid in Money; on the contrary, when the Ballance of the whole Trade is againſt a Country, that Country, muſt neceſſarily grow <hi>Poor,</hi> as long as ſuch Trade is carried on, till at laſt it becomes quite <hi>Bankrupt,</hi> at leaſt as to the Means of carrying Trade on, viz. <hi>its Money.</hi> Nor will any Medium the Government can find at all help the Matter, this we all know has been the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Argument amongſt us for a long Time paſt, but it is as <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>prepoſterous</hi> as it is <hi>popular.</hi> It is a certain and undoubted Maxim, that Trade ought to find its own Medium; and for this plain Reaſon, becauſe if it be a profitable Trade, the Profit ariſing from it, that is the Ballance will be paid in <hi>Money,</hi> and of Conſequence it will ſupport it ſelf without the Help of any Government Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium; and if it be a loſing Trade, which is the only one that can ſtand in need of any Artificial Medium, it ought not to be encouraged, nay, not only ſo, but any ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium will baniſh the intrinſick good Medium entirely away, and convert a profitable Trade into the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>THIS one would have thought our own paſt Experience would have convinced every Man of. For what End, with Regard to Trade, hath the enormous Quantities of Paper Bills, that have been iſſued out, ſerved but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006612_0011_102951FD37621DA8"/>
our luxurious and extravagant Conſumption of foreign Commodities, the loſs of all our Money, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in a great meaſure of publick and private Faith, the debauching our Morals, the Encouragement of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Introduction of Poverty: And this muſt eternally be the Caſe, ſince, as there can be no Occaſion for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment's finding a Medium, but in ſupport of a loſing Trade, the Conſequence muſt neceſſarily be, that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney will ſoon be gone, and as foreign Debts increaſe, (for increaſe they muſt as long as this Trade is carried on) there muſt be a greater Demand for thoſe Things, that will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in Payment, and the greater that Demand is, the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thoſe Things will be with Regard to this Government-Medium, or in other Words, this Medium muſt depreciate, this naturally introduces <hi>Cheating</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> and brings on <hi>Luxury</hi> and <hi>Extravagance,</hi> which produces <hi>Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and at laſt ends in the <hi>extreameſt Poverty.</hi> Hath not this been the Caſe with us! Did not the Emiſſion of Paper Money ſoon baniſh Gold and Silver from amongſt us? Did not our foreign Debts continually increaſe till we had loſt our <hi>Credit abroad</hi>? Did not the Demand for Returns to pay theſe Debts depreciate our Paper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium till it was reduced to leſs than a ſixth Part of its original Value? Hath not this introduced all Kinds of Cheating and Oppreſſion, without Regard I had almoſt ſaid either to <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>private</hi> Faith? Have not many Perſons amaſſed Eſtates, by running firſt of all into, and then continuing in Debt, till they have at laſt by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation of the Currency paid their Creditors with three quarters or one half the Value of the Original Debt? Hath not this been the great Occaſion of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable and daily increaſing Luxury? Hath not this been a great Diſcouragement to Induſtry, without which no Community can flouriſh, and a great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Idleneſs, the Bane and Deſtruction of every Society? Have not many Perſons left off their more induſtrious, laborious Employments in which they have been brought up, when they ſaw they could get a better Living in ſo much eaſier a Manner? And have
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006612_0012_102952027AA61960"/>
we not been reduced to ſuch a Degree of Poverty, that we ſhould have been in the greateſt Perplexity, had not the Parliament reimburſed us the Charge of the <hi>Louiſbourg</hi> Expedition, and our own Legiſlature, in ſo wiſe a manner, provided for the Redemption of our Bills of Credit?</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, we may ſafely conclude, that any <hi>artificial local Medium</hi> for the Support of Trade, inſtead of anſwering the good Ends pretended to be deſigned by it, will entirely deſtroy it, by driving away all Trade that is beneficial, and can ſupport none but ſuch as a Country had better be without; ſuch an one, as the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it is ſupported, will bring us into more Debt, and involve us in greater Miſery.</p>
            <p>IT is then of the utmoſt Importance to give a due At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the <hi>Trade and Commerce</hi> of a Country, upon which the <hi>Riches or Poverty</hi> of it depends, and of the laſt Neceſſity, to give a proper Encouragement to the raiſing and manufacturing thoſe Things that it is capable of, both for its own Conſumption, and for Exportation in return for what is neceſſarily obliged to take from others; and that there ſhould be a ſufficient Diſcouragement to the Conſumption of all <hi>foreign unneceſſary Commodities,</hi> that ſerve only for the feeding <hi>Luxury</hi> and gratifying <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER Article of very great Importance, is the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Inhabitants of the Province, as much as poſſible, of future <hi>Taxes.</hi> In caſe of another War, there will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ariſe new and great Charges to the Government; and conſequently Individuals muſt pay a larger Tax to the Defence and Support of it, than they are obliged to in a Time of Peace: But during a Peace, the Scheme to pay the current Charges of the Government is ſo eaſy, practicable and obvious, that it would be ſurprizing if it was overlooked, According to ſome late Calculations, we conſume annually nigh <hi>one million eight hundred thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and Pounds</hi> Old Tenor in ſpirituous Liquors: ſo large a Sum ſeems almoſt incredible; but if the Time that is
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006612_0013_10295205B8A13910"/>
miſpent in the Conſumption of thoſe Liquors is taken into the Calculation, I make no Doubt it is too low; but giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up that large Sum, let us only take it for granted that a <hi>Million</hi> Old Tenor is annually conſumed; yet the Expence even of that Sum (which I believe is vaſtly within the Bounds of Truth) is a Piece of Luxury that ought to be retrenched; and if it can't be retrenched, the Conſumers have not the leaſt Reaſon to complain of an Exciſe upon it; and any Perſon of the leaſt Modeſty who contributed to this Luxury, would be aſhamed to appear publickly againſt ſuch a Propoſal; ſince the large Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of thoſe Liquors tends to ruin our Conſtitutions; which is a Misfortune that not only will attend us, but reaches to our Poſterity; and at the ſame Time produces an Habit of Idleneſs, which has already impoveriſhed many Families, and is compleating the Ruin of many more. To ſee ſuch a Province as this, bleſſed with ſo healthy a Climate; ſuch a Variety of Soils calculated for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of almoſt all the Neceſſaries and Conveniences of Life; inhabited by a People ſituated under the happieſt of Governments; as brave in their natural Temper as any People on Earth; I ſay, to ſee a Province under all theſe and many other natural Advantages conſuming their Health and Eſtate in Luxury and Extravagance, muſt needs diſtinguiſh us to the reſt of Mankind as guilty of the greateſt Miſconduct, not to apply the Remedy which courts us: But if Individuals are loth to break off their bad Habits, it is ſtrictly incumbent on the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to make ſome Good ariſe out of ſo much Evil.</p>
            <p>THE Exciſe upon Rum and other ſpirituous Liquors is now <hi>two Shillings</hi> Old Tenor per Gallon, and the annual Produce of this and the other Exciſes is <hi>twenty-three thouſand Pound</hi> Old Tenor.—It is ſuppoſed that not one half of it is accounted for; now ſuppoſing the Exciſe ſhould be raiſed to <hi>four Shillings</hi> Old Tenor per Gallon, and to be paid at the Still Head; the neat Produce of this with the Duties of Import (which ought alſo to be raiſed on what is conſumed within the Province) would
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006612_0014_1029520749541F60"/>
be ſufficient to pay all the Charges of the Government. And in this Manner to be eaſed of all our publick Taxes, ſeems ſo prudent and neceſſary a Scheme, that a tender Regard for the good of the Province, abſolutely requires it to be thought of at leaſt.</p>
            <p>NOW I am on this Article of <hi>Taxes,</hi> I would juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that it ſeems quite reaſonable that a ſmall Tax ſhould be layed on <hi>Waſte Lands.</hi> The Inhabitants of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince are taxed for their Faculties, and why a Tract of unimproved Land, that is riſing perhaps <hi>twenty</hi> per Cent per Annum ſhould not be conſidered in ſome ſuch Light, is difficult to diſtinguiſh.</p>
            <p>WE have been ſo long burdened with Taxes, that it would reconcile the Minds of many of us to a Silver Medium, and detach us from our Fondneſs of a Paper Currency, if we could now have the Satisfaction, that we were for the future to be eaſed of our old dreaded Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. This may be done, and the Queſtion is whether it ought not to be done?</p>
            <p>OTHER <hi>Sumptuary Laws</hi> beſides the <hi>Exciſe,</hi> may be neceſſary, that would not interfere with the Intereſt of our Mother Country; particularly with Reſpect to the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance of Dreſs. The <hi>Lex Oppia</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was made in the 540th Year of the City, ordained, <hi>that no Woman ſhould have above half an Ounce of Gold, wear a party coloured Garment, or be carried in a Chariot in any City, Town or to any Place within a Miles Diſtance, unleſs upon the Account of celebrating ſome ſacred Solemnity.</hi> I juſt mention this to ſhew the Care of the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth in preſerving their ancient Frugality, and not to diſtinguiſh the Ladies for greater Extravagance than the Men; ſo far from it, that taking the whole into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, the other Sex are vaſtly more inexcuſable for Levity and the Folly of Dreſs.</p>
            <p>DOUBTLESS, prudent Laws to regulate Extravagance,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006612_0015_1029520A66D095A0"/>
would have a very good Effect; but at the ſame Time, the Polite Part of the Society, Gentlemen of Figure and Character might by their Example effectuate it. It is what is neceſſary to be done, and the different Characters in Life ought to diſtinguiſh themſelves in it.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Article which deſerves Conſideration, is the <hi>Improvement of our Soil.</hi> And here is ſuch a large Field of Variety, to range in, that it requires not only Skill but Induſtry to cultivate it. The Art of Huſbandry, however trifling it may appear, is a Subject equal to the greateſt Genius; and the proper Application of ſuch a Genius would make it vaſtly ſerviceable to any Community. Mankind are very fondly attached to the Cuſtoms of their Predeceſſors, and adopt them as their ſecond Nature; and hence, by being ſo loth to leave the old Road, they cramp that Invention which might be very uſeful in Life, and from which they might reap a double Profit: So that it ſeems neceſſary in ſuch a Country as this, for a Legiſlature to incourage Improvements of this Nature; by making it worth the while to deviate from ſuch old Roads or Cuſtoms; which after they have ſo done renders needleſs any future Proviſions of the ſame Nature: for the Intereſt of Mankind will be ſufficient to induce them to ſuch Practices, when they are once convinced from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment that that Intereſt is advanced thereby. We ſupply ourſelves from other Governments, in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, with Proviſions of various Sorts, which Strangers tell us, is a Shame for us to do; and we ourſelves ought to think it a Shame; for we have many different Soils, as well adapted to thoſe Neceſſaries of Life as our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. <hi>Corn, Rye, Barley</hi> and <hi>Oats</hi> we are ſure, from our own Experience, are quite eaſy to be raiſed among us; and I believe, were we as induſtrious as ſome other Nations, we ſhould raiſe enough not only for our own Conſumption, but alſo for Exportation, if required; but inſtead of ſo doing, we pay large Sums for thoſe Commodities to ſome of our neighbouring Provinces. The main Difficulty is, raiſing of <hi>Wheat,</hi> but even as to that Article (for which
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006612_0016_1029520F5C9D2648"/>
we pay a great Ballance to others) it may doubtleſs be produced among ourſelves; for why ſhould not thoſe County's eſpecially which are contiguous to the <hi>Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut</hi> Wheat Soil be as capable of producing it as that Soil is: Surely every Argument that is urged againſt this important Affair muſt be the Effect of Indolence; for it is well known that in many Counties of this Province good <hi>Wheat</hi> has been raiſed to Advantage. But it ſeems our Wheat is ſubject to <hi>Smut</hi> and <hi>Mildew</hi>: And ſo it is in <hi>England</hi>; but pray is not <hi>England</hi> one of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <hi>Wheat</hi> Countries in the World? Doubtleſs, was there a proper Bounty given for the raiſing it, we ſhould ſoon learn ſo much of the Art of Huſbandry, as to prevent thoſe <hi>Smuts</hi> and <hi>Mildews</hi> with as much Eaſe as others do. And I am apt to think that Obſervation, made by a Gentleman of Diſcernment, is very juſt, viz. that <hi>Wheat</hi> is very ſubject to Blaſt in the rainy Seaſons of Paper Money.</p>
            <p>A Bounty given to the manufacturing of what <hi>Wheat</hi> we raiſed, into <hi>Flour,</hi> would be another prudential Method, if we would only conſider how many thouſand Barrels of this we yearly import into the Province.</p>
            <p>BARLEY is an Article of great Conſequence, and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard a Farmer that ever raiſed it, but would allow it was a profitable Improvement of Land. Some Lands will produce <hi>ſixty</hi> Buſhels an Acre; and ſuppoſe but <hi>twenty</hi> Buſhels are allowed, the Thing ſpeaks for itſelf: And if we ſhould get into this Practice in general, we ſhould not only reap the Profits of our Trouble by a Crop, but it would alſo introduce the Cuſtom of drinking <hi>Malt Liquors,</hi> on which an hard Labourer in <hi>England</hi> will work and grow fat and healthy, while a lazy Labourer here, in the Uſe of ſpiritous Liquors, and of <hi>Cyder</hi> made from Fruit bad in its own Nature and rotten by Careleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will grow as Meagre as his Liquor, ſtarve his Family, and entail the Curſe of a bad Conſtitution on his Poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:006612_0017_102952125ACD4460"/>BUT what is of as great Conſequence as any Kind of Produce, is the raiſing <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax.</hi> There are many Tuns of Shipping built in this Province, and large Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of thoſe Articles are uſed upon our Navigation; and more particularly of the former, which comes to us through ſeveral Hands, and muſt therefore coſt us dear; whereas by proper Economy, we might not only raiſe enough for the Navigation of the Province, but might afford in a ſhort Time, to ſhip it to our Mother Country; which would not only be an eaſy Way of paying for the Manufactures we depend on her for, but would alſo be a Saving to the Nation, in Proportion as what we ſhipped to <hi>England</hi> would leſſen their Importation from the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Countrys. This may perhaps look chimerical at firſt View; but it is a Fact capable of being proved: for in <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> the Produce of an Acre of Hemp on good Land is <hi>one</hi> Tun, but ſuppoſing it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce here but <hi>half</hi> of a Tun; yet upon a Calculation of the Labour to raiſe it and dreſs it, and the Price it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, it will turn out a very profitable Article; beſides, a great Part of the Labour may be performed in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Seaſon, when Labour is of leſs Value than in any other Part of the Year; and beſides even this, a vaſt Deal of Labour might be ſaved by managing ſome Part of its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture with Waterworks. Suppoſing then upon the whole, that we have a Demand for our own Uſe, for <hi>four hundred Tuns</hi> per Year, which ſome think a large Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; yet this Quantity requires, at the above Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of its Produce, no more than <hi>eight hundred</hi> Acres of Land; and will any one ſuggeſt that ſo many Acres ſuitable to raiſe Hemp upon, cannot be picked out of the whole Province? It is confirmed by many that have raiſed it, that though it was laborious to go through the whole Proceſs of it, yet that it was at laſt very profitable. As to the Objection of not having Land ſuitable for it, it is quite idle; for it is well known, that we have very large Tracts of low Lands, which lie uncultivated notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their being the richeſt Soils we have; but the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of clearing them deters many from the Work.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006612_0018_10295213E7D29C50"/>
Thoſe Lands, if they were cleared (as they might be in the Winter Seaſon when People have little elſe to do, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting their Attendance on the neceſſary and important Avocations of a Tavern) we ſhould find to be ſome of our beſt Eſtates: This is a Fact, which a few Experiments have made inconteſtable, and to increaſe Experiments upon it, would make the moſt ample Amends.</p>
            <p>THE ſame Arguments here uſed for raiſing <hi>Hemp</hi> may ſerve for raiſing <hi>Flax,</hi> which is another important Article of Produce. It is ſaid, that the Town of <hi>Nutfield</hi> in <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> Government, manufactures into Linnen to the Amount of <hi>thirty</hi> or <hi>forty thouſand Pounds</hi> Old Tenor per Year; and why the whole Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> may not do ſomething on this Head in ſome Proportion to the Town of <hi>Nutfield,</hi> would be very difficult to aſſign a good Reaſon for. We import ſuch large Quantities of foreign Linnen, that a proper Degree of Emulation and Induſtry would ſave a large Ballance to the Province. Some that are always fond of Excuſes for their Indolence, will ſay, that our Soil is not adapted to <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax</hi>; but beſides the Anſwer juſt now given to this Objection, I would beg Leave to ſubjoin another, viz. That we can make Soils if we cannot find them: but as this comes more properly under the <hi>Art of Huſbandry,</hi> I would refer thoſe, who are in Earneſt, to the Authors who treat on this Subject, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the Pamphlets on <hi>Field Huſbandry,</hi> which are annually publiſhed by the <hi>Rev. Mr.</hi> JARED ELIOT <hi>of Killingſworth in Connecticut,</hi> which ſhew ſo much good Senſe, founded on his own and the moſt authentick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, and are ſo peculiarly adapted to our Climate, that every Farmer ought to have them by him, and to teach them to his Children, as including in them not the leaſt Part of the Duty which they owe to their Country.</p>
            <p>BUT that which is of the laſt Importance, and muſt be the Foundation of all other Proſperity is, the Increaſe of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006612_0019_102952171E450600"/>
our <hi>Inhabitants</hi>: And without this, the largeſt Tracts, beſt ſituated and moſt luxuriant Soil under Heaven avails no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But here I am in ſome Meaſure anticipated by a well-timed prudent Reſolve of the General Aſſembly in their laſt Seſſions, in lending the <hi>Province Ship</hi> for the Importation, and in appropriating <hi>four Townſhips</hi> for the Settlement of Foreigners; a Conduct highly becoming the Paternal Care, of thoſe, who are ſtiled the <hi>Fathers of their Country.</hi> When we conſider the Loſs of ſo many thouſands of our beſt Labouring Men in the Courſe of a few Years paſt, we ought not to ſit ſtill and deſpair, but to repair the Misfortune as ſoon as poſſible. We ſee the happy Effect of ſuch a Meaſure in the Province of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi>; where ſo many have been imported of late Years, that their Cities, their Trade, and their Riches have increaſed to a prodigious Degree. Let us only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the Labour of <hi>five hundred</hi> Men, as Wages are now, will amount to <hi>fifty thouſand Pound</hi> per Year Profit; and whether that Sum is not worth ſaving, let any judge. It is the Number of induſtrious <hi>Inhabitants</hi> that muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich a Country; it is their Number that muſt make the Charges of Government ſit light and eaſy, when ſuch Charges do ariſe; and it is their Number that muſt be the chief Defence of a Province, expoſed, as we are, to the Ravages of an Enemy on an extended Frontier: Let then the Number of induſtrious foreign Proteſtants be ſtill encouraged. In this Method we ſhall not only alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate our Loſs of Men, but in all Probability the Loſs of many uſeful Artificers, who have been taken off by the late Wars.</p>
            <p>SOME are very fond of the Name of Poſterity, and think the Introduction of Foreigners would oblige their Children to ſell their Country; but if they would only be pleaſed to conſider one Moment, that if Inhabitants were to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe only in a Courſe of Nature, how many <hi>Millions</hi> of Acres would in this Province lie uncultivated; and that their own Eſtates would be of little Value in this ordinary Way of Generation; whereas notwithſtanding the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006612_0020_1029521A71DBEE68"/>
of Foreigners, they might ſave as much Land for their Children as they would cultivate in many Generations; and at the ſame Time raiſe the Value of what they could conveniently ſpare to others; unleſs they will carry their Foreſight to <hi>ten thouſand</hi> Generations; and if they are ſo overprudent as this, I will allow they will want not only another Province for Poſterity, but alſo another Continent. But I ſhould be glad ſuch Objectors would aſk themſelves, whether in Caſe of another <hi>French War</hi> they would not be willing to have others bear a ſmall Part, at leaſt, of the Burden of Military Duties, and Taxes conſequent thereon.</p>
            <p>I have gone through the ſeveral Articles I purpoſed to mention, tho' many other things are left untouched, and willingly leave the Conſideration of them to the Friends of their Country. If any Thing of Importance has been offered, I doubt not it will have its due Weight. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is diſagreeable, unpopular, inaccurate or trifling, I hope will be overlooked, as the whole was deſigned for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Province. I was induced to mention them at this Time, as the Reſult of the laſt Seſſion of the General Aſſembly is looked upon as an Earneſt of much future Good, and as the Aſſembly is not again met: And ſhould any of thoſe Articles be worth their Notice, the acting their Part immediately might have the happieſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the Proſperity of the Province. One Year ſaved, in our particular happy Circumſtances, might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably produce the moſt beneficial Conſequences, and the Loſs of a Seſſion might be productive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
