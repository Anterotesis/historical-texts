            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And now the Light of God's Countenance ſhines upon them in its full Strength, and all their Darkneſs vaniſheth away, as the Shades of Night before the ſpringing Day, and riſing Sun. And being joined with the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, they wait in a certain Expectation for the Redemption of their Bodies and re-union with them, Yea, when Chriſt, who is their Life, ſhall appear, they ſhall alſo appear with Him in Glory: and ſo ſhall they be ever with the Lord. Agreably the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Johnn</hi> heard a Voice from Heaven, ſaying to him,— <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth: Yea, ſaith the Spirit, thai they may reſt from their Labours; and their Works do follow them,</hi> Rev. 14.13.</p>

                     <p>Contraries will have contrary Conſequences. This deadly Plague of the Heart inclines Men to diſobey and reject the Warnings of God's Word and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And this is highly provoking to God. Heb. 3.8. <hi>Harden not your Hearts, as in the Provocation.</hi> This evil Spirit gives God reaſon to complain as of his ancient People, Iſai. 1.5. <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? ye will revolt more and more.</hi> And therefore, when God's profeſſing People are guilty of this great and Heaven-daring Sin under in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and threatned Judgments, it's a fearful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of approaching Ruin. Ver. 7. <hi>Your Country is deſolate, your Cities are burnt with Fire: your Land, Strangers devour it in your Preſence, and it is deſolate as overthrown by Strangers.</hi> Accordingly Wiſdom cries, Prov. 1.23. <hi>Turn you at my Reproof.</hi> And threatens, v. 24,—27. <hi>Becauſe I have called,

                     <p n="2">II. Let us all be exhorted, <hi>in the diligent uſe of Means, to ſeek of God this tender Heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is God's Gift. Ezek. 36.26.—<hi>I will give you an Heart of Fleſh.</hi> i.e. a tender and ſoft Heart, of quick Senſe, and ready to receive due Impreſſions from God's Word and Providence, and to yield to his ſovereign Will. Let us then <hi>pray</hi> to God for this great Bleſſing. When God had promiſed it, He adds, Ezek. 36.37. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will yet for this be inquired of by the Houſe of Iſrael, to do, it for them.</hi> God will do this; but it muſt be in Anſwer to Prayer. He expects that his People do thus ſhew their Value for ſo great a Mercy, and their entire Dependance on him for it. Let us then, deeply ſenſible how our Hearts have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed and hardened by Sin, pour out that Prayer to the God of all Grace, Pſal. 51.10. <hi>Create in me a clean Heart, O God; and renew a right Spirit within me.</hi> Again, we muſt <hi>attend to the Word of God,</hi> which is perfect, converting the Soul. Jer. 23.29. <hi>Is not my Word like a Fire? ſaith the Lord: and like a Hammer that breaketh the Rock in Pieces.</hi> Yes
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007790_0020_102D8B96DB7A9F48"/>
ſurely, when the Almighty is pleas'd to take it into his Hand, he can break the hardeſt Heart, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it into Tears of godly Sorrow, which worketh Repentance to Salvation. Let us then wait at the Poſts of Wiſdom's Doors, and hearken to the Voice of God's Word, and pray that we may mix it with Faith; then the Word will be to us the Power of God to change and ſoften our Hearts. Again, we ſhould <hi>obſerve the Providences of God</hi> for this End: That his Goodneſs may lead us to Repentance; and that under his awful Judgments, we may ſay with <hi>Joh,</hi> Chap. 23.16.— <hi>God maketh my Heart ſoft.</hi> And that knowing the Terrors of the Lord, we may look unto Jeſus, to whom the Father hath committed all Judgment, and mourn and turn to the Lord, with a broken Heart and contrite Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Then we ſhould lay <hi>it to Heart, when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this Character are taken from us by Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let them be high or low in their outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, they are the excellent in the Earth, the <hi>Chariots and Horſemen of Iſrael,</hi> who help to keep off Judgments from a People. Had there been ten ſuch righteous Perſons in <hi>Sodom,</hi> the God who cannot lie, gave his Word to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen 19.32.— <hi>I will not deſtroy it for tens ſake.</hi> Agreeably, God ſpeaks of it as a provoking Sin, Iſai. 57.1. <hi>The Righteous periſheth, and no Man layeth it to Heart.</hi> And then adds, <hi>None conſidering that the Righteous are taken away from the Evil to come.</hi> May God avert the Omen!</p>
                     <p>In a particular Manner is this the Caſe, when ſuch are removed by Death, as were of <hi>publick Character and Influence,</hi> and in their Stations <hi>Gap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> who us'd their beſt Endeavours, Humane Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

excepted, to keep off impending Judgments from breaking in upon their People.</p>
                     <p>One of this Character, was that <hi>Honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> whoſe Death we lament before the Lord this Day: Who <hi>having ſerved his Generation by the Will of God, is fallen aſleep, and laid unto his Fathers.</hi> As he bare the Name, ſo he exhibited much of the Spirit of this pious King: His Heart was tender, humbled and ſoftned under God's cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting Hand, in public and domeſtic Calamities. He was a true Mourner in Zion, for his own, and the Sins of God's People; and forward to engage in the Work of Repentance and Reformation, that God's Anger might be turned away.</p>
                     <p>In his Death this <hi>Province is bereav'd</hi> of One who was a faithful Friend and tender Father to his Country, in the ſeveral Places of public Truſt which he filled: As a <hi>Secretary</hi> of this Province by the Royal Commiſſion, for about forty Years, in which Office he continued till his Death; and as he had been for ſeveral Years of the Honourable Council, and Judge of Probate for this County: He diſcharged the Duties of theſe important Offices with a laudable Capacity, great Diligence and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, as a good and faithful Servant of God, his King and Country. His ſolicitous Care was, that the Common-Wealth might receive no Damage. And he was moderate in his Demands from particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons; ſo far from extorting more than was due, that, as I am informed, he rather abated of his Right. And there is Reaſon now to take up that Lamentation, and ſay, <hi>Behold, the Lord, the Lord of Hoſts doth take away the Judge, and the prudent, and the Ancient, the honourable Man, and the Councellor.</hi>

                  <p>In <hi>Particular</hi>—One whoſe <hi>Heart</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> was <hi>ſanctfied</hi> in ſome Degree by his All-mighty Spirit—whoſe <hi>Principles</hi> or <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> of <hi>Enmity</hi> to or <hi>Averſion</hi> from the holy Nature, Laws, Will, Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, Authority and Government of God, were in ſome Degree <hi>ſubdued</hi> or <hi>mortified</hi>—whoſe <hi>Heart</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> was ſo <hi>renewed</hi> or <hi>changed;</hi> as to have a ſweet, pleaſant and predominant <hi>Reliſh</hi> for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation</hi> of his holy Nature, Perfections, Laws, Word of Inſpiration, Will, Deſigns, Authority, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, Government Bleſſedneſs, and glory:—of <hi>his Word of Inſpiration,</hi> eſpecially the Doctrines, Hiſtories, Promiſes, and Prophecies reſpecting the Work of Redemption by the MESSIAH, the Work of Sanctification by the HOLY SPIRIT, with all the inviſible and wonderful Realities therein revealed.</p>
                  <p>One who therefore <hi>clearly ſaw</hi> the <hi>tranſcendant Amiableneſs, Excellence,</hi> and <hi>Importance</hi> of all theſe Things: as alſo the exceeding Suitableneſs, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence,

the Happineſs, the great Deſireableneſs of having his <hi>Nature</hi> intirely, perfectly, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, conformed to the holy <hi>Nature</hi> of GOD in all his moral Excellencies; and of having his <hi>Heart,</hi> his whole Spirit, Soul, Body and <hi>Life,</hi> thus conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo to his Sovereign <hi>Will</hi> both in Submiſſion, Patience and Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, One who therefore clearly ſaw the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Honour, Excellence and Bleſſedneſs of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rving Him, and of employing all his Opportunities, Powers and Talents in his faithful <hi>Service,</hi> and to promote his Glory:—who intirely heartily, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eternally <hi>devoted</hi> himſelf and all he had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:—who had <hi>habitual</hi> and <hi>predominant</hi> Deſires, Longings, Prayers, Reſolutions, Labours, Strivings, and Preſſings after all this Honour, Excellence and Bleſſedneſs:—And who exceedingly <hi>rejoyced,</hi> and grew in <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to GOD, for every Meaſure of attaining to them.</p>
                  <p>Such a One was CALEB: and no doubt but that He, as well as his Anceſtor ABRAHAM who lived above <hi>three Hundred Years</hi> before him, <note n="*" place="bottom">A.

                  </p>
                  <p>And ſuch a One is <hi>every Real Chriſtian;</hi> but with this complex and great Advantage—That abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more of the tranſcendent Glories and Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the bleſſed GOD are ſince revealed in the Goſpel:—They are vaſtly more diſplayed in and through CHRIST, in his wondrous Perſon, Natures,

Offices and Benefits:—In The Face or Perſon of CHRIST they ſurprizingly appear, who is the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Effulgence of the Divine Glory:—The Ways and the higher Degrees of ſerving the Bleſſed GOD, are more clearly ſhown:—The Obligations, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements and the Motives exceedingly increaſed:—And the Souls of thoſe who are ſavingly renewed and enlightned, are therefore vaſtly more engaged, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and delighted in his Service than before.</p>
                  <p>But the</p>
                  <p>2d Part of his Character, yet more diſtinguiſhing, was, that he <hi>had another Spirit with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>i. e. A Spirit different, not only from what was in die <hi>other Spies,</hi> excepting <hi>Joſhua,</hi> but alſo from what appeared in the <hi>Generality</hi> of the <hi>Congregation</hi> of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe learned Men who near the Apoſtles Days cranſlated the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> out of <hi>Hebrew</hi> into <hi>Syriack,</hi> tho't, the Meaning of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> was— <hi>My Spirit was with him.</hi> And indeed they ſo far rightly tho't; that unleſs the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD was working with and in him, as a Spirit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and exciting Holineſs; he would not have differed from the Reſt of the unbelieving, murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; rebellious Congregation.<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Iſai</hi> iv. 4. xi. 2. xxviii. 6.</note> It was the SPIRIT of GOD, as a SPIRIT of communicative Holineſs, now in the Goſpel revealed to be alſo the SPIRIT of CHRIST; which made the Spirit or active Temper of the Soul of CALEB to be, and at that Time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear exceeding different from the Spirit of the Reſt of the People. And I ſaid the SPIRIT of CHRIST;—as all his gracious Workings are Purchaſed by Him, and are the Effect both of his gracious, mediatorial Interceſſion, and then of his conjunct Authority and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007790_0036_102D8BB6F90A8A00"/>
Miſſion with the Divine Father, in the agreed Oeconomy, and Order of our Salvation.</p>
                  <p>But then as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Words more preciſely ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy— <hi>Another Spirit with Him—as all the other ancient Perſons</hi> render them;—it ſeems plain to me, that <hi>this other Spirit with him,</hi> was <hi>the actual Temper</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> of CALEB: and as it was in it ſelf, ſo on that Occaſion it remarkably appeared exceeding different from the unbelieving, murmuring and rebellious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which then ſurprizingly wrought and appeared in the tumultuous Congregation.</p>
                  <p>I can't tell how to think, that <hi>all</hi> the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, excepting <hi>Moſes, Aaron, Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> were combin'd in the <hi>Mutiny:</hi> For it appears clear to me, that <hi>the whole Tribe</hi> of <hi>Levi,</hi> were diſtinguiſh'd from the Reſt in <hi>Mutiny;</hi> as a late learned Writer of our own, a curious Searcher of the holy Scriptures,<note n="†" place="bottom">The late Hon. Chief Juſtice <hi>Dudley.</hi>
                     </note> has, I think, ſufficiently made evident: and to me it ſeems alſo highly probable, that they were then, <hi>in, around &amp; neareſt</hi> to the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> where <hi>their Tribe</hi> was ſtationed, and with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> diſtinguiſh'd from the Reſt in <hi>Company,</hi> with ſome Vacancy between them and the Reſt of the Congregation: but they were <hi>only the other twelve Tribes, Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> being two of the twelve, out of whom the <hi>twelve Spies</hi> were ſent, who were the murmuring Multitude.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe other twelve Tribes <hi>only,</hi> it is ſaid that— <hi>All the Congregation liſted up their Voice and cried—And all the Children of Iſrael murmured—And the whole Congregation ſaid—Would God we had died in the Land of Egypt—And they ſaid one to another, Let us make a Captain, and let us return into Egypt.</hi> Nor were the <hi>Children</hi> under <hi>twenty Years of Age,</hi> who were in all Probability, as Mr. <hi>Saurin</hi> well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes

at leaſt <hi>Twelve Hundred Thouſand,</hi> involv'd either in the threatened Deſtruction in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor among the guilty Murmurers.</p>
                  <p>Nor can I think that <hi>all</hi> the MEN of <hi>this Congregation,</hi> excepting <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> deſtitute of real <hi>habitual Holineſs;</hi> or what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called ſpecial ſanctifying, ſaving Grace. For the Word <hi>all,</hi> Scripture, often ſignifies <hi>ſo many, ſuch a Generality,</hi> as to a Spectator the Others made no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; but the whole Congregation ſeem'd to be agitated by the ſame rebellious Spirit No doubt <hi>great Numbers</hi> among that vaſt Multitude, compos'd of above <hi>Six Hundred Thouſand Men</hi> beſides Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children, were greatly grieved with what they heard and ſaw, all round about them: but the Uproar of the Multitude was ſo great, as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm and cover them.</p>
                  <p>Yea, I am apt to think that <hi>great Numbers</hi> even of the <hi>Murmurers themſelves,</hi> might yet have <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Holineſs</hi> or Grace <hi>in the Bottom of their Hearts;</hi> tho' then dreadfully overwhelmed with ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Floods of Paſſion and Corruption:—as in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Heart of <hi>Peter,</hi> when he profanely curs'd and ſwore, and deny'd his Divine and dear Maſter. And if CHRIST had not ſo ſoon beſtowed ſuch a melting Look upon Him, he would not have ſo ſoon gone out and wept ſo bitterly.</p>
                  <p>It is both grievous and aſtoniſhing to think how the habitual and <hi>vital Principles</hi> of Grace, may lie deep in the Hearts of the Renewed, or thoſe who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be ſanctified; and yet ſometimes by the awful <hi>Permiſſion</hi> of GOD, be overwhelmed by <hi>Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Corruptions,</hi> which over-power and for a while ſuppreſs the predominant Exerciſe of thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Principles; and the <hi>Renewed</hi> are ſadly left to act and look like the <hi>Reſt</hi> of the <hi>ungodly</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi>

World. And this I apprehend was the Caſe of <hi>many</hi> blended with that tumultuous Multitude.</p>
                  <p>But CALEB had in Himſelf, and on that Occaſſion ſhewed quite <hi>another Spirit:</hi> i. e. a Spirit, not only totally different from thoſe who were habitually <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Ungodly</hi> but alſo vaſtly different from thoſe who were <hi>Religious at the Bottom,</hi> but in that Seaſon of Temptation murmured with the Reſt of the Congregation.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>in what Reſpect</hi> had lie <hi>Another Sprit?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer—</p>
                  <p>The <hi>active Temper</hi> of his Heart or Soul, were not only <hi>ſanctified</hi> with holy Reliſhes and Bents, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he differ'd from all the <hi>Ungodly;</hi> But this ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Temper alſo <hi>ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>ſeveral Branches</hi> of this ſanctified Temper are in the holy Scripture commonly called <hi>Graces,</hi> And all theſe Graces dwelt and acted in him in a lively, reigning, apparent and ſteady Manner. Thus we read of <hi>the Spirit of Wiſdom,</hi> which his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Joſhua was ſaid to be <hi>full of,</hi> Deut. xxxiv. 9. <hi>The Spirit of Meekneſs,</hi> which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſed the <hi>Chriſtian Galatians</hi> had; <hi>Chap.</hi> vi 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe and other Graces CALEB had, and liv'd in the powerful, eminent and ſteady Exerciſe of. And among his other Graces, he had of eſpecially <hi>the Spirit of Faith,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, that he and the other Apoſtles had in their Day, in 2 Cor. iv 13. And CALEB had not only the vital <hi>Principle</hi> of this active
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007790_0039_102D8BBCD9D63E18"/>
Grace, but alſo the lively, powerful, and victorious <hi>Excerciſe</hi> thereof; in which he eminently liv'd conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and eſpecialy in a diſtinguiſhing Degree diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in this dreadful Hour of Temptation.</p>
                  <p>He diſtinguiſhingly ſhow'd, that he had not only <hi>That Faith</hi> in GOD and in <hi>his Inſpirations</hi> which he derived from <hi>Education &amp; Rational Conviction;</hi> but alſo <hi>That</hi> vaſtly more vital, active and victorious <hi>Faith</hi> wrought by the DIVINE SPIRIT, when he changes or begins to ſanctify the Hearts of Sinners. And by <hi>this vital Principle,</hi> as the Fundamental Power in him, with the Help of wiſe <hi>Conſideration</hi> and thoſe concurring <hi>lively Ideas</hi> of thoſe moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Objects and Truths which GOD had then revealed—I would ſay. with the Help of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring <hi>lively Ideas</hi> of them which the HOLY SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT gave him, and which the Scriptures call <hi>his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Illumination,</hi> or <hi>ſhining in the Hearts of Men:</hi>—He lived in a conſtant, believing View of thoſe Truths and Objects, as real, certain, and of the greateſt Moment.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Particular,</hi> He lived in the believing and lively Views of GOD, his Being and Perfections, Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty. Authority, Laws, Predictions, Threatnings.

                  <p>And as GOD had <hi>promiſed</hi> to bring the Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and put them in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and CALEB knew this Promiſe, and had ſeen the Begining of its Fulfilment in a moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007790_0040_102D8BBF0723BE58"/>
View excited, he with an amazing Courage, along with <hi>Joſhua</hi> ran among the mutinous and raging Multitude; to ſtay them from their mad Deſign of turning back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and encourage them to truſt in GOD to fulfil all his Promiſe and put them into the Poſſeſſion of the Land before them. From his Faith, his public Zeal and Courage, he ran the moſt deſperate Riſk among them: And in their Rage they had quickly ſtoned <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> to Death, had not <hi>the Glory of the LORD</hi> at that Moment blazed out and ſaved them.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>this Town</hi> he was <hi>born</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1681.

                  <p>From the <hi>College</hi> he <hi>travelled Abroad</hi> both to the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> improved ſtill in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel Accompliſhments; but maintained unſullied his <hi>moral Character;</hi> and <hi>religious Sentiments and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</hi> And indeed the more a ſerious and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>New-England</hi> Youth ſees of the depraved World Abroad; the more will he riſe in his Eſteem of the ſolid Religion of his native Land, which renders it the happieſt for good Order and Sobriety, at this Day on the Earth.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>June</hi> 1717, King GEORGE I. exceedingly gratified and bleſs'd <hi>this Province,</hi> by appointing Him our <hi>Secretary.</hi> And in this publick Poſt he has ever ſince appeared a bright and moſt amiable Example of Care, Diligence, Integrity, Publick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Generoſity; to the great Honour and Advantage, and to the univerſal Pleaſure of his Country.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Dec.</hi> 1731, He was made <hi>Judge of Probates</hi> for <hi>this County</hi> of <hi>Suffolk;</hi> and in <hi>May</hi> 1734, choſen into HIS MAJESTY'S <hi>Council</hi> for the <hi>Province:</hi> and held all theſe Places at the ſame Time, till from his great Increaſe of Buſieſs in the <hi>Secretary's Office,</hi> He of his own Motion laid down the <hi>Probacy</hi> in 1745; and from his advanced Age, apprehended it his Duty to give up his Place the laſt Year at the <hi>Council-Board,</hi> to the Publick Sorrow; and tho' earneſtly follicited to ſtay, with Offers of great Indulgence to his growing Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities

                  <p>But it was his diſtinguiſhing, unaffected and yet ſhining <hi>Piety,</hi> which ſpread a pleaſing Luſtre on all his other Endowments, and render'd him ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amiable and delightful to us.

                  <p>There ſeem'd to be a great deal of <hi>Sincerity, Openeſs</hi> and <hi>Freeneſs</hi> in his <hi>natural Temper;</hi> tho' his <hi>Openeſs</hi> and <hi>Freeneſs</hi> were agreably tempered with <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Prudence.</hi> And when he couragiouſly open'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with any Meaſure of <hi>Anger;</hi> it proceeded from Diſpleaſure at the <hi>Evil,</hi> and not Enmity to the <hi>Perſon,</hi> and from a <hi>Conſciencious Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Glory</hi> of GOD, and <hi>Good</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi> But his <hi>Sincerity,</hi> by the <hi>humbling and breaking</hi> Influences of the SPIRIT of GOD on his enlightned Heart, became in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Degree a <hi>Grace</hi> of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>His more <hi>eminent Piety</hi> began with <hi>this humbling and breaking</hi> Operation.

Heart as to think upon them with Delight, together with thoſe baſe and carnal Motives which put him on and mixed with, and ſo defiled all his Duties; with the perfectly and perpetually holy and all-ſeeing Eye of GOD upon him;—that his Heart was broken to Pieces with the deepeſt Shame, Abaſement, and Self-Abhorrence: All his Confidence in his own Strength and Righteouſneſs or Worthineſs, was utterly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: He could ſay with the inlightened <hi>Joh</hi> in Chap. xl. 3—5. <hi>Then Joh anſwered the LORD and ſaid, Behold I am vile; what ſhall I anſwer Thee? I will lay my Hand upon my Mouth: once have I ſpoken, but I will not Anſwer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further.</hi> And in Chap. xlii. 1. <hi>Then</hi> JOB <hi>anſwered the LORD and ſaid, I know that thou canſt do every Thing, and that no Thought can be with-holden from Thee: I have heard of Thee by the heard of the Ear; but now mine Eye ſeeth Thee: Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes.</hi> And from this Time, deep Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Lowlineſs and Brokenneſs of Heart, with a thoro' gracious, eminent Sincerity, became more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently the habitual, reigning Principles or Diſpoſitions in Him.</p>
                  <p>Now he alſo more clearly ſaw the abſolute Neceſſity of the Divine SPIRIT to ſanctify, enlighten, help and govern him; of the perfect and moſt meritorious Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of CHRIST to juſtify him; and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Grace of GOD to abound thro' CHRIST and by the HOLY SPIRIT, infinitely to him. CHRIST as GOD and Man Mediator appeared in his perfect Excellency, All-ſufficiency, and Suitableneſs, to ſave and make him happy: And to the glorious GOD in CHRIST he looked, and on Him truſted, and this continually, to ſave him from his Sins, his Sinfulneſs and Miſeries; and by his Holy SPIRIT to give

him ſaving Light &amp; Grace; ſpiritual Wiſdom, Strength, Victories and Comforts; and prepare him for, &amp; bring Him for the heavenly Glory.</p>
                  <p>He was a diligent Searcher of the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> had a deep Impreſſion on his Heart of their Divine Inſpiration and Authority; even by his own continual Experience, whereby his Faith in them was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confirmed: He clearly ſaw their exceeding Preciouſneſs: and the Truths and Promiſes therein were his delightful Contemplation.</p>
                  <p>He was well acquainted with the Meaning of thoſe Divine Truths revealed in the Scriptures, which are <hi>compatible</hi> to the humane Underſtanding: And for thoſe <hi>above</hi> it; He reverentially ſubmitted to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority, &amp; as firmly believed them, becauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd by GOD, as any Others.</p>
                  <p>He believed <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> commonly called <hi>Reformed</hi> to be wonderfully agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the HOLY SCRIPTURES. For he could not but account it a wondrous Thing indeed, that tho' they differed about the <hi>Worſhip, Form</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Churches;</hi> yet all the Martyrs and Reformers in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Italy, Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> as ſoon as they had the SCRIPTURES tranſlated into their ſeveral Languages, without conſulting with each other; yet harmoniouſly agreed in the very <hi>ſame Doctrines,</hi> by which they liv'd and dy'd, on which their extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Piety was founded, and which great Numbers ſealed in the glowing Fire: which the moſt pious <hi>Founders</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> brought over hither, and to which the pious Miniſters and People of <hi>our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> have ſtedfaſtly adhered to the preſent Day.</p>
                  <p>In Particular, He firmly believed with them, that the unſearchable <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Divine Trinity,</hi> is moſt plainly revealed in SCRIPTURE; and ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007790_0049_102F6B9F9A73DDA8"/>
with the entire Frame of the Chriſtian Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Religion, that if this Divine Doctrine be taken away, the wondrous Fabrick of Chriſtianity would fall to Pieces, and the utmoſt Confuſion intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Minds of its Profeſſors. And he was ſo much grieved, that he could fearce enjoy any Reſt, at the pernicious Attempts of ſome among us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine this great and fundamental Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>He would never perplex his Mind with <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical</hi> or ſubtil Attempts to <hi>explain</hi> it; which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended a vain Intruſion into Things above our Reach, and not revealed. He clearly ſaw the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Oracles aſcribe the <hi>ſame Divine Perfections, Titles, Works,</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> to the <hi>Divine</hi> FATHER, WORD and SPIRIT, which belong only to the <hi>One</hi> true GOD: That they <hi>abſolutely forbid devine Worſhip</hi> to be paid <hi>to any other;</hi> that the FATHER is the One GOD, the WORD is the One GOD, and the SPIRIT is the One GOD; but that there is <hi>ſame Sort of Diſtinction</hi> which the <hi>Scripture</hi> represents under the Form of a Perſonal <hi>Diſtinction;</hi> ſo that it would be highly improper to ſay that either the <hi>Divine</hi> FATHER, or the <hi>Divine</hi> SPIRIT were <hi>made Fleſh</hi> or <hi>became Incarnate;</hi> and yet that <hi>Theſe Three</hi> are wondrouſly <hi>united;</hi> but what that <hi>Diſtinction</hi> is <hi>preciſely,</hi> is not yet revealed, and without a further Revelation we can never find it.</p>
                  <p>With the concurring Help of the <hi>Divine</hi> SPIRIT, He felt the quickning and ſanctifying Power, and reliſhed the Sweetneſs of the DOCTRINES <hi>of the Goſpel</hi> preached in our NEW-ENGLAND <hi>Churches,</hi> which he found to be the very ſame which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taught in the <hi>Church</hi> of ENGLAND in the Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> I, and King <hi>Charles</hi> I And as he advanced in <hi>Sanctity,</hi> the more the <hi>Goſpel Doctrines</hi> and <hi>pious Spirit</hi> of <hi>thoſe ancient

Writers</hi> became ageeable to him. He had a mighty and juſt Senſe of <hi>Eternity,</hi> and of <hi>his eternal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt;</hi> wiſely apprehended all others were Trifles in Companion, and that he could not be too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned or careful to ſecure it:—was therefore greatly afraid leaſt he ſhould be fatally miſtaken in a Matter of ſuch infinite Importance:—moſt diligently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſearched his own Heart—chiefly valued the <hi>moſt ſearching Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Writers;</hi> thoſe who moſtly treat of <hi>the Religion of the Heart;</hi> i. e. the Work of the HOLY SPIRIT on the Hearts of Men, with the inward Workings of <hi>their own Spirits,</hi> and the Fruit of both; or which is the ſame, of <hi>vital</hi> or <hi>experimental Piety!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And tho' he ſometimes walked in <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> yet he has told me, He dare not deny the gracious Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the HOLY SPIRIT in him; the hopeful Appearances of a ſaving Change; of the Exerciſe of internal Graces;—in Particular high and endearing Apprehensions of GOD, as he appears in CHRIST; earneſt Thirſtings after Him, delightful Views of Him, and therein ſenſible Communion with Him, But his own Deficiencies in Obedience and Holineſs, with the ſinful Workings in him, and the Body of Sin, were his continual Burden: And of theſe, with his Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and the Dulneſs in the Frames and Motions of his Heart towards the bleſſed GOD, as diſplaying himſelf in CHRIST, he was continually complaining, and even groaning to be delivered from them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> he ſaw plainly deſcribed in Scripture, moſt clearly evident in the univerſal Depravation of Mankind, moſt bitterly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of by all the Pious he converſed with: And he knew it to be true from his own <hi>continual Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</hi> Yea the more he grew in Sanctity, the more he ſaw with Grief the odious Fountain in him. For
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:007790_0051_102F6CC60D18C498"/>
the ſtronger he grew in his Aſpirations after perfect Holineſs; every Inclination, every Frame, and every Tho't of a ſinful Nature, grew more grievous to him; and ſo did every Indiſpoſition to think on GOD, on CHRIST, on <hi>Heaven,</hi> on the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, with Engagedneſs and Pleaſure. When he could not Sleep in the <hi>Night;</hi> O how ardent were his Thirſtings after GOD, as in a dry and parched Land, where is no Water! How earneſt his Deſires of having his Heart and Meditation fixed on thoſe Divine and holy Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with ſupream Delight! How grievous to feel the miſerable Indiſpoſedneſs of his Heart often Times thereto: And the more he felt and ſaw of the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Depravation and Corruption of his Nature.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, for <hi>above</hi> theſe <hi>fifty Years,</hi> I have conſtantly obſerved, that the more any Perſons have grown in Piety; the more ſtrong were their Deſires after perfect Holineſs, the more ſenſible they grew of the Corruption of their Nature, the more burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome it grew, and they more heavily complained with the holy Apoſtle PAUL in <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 22—24. <hi>I find then a Law, that when I would do Good, Evil is preſent with me: For I delight in the Law of the GOD after the inward Man: But I ſee another Law in my Members warring againſt the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of Sin which is in my Members: O wretched Man that I am! Who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I often heard this pious Perſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining with great Affiction: as alſo often repeating the greater Part of the xlii, xliii, &amp; lxiii <hi>Pſalms,</hi> with the like ardent Thirſtings of Soul, as <hi>David</hi> expreſſed in his Day. And when he came into his <hi>Final Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which held about a <hi>Fortnight,</hi> the ſame grievous Complaints, ardent Longings, and earneſt Prayers,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:007790_0052_102F6CC9EO9B6980"/>
continued <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night</hi> without Ceſſation in Him. Yea, they were <hi>ſo deeply fixed in his Heart;</hi> as that when the Power of Reaſon grew quite broken, yet he conſtantly repeated, tho' without Connection, <hi>the ſame ſenſible Petitions</hi> both for <hi>Himſelf</hi> and <hi>Others,</hi> and with like <hi>Earneſtneſs</hi> of Soul as uſual, both <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night,</hi> till he could ſpeak no more.</p>
                  <p>Tho' by his tall and erect Stature till Age began to bow him, the majeſtick Appearance of his Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the native and improved Grandeur of his Mind, vaſtly rais'd above mean and little Things, with his Powers, Accompliſhments and exalted Station; He ſeem'd to be formed to ſpread a Reverence in all about him; yet the Generoſity and Goodneſs of his natural Tmper, and eſpecially ſanctified by the Grace of GOD, made him <hi>exceeding courteous</hi> and <hi>conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeending</hi> to the meaneſt Perſon: And when he ſmil'd upon them, it was with the moſt engaging Sweetneſs, and Air of cordial Amity.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>his Houſe</hi> he walked uprightly and with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Heart, catechizing, inſtructing, counſelling, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reading in his Family; and recommending all his Counſels and Inſtructions with his amiable Example—a ſtrict Obſerver of the <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath</hi>—a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Attender on the <hi>Public Worſhip,</hi> both in and out of the Seaſons of ſtated Appointment—continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally appeared at our <hi>Lectures,</hi> as well as our <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> Worſhip, as our Eyes have long ſeen with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; tho' now with Sorrow ſhall ſee no more.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Heart</hi> was not only exceeding <hi>tender</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> like JOSIAH'S; but aiſo <hi>exceeding large, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral, beneficent</hi> and <hi>bountiful</hi> both to the Needy and Afflicted, both in Body and Soul: And he had a great and extenſive View and Concern for the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Town,</hi> the <hi>College,</hi> the <hi>Land,</hi> the <hi>Nation,</hi> and all the <hi>World.</hi>

                     <pb n="28" facs="unknown:007790_0053_102F6B9D556134A0"/>When he ſaw or heard of any <hi>grievouſly afflicted,</hi> eſpecially with Soul-Diſtreſſes; he could not forbear expreſſing his tender Pity and Wiſhes for them: and where he was <hi>acquainted,</hi> yea ſometimes where he was <hi>not,</hi> he would kindly <hi>viſit</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> them: And I have heard of ſome in great Diſtreſs of Soul, who have received more Encouragement and Comfort from Him, than from any other.</p>
                  <p>Tho' Nothing was more <hi>diſagreeable</hi> to him than <hi>Oſtentation</hi> in <hi>Religion;</hi> yet his Heart ſeem'd <hi>ſo full</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> that from its very efficacious Nature, it could not but overflow in all Companies wherever it might, with Freedom and Acceptance:—Abounding in <hi>ſuitable Obſervations</hi> on the Works or Word of GOD, or on his Dealings with the Souls of Men; or on the lamentable and abaſing Corruptions, Sins and Miſeries of the humane Nature: And he ſaw ſo much of <hi>Sin within himſelf</hi> as made him think <hi>himſelf</hi> in many Reſpects to be <hi>worſe than Others;</hi> increas'd his <hi>Charity</hi> for them and his own <hi>Humility.</hi>

                  <p>He <hi>deeply mourned</hi> our <hi>Publick Sins</hi> and <hi>Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:</hi>—He carried the Apprehenſions of them with a heavy Heart:—was Couragious to bare his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt them; and to ſtand up for and promote: the <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Ways</hi> of CHRIST, which are the Cauſe of GOD, as an Overſeer of the <hi>College,</hi> as a <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> for the Propagation of the Gopel among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and as a <hi>Publick Magiſtrate</hi> in the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly.</hi>—For theſe he prayed, projected, and joined with Others to promote: and to Him is in a

                  <p>In ſhort, like the <hi>Scripture</hi> CALEB—To the LORD he heartily <hi>devoted</hi> Himſelf intirely, and was his <hi>diligent and faithful Servant</hi>—had <hi>another</hi> and <hi>more excellent Spirit in him,</hi> than the Generality of the <hi>World,</hi> yea, than the greater Part of <hi>Chriſtians</hi>—and <hi>Followed the LORD as fully</hi> as any among us, and as is well conſiſtent with the preſent State of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature.
