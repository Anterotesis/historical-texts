            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO ALL FREE-MASONS.</head>
            <p>THE Author of the following pages has the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being well reſpected in moſt of the Lodges of reputation in this metropolis, and has been a frequent viſitor at the Queen's Arms, St. Paul's Church-yard; the Globe, in Fleet-ſtreet; the Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, at Clerkenwell; Half-moon, Cheapſide; Crown and Anchor, in the Strand; Salutation, Grey-Friars; and ſeveral others of leſs note.</p>
            <p>An earneſt deſire of becoming a perfect maſter of MASONRY, and the ſucceſs he met with in his firſt attempt, has rendered him capable of revealing thoſe myſteries to the world, which, till now, have been kept ſecret as the grave.</p>
            <p>He acquired his knowledge at firſt from ſome looſe papers belonging to a merchant to whom he was nearly related, who had been a member of the Queen's Arms, St. Paul's Church-yard. This rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dying about ten years ago, the Editor became poſſeſſed of his effects; and on looking over his papers, among others he found ſome memorandums or remarks on MASONRY, which excited his curioſity ſo far, that he reſolved on accompliſhing his ſcheme, without going through the ceremonies required by the ſociety.</p>
            <p>The remarks of his friend above-mentioned fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed hints ſufficient to make a trial on an intimate acquaintance, a FREE MASON, who readily gave him the Sign in the manner he expected. After a more narrow inſpection on the part of his friend, ſuch as, where he was made, and when, &amp;c. &amp;c. (to all
<pb facs="unknown:031147_0004_0FEAE28AF6980B30"/>which he anſwered with great readineſs) he received an invitation to ſpend an evening at a tavern in the Strand, with ſeveral acquaintances. Elated by this ſucceſs, he boldly advanced with his company; all of whom belonged to the Lodge, and were well known by the TYLER at the door. After the uſual ceremony, in which he gave full ſatisfaction, he was admitted and took his ſeat. That night he ſaw two MAKINGS <note n="*" place="bottom">MAKING, the term uſed in the circular letters to the members of the Ledge, acquainting them that new members are to be admitted the next Ledge night.</note>, and came off full of ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Soon after he went to another Lodge, where he diſtinguiſhed himſelf greatly in anſwering the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions propoſed by the Maſter, which he acquired from his friend's manuſcripts of the ENTERED AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRENTICE, and FELLOW-CRAFT's Lectures.</p>
            <p>His regard to the ſociety, and reſpect to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, is the only inducement to this publication, which is intended not only to aſſiſt thoſe who have been lately made, and ſtill remain ignorant of the true foundation of the Art, but alſo to give all that have an inclination to become Maſons an opportunity of conſidering the advantages and diſadvantages of the engagements and oaths by which they are bound.— Such is the intention of this undertaking; and the Editor flatters himſelf the Brotherhood will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn his officiouſneſs in this reſpect, as it will rather ſtrengthen than hurt the intereſt of the ſociety; the fear of going through the ceremony, which hitherto has been repreſented in ſuch frightful ſhapes, being the greateſt obſtacle to its future welfare and increaſe.</p>
            <p>The Editor's ambition is to pleaſe; and the work is ſubmitted to the only proper judges, viz. his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the FREE MASONS; to whom he begs leave to declare, that no private or public quarrel, the view of gain, nor any other motive than the public good could ever have induced him to write upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and he declares to the world, that the following is the whole of true MASONRY in all its branches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:031147_0005_0FEAE292FB7004C8"/>
SINCE the former edition of this pamphlet was put to preſs the author has received from his publiſher ſeveral annony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous letters, containing the loweſt abuſe and ſcurrilous invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; nay, ſome have proceeded ſo far as to threaten his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He requeſts the favour of all enraged brethren, who ſhall chuſe to diſplay their talents for the future, that they will be ſo kind as to pay the poſtage of their letters, for there can be no reaſon why he ſhould put up with their ill treatment, and pay the piper into the bargain. Surely there muſt be ſomething in this book very extraordinary; a ſomething they cannot digeſt, thus to excite the wrath and ire of thoſe hot brained Maſon-bit gentry! But however unwiling the Editor may be to publiſh <hi>all</hi> the letters and meſſages he has received on this occaſion, yet he cannot be ſo deficient in returning the compliment, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal one, which notwithſtanding the threatenings contained in it, appears to be wrote with very little meaning, and he has (ſans ceremonie) ventured to publiſh it verbatim.</p>

<pb facs="unknown:031147_0008_0FEAE29B1754F620"/>think that the chief deſign of the eſtabliſhment is to rectify the heart, inform the mind, and promote the moral and ſocial virtues of humanity, decency, and good order, as much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> poſſible in the world: and ſome of the emblems of Free-Maſons confirm this opinion, ſuch as the Compaſs, Rule, Square, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In all countries where Maſonry is practiſed, or eſtabliſhed at this time, there is a Grand Maſter; but formerly there was only one Grand Maſter, and he was an <hi>Engliſhman.</hi> HIS ROYAL HICHNESS GEORCE PRINCE OF WALES is the perſon on whom the dignity is now beſtowed, who governs all the Lodges in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and has the power of delivering the conſtitutions and laws of the ſociety to the Maſters who preſide over the ſubordinate aſſemblies: which conſtitutions muſt always be ſigned by the Grand Secretary of the Order.—The Grand Maſter can hold a Meeting or Lodge when he thinks proper, which is generally the ſecond <hi>Saturday</hi> in every month in the ſummer, but oftener in the winter.</p>
            <p>The other Lodges meet regularly twice a month in the winter half-year, and once a month in the ſummer; and the members of each Lodge pay quarterly, from 3 <abbr>s.</abbr> 6 <abbr>d.</abbr> to 5 <abbr>s.</abbr> into the hands of the Treaſurer; and this generally defrays the expence of their meetings.</p>
            <p>There are alſo quarterly communications or meetings, held, at which are preſent the Maſter and Wardens of every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular conſtitution in and near <hi>London,</hi> where the ſeveral Lodges ſend, by the ſaid Wardens, different ſums of money to be paid into the hands of the Treaſurer-General, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to ſuch charitable uſes as the Grand Maſter, and the Maſters of the different Lodges under him, think proper; but theſe charities are chiefly confined to Maſons only. Such as have good recommendations as to their behaviour and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, will be aſſiſted with five, ten, or twenty pounds; and lefs ſums are diſtributed to the indigent brethren, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their wants, and the number of years they have been members. At theſe quarterly communications, large ſums are likewiſe ſent from Lodges in the moſt remote parts of the world, viz. in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> and accounts tranſmitted of the growth of Maſonry there. The ſtate of the funds of the ſociety are likewiſe communicated to the company, and the deliberations of the meeting taken down by the Secretary, who lays them before the Grand Maſter at the yearly meeting.</p>
            <p>The number of members which compoſe a Lodge is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate: but it is no Lodge except there are preſent one Maſter, three Fellow Crafts, and two Apprentices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:031147_0009_0FEAE29E2BFA06B0"/>
When a Lodge is met, there are two principal officers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Maſter, called Senior and Junior Wardens, whoſe buſineſs it is to ſee the laws of the ſociety ſtrictly adhered to, and the word of command given by the Grand Maſter, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly followed.</p>
            <p>It muſt be remarked, that the authority of a Maſter, though chief of the Lodge, reach <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> no farther than he is himſelf an obſerver of the laws; ſhould he infringe them, the brethren never fail to cenſure him; and if this has no effect, they have a power of dopoſing him, and appealing to the Grand Maſter, and giving their reaſons for it; but they ſeldom proceed to this extremity.</p>
            <p>As no doubt the reader chuſes to be made acquainted with every circumſtance of the ceremony of making a Maſon, I ſhall begin with the following directions, and proceed regularly in the deſcription of what further concerns Maſonry.</p>
            <p>A man deſirous of becoming a Free-Maſon, ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to get acquainted with a member of ſome good Lodge, who will propoſe him as a candidate for admiſſion the next Lodge-night. The Brother who propoſes a new member, is likewiſe obliged to inform the Brethren of the qualifications of the candidate <note n="*" place="bottom">For the good of this, and all other ſocieties, it were to be wiſhed a more ſtrict regard was paid, on the part of the propoſers, to the character and morals of every candidate.</note>. Upon this it is debated whether or not he ſhall be admitted; and it being carried in the affirmative, the next ſtep is to go with the propoſer the enſuing Lodge-night.</p>
            <p>The evening being come when a Lodge is to be held, which generally begins about ſeven in the winter, and nine in the ſummer, as previous notices are ſent to the members for this purpoſe; the Maſons are punctual to time, and it frequently happens, that, in half an hour, the whole Lodge, to the number of fifty or ſixty, are aſſembled.</p>
            <p>The Maſter, the two Aſſiſtants, Secretary, and Treaſurer, begin with putting over their necks a blue ribbon of a trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſhape; to the Maſter's ribbon hangs a Rule and Compaſs, which is in ſome Lodges made of gold, though in others only gilt: the Aſſiſtants, Senior Wardens, and the other officers, carry the Compaſs alone.</p>
            <p>The candles are placed upon the table in the form of a triangle; and in the beſt Lodges the candleſticks are finely carved with emblematical figures. Every Brother has an apron made of white ſkin, and the ſtrings are alſo of ſkin; though ſome of them chuſe to ornament them with ribbons
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031147_0010_0FEAE2A149606FB8"/>of various colours. On the grand days, ſuch as quarterly communications, or general meetings, the grand officers aprons are finely decorated, and they carry the Rule and Compaſs, the emblems of the Order.</p>
            <p>When they ſit down to the table, the Maſter's place is on the eaſt ſide, the bible being opened before him, with the Compaſs laid thereon, and the points of them covered with a lignum vitae or box Square; and the Senior and Junior Wardens oppoſite to him on the weſt and ſouth. On the table is likewiſe wine, punch, &amp;c. to regale the Brethren, who take their places according to their ſeniority. Being thus ſeated, after a few minutes, the Maſter proceeds to<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>The Maſter gives three knocks upon the table with a wooden hammer, and puts on his hat, the Brethren being uncovered; he then aſks, if the gentleman propoſed laſt Lodge-night is ready to be made? and on being anſwered in the affimative, he orders the Wardens to go out and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the perſon, who is generally waiting in a room at ſome diſtance from the Lodge room by himſelf, being left there by his friend who propoſed him.

When this part of the ceremony is ended, the Maſter, who ſtands at the upper end, facing the foot or ſteps of the drawing on the floor, behind a low arm-chair, aſks the following queſtion, Whether you have a deſire to become a Maſon? and if it is of your own free will and choice? Upon which the candidate anſwers, Yes. "Let him ſee the Light." ſays the Maſter: They then take the handkerchief from his eyes, and whilſt they are ſo doing, the Brethren form a circle round him, with their ſwords drawn in their hands, the points of which are preſented to his breaſt. The ornaments borne by the officers, the glittering of the ſwords, and fantaſtic appearance of the Brethren in white aprons, creates great ſurpriſe, eſpecially to a perſon, who for above an hour has been fatigued with the bandage over his eyes; and his uncertainty concerning what is further to be done for his reception, muſt, no doubt, throw his mind into great perplexity.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ancient Maſons made uſe of a prayer inſerted in the Apprentice's Lecture; but the moderns leave it out when they make a Brother.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The candidate is then directed to advance three times to a ſtool at the foot of the arm-chair; he is taught to ſtep in a proper manner by one of the aſſiſtants. Upon the ſtool are placed the rule and compaſs; and one of the Brethren ſays to the candidate to this effect: <q>You are now entering into a reſpectable ſociety, which is more ſerious and important than you imagine. It admits of nothing contrary to law, religion, or morality; nor does it allow any thing inconſiſtent with the allegiance due to his Majeſty; the Worſhipful Grand Maſter will inform you of the reſt<note n="†" place="bottom">It is here to be underſtood, that in different Lodges this ſpeech varies; as alſo do the forms of making, in ſome reſpects, which may be ſeen in the Entered Apprentice's Lecture; where the only proper and ancient method a clearly pounted out.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as the ſpeaker has ended his ſpeech, he is deſired to put his right knee upon the ſtool, which is bare, as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above<note n="‡" place="bottom">The ancient cuſtom was thus: The candidate, though kneeling on his right knee, ſhould have his left foot in the air; but this poſition being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing, it is omitted in moſt Lodges.</note>, and his left foot is put into a ſlipper, with the ſhoe on, or the ſhoe ſlipped at the heel, to repreſent a ſlipper.</p>
            <p>The candidate being in this poſture, the Worſhipful Grand Maſter addreſſes him to the following effect: <q>Do you promiſe never to tell, write, or diſcloſe, in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner whatever, the ſecrets of Free Maſonry and Free Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,

I furthermore do ſwear that I will not write it, print it, cut it, paint it, ſtint it, mark it, ſtain or engrave it, or cauſe it ſo to be done, upon any thing moveable or immoveable under the canopy of heaven, whereby it may become legible or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, or the leaſt appearance of the character of a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereby the ſecret art may be unlawfully obtained.

So help me God, and keep me ſtedfaſt in this my Entered Apprentice's Obligation.</p>

They alſo draw other figures, one of which is called the Laced Tuft, and the other, the Throne beſet with Stars. There is alſo repreſented a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular line in the form of a Maſons' inſtrument, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Plumb-Line; and another figure which repreſents the Tomb of <hi>Hiram,</hi> the firſt Grand Maſter, who has been dead almoſt three thouſand years. Theſe are all explained to him in the moſt accurate manner, and the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or emblems of the Order are deſcribed with great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility. The ceremony being now ended, the new made member is obliged to take a mop out of a pail of water brought for that purpoſe, and rub out the drawing on the floor, if it is done with chalk and charcoal. Then he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted back, and every thing that he was d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The Brethren now congratulate the new-made member, and all return to the table to regale themſelves; when the Maſter propoſes a health to the young Brother, which is drank with the greateſt applauſe by the whole body, the new Maſon ſitting all the while. After which he, inſtructed by a Brother, takes a bumper, and drinks <q>To the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful Grand Maſter, the Senior and Junior Wardens, the reſt of the Officers and Members of the Lodge, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſucceſs in all their public and private under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, to Maſonry in general, and that Lodge in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, craving their aſſiſtance.</q> To which they anſwer, "they will aſſiſt him." And after he has drank, the throws his glaſs from him, and brings it back three times, and then ſets it down on the table, the reſt doing the ſame in exact order. This they call firing: then they clap their hands nine times divided into three, and ſtop between each, keeping true time.</p>
            <p>The reader having been led thus far, it is high time to introduce the Apprentice's Lecture, which is intended not only to amuſe, but likewiſe to inſtruct him in the part he is entered into. The readineſs of many of the Brethren in anſwering the queſtions, adds a luſtre to the Order, the members vying with each other who ſhall moſt contribute to the edification of their new Brother.</p>

            <p>In this place it will be neceſſary to acquaint the reader how he may diſcover an Entered Apprentice by drinking with him in company. Take the glaſs with your right hand, and draw it acroſs your throat, either before or after you drink; and if an Apprentice is preſent, he will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately take notice of it, by aſking you ſome queſtion in Maſonry, which you will readily anſwer from this book. If he aſks you the meaning of your doing that, you may whiſper to him, that it is the penalty of the Obligation of an Entered Apprentice. From this anſwer he will proceed farther in his Inquiry.</p>
            <p>The Brethern having now regaled themſelves, they take their ſeats, and the maſter proceeds to ſet them on again, which is performed in the ſame manner as the calling off; with this difference, the Warden proclaims, <q>It is our Worſhipful Maſter's pleaſure that this Lodge is called from refreſhment to work.</q> The Junior Warden lays down his Column, and the Senior ſets his up. But as it often happens, that the time will not permit for the Fellow-Craft's Lecture, they cloſe the Lodge, which is done after the ſame manner as that of opening. The Senior Warden declares it in the following words: <q>It is our Maſter's will and pleaſure, that this Lodge ſtand cloſed till the firſt or third Wedneſday in the next month,</q> according to the night the Lodge is held. Then the Maſter, Wardens, Deacons, Secretary, &amp;c. take off the Enſigns and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from their necks, and every one is at liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part or ſtay longer; every thing of Maſonry is excluded; they talk of what they pleaſe, and ſing various ſongs for their amuſement.</p>

I do furthermore ſwear, that I will anſwer all ſigns and ſummonſes ſent to me from a Lodge of Crafts, within the length of a cable-tow<note n="*" place="bottom">A Cable Tow is three miles in length: ſo that if a Fellow-Craft is at that diſtance from his Lodge, he is not culpable on account of his Non-Attendance.</note>. I alſo ſwear, that I will not wrong a Brother, nor ſee him wronged, but give him timely notice of all approaching dangers whatſoever, as far as in me is. I will alſo ſerve a Brother as much as lies in my power, without being detrimental to myſelf or family: and I will keep all my Brother's ſecrets as my own, that ſhall be delivered to me as ſuch, murder and treaſon excepted. All this I ſwear, with a firm and ſteady reſolution to perform the ſame, without any equivocation or heſitation in me what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, under no leſs penalty than to have my heart torn from my naked left breaſt, and given to the vultures of the air as a prey. So help me God, and keep me ſtedfaſt in this my Fellow-Craft's obligation.</q>

They ſeparated, and divided themſelves into four parties; three eaſt, weſt, north and ſouth, in queſt of the murderers. As one of the twelve was travelling on the ſea-ſide, near <hi>Joppa,</hi> being fatigued, he ſat down to refreſh himſelf: but was ſoon alarmed by the following hideous exclamations from the cliff of a rock: <q>Oh! that my throat had been cut acroſs, my tongue torn out by the root, and buried in the ſands of the ſea at low-water mark, a cable's length from the ſhore, where the tide ebbs and flows twice in twenty-four hours, e'er I had conſented to the death of our Grand Maſter <hi>Hiram!</hi>"—"Oh! (ſays another) that my heart had been torn from under my naked left breaſt, and given a prey to the vultures of the air, rather than I had been concerned in the death of ſo good a Maſter!" But (ſays a third) I ſtruck him harder than you both; 'twas I that killed him. Oh! that my body had been ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in two, and ſcattered to the ſouth and north; my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els burnt to aſhes in the ſouth, and ſcattered between the four winds of the earth, ere I had been the cauſe of the death of our good Maſter <hi>Hiram!</hi>
                  </q> The Fellow-Craft bearing this, went in queſt of his two afs;ſociates, and they entered the cliff of the rock, took and bound them faſt, and brought them to king <hi>Solomon,</hi> before whom they voluntarily confeſſed their guilt, and begged to die. The ſentence paſſed on them was the ſame as they expreſſed in their lamentation in the cliff; <hi>Jubela</hi>'s throat was cut acroſs; <hi>Jubela</hi>'s heart was
