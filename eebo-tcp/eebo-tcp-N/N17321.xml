            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL WORK.</head>
            <p>BY the Author of this work more than twenty years were waſted in learning, teaching, and diligently ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing every part of medicine. The firſt five paſt away in hearing others, ſtudying what he had heard, implicitly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it, and entering upon the poſſeſſion as a rich and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable inhertance. <hi>His mode of employment</hi> the next five years, was to explain more clearly the ſeveral particulars, to refine and give them a nicer poliſh. During the next equal ſpace of time, becauſe no part of it had ſucceeded to his mind, he became cold upon the ſubject, and, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eminent men, <hi>even</hi> with the vulgar themſelves, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the healing art as altogether uncertain and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible. <hi>All this time paſſed away</hi> without <hi>the acquiſition of</hi> any advantage, and of that, which of <hi>all</hi> things is the moſt agreeable to the mind, the light of truth; and ſo great, ſo precious, a portion of the fading and ſhort-lived age of man was loſt. It was only betwixt the fifteenth and twentieth year <hi>of his ſtudies,</hi> that, like a traveller in an unknown country, wandering in the ſhade of night, after lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trace of his road, a very obſcure gleam of light, like that of the firſt break of day, dawned upon him.</p>

Thirteen years ago<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Four years muſt be added now, it being that time ſince the ſecond volume of the Elementa was publiſhed, that is, ſeventeen years ſince the author's firſt fit of the gout. At this very time from hard walking in very hot weather, to inſpect the beauties and majeſty of Hampton-Court, he had a ſlight attack, which gave him no ſort of trouble, never hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from buſineſs, and which he repelled in leſs than thirty-ſix hours.</note>, when he was going in the thirty-ſixth year of his age, he fell into his firſt fit of the gout. For many years before he had lived well, with the excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of having confined himſelf to a diet more ſparing than uſual a few months before the arrival of the diſeaſe<note n="(b)" place="bottom">It was about ſix months.</note>. In about ſix weeks the diſeaſe finiſhed its courſe, and did not return till ſix years after, and not even then, but in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of unuſual low living for ſeveral months<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Between five and ſix.</note>. He was in the vigour of his age, and, excepting the taint of the gout, and ſome debility, brought on by his unuſual abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, his habit was good. The diſeaſe, according to an old theory among phyſicians, was ſaid to depend upon ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora and exceſſive vigour; vegetable aliment was enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne was forbidden, and the careful execution of <hi>that plan of cure</hi> was promiſed to be rewarded with no return of the diſeaſe. A whole year paſt in a ſtrict adherence to this regimen. In the courſe of that ſpace of time, <hi>inſtead of never having a return of the diſeaſe,</hi> he experienced no leſs than four fits, moſt violent, moſt painful, and of a very great duration: <hi>In ſhort,</hi> the whole year, except fourteen days, was divided between limping and excruciating pain.</p>
            <p>If an over-proportion of blood and exceſs of vigour was the cauſe of the diſeaſe, <hi>according to the general theory juſt now mentioned,</hi> it became next with him a ſubject of enquiry, how ſuch diſtreſſing ſymptoms were to be explained; his reflections were, why the diſeaſe had not made its <hi>firſt</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:022373_0004_0FB86D03CD44B2B0"/>
twelve or fifteen years before, <hi>at a time</hi> when there was <hi>in reality</hi> more blood and vigour in the ſyſtem<note n="(e)" place="bottom">The blood is made from the food, and is in proportion to the quantity, quality, and completeneſs of its digeſtion. Now, before each of his laſt fits for the time ſpecified in the text, as well as during the whole courſe of the attacks of the ſecond year, his food had been almoſt ſolely vegetable, and, therefore, was not ſuited to produce enough, much leſs an exceſſive quantity, of blood, and the digeſtion was alſo more imperfect.</note>, and why it only came on after an abatement of diet both conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in degree and duration; why ſo great an interval of time, during which he had returned to his uſual full di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, had intervened betwixt the firſt fit and the recent ones; and, why the diſeaſe had twice, almoſt inſtantaneouſly, come on after the change of <hi>full nouriſhing</hi> diet into a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one. At laſt the ſolution of this queſtion was made out by the interpoſition of one of greater magnitude, in the following interrogatories: What is the effect of food, drink, and ſimilar ſupports of life? They produce ſtrength. What is their effect afterwards? Always leſs and leſs. What is it towards the end of life? They are ſo far from giving any more ſtrength, that they evidently prove weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening. Nay, the very ſame powers, by which life was at firſt ſupported, at laſt put an end to it, commonly through the intervention of diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>As diſeaſes firſt, and death after, in general happen in the way <hi>that has been juſt now</hi> explained, not from want, but an over-abundance of the ſupports of life, he found, however, that the cauſe was debility, and ſaw that it was not debilitating<note n="(f)" place="bottom">according to the common practice of evacuation and ſtarving;</note>, but ſtrengthening, powers that were to be thought upon as remedies. To this ſort of debility he thought proper to give the name of indirect. Such for
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:022373_0005_0FB86D054E5B2FA8"/>
two years was the ſucceſs of his invigorating plan<note n="(g)" place="bottom">which he immediately after the laſt mentioned reflections and queries carried into execution;</note>, that at the end of that <hi>ſpace of time</hi> he only underwent a a very ſlight fit, which did not amount to a fourth part of any of the former ones<note n="(h)" place="bottom">the fit that happened at the thirty-ſixth year of his age, and the four ſevere ones, that attacked him about ſix years after, all within the courſe of the ſame year.</note>. Now, no phyſician will deny, that the recurrence of ſuch a diſeaſe <hi>as the gout,</hi> which had made four attacks in one year, would have been more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent than in that proportion the next two years, had the ſame method of cure been continued; nor will any one think the addition of two fits every year too much. The mild fit was four times leſs in degree than the more violent ones. Multiply, therefore, twelve by four, and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that computation, the proportion of alleviation of the diſeaſe will amount to a reduction of eight and forty to one. As, during the firſt year, he made uſe of vegetable food alone, ſo, during theſe two years, his only food was of the land animal kind, and of the moſt nutrient quality. <hi>Of the latter,</hi> his choice was directed to the beſt in kind, <hi>without any other precaution than</hi> being ſparing in the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity he uſed<note n="(i)" place="bottom">He found moſt kinds of fiſh, whether from the ſea or freſh water, nearly as debilitating as vegetable matter, when ſolely or chiefly relied upon for a meal.</note>. A young gentleman, who lived with him and had laboured under a very ſevere aſthma, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenee of <hi>ſubmitting to the ſame</hi> treatment, ſuffered only one fit at the end of the <hi>ſame</hi> two years, inſtead of <hi>experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> one every day, <hi>as he had done upon the common treatment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards, to remove an opinion, that had been often inſiſted on, of the gout not depending upon debility, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe inflammation accompanied it; little doubting that
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:022373_0006_0FB86D06C0DEF620"/>
the inflammation itſelf depended on debility, he ſubjected the queſtion to experiment. He invited ſome friends to dinner, and by the uſe of certain ſtimulants uſed in their preſence<note n="(k)" place="bottom">Theſe are mentioned in Dr. Jones's Enquiry.</note>, recovered the moſt perfect uſe of that foot, with which, before dinner, he could not touch the floor for pain. By this <hi>fact</hi> he ſaw, that <hi>not only the gout itſelf,</hi> but the inflammation accompanying it, was aſthenic<note n="(l)" place="bottom">that is, depending on debility.</note>. And he found, afterwards, ſuch inflammations affecting the throat in the putrid, in the gangrenous ſore throat, and the joints in rheumatalgia, or that rheumatiſm which depends upon debility, and is improperly denominated chronic rheumatiſm<note n="(m)" place="bottom">The word rheumatiſm, as implying a ſimilarity of the diſeaſe to the true acute rheumatiſm, ſhould be rejected, and this term, taken from Sauvage, ſubſtituted in its place.</note>, and ſuppoſed, if there be any truth in that ſuppoſition to attack the brain in the end of typhus, to be alſo aſthenic.</p>
            <p>As the gout affects the alimentary canal, and eſpecially the ſtomach, and proceeds in its courſe with diſtreſſing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſimilar to thoſe <hi>that happen</hi> in dyſpepſia<note n="(n)" place="bottom">or indigeſtion;</note>; being deſirous to know if there was any affinity betwixt it and them, he obſerved that they, as well as it, depended on debility, and yielded to ſtimulant remedies. Nay, he afterwards found for certain, that all the ſpaſmodic, all the convulſive, diſeaſes of the ſame canal<note n="(o)" place="bottom">or, firſt paſſages, comprehending the paſſage to the ſtomach, that organ itſelf, and the inteſtines below it;</note>, and nearly all the diſeaſes of children, were of the ſame ſtamp.</p>
            <p>Continuing his inveſtigation of the ſame ſpaſmodic and convulſive diſeaſes, when they occupy the organs of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motion; he diſcovered that their nature was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:022373_0007_0FB86D08390273B0"/>
the ſame <hi>in kind,</hi> but <hi>only</hi> greater in degree; as <hi>they are exemplified</hi> in the ſpaſms and pains, <hi>that occur</hi> in various parts of the external <hi>ſurface</hi> of the body, and in epilepſy<note n="(p)" place="bottom">or the falling ſickneſs,</note>, and in tetanus themſelves. And by that means he diſcerned, that a vaſt number of affections, in which, upon the ſuppoſition of their being inflammatory, no limits had been ſet to the uſe of the lancet, <hi>inſtead of ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from an over-proportion of blood and exceſſive vigour, or any other ſuch cauſe,</hi> depended upon an under-proportion <hi>of that fluid,</hi> and other cauſes of debility, and were to be cured, not by bleeding, nor any other evacuations<note n="(q)" place="bottom">ſuch as vomiting, purging, ſweating, bliſtering, gliſtering, &amp;c.</note>, but by fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the veſſels,</hi> and reſtoring the ſtrength <hi>of the whole ſyſtem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At firſt, for the purpoſe of removing fits of the gout, he went no farther than the uſe of wine, and other ſtrong drink, of <hi>a</hi> ſimilar <hi>operation,</hi> and nouriſhing food, that is ſeaſoned meat, and kept the uſe of the more powerful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies in reſerve. But, of late<note n="(r)" place="bottom">that is, now, for many years paſt.</note>, his ſurpriſing ſucceſs in the uſe of the latter, has enabled him to find in opium, and certain other ſtimuli, the ſecret of repelling the fits of the gout as often as they returned, and, at the ſame time, re-eſtabliſhing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound healthy ſtate, a ſecret that has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been ſo much wanted and deſpaired of. This he has often effected both in himſelf and in other perſons. It is now going the third year, and near the end of it<note n="(ſ)" place="bottom">now the ſeventh,</note>, ſince he has <hi>always</hi> been able to prevent all return of the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Taught by ſimilar inſtances of actual practice, he found for certain that bleeding diſcharges, which are called hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhages, do not depend on plethora and vigour, but upon penury of blood and debility ariſing from any other
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:022373_0008_0FB86D0E6B3376A8"/>
ſource, and therefore did he reject them from the number of ſthenic diſeaſes<note n="(t)" place="bottom">Sthenic diſeaſes, as will be afterwards explained, are ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon an exceſſive application of the ſeveral powers that otherwiſe produce health.</note>, among which they had been arran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the firſt edition of the text book, reſerving a place for them among the aſthenic diſeaſes in the ſecond volume of that work. For he ſaw, that bleeding, various <hi>other</hi> evacuations, abſtinence, cold, and ſedatives, as they are called, proved hurtful; and that the ſtimulant plan of cure alone, was ſalutary. Even wine and brandy, which had been thought ſo hurtful <hi>in thoſe diſeaſes,</hi> he found the moſt powerful of all other remedies in removing them. Upon finding that a certain fact; he learned, that in all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, in which others had thought there was abundance of blood, there was a deficiency of it, and that from the defect of that and of other ſtimulants the <hi>real</hi> cauſe of <hi>the diſeaſes</hi> was debility; and ſtimulants, given in proportion to the degree of the cauſe, the <hi>proper</hi> remedies.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of the light that thus beamed in from the practice, he found, that the cauſe and cure of fevers, both intermittent and continued, was the ſame as thoſe already mentioned.</p>
            <p>Gradually led, as it were by the hand of nature, around the whole circle of aſthenic diſeaſes<note n="(u)" place="bottom">diſeaſes of debility.</note>, he thoroughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they all depended upon the ſame cauſe, that is, debility, that they were all to be removed by the ſame kind of remedies, to wit, ſtimulant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

With reſpect to ſthenic diſeaſes, the nature of either the cauſe or cure of which nobody had obſerved; he had long ago underſtood that inflammation in them, as well as the other ſymptoms, were not, as had been univerſally believed by Syſtematics, the cauſe, but the effect: and that the inflammation aroſe from the cauſe, i. e. the diatheſis<note n="(y)" place="bottom">or habit.</note>, and not even from it, unleſs very violent. In fine, he experienced in his own perſon, that catarrh was not produced by cold according to the common opinion, but by heat, and the other known ſtimuli, and was removed by cold and other debilitating powers. By which diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he was led to form a proper judgment of the catarrhal ſymptoms in the meaſles: In which he found, that a very great man who had improved the cure of ſthenic diſeaſes, but never attained to any knowledge of the aſthenic, had been miſled, by the alexipharmic phyſicians. And, as theſe ſymptoms are the moſt dangerous part of the diſeaſe, he was right in ſuppoſing, that the proper cure of them very much intereſted that of the whole diſeaſe. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which was that it came out a demonſtrated fact, that the refrigerating antiphlogiſtic plan of cure was of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ſervice in the meaſles and ſmall-pox.</p>
            <p>In ſthenic diſeaſes he illuſtrated the cauſe, enlarged the plan of cure, enriched the knowledge of both, explained and reduced the whole to a certain principle; he diſtributed all general diſeaſes into two forms, a ſthenic and an aſthenic one<note n="(z)" place="bottom">Sthenic ſignifies an exceſs, aſthenic a defect, of invigorating power.</note>. He demonſtrated that the former depended upon exceſs, the latter upon deficiency of exciting power; that the former were to be removed by debilitating, the latter by ſtimulant, remedies; that the hurtful powers which excited either were the remedies of the other, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:022373_0010_0FB86D1202AF87D0"/>
and that they acted by the ſame operation with the powers which produce the moſt perfect health, differing from them only in degree. He extended the ſame doctrine to plants. He laid down a principle which is illuſtrated and confirmed by all the parts of the detail, and <hi>itſelf</hi> reflects illuſtration and confirmation upon every one of them. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> he put the queſtion, whether the medical art, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto conjectural, incoherent, and in the great body of it falſe, was not at laſt, reduced to a demonſtrated ſcience, which might be called the ſcience of life<note n="(a)" place="bottom">That queſtion has been anſwered in the affirmative by every one who had been at due pains to underſtand the doctrine.</note>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE TRANSLATION.</head>
            <p>A PRESSING, and very general, demand for an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh tranſlation of the Elementa Medicinae, made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years before the publication of the ſecond edition of that work, and ſucceſſively repeated with an encreaſing importunity ever ſince; a deſire of ſpreading the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a doctrine, which had exhibited ſo many indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table proofs of its importance and utility to mankind: an ambition, not quite extinguiſhed by advancing years, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic cares, and a declining ſtate of health, to get the better of the keeneſt, and moſt univerſal, perſecution, that ever was raiſed againſt an uſeful and extenſive diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; the neceſſity for a tranſlation in the preſent decaying ſtate of the knowledge of the Latin language; the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the doctrine coming before the public from adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers unequal to the taſk; and ſome other circumſtances, partly of a private, partly of a domeſtic, nature, with which it would be impertinent to trouble the reader; all theſe at laſt prevailed with the author to ſubmit, for once, to a taſk, otherwiſe not deſirable, that of tranſlating his own work. Such a taſk ſeemed more naturally calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to lay the foundation of the commencing ſame of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious pupil. But, as no one of many, whoſe literature
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:022373_0012_0FB86D14F9A88368"/>
and knowledge of the ſubject completely qualified them for the undertaking, wiſhed to ſuperſede the occaſion for his engaging in it himſelf; and as the courage of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons of a different deſcription kept not pace with their affectation or intereſtedneſs; it is to be hoped the public will not be diſpleaſed to receive the work from the author himſelf. This performance is intended for the uſe of three ſets of readers; thoſe who do not readily enter into a thought conveyed in pure Latin, and who, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, might wiſh to be poſſeſſed of a tranſlation for the ſake of comparing it with the original, and, thereby, of acquiring, renewing, or improving their knowledge of the latter; thoſe, who are only acquainted with ſuch Latin, as has prevailed in modern times; and, laſtly, thoſe, who either cannot, or will not be ſubjected to the trouble of reading Latin at all, and who, ſurely, may, often be better employed.</p>
            <p>Both this, and the original work, are intended not for the excluſive uſe of medical readers, but alſo for that of the public at large, it being evident, that, without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the exception of the profeſſional knowledge of each individual, that of his own health is preferable to all others. And ſuch ana <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quiſition becomes valuable in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its juſtneſs and ſolidity. The public are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with a work, that claims the merit of having redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the doctrine and practice of medicine to ſcientific cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and exactneſs. With reſpect to the form, in which it is delivered, it is ſtripped of that jargon of numerous, unmeaning or miſleading terms, and all that myſtery ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſtyle or matter, that has hitherto rendered the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended healing art impenetrable to the moſt intelligent and diſcerning, and locked it faſt up in the ſchools. No terms are admitted but the few that neceſſity impoſed, and theſe are every where defined. The ſtyle is ſimple, and
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:022373_0013_0FB86D1B25A607F0"/>
ſuited to the ſimplicity of the ſubject. In the language and compoſition, as far as the thoughts, which are new throughout, and that reſtraint, which is inſeparable from exactneſs of tranſlation, permit, clearneſs is every where preferred to elegance, and diffuſion to brevity.</p>
            <p>The author, in prefixing his name to both forms of his work, has thrown the gauntlet to its numerous, but anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, oppoſers. They are, therefore, called upon, now or never, to diſprove it, and the judicious and candid part of mankind to judge between the parties.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>I. MEDICINE is the ſcience of preſerving the good, and of preventing and curing the bad, health of animals.</p>
               <p>II. The application of the ſame profeſſion to vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſhould be named Agriculture.</p>
               <p>III. Good health conſiſts in a pleaſant, eaſy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act uſe of all the functions.</p>
               <p>IV. Bad health conſiſts in an uneaſy, difficult, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed exerciſe of all or any of the functions. The latter reſpects diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>V. Diſeaſes are either extended over the whole ſyſtem, or confined to a part; the former merit the appellation of Univerſal, the latter that of Local.</p>
               <p>VI. The former are always univerſal from their firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement, the latter in their courſe, and that but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The former are always, the latter never, preceded by prediſpoſition. The originality of the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:022373_0016_0FB86D204C2613B0"/>
from an affection of the principle of life, of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from local injury. The cure of thoſe is applied to the whole body, of theſe to the injured part.</p>
               <p>VII. To the province of the Phyſician belong all the univerſal, and as many of the local, as firſt affect a part, and, in conſequence of that, at laſt injure the reſt of the body with ſome reſemblance to the univerſal ones.</p>
               <p>VIII. Prediſpoſition to diſeaſe is that ſtate of the body, that recedes from health, and approaches to diſeaſe in ſuch a manner, as to ſeem ſtill within the boundaries of the former, of which, however, it is only an inſiduous and deceiving reſemblance.</p>
               <p>IX. Theſe <hi>three</hi> ſtates<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Of health, diſeaſe, and prediſpoſition.</note> conſtitute the life<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Or living ſtate.</note> of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; to which that of vegetables is not diſſimilar, but more imperfect.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>X. IN all the ſtates of life, man and other animals differ from themſelves in their dead ſtate, or from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inanimate matter in this property alone; that they can be affected by external agents, as well as by certain functions peculiar to themſelves, in ſuch a manner, that the phaenomena peculiar to their living ſtate, that is, their own functions, can be produced. This propoſition comprehends every thing that is vital in nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>at leaſt,</hi> applies to vegetables.</p>
               <p>XI. The external agents in general, are reducible to heat, diet,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Conſiſting of food, drink, and condiment.</note>, other matters taken into the ſtomach, the blood, the fluids ſecreted from the blood, and air. <hi>How</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:022373_0017_0FB86D2211B50138"/>
poiſons and contagions come under the ſame view ſhall afterwards be mentioned.</p>
               <p>XII. The functions of the ſyſtem itſelf, producing the ſame effect, are muſcular contraction, ſenſe, and the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the brain in thinking, and in exciting paſſion and emotion. "While theſe affect the ſyſtem in the ſame manner as the other agents; ſo, with reſpect to their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, they ariſe both from the other and from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves."</p>
               <p>XIII. The reſult of withholding either the property diſtinguiſhing living from dead matter, or the operation of either of the two ſets of powers, is the non-exiſtence of life. Nothing elſe is neceſſary to life.</p>
               <p>XIV. The property, by which both ſets <hi>of powers</hi> act, ſhould be named Excitability; and the powers themſelves, Exciting powers. By the word "body" is meant both the body ſimply ſo called, and alſo as endued with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual part, a part appropriated to paſſion and emotion, or to the ſoul; the appellation commonly given to it <hi>in medical writings</hi> is ſyſtem<note n="(b)" place="bottom">No diſquiſition is here meant to be entered into, as religion is no where interfered with, but left to its proper guardians.</note>.</p>
               <p>XV. The common effect, produced by the exciting powers, is ſenſe, motion, mental action, and the paſſions. Which effect being one and the ſame, it muſt, therefore, be granted, that the operation of all the powers is alſo one and the ſame<note n="(c)" place="bottom">That is, ſince ſenſe, motion, mental functions, and the paſſions are the only, and a conſtant, effect of the exciting powers, acting upon the excitability; and ſince that happens, whether one, or more, or all the powers, or which ſoever of them, act, the irreſiſtable concluſion, that ariſes in the mind, is, that the effect of the powers being the ſame, the mode of operation of them al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> muſt be the ſame. This mode of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is certainly as juſt as it is new in medicine, will often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, and, we truſt, will ſtand the teſt of the moſt ſcrupulous ſcrutiny.</note>.</p>

XVI. The effect of the exciting powers, acting upon the excitability, is to be denominated Excitement.</p>
               <p>XVII. Since, of the ſame exciting powers, ſome act by evident impulſes, and the identity of the effect of others infers the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ame mode<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Or ratio.</note> of operation; and ſince they have all a certain activity in them, they ought to be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated ſtimulant, or ſtimuli.</p>
               <p>α. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>muli are either univerſal or local.</p>

                  </gap>n the excitability, as always to produce ſome excitement over the whole ſyſtem. And their appellation of univerſal is convenient to diſtinguiſh them from the local.</p>
               <p>γ. The local ſtimuli act only on the part to which they are applied; and do not, without previouſly producing an affection in it, affect the reſt of the body.</p>

            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>XVIII. WE know not what excitability is, or in what manner it is affected by the exciting powers. But, whatever it be, either a certain quantity, or a certain ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of it, is aſſigned to every being upon the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its living ſtate. The quantity, or energy, is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in different animals, and in the ſame animal at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times. It is partly owing to the uncertain nature of the ſubject, partly to the poverty of common language, and likewiſe to the novelty of this doctrine, that the phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the excitability being abundant, encreaſed, accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, ſuperfluous; or weak, not well enough ſuſtained, not well enough exerciſed, or deficient in energy, when
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022373_0019_0FB86D27B9410B20"/>
enough of ſtimulus has not been applied; ſometimes ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, fatigued, worn out, languid, exhauſted or conſumed, when the ſtimulus has operated in a violent degree; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at other times in vigour, or reduced to one half, when the ſtimulus has neither been applied in exceſs nor defect, will be employed in different parts of this enſuing work. Both upon this, and every other ſubject we muſt abide by facts; and carefully avoid the ſlippery queſtion about cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as being in general incomprehenſible, and as having ever proved a venomous ſnake to philoſophy.</p>
               <p>XIX. As there is always ſome excitability, however ſmall, while life remains, and the action of the exciting powers in one degree or another is never wanting; the concluſion from that <hi>fact</hi> is, that they are all endowed with more or leſs of ſtimulant power, and that this muſt be either exceſſive, in due proportion, or deficient. A great quantity of blood ſtimulates in exceſs, and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, produces the diſeaſes that depend upon too much ſtimulus; but an under proportion of blood, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitating <hi>in its effect,</hi> and inducing the diſeaſes that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon debility as their cauſe, muſt ſtill be underſtood to be ſtimulant; but only ſo much more weakly ſtimulant, as the penury is more conſiderable: The ſame concluſion applies to all the other exciting powers, unleſs that poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, contagions, and ſome few other powers, might to ſome ſeem exceptions. But,</p>
               <p>XX. Poiſons either do not produce the univerſal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which make our preſent ſubject; or, if they do, by operating the ſame effect as the ordinary exciting powers, their mode of operation muſt alſo be allowed to be the ſame<note n="(a)" place="bottom">This propoſition of frequent occurrence in this work, that iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of known effect, always produces identity of cauſe though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, will be found to be a mode of reaſoning of equal ſervice in guarding our reader from the deceitfulneſs of abſtract reaſoning, and in leading him into a proper mode of inveſtigating ſolid and uſeful truth.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:022373_0020_0FB86D2AE45F2070"/>
XXI. Some contagions accompany diſeaſes depending on too much ſtimulus<note n="(b)" place="bottom">As the ſmall pox and meaſles.</note>; others thoſe that conſiſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility<note n="(c)" place="bottom">As the petechial typhus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ever, the plague.</note>. If both theſe are the product, not of contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alone, but, by a conjoint operation, alſo of the hurtful powers that uſually depend upon ſtimulus, which is a fact aſcertained: the effect, therefore, in this caſe being the ſame, the concluſion is unavoidable, that their cauſe is alſo the ſame, and the mode of operation of both the ſame. It muſt, therefore, be admitted that the operation of contagions is ſtimulant<note n="(d)" place="bottom">This is all that is contended for at preſent; the degree of their ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus will be afterwards conſidered.</note>. It makes for the ſame concluſion, that no remedies, but thoſe that cure diſeaſes, depending upon the operation of the uſual hurtful powers, remove thoſe that have been ſuppoſed to be induced by contagions. Finally, the great debilitating energy, <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable</hi> in certain contagions, does not more prove a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of action <hi>in them,</hi> than <hi>it d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>δ. It might appear to ſome, that a certain matter of food, not ſufficiently nouriſhing, and therefore, <hi>of</hi> hurtful <hi>tendency;</hi> as alſo that emetics, and purgatives, and ſedative paſſions, as they are called, might be thought to belong to the number of <hi>powers,</hi> the operation of which might ſeem ſo many exceptions from the ordinary ſtimulant ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>ε. In general all vegetable matter, when depended upon alone for nouriſhment, is hurtful, at leaſt, to thoſe who
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022373_0021_0FB86D2C9D50B708"/>
have been accuſtomed to better, and that by a debilitating operation; and yet even it, ſince it ſupports life, however incommodiouſly, longer than <hi>a total</hi> want of food, muſt, of courſe, be ſtimulant. But, if aſthenic diſeaſes ariſe from vegetable food, and not, to a certain degree, from want; that circumſtance muſt be owing to a certain change pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the ſyſtem, by which the ſum total of ſtimuli is rendered leſs fit to act upon the excitability. That ſuch is the caſe, is proved by the moſt ſtimulant matter of food loſing part of its ſtimulus by continued uſe, and requiring the ſubſtitution of another in its place.</p>
               <p>ζ. In the ſame manner is the operation of emetics and purgatives to be explained, as diminiſhing the ſum total of excitement; which depends partly on an agreeable relation <hi>that the exciting power hears</hi> to the excitability, or on an agreeable ſenſation. That it is ſometimes the relation, ſometimes the ſenſation, that acts <hi>in this caſe,</hi> is evident from the hurtful effect of things moſt grateful to the ſenſe, as in the examples of the legumina, and other articles of vegetable food; and by the ſalutary effect of diſagreeable things, as the ſeveral forms and preparations of opium: Both which produce their effect, the former by a debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that is, an inſufficiently ſtimulant, the latter by a conſiderably ſtimulant, operation<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Suppoſe a certain power, as 40, to mark the degree, in which the ſum total of proper ſtimulant operation conſiſts, and the excitement, produced to that degree, to ariſe from different exciting powers, all of them conducing to the ſame effect, by the operation of each bearing an agreeable relation to the excitability, or producing an agreeable ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on it; the inference to be drawn from that fact is, that a certain ſuitableneſs in the mixture of the whole to the excitability, as well as the degree of ſtimulus, produces the effect. Again, ſuppoſe certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, which cannot be denied to be ſtimulant, added to this given mixture, the effect of the added article will be one of two: it will either increaſe the excitement firſt produced, without altering the agreeable ſtate which that had induced; or it will, ſtill without any reaſon for ſuppoſing it not ſtimulant, diminiſh the excitement that had ariſen from the combination of the agreeable articles. And this will happen merely from the effect of a diſcordant combination of exciting powers, while that, which diminiſhes the exciting effect of the others, as well as theſe others, that conſtituted its given ſum, are both ſtimulant; but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in a higher, the latter in a lower degree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore acting over all as debilitating powers. Muſtard taken with meat, or onions with beef-ſtakes, are agreeable to moſt taſtes; but they are, though ſtill ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, diſagreeable to others, and debilitating. Peas-ſoup and peas-pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, though, independent of the animal juice infuſed into them, they are far from being ſalutary, will be bor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e by many; while in others, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe who have been accuſtomed to more ſtimulant meals, and in perſons who are gouty, and liable to complaints of the firſt paſſages, they will produce morbid affection. The ſame thing is to be ſaid of beef-ſteaks with onions, which agree with the ſound ſtate, and diſagree with that of the firſt paſſages juſt now mentioned. With regard to all theſe enfeebling matters, there is no queſtion about their being ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant; the whole effect is to be referred to their rendering a mixture, ſtimulant in a certain degree, leſs ſo.</note>.</p>

               <p>XXII. Since the general powers produce all the phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of life, and the only operation, by which they
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022373_0023_0FB86D2F39981C30"/>
do ſo, is ſtimulant; it, therefore, follows, that the whole phaenomena of life, every ſtate and degree of health and diſeaſe, alſo conſiſt in ſtimulus, and are owing to no other cauſe.</p>
               <p>XXIII. Excitement, the effect of the exciting powers, the true cauſe of life, is, within certain boundaries, produced in a degree proportioned to the degree of ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus. The degree of ſtimulus, when moderate<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Of a middle kind.</note>, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces health; in a higher degree it gives occaſion to diſeaſes of exceſſive ſtimulus; in a lower degree, or ultimately low, it induces thoſe that depend upon a deficiency of ſtimulus, or debility. And, as what has been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is the cauſe both of diſeaſes and perfect health; ſo that which reſtores the morbid to the healthy ſtate, is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of excitement in <hi>the caſe of</hi> diſeaſes of exceſſive ſtimulus, and an encreaſe <hi>of the ſame excitement</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of diſeaſes of debility. Both which <hi>intentions</hi> are called Indications of Cure.</p>
               <p>XXIV. This mutual relation obtains betwixt excitabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and excitement, that the more weakly the powers have acted, or the leſs the ſtimulus has been, the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant the excitability becomes; the more powerful the ſtimulus of the agents has been, the excitability becomes the more exhauſted.</p>
               <p>XXV. A mean ſtimulus, affecting alſo a mean or half conſumed excitability, produces the higheſt excitement. And the excitement becomes leſs and leſs, in proportion as either the ſtimulus is applied in a higher degree, or the excitability more accumulated. Hence the vigour of youth, and the weakneſs of childhood and old age. Hence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a more moderate ſpace of time, a middle diet <hi>gives</hi> vigour, and debility is the effect of its being either too full or too ſparing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:022373_0024_0FB86D348E7F0770"/>
XXVI. While that is the caſe, every age, every habit, if the excitement be properly directed has its <hi>due degree</hi> of vigour <hi>accommodated to it.</hi> Childhood, and that weakneſs, which an abundant excitability produces, admits of little ſtimulus, <hi>but,</hi> upon leſs than the middle proportion becomes languid, upon more is oppreſſed. Old age, and that frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is occaſioned by a deficiency of excitability, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a great deal of ſtimulus, becomes enfeebled by leſs, and overſet by more. The reaſon for the latter is, that the excitability, without which no vital action is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, does not exiſt in that degree, by which vigour of the functions is produced; while the former is to be explained from the exciting or ſtimulant power, without which the excitability is of no effect, not being applied in that degree, which is requiſite to the vigour that it ſhould give. The impotency of ſtimulus may riſe to ſuch a degree, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce death from its extreme under proportion. On the contrary, the exhauſtion of excitability may go ſo far, as to extinguiſh life by the extreme exceſs of ſtimulus.</p>
               <p>XXVII. The circumſtances, under which excitement is produced, have two confining boundaries.</p>
               <p>XXVIII. The one of theſe circumſtances is, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtion of the excitability from violence of ſtimulus. For all the ſtimulant powers may carry their ſtimulant energy to that degree, under which no excitement will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe. The reaſon for which is, that the body becomes no longer fit to receive the operation of ſtimulus; another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion for which is, that the excitability is conſumed.</p>
               <p>XXIX. The termination<note n="(k)" place="bottom">Or ceſſation, or extinction.</note> of excitement, from the exhauſtion of the excitability by ſtimulus, may be either temporary or irreparable, and may ariſe either from a ſhort continuance of a high degree of ſtimulus, or a long applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one the exceſs of which is more moderate. Both
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022373_0025_0FB86D3818AA0A88"/>
circumſtances come to the ſame thing; the high degree of ſtimulus compenſating for the ſhortneſs of its application, and the ſhortneſs of its application for its greater modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in degree<note n="(l)" place="bottom">A force of ſtimulus as ſix, operating for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ix, will produce the ſame effect in wearing out the excitability.</note>. The effect of the former is ſudden death; of the latter a more gradual death preceded by diſeaſes. And though a moſt exact meaſure of excitement were kept up, yet death at laſt, however late, ſupervenes.</p>
               <p>XXX. Ebriety, debauch in eating and drinking, ſweat, languor, heat either <hi>operating</hi> alone, or overcoming the effect of cold, dulneſs in mental exertion from exceſſive thinking, or ſinking of the ſpirits in conſequence of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of paſſion, finally, ſleep; all theſe are the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of a ſhort application of a high degree of ſtimulus, operating an exhauſtion of excitability. The long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of a more moderate exceſs in the force of ſtimulus, is followed by the frailty of old age, prediſpoſition to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of debility, as well as thoſe diſeaſes themſelves. The ultimate termination of both is death.</p>
               <p>XXXI. When the excitability is waſted by any one ſtimulus, there is ſtill a reſerve of it, capable of being <hi>acted upon</hi> by any other. Thus a perſon, who has dined fully; or is either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ate; and finiſhed his buſineſs in forty hours. What he had wrote was n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w to be put to the preſs. He had next to watch and correct the proofs, which coſt him four or five hours further continuance of vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and activity. To effect this he took a glaſs with the Maſter Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, while his men were going on with their part of the work. The ſucceſſion of ſtimuli in this caſe was firſt food, next the ſtimulus of the intellectual function, then wine, then the food varied, then punch, then opium, then punch and converſation.</note>. Even after opium fails, and

leaves him heavy and oppreſſed by the ſame propenſity, a ſtimulus ſtill higher and more diffuſible, if there be any ſuch, will have the ſame effect. A perſon fatigued with a journey will be rouſed by muſic to dance and ſkip; and he will be enabled to run after a flying beauty, if her flight encourages him with the hope of overtaking her.</p>
               <p>XXXII. The waſte of excitability, firſt exhauſted by ſtimuli, and then recruited by new ones, is moſt difficultly repaired, becauſe the more a ſtimulant operation has been employed, that is the more the ſtimuli have been applied; there remains the leſs acceſs to freſh ſtimuli, by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which the failure of excitement may be removed.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. The reaſon of the difficulty is, that no means of reproducing the healthy ſtate, that is, the proper <hi>degree</hi> of excitement, is left; but the very circumſtance that occaſioned the waſte, that is, already an exceſs of ſtimulant operation, not admitting of more ſtimulus.</p>
               <p>XXXIV. Such, in fine, is the nature of the ſame loſs of excitement, that it ruſhes to inſtant death, unleſs proper meaſures be taken to preſerve life by a great ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, but leſs than that which occaſioned it, and then by a ſtill leſs, till by means of the moderate ſtimulus, that is ſuitable to nature, or a ſomewhat greater, life may at
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022373_0027_0FB86D3B5A97B188"/>
laſt be preſerved. The difficult cure of drunkards and gluttons, already affected with diſeaſes, ſufficiently evinces, that the ſame conſideration applies to all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing powers that ſtimulate in exceſs<note n="(n)" place="bottom">This propoſition applies to the moſt difficult part of the practice for the cure of diſeaſes, that is, thoſe that depend upon a certain ſpecies of debility, which in the very next paragraph will be denominated <hi>indirect.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>XXXV. The excitability, thus exhauſted by ſtimulus is debility, which ſhould be denominated indirect, becauſe it does not ariſe from defect, but exceſs of ſtimulus<note n="(o)" place="bottom">Like another debility, by and by to be ſpoken of.</note>
               </p>
               <p>XXXVI. Through the whole progreſs to indirect debility, the ſecond impreſſion of every ſtimulus has leſs effect than the firſt, the third leſs than the ſecond, and ſo forth to the laſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which gives no more excitement and the effect takes place in proportion to the degree or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>ſeveral impreſſions,</hi> though every one always adds ſome excitement. The inference from this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that, before the eſtabliſhment of indirect debility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, when it is now upon the eve of being eſtabliſhed, the ſtimulus which produces it, ſhould be withdrawn; a debilitating power ſhould be applied, as in giving over drinking wine at the end of an entertainment, an ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting water in its place, and applying refrigeration to a perſon who has been expoſed to an exceſſive degree of heat<note n="(p)" place="bottom">A convaleſcent, from a diſeaſe of debility, was preſcribed wine, but not to carry it to exceſs. A hiccup was the ſignal, by which he was to underſtand, that he had carried that ſtimulus too far.

               </p>
               <p>XXXVII. The ſame progreſs to indirect debility
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022373_0028_0FB86D3CBA9C2A68"/>
is retarded by diminiſhing the excitement from time to time, and proportionally encreaſing the excitability, and thereby giving more force to the action of the ſtimuli. Take for example, cold bathing from time to time, lowering the diet from time to time, and a ſimilar abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the <hi>other</hi> ſtimulant powers.</p>
               <p>θ. If cold ſometimes ſeems to ſtimulate, it produces that effect, not as actual cold, but either by diminiſhing exceſſive heat, and reducing it to its proper ſtimulant tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature<note n="(q)" place="bottom">The principle upon which the operation of the cold bath depends has never been underſtood, and therefore all reaſoning, as well as prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, with reſpect to it, has been conducted in quite a vague and random manner. Suppoſe a range of excitement, the middle and healthy point of which is 40 degrees of excitement, the ultimate degree of its exceſs 70. It is, therefore, the intermediate degrees between theſe extremes, to which the practice of cold bathing is applicable. From 80 to 70, the former of which is the head of the ſcale, and conſtitutes the range of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct debility; and likewiſe through all the intermediate degrees from 40 down to 0, the cold bath, which is a weakening power, as well as every other, is improper. It is a miſtake prevalent among ſyſtematic writers and lecturers, that cold is of ſervice in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>evers and other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the Torrid Zone. The truth is, that, in that country, there is no acceſs to the uſe of actual cold. All, that can be done there, is, by various means, to diminiſh the exceſs of heat, which is conſtantly ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thoſe degrees of it which ſtimulate and excite, to thoſe, in which its ultimate ſtimulant power deſtroys excitement, and leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but indirect debility.</note>, or by rendering the body acceſſible to air, or by accumulating the excitability diminiſhed by exceſſive ſtimulus, and communicating energy to the ſtimulus of the exciting powers, now acting too languidly. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this operation of cold occurs in the Torrid Zone, where actual cold is ſcarcely to be procured, in the uſe of refrigerants, as they are called, in fevers, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, by means of cold, of a ſcrotum previouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed by heat. Nay, the effect goes ſo far, that ſthenic
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022373_0029_0FB86D3E65FDC0F8"/>
diſeaſes may ariſe more certainly from cold, alternating with heat, and either preceding or following it, than from pure heat.</p>
               <p>XXXVIII. The other condition <hi>or circumſtance,</hi> limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting excitement, is, an energy of the exciting powers too ſmall, and therefore inſufficient to produce excitement. As this caſe ariſes from a deficiency of ſtimulus, and an abundant excitability, it ought to be diſtinguiſhed from the other, which ſuppoſes an abundance of the former, and deficiency of the latter. The ſame diſtinction is required alſo for the purpoſe of practice, All the exciting powers may fall ſo ſhort of ſtimulant force, as to produce that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. They all, therefore, equally ſerve to illuſtrate and confirm this <hi>propoſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXIX. In this caſe, the excitability is abundant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in conſequence of the ſtimuli being withheld, it is not exhauſted. Thus, in the cold bath, the excitement is diminiſhed, becauſe the ſtimulus of heat, and, therefore, the ſum of all the ſtimuli, is deficient; and the excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, as being leſs exhauſted by ſtimulus, is encreaſed<note n="(r)" place="bottom">
                     <p>This is altogether a negative circumſtance. The accumulation, encreaſe, or abundance or excitability, take any term you pleaſe, is not occaſioned by any action or operation, but by the want of action, the want of operation. To form an adequate idea of it, ſuppoſe a ſcale of excitability of 80 degrees, as in the line here drawn.</p>
                     <p>EXCITING POWER.</p>
                     <p>0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80</p>
                     <p>EXCITABILITY.</p>
                     <p>80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0</p>
                     <p>At the commencement of life, the ſum total aſſigned is underſtood to be 80, becauſe no part, as yet, is waſted by the action of ſtimuli. Next it is waſted in proportion as theſe are applied from the beginning to the end of the ſcale. Its waſting is, therefore, owing to action and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but its accumulation to the reverſe, the want of the action or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the exciting powers, as is expreſſed by the numbers placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thoſe firſt mentioned. Thus one degree of exciting power applied takes off one degree of excitability, and every ſubſequent degree im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs the excitability in a proportion exactly equal to its degree of force. Thus a degree of ſtimulant or exciting power equal to 10, reduces the excitability to 70; 20 to 60; 30 to 50; 40 to 40; 50 to 30; 60 to 20; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>0 to 10; 80 to 0. And on the contrary, the ſubtraction of ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant power allows the excitability to accumulate. Thus, when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement is at 79, conſtituting only one degree of life, take off one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of exciting power, and 2 degrees of excitability will ariſe. As 80 degrees of exciting power leave no excitability, ſo 70 degrees of exciting power leave 10; 60 20; 50 30; 40 40; 30 50; 20 60; 10 70; 0 80. Hence death takes place from nothing poſitive, but from the negation of the only means by which life is ſupported; which are the ſeveral exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or ſtimulant powers, now fully explained.</p>

The ſame concluſion applies to famiſhed perſons, to water drinkers, to thoſe who are in a ſtate of refrigeration from other cauſes, to thoſe who have ſuffered evacuations of any kind, to thoſe who have <hi>neglected the ſtimulus of exerciſe, and</hi> given themſelves up to indolence, to thoſe who have neglected the uſe <hi>of that ſtimulus, which</hi> exerciſe of the mind affords, and to perſons in low ſpirits.

XL. As, during the encreaſe of excitability, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement decreaſes, and in proportion to the encreaſe of the former; ſo that that proceſs may go all the way to death, is a fact from which nature exhibits no exception. It is confirmed by the effect of all the debilitating powers mentioned above; every individual of which, as often as it proves urgent, has a rapid tendency to death.</p>
               <p>XLI. The defect of any one ſtimulus, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional abundance of excitability, is, for the time, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſated by any other, and often with great advantage to the ſyſtem. So a perſon, who has dined inſufficiently, <hi>and therefore not well enough ſtimulated,</hi> is recruited by a piece of good news. Or, if during the courſe of the day, he has not been ſufficiently invigorated by the ſtimulant operation of corporeal or mental exerciſe, and conſequently likely to paſs a ſleepleſs night, he will be laid aſleep by a doſe of ſtrong liquor. When the latter is not at hand, opium will ſupply its place. The want of the venereal gratification is relieved by wine, and the want of the latter is made amends for by <hi>the uſe of</hi> the former, each baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the languor occaſioned by the want of the other. The ſame concluſion applies to the uſe of ſtimuli, for which we have an artificial, rather than a natural, craving.

As, in this manner, the ſuperabundance of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citability, proportioned to the deficiency of ſtimulus, may through all the degrees from its ſmalleſt to its greateſt quantity, be worn out to a certain extent, by one ſtimulus, and then another, and the danger <hi>of its morbid</hi> accumulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on awarded, till the ſum of it be brought down to that, which is ſuitable to health; ſo, the more abundant the <hi>ſame</hi> excitabilty is, that is the more ſtimuli are withdrawn, or the greater penury of the moſt powerful ſtimuli is; the leſs recourſe can be had to that mediocrity of excitability on which the vigour of life depends; and the weakneſs may go to that pitch, the excitability arrive at that degree of abundance, that the <hi>loſs of</hi> excitement may at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come irreparable. This propoſition is both illuſtrated and confirmed by the uſe of every debilitating power; as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified by cold, famine, thirſt, and <hi>the progreſs of</hi> fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
               <p>XLIII. This ſuperabundant excitability proceeds with ſuch rapidity to death, that the only means of reſtoring health, is firſt to encounter it with a very ſmall <hi>doſe of</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſible ſtimulus, <hi>a doſe</hi> ſcarcely exceeding the ſcanty<note n="(w)" place="bottom">Or under-proportioned.</note> por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of ſtimulus, that occaſioned it; then, after waſting a part of the ſuperabundance, to proceed to ſomewhat a ſtronger doſe <hi>of the ſtimulus;</hi> and in that manner to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly taking off whatever ſuperfluity ſtill remains, till at
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022373_0033_0FB86D4A4C285DA0"/>
laſt the ſalutary mediocrity is regained. This ſtate is the converſe of that debility, which ariſes from a worn-out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citability<note n="(x)" place="bottom">An inſtance of a worn-out excitability is that debility which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from intoxication; one of an accumulated excitability is that which dram-drinkers experience the day after a debauch, in conſequence of which their hands ſhake till they are re-excited by their favorite cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial.</note>, and the danger of death occaſioned by it. <hi>To give examples,</hi> a famiſhed perſon is not immediately to be gratified with a full meal; a perſon afflicted with a long duration or high degree of thirſt, is not immediately indulged with a large draught: but the former ſhould be given bit by bit, the latter drop by drop, then both of them gradually more plentifully. A perſon benumbed with cold ſhould gradually receive the cheriſhment of heat. Every perſon, thoroughly penetrated with grief, ſorrow, or any high dejection of mind, ſhould have good news gradually communicated to him. The news of the ſafety of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſoldier, who ſurvived the diſaſter of his countrymen at Cannae, ſhould have been communicated to the mother in a round-about way, at firſt as having no better founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than doubtful report, then as being ſomewhat more to be depended on, afterwards as having ſtill a greater ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of certainty, finally, as not admitting a ſhadow of doubt: and laſt of all, before her ſon was introduced to her, the woman ſhould have been at the ſame time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified<note n="(y)" place="bottom">Had a part of her abundant excitability taken off.</note> both by other ſtimuli, and a glaſs of Falerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an wine.</p>
               <p>XLIV. Since all life conſiſts in ſtimulus, and both the over-abundance and deficiency of it is productive of diſeaſes, and in <hi>exact</hi> proportion to the over-abundance or deficiency; it follows, that the remedies of both theſe deviations from the <hi>proper</hi> ſtandard ſhould be accommodated to their degree;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022373_0034_0FB86D4BC294CC10"/>
and that a high ſum total of ſtimulus, through the courſe of the diſeaſe, ſhould be applied to a high degree of debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or, what comes to the ſame thing, to a very abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant excitability; but, that the quantity to be applied at any <hi>particular</hi> time ſhould be in the ſame proportion ſmall that the excitability is abundant.</p>
               <p>XLV. The debility ariſing from defect of ſtimulus, merits the appellation of DIRECT; becauſe it happens in conſequence of no poſitive hurtful power, but from a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the neceſſary ſupports of life.</p>
               <p>XLVI. Through the whole courſe of direct debility, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very deficiency of ſtimulus is encreaſed by a ſecond, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by a third, the third by a fourth, till the effect at laſt comes to be a ceſſation of any further excitement. This laſt, therefore, is never to be leſſened and the debility encreaſed, with the view, forſooth, that in conſequence of encreaſing the excitability, the addition of a new ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus may act more ſtrongly. For, as often as that is put in practice, the morbid ſtate is encreaſed; and, if the debility ſhould happen to be great, any <hi>further</hi> encreaſe of it may induce death, but <hi>never</hi> encreaſe the ſtrength. For, while great debility, and, indeed, at pleaſure, may, <hi>in that way,</hi> be produced; <hi>any</hi> excitement to be obtained from a ſtimulus to come after, is confined within narrow boundaries<note n="(z)" place="bottom">Suppoſe, that in place of an excitement of 40 degrees, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement is gone down to XXX, and the excitability mounted up to L, and a debilitating power, ſuch as the cold bath, or any of thoſe that are juſt now to be mentioned in the text, has been ſuperadded, reducing the excitement to XXV, and accumulating the excitability to LV. Suppoſe alſo, that any ſtimulus is next employed, with a view to raiſe the excitement, and ſink or reduce the excitability; what will be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult? As an accumulated excitability admits of a very ſmall degree of ſtimulus at any given time, while the accumulation of excitability, and ſinking of excitement, even to death itſelf, can be effected in the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſpace of time, and by any one of the debilitating powers; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the loſs of vigour by the firſt practice, and the reparation of it by the laſt, will bear no proportion to one another; there will be no poſſibility of regaining the vigour thrown away, much leſs any hope of procuring more than exiſted before it was lowered.</note>. Take for an example, cold bathing in

               <head>Of the Seat and Effects of Excitability.</head>
               <p>XLVIII. THE ſeat of excitability in the living body<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Called ſyſtem by medical writers.</note>, is medullary nervous matter, and muſcular ſolid; to which the appellation of nervous ſyſtem may be given. The excitability <hi>is</hi> inherent in it, <hi>but</hi> not different in different parts of its ſeat. This fact is proved by the production of ſenſe, motion, the mental function, and paſſion<note n="(b)" place="bottom">That is, all the functions which diſtinguiſh living animal ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems.</note>, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, inſtantaneouſly, and not in a ſeries of ſucceſſive operation<note n="(c)" place="bottom">If a ſmall quantity of an opiate, a large one of any ſtrong ſpirit, taken into the ſtomach, can inſtantly alleviate an excruciating pain in a Part the moſt diſtant from that to which the remedy is applied, and, in a ſhort time after, remove it altogether, as is now well known, how is that to be explained but by the above propoſition; it being impoſſible to pretend that it is carried in the veſſels? Nor is any other of the many hypotheſes, that have been thought of for the ſolution of this fact, more admiſſible. Should it be imagined, that it moves along the nerves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laſt opinion, we demand proof of that aſſertion; which has not yet, and will not eaſily be produced; while the fact juſt now aſſigned carries its own demonſtration in its boſom. The queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves itſelf wholely into the following ſolution; Why does opium at once relieve the gout in the ſtomach, on the external ſurface, and in the remoteſt extremity of that ſurface? Becauſe the property in the living ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem, upon which and by which it acts, is one and the ſame over all.</note>.</p>
               <p>

                  </gap>. Different exciting powers are applied to different parts of the nervous ſyſtem, one at once to them all; but <hi>the mode</hi> of their application is ſuch, that, wherever they are applied, every one immediately affects the whole excitability.</p>
               <p>XLIX. Every one of the ſame powers always affects ſome part more than any other, <hi>in which reſpect</hi> one pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>affects</hi> one part <hi>more than any other,</hi> another another, <hi>with the ſame</hi> inequality. The affected part is generally that to which any of the powers is directly applied.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. And beſides that, the more excitability has been aſſigned to any part from the beginning <hi>of the living ſtate,</hi> that is, the more vivid and ſenſible it is, the operation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it of each exciting power, whether acting with due force, or in exceſs, or in defect, and through all the interminate degrees <hi>of its action,</hi> becomes more powerful<note n="(d)" place="bottom">That is to ſay, if the exciting power acts with that force which produces health, the degree of its action is greater upon the given than any other part; as alſo when its action is either greater or leſs than that of the middle ſalutary degree.</note>. Thus the brain and alimentary canal poſſeſſes more vivid exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, that is, more propenſity to life, than other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts; and the parts below the nails, than other exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts. Again, while the fact juſt now related is ſuch, a sit has been ſtated, the affection of the part bears no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to that diffuſed over the whole body.</p>
               <p>L. An eſtimate may be formed of the degree of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the part more affected <hi>than any other,</hi> and of that which is diffuſed over the whole body, by comparing the affection of the former with as many leſſer affections, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken together, as equal the number of parts in all the reſt of the body. Suppoſe the greater affection of a part<note n="(f)" place="bottom">As the inflammation of the lungs in peripneumony, the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the foot in the gout, the effuſion of water into a general or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cavity in dropſy.</note>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:022373_0038_0FB86D557294E9E0"/>
to be as 6, and the leſſer affection of every other part to be 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the number of the parts leſs affected to amount to 1000<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Which is keeping greatly within the truth.</note>; then it <hi>will follow, that</hi> the ratio of affection, confined to the part, to the affection of all the reſt of the body, will be as 6 to 3000. This eſtimate, or ſomething very like to it, is proved by <hi>the effect of</hi> the exciting hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful powers, which always act upon the whole body<note n="(h)" place="bottom">The hurtful powers which produce peripneumony, in common English, the inflammation of the lungs, are exceſs in eating, drinking, expoſure to heat, or to the alternation of heat with cold, an over pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of blood from inactivity, or an encreaſed velocity of its motion from violent labour, &amp;c. the effect of any or all which muſt fall as much upon every other part of the ſyſtem as upon a ſmall portion of extreme veſſels in the lungs, and therefore the morbid affection produced cannot be confined to the latter, but muſt be extended to the former. The whole body muſt partake of the morbid change; it muſt be one common affection pervading the whole. If this is not probation, let any thing left on record by authors, or any living phyſician, produce a ſingle hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful power, that, without affecting the ſyſtem over all, can penetrate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the the inmoſt receſſes of the lungs, and there produce an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſhall be content with one ſuch hurtful power, and in exchange for it, when produced, give up my whole doctrine.</note>; and by <hi>that of</hi> the remedies, which always remove the effect of the hurtful powers from the whole body<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Here too I throw the gauntlet. Find a ſingle remedy which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the diſeaſe by an operation confined to the lungs. There is not one.</note>, in every general diſeaſe<note n="(k)" place="bottom">A wound in the lungs, among other effects of it, may produce an inflammation. But that is not a peripneumony, or a general diſeaſe at all. It is, on the contrary, a local one, ariſing from a local cauſe, and to be removed by local remedies, if acceſs could be had to them. And though nothing has been more common than blending ſuch caſes of local and general diſeaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Such an accident is as much a peripneumony, as an inflammation from a contuſion in the foot is a gout, or the ſwelled legs of women heavy with child is dropſy. But of all this more hereafter.</note>

In this way temperature affects the ſurface of the body; diet the ſtomach, and the reſt of the ſame cannal; the blood and other fluids their reſpective veſſels; labour and reſt the veſſels again, and fibres of the muſcles: paſſion and exertion in thinking, the brain; all theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the part mentioned, each that upon which its action is exerted, more than any other equal part.</p>
               <p>LII. Inſtances of a greater excitement of a part then <hi>of the reſt of the body,</hi> are found in ſweat in a perſon in health, flowing firſt from the brow under exerciſe, in checked perſpiration, in inflammation or an affection analagous to it in diſeaſes, in head-ach and delirium. Proofs of a leſſer excitement in a part, are exceſſive perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſweat not occ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>LIII. As the operation of the general powers, whether exciting in exceſs, in due proportion, or in defect, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to ſome one part a little more, than to any other equal part; <hi>it is next to be obſerved,</hi> that it muſt be of the ſame kind in that part as in the reſt, and as well as the general <hi>operation,</hi> be either in exceſs, or in juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion or deficient, but never of an oppoſite <hi>nature.</hi> For as the exciting powers are the ſame, and the excitabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity every where the ſame, it is impoſſible that the effect ſhould not be the ſame. The excitement, therefore, is never encreaſed in a part, while it is diminiſhed in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſyſtem—nor diminiſhed, while the general excitement is encreaſed. There is no difference <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Thus, nauſea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and other ſimilar ſymptoms, produced by ſtrong drink and opiates; as well as the ſame affections apparently, and the gout, colic, gripes, and other ſimilar ſymptoms, occaſioned by abſtinence and water drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; likewiſe good appetite, and the removal of the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent ſymptoms of the ſtomach and inteſtines, which we have mentioned, taking place in the convaleſcent ſtate, in conſequence of a proper adminiſtration of food, drink, and diffuſible ſtimulants: <hi>all theſe</hi> are ſhortly followed by a ſimilar ſtate of the reſt of the body, and the eſtabliſhment of indirect debility is the conſequence of the firſt caſe; that of direct debility <hi>ſucceeds</hi> to the ſecond, and health over all is the termination of the laſt.</p>
               <p>LIV. A part, therefore, is the ſeat of no general affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the whole body is the ſeat of them all; becauſe, with the inequality <hi>above</hi> related, the whole excitability is effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them all.</p>
               <p>LV. Neither is the affection of the more ſuffering part the firſt, and afterwards propagated over the ſyſtem; for this good reaſon, that, as ſoon as the excitability is affected any where, it is alſo and immediately affected every where. Both facts are confirmed by the operation of every exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting power, affecting the whole body as quickly as any one part; by general morbid affections appearing equally ſoon
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022373_0041_0FB86D5A5A2A8C20"/>

Likewiſe the pain of the gout is not the firſt of the phaenomena of that diſeaſe. But all theſe, and many more particulars, will be brought in with more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in their proper places afterwards.</note>. Therefore,</p>
               <p>LVI. Every affection of a part, however formidable, <hi>occurring</hi> in general diſeaſes, is to be conſidered as only a part of the affection inherent in the whole body, and the remedies are not to be directed to a part, as if the whole diſeaſe lurked there, and was thence to be taken off only, but to the whole body, to all which it belongs<note n="(n)" place="bottom">When the affection of a part is external, and, therefore, acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the application of a remedy over it, in conjunction with the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal remedies, is of ſervice, in conſequence of their mutually aſſiſting each other.

The degree of contraction, that conſtitutes ſpaſm, is not an exception from this <hi>propoſition.</hi> It is a continued and deficient function, rather than a great and exact one; and in ſo far as it is a great contraction, it depends upon the local ſtimulus of diſtention, or of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reſembling diſtention, it conſiſts in diminiſhed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement, is devoid of force, and removed by ſtimulant remedies.

               <p>LIX. As the degree of contraction, in ſo far as it is a ſound function, is connected with force; from that we are to hold it as a certain and demonſtrated fact, that the denſity of muſcular fibres conſidered as ſimple ſolids, is proportioned to the degree of their contraction.</p>
               <p>LX. It muſt therefore be admitted, that excitement is the cauſe of denſity. And the denſity is rendered grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and greater by the excitement in proportion to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the latter: Which it is eaſy to perceive through all the intermediate degrees <hi>of ſtrength,</hi> from <hi>the higheſt, or that</hi> which takes place in madneſs, and the denſity cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding to it, to <hi>the loweſt,</hi> or that debility which is diſcerned in the article of death, in death itſelf, and after death, with a laxity corrreſponding to it. That this is the fact, is proved by the weakneſs of the ſame fibres in their dead, and their ſtrength in their living ſtate; the only cauſe of which difference, we know for certain, is excitement<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Experiments have been made by Baron Haller and others, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the comparative ſtrength of muſcular fibres, and the criterion of judgment was their greater or leſſer diſpoſition to break by appended weights; but the power by which any body reſiſts ſtretching, is the denſity of that body. Thoſe experiments ſhow that the fibres in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving body are prodigiouſly ſtronger than the dead.</note>.</p>

LXI. Hence the cavities of the veſſels, through their whole tracts, over the whole body, are diminiſhed in <hi>a ſtate of</hi> ſtrength, and encreaſed in weakneſs.

               <p>LXII. EXCITEMENT, the effect of the exciting powers, when <hi>of a</hi> proper <hi>degree,</hi> conſtitutes health; when <hi>either</hi> exceſſive or deficient, <hi>it proves the occaſion of</hi> diſeaſe, and, of prediſpoſition previous <hi>to the arrival of diſeaſe.</hi> The ſtate both of the ſimple ſolids and fluids follows that of health as conſtituted by the excitement, and a given ſtate<note n="(a)" place="bottom">This propoſition overturns the principal ſyſtems that have ever appeared in the profeſſion of medicine. But more of it after.</note>.</p>
               <p>μ. The firſt cauſe of the formation of ſimple ſolids, and the ſole one of their preſervation after, is the excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Under the direction of the excitement, the living ſolids produce the blood from an external matter taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>the ſyſtem,</hi> keep it in motion, form its mixture, ſecrete from it various fluids, excrete them; abſord others, and circulate and expel them from the body. It is the excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone, thro' its varying degrees, that produces either health, diſeaſes, or the return of the found ſtate. It alone governs both univerſal and local diſeaſes. Neither of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:022373_0044_0FB86D617A3C9990"/>
which ever ariſe from faults of the ſolids or fluids, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways either from encreaſed or diminiſhed excitement. The cure of neither is to be directed to the ſtate of the ſolids or fluids, and only diminution or the encreaſe of excitement. But,</p>
               <p>LXIII. Affections peculiar to parts, or organic mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, being foreign from this place of the work, in which the treatment of the general ſtate of the body is only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, muſt be paſſed over at preſent.</p>
               <p>LXIV. That the excitement governs all life is proved by the exciting powers, acting always by ſtimulating, and thereby producing excitement; it is proved by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or ſmaller activity of the functions being proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the force of the exciting powers; it is proved by the effect of the remedies, which always oppoſe deficient, to exceſſive, and exceſſive, to deficient excitement, in <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting</hi> the cure of diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>LXV. The notion of health and diſeaſe being different ſtates, is diſproved by the operation of the powers which produce them, and thoſe that remove them, being one and the ſame.</p>
               <p>LXVI. The general diſeaſes, ariſing from exceſſive excitement, are called ſthenic<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Their old name is phlogiſtic; but as that word is abſurdly meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical from an old notion of that ſort of diſeaſes depending upon fire or flame; and becauſe it was not a proper contraſt to the term here to be oppoſed to it; as alſo becauſe it is ſtill more ridiculous when applied to plants, which are comprehended in this doctrine; for theſe reaſons it has been thought proper to reject it, and ſubſtitute the other in its place.</note>; thoſe that origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate from a deficient excitement, aſthenic. Hence there are two forms of diſeaſes, and both are always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by prediſpoſition.</p>
               <p>LXVII. That the origin of diſeaſes, and prediſpoſition <hi>juſt now</hi> mentioned, is the only one and true, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the ſame powers which produce any diſeaſe, or
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:022373_0045_0FB86D6357F25B18"/>
prediſpoſition, alſo producing the whole form of diſeaſes to which it belongs; and by the ſame remedies, which cure any diſeaſe, or prediſpoſition, alſo curing all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and prediſpoſitions of its reſpective form<note n="(c)" place="bottom">The ſame hurtful powers produce, and the ſame remedies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, both Catarrh and Peripneumony, only differing in degree. The powers producing them are exceſs in the uſe of ſtimulants, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies whatever moderates that exceſs. Evacuation, cold, and ſtarving, are the means. All the difference is, that more of the means are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the cure of Peripneumony than for that of Catarrh. The hurtful powers producing indigeſtion and fevers, are alſo the ſame, to wit, debilitating; and the remedies the ſame, to wit ſtimulant. Only a ſmall degree of the remedies, proportioned to the ſlightneſs of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the cauſe, is ſufficient for the cure of indigeſtion; while the moſt diffuſible ſtimuli are required to effect the cure of fevers. Stimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, in one degree or other, make the cure of all aſthenic diſeaſes; evacuants and other weakening means in different degrees, form the whole cure of the ſthenic form of diſeaſes. Might not this have been known long ſince?</note>. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>LXVIII. The exciting powers, which produce pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition to diſeaſes, or thoſe diſeaſes themſelves, ſhould be denominated ſthenic, or ſtrictly ſtimulant. Thoſe that pave the way to aſthenic diſeaſes, or produce the latter, ſhould be called aſthenic, or debilitating. The ſtate of the body producing the former or the prediſpoſition to them, is to be called Sthenic Diatheſis; that which occaſions the latter, with the prediſpoſition peculiar to it, receives the new term of Aſthenic Diatheſis. Each of theſe diatheſis are a ſtate of the body, the ſame with prediſpoſition and diſeaſe, varying only in degree.

               <head>The Effect of both the Diatheſes, and of the moſt perfect Health itſelf.</head>
               <p>LXIX. THE common effect of the ſthenic hurtful powers upon the functions, is, firſt to encreaſe the functions, then partly t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

The effect, in common to the aſthenic hurtful powers, upon the ſame <hi>functions,</hi> is to diminiſh them, in ſuch a manner, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſometimes to exhibit an appearance, but a falſe one<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Spaſm and convulſion, ſuppoſed to ariſe from encreaſed influx of the nervous power, are both occaſioned, and cured, by the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as all the other ſymptoms.</note>, of encreaſing them.</p>
               <p>LXX. If the juſt degree of excitement could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept up, mankind would enjoy eternal health. But two circumſtances prevent that. Such is the nature of the ſthenic diatheſis, that it waſtes the ſum total of exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability aſſigned to every being upon the commencement of its living ſtate, and, thereby ſhortening life often by the interpoſition of diſeaſes, ſooner or later induces death. Which is one cauſe of mortality.</p>
               <p>LXXI. The aſthenic diatheſis is hurtful by not ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that degree of excitement, which is neceſſary to life,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:022373_0047_0FB86D6602AB9418"/>
and thereby allowing the ſtate of life to approach more nearly to that in which death conſiſts. Which opens ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gate of death to mankind.</p>
               <p>ν. Further diſeaſes and death are the conſequences of the change of either diatheſis into the other. Either dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, by means of the hurtful powers producing the other, when theſe are employed as remedies<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Stimulants are the proper remedies for curing the gout; but they may be carried ſo far as to produce ſo much ſthenic diatheſis as to border upon indirect debility. A conſequence of which is vomiting, purging, a feeling of burning in the inteſtines, intermiſſion of the pulſe, and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury; which are only to be cured by ſubſtituting watery drink and low diet in place of thoſe oppoſite remedies: Nay, the ſtimulants may be carried ſo far, as to effect the eſtabliſhment of indirect debility. Hence, will ariſe paralytic affection, anaſarca, dropſy, &amp;c. The evacuants and other debilitating remedies, by which the diſeaſes of ſthenic diatheſis are removed, may, by being puſhed to exceſs, produce the laſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſeaſes, as depending on direct debility.</note>, may, either from accident, inadvertence, or deſign, be completely converted into the other; and when that has been done, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite remedies <hi>to thoſe, that in this manner</hi> proved hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, are employed; it may, <hi>by a contrary exceſs,</hi> be turned back to the ſame ſtate from which it ſet out<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Puſhing the remedies of ſthenic diſeaſes too far, may reduce the patient to an incipient dropſy; and the remedies of the latter may be urged to ſuch exceſs, as to paſs the range of ſthenic diatheſis, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in indirect debility. A is affected with a diſeaſe of debility, where the excitement has gone down to 10, the excitability mounted up to 70, degrees in the ſcale. What is to be done? By a proper uſe of high ſtimulants the 30 degrees of loſt excitement may be reſtored, and as many of ſuperfluous excitability diſcharged, and the excitement and excitability made to meet again at the middle point of 40. If the remedies are carried up to any degree betwixt 40 and 55, they have gone too far, and produced prediſpoſition to ſthenic diſeaſes; if ſtill far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but not exceeding 70, they will have produced one or other of theſe diſeaſes. But carried beyond 70, the diſeaſes, which their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion produces, are thoſe of indirect debility. Any diſeaſe of this ſort, when treated according to a rule lately delivered, will be cured. But if the ſtimulants adapted to this purpoſe be urged further; the ſthenic diatheſis will again be produced; and the debilitating power, ſuited to the removal of it, may carry down the excitement below 40 into the range of prediſpoſition betwixt 40 and 25; and then, by a further abuſe of remedies, which ſhould only be uſed in the range betwixt 40 and 70 the excitement may return to the ſame point from which it ſet out, to wit, the point of 10, and the excitability riſe to its original point, that of 70</note>. This
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:022373_0048_0FB86D6B262B1670"/>
obſervation will be found of the greateſt conſequence in the cure of both prediſpoſitions and diſeaſes<note n="(e)" place="bottom">It muſt never be forgot, that we are nothing in ourſelves, but, while we have any excitability remaining in proper capacity to be acted upon, we entirely depend on the exciting powers acting on it.</note>. What is wanting to a further illuſtration of it ſhall be given af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. An illuſtration of the change of ſthenic diathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis into aſthenic is <hi>found</hi> in hydrothorax ſucceeding perip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neumony. Again, the immoderate uſe of ſtimulants may convert any aſthenic affection into a ſthenic one; as when a violent cough, a catarrh, or an inflammatory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore throat, are induced in conſequence of the cure of the gout, though proper in kind, being carried to exceſs in degree.</p>
               <p>ξ. Though excitement governs all the phenomena of life; yet the ſymptoms of diſeaſes, which either its exceſs or deficiency produces, do not of themſelves lead to any proper judgement reſpecting it; on the contrary, their deceiving appearance has proved a ſource of infinite error.</p>
               <p>LXXII. From all that has hitherto been ſaid, it is a certain and demonſtrated fact, that, life is a<note n="(g)" place="bottom">not a natural, but,</note> forced ſtate, that the tendency of animals every moment is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; that they are kept from it<note n="(h)" place="bottom">not by any powers in themſelves, but</note>, by foreign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

                  <hi>and even by theſe</hi> with difficulty and only for a little; and then, from the neceſſity of their fate, give way to death.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <head>Of Prediſpoſition.</head>
               <p>LXXIII. Prediſpoſition is a middle ſtate betwixt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health and diſeaſe. The powers, producing it, are the ſame with thoſe which produce diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>LXXIV. The period of prediſpoſition will be ſhorter or longer, according to the greater or leſſer force of the hurtful powers <hi>that have induced it;</hi> and the interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween health and actual diſeaſe will be more quickly or ſlowly got over.</p>
               <p>LXXV. That prediſpoſition neceſſarily precedes diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is evident from the fact of its ariſing from the ſame exciting powers, acting upon the ſame excitability, from which both health and diſeaſe ariſe, and of its being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate ſtate betwixt them both. And, as the excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of health differs much from that of diſeaſe; it is not, therefore, to be ſuppoſed, that the former immediately mounts up to the latter, and ſkips over the boundaries of prediſpoſition: nay, the contrary is certain and beyond a doubt.</p>
               <p>LXXVI. Contagious diſeaſes are not an exception from this obſervation; becauſe, whether the matter of contagion act by a ſtimulant or a debilitating operation, its operation is the ſame with that of the ordinary powers, that is to ſay, its cauſe is the ſame<note n="(a)" place="bottom">The ſmall-pox and meaſles are cured by the ſame means as perip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neumony or any other ſthenic diſeaſe; and, excepting the contagious matter, ariſe from the ſame ſtimulant urtful powers; they muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with the ſame exception, be the ſame. The only difference is, that they are accompanyed with a contagious matter, and the other ſthenic diſeaſes are not. The amount of which is altogether unimport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. For, if the ordinary powers have not operated, the affection does not come under the definition of general diſeaſe; none of the functions reading from their natural ſtate, and the eruption amounting to no more than a ſlight local complaint. It is, therefore, only of uſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the general circumſtances of theſe diſeaſes, making no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the local part, than to conſider, arrange, and treat it as ſuch. It is well known, that, when by the means uſed for the cure of ſthenic diſeaſes without contagion and their ſequel, eruption, the ſthenic dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis is prevented or removed, the local part gives no trouble; and that the diſeaſe is never dangerous but from the neglect of that manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the management is nothing elſe but the ordinary one in any ſthenic caſe. If it ſhould be contented, that, all that being granted, ſtill the eruption may contribute a little: Be that ſo, and it can be but very little; what is the effect? The cure ſhows it; which is exactly the ſame as in ſthenic diſeaſes without eruption. The diſeaſe, therefore, being the ſame (for its mere local part is out of the queſtion, as only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a peculiar expoſure to cold, which is equally proper in every ſthenic diſeaſe); every part of reaſoning reſpecting it, and, conſequently, that affecting the queſtion about prediſpoſition, muſt alſo be the ſame. If, therefore, other general diſeaſes have their prediſpoſition, ſo muſt the ſmall-pox, the meaſles, and the plague itſelf. If it ſhould ſtill be ſaid, that the eruptive diſeaſes, though in other reſpects the ſame with the non-eruptive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> differ, in ſo far as prediſpoſition is required as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon circumſtance between them; the anſwer is, that that difference only reſpects their local part, which, without the powers producing the diſeaſe, is inſignificant and a mere local complaint. As general ſthenic diſeaſes, the ſmall-pox and meaſles, and as general aſthenic ones, conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious fever and the plague, to the full extent of their generality, have their period of prediſpoſition; we may have occaſion afterward to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the queſtion about prediſpoſition to them even as local diſeaſes, but this is not the place for it; all that was required here being to ſettle the queſtion about prediſpoſition to them as general diſeaſes. In the ſame point of view all that has been ſaid of contagious diſeaſes, will apply to diſeaſes in which poiſons may have been concerned.</note>. If, as it ſometimes happens, no
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:022373_0050_0FB86D70D31934B8"/>
general affection follows the application of contagion, if no undue exceſs or defect of excitement is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:022373_0051_0FB86D7201DD1CA0"/>
in that caſe, the affection is altogether local and foreign from this place.</p>
               <p>LXXVII. If poiſons communicate any ſort of morbid affection without prediſpoſition, ſuch an affection, for that very reaſon, is not to be conſidered as a general diſeaſe, as alſo for this additional reaſon, that <hi>the affection</hi> is neither removed nor relieved by the uſual cure of general diſeaſe;s and the diverſity of the effect proves, that both the cauſe and exciting hurtful power are different from the general ones. In one word, ſince prediſpoſition and diſeaſe are the ſame, varying only in degree, the unavoidable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is, that whatever, with a given force, produces the latter, <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> with a leſſer force, will produce the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The only cure of moſt poiſons is their early diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from <hi>the ſyſtem.</hi> And if, as often happens, others, by wounding an organ neceſſary to life, are not curable, but fatal; the effect of both is foreign from our preſent ſubject, and to be referred to local diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>LXXVIII. The only thing to be regarded in the powers producing either prediſpoſition to general diſeaſes, or thoſe diſeaſes <hi>in their full force,</hi> is the degree of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer<note n="(b)" place="bottom">thoſe that produce the prediſpoſition,</note> compared with <hi>that of</hi> the latter<note n="(c)" place="bottom">thoſe that produce the diſeaſe,</note>, or of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual powers compared with one another; for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of diſcerning the degree of hurtful power that each poſſeſſes, and the degree of curative means to be employed in order to remove the hurtful effect<note n="(d)" place="bottom">The diſtinctions of the powers producing prediſpoſition, and of thoſe that excite diſeaſe, under the general appellation of prediſponent or occaſional cauſes have been multiplied and refined upon without end. But the whole ſyſtem of remote cauſes, as they have been called, is falſe in its firſt idea. The hurtful powers, whatever they be called, that produce diſeaſes, alſo produce the prediſpoſition to them. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once admitted, as it henceforth muſt, the whole fabric of aitiology or of the doctrine of remote cauſes muſt fall to the ground: Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, ſimply remote cauſes, not diviſible into prediſponent and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional; relative remote cauſes, or ſuch as are ſo diviſible; internal and external prediſponent, internal and external occaſional, cauſes; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching cauſes, or cauſae propriories proximate cauſes, of which, not only one, but often ſeveral, are aſſigned to every diſeaſe, muſt ceaſe in medical language, and the ſtudent's attention be turned away from the endleſs purſuit of diſtinctions without a difference, to the ſtudy of the ſolid and uſeful facts that nature holds up to his contemplation in great abundance, when once his eyes are fairly opened to behold them.</note>.</p>

As the prediſpoſition, to diſeaſes, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes themſelves, are the ſame ſtate; a great criterion, by which general diſeaſes may be diſtinguiſhed from local ones, will be <hi>found in this ſingle circumſtance,</hi> that general diſeaſes are always, local never, preceded by prediſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="(g)" place="bottom">An inflammation in ſome part of the ſtomach, or as it has been commonly called, "the Inflammation of the Stomach," as if it were always of the ſame kind, produces many ſymptoms, that bear ſo great a reſemblance to general ſthenic diſeaſes, ſuch as peripneumony, that by ſyſtematics and noſologiſts, it, as well as many other inflammations of internal cavities, have been united into an order of diſeaſes, ſuppoſed all to partake of one common nature. The Gaſtritis, however, which is its noſological name, is eſſentially different, both from Peripneumony and all the other general diſeaſes of the order with which it is aſſociated, both in other reſpects, and in that of which we are ſpeaking. As ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from certain local hurtful powers, it is not preceded by prediſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So when I come to the bed-ſide of a patient under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, though I had no previous knowledge of the nature of his diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whenever I hear that he has ſwallowed ground glaſs, ſmall fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones, or, perhaps, a great quantity of Caien pepper, I can be at no loſs to diſcern the nature of the diſeaſe, and to find, that it is altogether local; and that for two of the beſt of all reaſons; firſt, the perſon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been in perfect health immediately before that accident; and, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the ſubſtances which he had ſwallowed were ſuch as would naturally divide a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

From this, again, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is an inſeparable conſequence. And it is equally an univerſa fact in the animal economy, that, when any part, whether internal or external, which poſſeſſes great ſenſibility, is wounded or otherwiſe inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in its ſubſtance, the pain ariſing from the inflammation ſuperinduced, ſpreads ſymptoms of diſorder over the whole ſyſtem, which are liable to miſlead thoſe, who are not in poſſeſſion of the criterion we here point out. As ſuch a caſe, then, it not preceded by prediſpoſition, ſo peripneumo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as well as every other ſthenic, every aſthenic, diſeaſe muſt, from the proofs of the univerſality of the fact, be allowed to be, it muſt be local.

               <p>LXXXVI. SINCE the powers producing ſthenic and aſthenic diatheſis, always act upon a part with more force than any other equal part; it follows, therefore, that the danger of diſeaſe during the prediſpoſition, and of death
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:022373_0057_0FB86D804D9CCD60"/>
during the diſeaſe, ariſes in proportion to the degree of diatheſis, or to the importance of the part eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. But, its degree being given, the more equal the diatheſis is, the more ſafe it is. Nor does it ever fall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon an organ neceſſary to life, without inſtant danger. And hence it is, that peripneumony, apoplexy, phrenitis, eryſipelas, and the gout, when the two latter affect the head with violence, are chiefly formidable.</p>
               <p>LXXXVII. Local and ſymptomatic affections ought to be diſtinguiſhed from general diſeaſes, and the remarks made in the LXXXIII. LXXXV. transferred to this place.</p>

               <p>LXXXVIII. THE indication for the cure of ſthenic diatheſis is to diminiſh, that for the cure of the aſthenic diatheſis, is to encreaſe the excitement, and to continue to encreaſe it, till that degree of it, which conſtitutes the mean betwixt its extremes, and which is ſuited to good health, be replaced. This is the only indication of cure that univerſal diſeaſes admit of.</p>
               <p>LXXXIX. As both diatheſes ariſe from an operation of the exciting powers, the ſame <hi>in kind,</hi> but varying in degree; ſo they are both prevented and removed by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the remedies, alſo the ſame <hi>in kind,</hi> but oppoſite in degree, to that which produced them. As their cauſe, ſo is alſo their plan of cure, confirmed by an induction of proof<note n="(a)" place="bottom">not one or two, but</note>, drawn from the whole course of facts and phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Suppoſe the ſthenic diatheſis mounted up to 60 in the ſcale; to reduce it to 40 it is evident, that the 20 degrees of ſuperfluous excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be taken off, and, therefore, that remedies operating with a ſtimulus, weak enough to produce that effect, muſt be employed: they are ſtill, however, ſtimulant, and of conſequence, though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, ſtill the ſame in kind, as the powers that produced the diathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis; it having been proved, that they are not to be ſuppoſed ſedative, both for the reaſons already given, and for this addtional one, that proof has not been yet brought of a ſingle ſedative in nature. As their ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, however, is leſs than that which is required to ſupport the ordinary ſtate of health, they are underſtood to be debilitating, and, therefore, proper remedies of ſthenic diatheſis.</note>. The ſame debilitating remedies, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

any one ſthenic diſeaſe, remove that whole <hi>form of diſeaſes:</hi> and the ſame ſtimulant means, which cure any one aſthenic diſeaſe, remove all the reſt<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Suppoſe the aſthenic diatheſis to have ſunk down to 20; to raiſe it up to the ſtandard of health, it is plain, from all the propoſitions hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to laid down, that the 20 degrees of deficient ſtimulus muſt be reſtored, and, therefore, that remedies operating with a degree of ſtimulus ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the production of that effect, muſt be uſed. All the difference betwixt this force of ſtimulus and that of the other, is only a difference of 40 degrees. As, therefore, the debilitating powers, though ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, employed in the firſt, removed the morbid ſuperfluity; ſo the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulant powers uſed in this caſe, called ſtimulant by way of eminence, remove the morbid deficiency, and thereby, reſtore the degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement, that conſtitutes the ſtandard of health.</note>.

Theſe ariſe from oſſifications in the large veſſels next the heart, from tumors, whether ſchirrous or ſteatomatous, impeding by their preſſure the return of the blood by the veins to the heart. It is the general caſe that is here allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, and the public may depend upon it, that it is to be cured, but not by evacuant means, and, on the contrary, by the high diffuſible ſtimuli, neceſſary to the cure of diſeaſes of high debility, ſuch as the extremity of typhus fever, and an expiring gout. All theſe are cured by high ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulants.</note>, as well as the gout, and fevers, both relieved and removed by the ſame remedies? And are not peripneumony, the ſmall-pox, the meaſles, rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,

and catarrh, removed by the ſame remedies<note n="(f)" place="bottom">to wit, evacuants, cold, and ſtarving.</note>? But all theſe remedies in the aſthenic caſe encreaſe, in the ſthenic diminiſh, the energy of life. In both caſes the operation is a common one <hi>over all,</hi> nor is there any diverſity but in degree.</p>
               <p>XC. The remedies, therefore of ſthenic diatheſis are powers, exciting by a weaker ſtimulus, than that which is ſuited to health; and are in this work to be denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, for the ſake of brevity, Debilitating or Antiſthenic Remedies.</p>
               <p>XCI. The remedies of aſthenic diatheſis are powers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing with more force, than ſuits the beſt health; to be named here in the practice ſtimulants or ſthenic, for the more convenient diſtinction of them from the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
               <p>XCII. Theſe are to be employed with more or leſs free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in proportion to the higher or lower degree of <hi>each</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atheſis, and of the local affection depending upon it. And ſuch a choice of each ſhould be made in ſuch a way as that the moſt powerful may be adapted to the moſt violent caſe. But the cure of any diſeaſe of conſiderable violence, and ſcarce of any at all, is never to be entruſted to any one remedy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The uſe of ſeveral remedies is preferable to that of one; becauſe, thereby, their direct energy is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſyſtem to a greater extent, and the excitability
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:022373_0060_0FB86D8A09835550"/>
is more completely and more equally affected. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who means that his remedies ſhould go to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular part<note n="(h)" place="bottom">and there, from a local operation, and not by an affection of the excitability, ſerve the purpoſe,</note>, is equally wiſe, as <hi>any</hi> one <hi>would</hi> be, who, by cropping a twig, expects to eradicate a tree. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are <hi>of</hi> general, what <hi>of</hi> local <hi>operation,</hi> ſhall next be mentioned.</p>
               <p>XCIII. General remedies are thoſe, which, acting upon the excitability, by an operation diffuſed over the whole body, reproduce the ſtate of health.</p>
               <p>XCIV. Local remedies are thoſe, which act by a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar operation on a part, and, by an operation confined to that, reſtore the ſound ſtate.</p>
               <p>XCV. Since every univerſal diſeaſe, every prediſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, depends upon encreaſed or diminiſhed excitement, and is removed by the converſion of that into the degree <hi>which conſtitutes</hi> the mean betwixt both; for that reaſon in order both to prevent and cure diſeaſe we muſt always uſe the indication propoſed, and ſtimulate or debilitate; never lay by, nor truſt to the ſuppoſed powers of nature, which have no real exiſtence.</p>
               <p>XCVI. In the indication of cure, the only regard to be had to morbific matter, is to allow time for its paſſing out of the body. For whether it acts, like all other exciting powers, ſometimes by a ſtimulating<note n="(i)" place="bottom">as in the ſmall-pox and meaſles,</note>, ſometimes by a debilitating operation<note n="(k)" place="bottom">as in contagious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>evers and the plauge,</note>, or whether <hi>its action conſiſt in</hi> only giving the peculiar form of its reſpective diſeaſe, and, thereby, adding a local affection to a general one; in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe there is no room for a new indication.</p>
               <p>XCVII. For if the diſeaſe, as a general one, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly managed, every eruption, and its conſequences,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:022373_0061_0FB86D8B85161408"/>
every ſpecies of inflammation, every ſpecies of ulceration, give way to the happy effect of the general plan of cure. And, when a contrary event takes place in conſequence of a bad method of cure, the local ſymptoms are propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally aggravated. This is proved in the ſmall-pox long ago, and in the meaſles lately<note n="(l)" place="bottom">After the diſcovery of the nature of the catarrh, the catarrhal ſymptoms in the meaſles came naturally to be enquired into. A full trial was given to the refrigerant debilitating plan, in the author's own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as well as among ſeveral patients, and laſtly among near an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred patients in England, treated by the father of one of the author's pupils; who all did well, while others, who ware kept warm, according to a practice that Dr. Sydenham had left as he found it among his Alexipharmac cotemporaries, many died, and all had a bad recovery. The Author's own ſon and name-ſon, a boy about ſix years of age, was ſtript half naked and allowed to go out and play as he pleaſed. The only check upon him was, his being allowed nothing but fluid vegetable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he returned home with a keen appetite. This matter will be further explained, and in a more proper place, afterward. But, what has been ſaid, was in illuſtration of the hint in the text.</note>, but, with equal certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it is proved by the plague, <hi>at leaſt,</hi> as often as it has been treated with any judgement, and by remedies proper in kind and adminiſtered in due proportion; it is proved by the malignant, or gangrenous ſore throat<note n="(m)" place="bottom">This caſe of diſeaſe has been conſidered, as wholly and ſolely ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the throat, and therefore conjoined with other diſeaſes, where that local affection was underſtood to be the eſſential ſymptom, and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ymptom that connected all the caſes. But the other caſes are ſthenic or to be cured in the ordinary way of bleeding and evacuation; while ſuch a practice is certain death in it, as being not only an aſthenic caſe, that is a caſe of debility, but one of the higheſt; and, inſtead of depending upon the affection of the throat, the affection of the throat depends on it. Give ſtimulants to the patients labouring under the inflammatory ſore throat, and you kill them; bleed, purge, vomit, and ſtarve, in the gangrenous caſe, and you enſure the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ate. Such, however, are the diſeaſes, that ſyſtematics, noſologiſts, and other ſtrangers in the city of nature, have, from their ignorance of the place, in ſpite of their natural diſtance, brought all together. (See Dr. Cullen's Genera Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum, all the three editions, genus VII.) As ſoon will Mile-end and Knightſbridge meet; as ſoon will London place itſelf on the Calton-hill, and become an elevated ſuburb of Edinburgh.</note>, and by

other caſes of typhus, with a ſimilar affection of a part. In the two laſt, the danger to life depends upon the degree of the general affection, without which there is no occaſion for <hi>any</hi> apprehenſion from the local. And the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is ſo true, with reſpect to the <hi>three</hi> former, that, though the <hi>contagious</hi> matter has been applied, yet, without the general hurtful powers preceding, no true general diſeaſe ariſes, the danger encreaſes in proportion to their violence, and the whole cure depends upon the general remedies. Theſe are <hi>ſo many</hi> facts, that ſhow, that no matter, whether of a contagious nature or not, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes towards the cauſe of the general diſeaſe, which it accompanies or diſtinguiſhes, or, if it contributes any thing, that in that it differs not from any uſual hurtful powers.</p>

But neither does that ſuggeſt a new indication of cure; ſince the only means of effecting it are thoſe, which otherwiſe remove both the diatheſes in proportion to their force, and which are not ſerviceable as local, but as general remedies<note n="(n)" place="bottom">The diſcovery of the ſupport of perſpiration upon a principle, which extends to all phenomena of the ſubject, was reſerved for this work. The heating remedies of the Alexipharmac phyſicians were intented to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port perſpiration, and thereby, throw out a morbific matter: Which was a very unlucky thought in the ſthenic diſeaſes, the principal of which were peripneumony, of which we have already ſo often ſpoken; phrenitis, in which the brain was ſuppoſed to be inflamed; and the ſmall-pox and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles; becauſe the nature of thoſe diſeaſes, and the tendency of all the powers producing them, was to check perſpiration, (ſee No. LXI.) from the exceſs of their ſtimulus; conſequently, the addition of more ſtimuli, by way of cure, was to check it ſtill more. But thoſe diſeaſes are only three out of the hundred of general diſeaſes: whereas the followers of a great man, who corrected that abuſe through a fiery perſecution, <gap reason="foreign">

Their imitation of their maſter tranſported them into a rage to carry on the plan of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting perſpiration, by the ſame means, through the remaining 97 of the hundred. And they ſucceeded with a vengeance. For, as it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe diſeaſes to tranſmit too great a quantity of fluids through the perſpiratory pores, in conſequence of the debility which conſtitutes their cauſe; certainly the encreaſe of that debility, that is to ſay, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the cauſe, ſhould encreaſe the effect.

The quantity of blood, ſo produced, may go to exceſs, as well as every other exciting power, the principal of which it is. But the queſtion is, when, in whom, and under what circumſtances, is an over-proportion of blood generated? Common ſenſe would ſay, not at the beginning or the end of life, when the degree of nutriment uſed is far from being ſo conſiderable, as at the middle and vigorous period of life. Again, which of the two ſexes are ſuppoſed moſt liable to generate this morbid redundancy of the vital fluid? A ſimple creature, aided by nothing but natural ſagacity, would be apt to ſay, the men; both becauſe they eat more, and, from the greater variety of the modes of promoting digeſtion to which they are addicted, digeſt better. How medical ſyſtematics would laugh at ſuch ſimplicity! How contrary that would ſeem to myſtery, their Lydian ſtone, under which they think all wiſdom ſo ſafely lodged, as to fear it would be dangerous to turn it up, and examine what was under it!

               <p>CIV. When the firſt part of the cure is completed, and the convaleſcent now can uſe the more permanent and natural ſtimuli, he ſhould gradually be confined to them, and drop the uſe of the more diffuſible; with this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, that if he has been in the habit of uſing a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable deal of ſtimulus, he may be indulged in ſomething extraordinary in that way for ſome time<note n="(t)" place="bottom">This indulgence is chiefly intended for thoſe, who have gone to ſome exceſs in the uſe of the ſtimulus of drink, and who ſtill, without it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, are not capable of taking enough of food and other durable ſtimuli for their ſupport. The aim, however, of all ſuch perſons (with the exception only of thoſe who are of an advanced age, or of thoſe whoſe debility threatens to run a certain courſe), ſhould be to lay aſide the daily uſe of drink altogether, and to indulge in occaſional approaches to exceſs as ſeldom as poſſible. Some perſons, even beyond the fiftieth year of their age, when they found they could eat and perform all their other functions with vigour, have had the reſolution to abſtain from all ſort of ſtrong drink, not only with impunity, but with a moſt wonderful improvement of their health and vigour. Another advantage, ariſing from this management, is, that, whenever any diſeaſe, to which a perſon may be liable, (ſuch as the gout, various affections of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, chiefly prevalent in the alimentary canal; in a word, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of either form of debility), either returns, or threatens to return; a return to the uſe of wine and other ſtrong drink will then become an excellent remedy, and even ſupercede the uſe of the high diffuſible ones. That practice would be attended with this further advantage, that, when the occaſion that called for it was over, and the diſeaſe prevented or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the perſon might again lay aſide the uſe of drink, with all the good conſequences he had formerly experienced from the practice, and thereby both prolong his life, improve his health, and enjoy the proper and vigorous uſe of all his functions.</note>.</p>

CV. The cure of the hurtful effect of any ſtimulus ſhould firſt be ſet about by changing it for a leſſer one, this for a ſtill leſſer; and the intention of cure ſhould be always to paſs from the uſe of the more violent and diffuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which nature in her ſound ſtate rejects, to that of the more durable, and more ſuitable to nature when unop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, till the healthy ſtate can at laſt be unheld by the uſual ſupports<note n="(u)" place="bottom">In many diſeaſes of debility ariſing from a former exceſs, the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulant effects of which have paſſed away, the uſe of cold water, though in gratification of the patients craving, and of other thin potions, as well as of vegetable aliment in a fluid form, and of evacuation of every kind, is moſt hurtful.</note>.</p>
               <p>CVI. In the caſe of indirect debility, when the view is to reſtore vigour, a debilitating plan of cure ſhould be avoided; becauſe no ſort of debility is to be cured by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor any degree of it by any degree of another. It
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:022373_0067_0FB86D9903A12B30"/>
is only in the progreſs to indirect debility<note n="(x)" place="bottom">Betwixt 40 and 70.</note>, that directly debilitating powers are ſuitable for the purpoſe of ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the vigour, in that caſe, in danger of being worn out<note n="(y)" place="bottom">At 65 there are only 5 degrees of vigour left, which, either by a continuance of the ſame exceſſive ſtimuli that produced them, or, by the addition of a degree proportioned to that effect, would be worn out. Remove ſome of the ſtimulant powers, the exceſs of excitement will be diminiſhed, ſuppoſe to 60; remove more of the former, and the exceſs of the latter will be further diminiſhed, till the excitement is reduced to its natural healthy ſtandard of 40. The ſtate of excitement, then, within this range, that is, between 40 and 70, eſpecially in proportion to the approach of the exceſs to 70, is that, to which only directly debilitating powers ſhould be applied. In all caſes above 70 where the excitement is gone, and below 40 where it conſtantly decreaſes all the way, till it is loſt at 0<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> directly debilitating powers are pernicious. How had then muſt the only practice be, that we find in books and lectures, a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice tranſmitted from the firſt accounts of our profeſſion, and which deals in the uſe of no other means but directly debilitating ones? Bad, indeed, muſt it be!</note>: ſuch as cold bathing, lowering the diet, weak drink, and a ſimilar abatement in the uſe of the other ſtimuli.</p>
               <p>CVII. For the cure of direct debility, we ſhould begin with the ſmalleſt degree of ſtimulus, and then riſe to the uſe of a greater and greater, till the morbid abundance of excitability be gradually worn off, and the health at laſt reſtored.</p>
               <p>CVIII. When the diſeaſe ariſes from the want of any one ſtimulus, the return to its uſe ſhould be gradual, and facilitated by other ſtimulants more powerful <hi>than itſelf.</hi>

               <p>CX. Since, therefore, the ſame powers excite all the phaenomena of life, and produce ſometimes an exceſs, ſometimes a juſt proportion, ſometimes a deficiency, of life, according to the various degrees in which they are applied; and ſince the ſame obſervation extends to the ſame powers, when they are applied as remedies of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; let it, therefore, be an univerſal rule, never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guardedly to convert either diatheſis into the other. And, as every diſeaſe, that debilitating powers remove, is ſthenic, every one, that is cured by ſtimulant means, aſthenic; the knowledge of that may furniſh the proper means of caution againſt miſtake.</p>

                  <p>CXIII. Becauſe the action of heat is encreaſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more upon the ſurface than in the internal parts, where the temperature is nearly ſtationary, it, therefore ſtimulates more in the former than in the latter. Hence, in the phlegmaſiae<note n="(d)" place="bottom">diſeaſes with inflammation of a part,</note>, the inflammation is always external, The ſame <hi>agent</hi> encreaſes the tone of the muſcular fibres every where, and conſequently their denſity<note n="(e)" place="bottom">See Chap.

Hence the merit of Dr. Sydenham in recommending cold both in the ſmall-pox and in peripneumony, in which diſeaſe he took his patients out of bed, and placed them in an eaſy chair. Happy had it been for the profeſſion, and happier for the ſick, had he extended his improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the meaſles and catarrh, and all the reſt of the few aſthenic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and ſtopt there; but by extending his antiphlogiſtic and refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant doctrine to the whole form of aſthenic deſeaſes, the harm and good he did were in the proportion of 97 of the former to three of the latter.</note>.</p>

CXV. Heat, in extreme exceſs, whether it it acts hurtfully by its duration or intenſity, conſtantly debilitates by diminiſhing the tone, and producing laxity inſtead of denſity. Which effect is ſomewhat greater upon the ſkin, to which the direct energy of heat is applied, than in the interior parts, in which there is little change of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature. Hence ariſes ſweating as in the torrid zone; hence the diameters of all the veſſels, and particularly of the perſpiratory veſſels are enlarged. Hence proceed the colliquative ſweats in fevers, and a ſimilar ſtate of the belly. Hence, alſo, corruption of the fluids, and not from a ſtate of them directly produced by corrupting pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers<note n="(h)" place="bottom">The idea of certain powers of a tendency to corrupt our fluids, and of certain others to correct that effect, and take off the degeneracy, long prevailed in the minds of ſyſtematics, and is not among many of their followers yet laid aſide.

CXVII. Cold, inimical to animals, vegetables, and the elements, weakens the reſt of the ſyſtem, and ſtill more the ſurface, the temperature of which it almoſt only diminiſhes, <hi>and it produces that effect</hi> always by a direct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, always in proportion to its degree.

                  <p>CXVIII. that theſe effects of the extremes of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature ariſe from debilitating not generating putrefaction, from an affection of the excitement, not of the fluids, plainly appears from this; that other exciting hurtful powers, ſuch as a famine, an overabundance of blood, as in the caſe of thoſe who die of peripneumony, and ſimilar hurtful powers, which neither have been, nor can be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to affect the fluids by any direct operation upon them<note n="(n)" place="bottom">Famine, acids, and cold, have all the ſame effects upon the fluids that the putrefying ſubſtances were ſuppoſed to have; but ſurely acids produce no putrefactive proceſs; neither can want act as poſitive matter; nor cold be ſuppoſed to produce any ſuch effect. In a word, any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is produced, ariſes only from the weakneſs of the heart and arteries, predominant in their extremities. They ceaſe to act; the fluids within ſtagnate, and, under the heat of the body, degenerate. This is the true cauſe of the corruption. And the remedies are not correctors of the corrupted maſs; but whatever invigorates the whole body, and conſequently the heart and arteries. Nothing can be more abſurd than to ſuppoſe that a glaſs or two of wine and water, a little bark, and ſo on, after being blended in the whole maſs of fluids, ſhould go to a portion of fluids in the extreme veſſels, even without the circulation, and, by mixing with it, change its qualities.</note>, produce not the ſymptom of corruption, and all the reſt of the ſymptoms, and the ſame ſtimulants, which remove the latter, remove the former. Nay, the ſuppoſed antiſeptics, ſuch as wine, Peruvian bark, acids,

It is true the excitement will riſe the moment the perſon is taken out of the bath; but ſtill ſomething is loſt. The very accumulation implies a reduced diſpoſition in it to be acted upon by ſtimuli. A perſon, who has abſtained from any one ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus for a given time, when it is again applied, will not bear near ſo much of it as he did formerly.

The ſtimulus of the articles of diet, not excluſive of the diffuſible ſtimuli, ſhould be denominated direct, becauſe it acts directly and immediately upon the excitability of the part to which it is applied.

Both ſtimuli are neceſſary, but chiefly the direct, by which animal food chiefly acts; and therefore is the vegetable the worſt and weakeſt ſort of aliment, becauſe it chiefly acts by its bulk of matter. A ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the indirect ſtimulus is neceſſary; hence the very general uſe of bread. But our vigour of mind and body depends upon the direct.</note>.</p>

                  <p>CXXX. Strong drink, and the diffuſible ſtimuli, are never neceſſary to young and ſtrong people, upon account of their rapid tendency to indirect debility, from their high ſtimulant power; nor are they even ſafe. But, in perſons who have been accuſtomed to them, in the <hi>caſe of thoſe who are</hi> advanced in age, and of thoſe who are weak from that or any other circumſtance, cold, watery, acid, or fermenting drink, has a great influence directly, and exceſs in the uſe of ſtrong drink indirectly, in producing aſthenic diatheſis.</p>
                  <p>υ If the diffuſible ſtimuli, after they have been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are too quickly withdrawn, they, in the ſame manner as the more durable, allow the excitability to accumulate, and direct debility to come on, and conſequently may be ſaid to produce aſthenic diatheſis. But aſthenic dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis is never the conſequence of withdrawing their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at leaſt worth ſpeaking of, but when that has been habitual. And all the hurtful effects which they have moſt untruly, to the great detriment of mankind, been ſaid ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than are now ſaid, to occaſion, ariſe not from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but from the want of knowledge how to manage them. And as this operation of diffuſible ſtimulus ought to be ſupported by that of a durable; at the ſame time, it muſt not be confounded with debilitating powers. What diſturbances, during the operation of opium, will not a breath of cold <hi>air,</hi> affecting the body, create? And how

eaſily, as well as quickly, are they all removed, by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully covering up the body?<note n="(l)" place="bottom">As there are caſes of indirect debility from an habitual abuſe of ſtrong drink, there are alſo others from a miſtaken or intemperate uſe of the diffuſible ſtimulus, particularly opium. Both of them require nicety and ſkill in the management of them for their cure; for which conſult Chap. XI. from par. CIII. to CX. The management is out of our preſent queſtion; but what affects that is, that, from this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, we can clearly find, as it was to be expected from the analogous operation of the other exciting powers, that the diffuſible ſtimuli, when their operation is carried to exceſs, will alſo produce an aſthenic diatheſis of the indirect kind.</note>.</p>

The quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the blood, at leaſt, as a cauſe, is of no effect, it is the quantity only that is. The quantity, by <hi>its action of</hi> diſtending the muſcular fibres of the veſſels, acts with a conſtant impulſe<note n="(m)" place="bottom">The blood by its quantity diſtends the muſcular fibres of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; that diſtention ſtimulates the excitability in the fibres, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces excitement, commonly called their irritability; thus excited, the fibres contract; the contraction of each portion ſends the wave onward to another portion: when the wave has paſſed any given portion of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, its fibres again relax, and make way for the next, which is puſhed along in the ſame manner. In this way the circulation goes on in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes while life remains; contraction and relaxation conſtantly alternate; the former propelling the wave before the latter opens to receive the next. But the veſſel may be in different ſtates with reſpect to its power of either contracting or relaxing. When it is weak, which every part of the vaſcular ſyſtem is as often as all the reſt of the ſyſtem is weak, both the contraction and relaxation of each portion of veſſel is imperfect. The contraction from its ſmallneſs, and the relaxation from its being more owing to the paſſive ſtate of the ſimple, than the active ſtate of the living, fibres, leave betwixt them a large diameter upon the whole. But, in a vigorous, or ſthenic, ſtate of the whole ſyſtem in general, and of that of the veſſels in particular, the contractions are ſtrong and forcible, and the relaxations active and in conſent with the contractions. Hence the diameter of each portion of veſſel is diminiſhed upon the whole, and while the quantity of the blood is at the ſame time encreaſed, the action and re-action are great; the blood diſtends with mechanical, the veſſels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with vital energy; the mutual effect of both upon the excitability is conſiderable; all is activity, all is force, and theſe are in exact proportion to their cauſe over all the ſthenic diatheſis. This ſtate of the veſſel, in ſo far as it reſpects the muſcular fibres, is its tone; in ſo far as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects them as ſimple ſolids, its denſity. It is a ſthenic ſtate of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, oppoſed to the aſthenic firſt deſcribed, which is diſtinguiſhed by the epithets of atony and laxity; which, however, oppoſed to tone and den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity are only relative terms, employed for convenience, not abſolute: like the term cold, uſed for diminiſhed heat, they only ſignify a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of tone and denſity.</note>.

The effect of diſtention<note n="(o)" place="bottom">that we have been deſcribing,</note> is encreaſed by the velocity of the blood, both as ariſing from other ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and eſpecially from that motion of the body which its own muſcles perform, a motion, which, by compreſſing the veins, carries the blood more quickly back to the heart.</p>
                  <p>CXXXIII. Nothing is more effectual than theſe two <hi>laſt mentioned ſtimuli,</hi> in producing ſthenic diatheſis, and the diſeaſes depending upon it. Thoſe diſeaſes are violent in proportion to the over proportion of the blood, and the rapidity of the force with which it flows; a fact, that is proved by all the exciting powers, all the ſymptoms of thoſe diſeaſes, and, eſpecially, the pulſe of the arteries;
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:022373_0082_0FB86DB7BA9158E0"/>
it is alſo proved by the great efficacy of bleeding, purging, abſtinence from food, and reſt, in the cure of the diſeaſe<note n="(p)" place="bottom">Relief from bleeding and other evacuations is certainly a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the cauſe of the diſeaſe being ſo far owing to an over-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of blood; and reſt is as good for the proof of agitation of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels being concerned in the cauſe: beſides, exerciſe is otherwiſe a noted cauſe of quickneſs of the pulſe: and the hurtful powers and ſymptoms are equally deciſive.</note>.</p>

So great a penury of blood is the principal origin of bleeding diſeaſes; which never happen but in the aſthenic ſtate. The ſame <hi>penury of blood</hi> acts in ſuch a manner, and chiefly affects its own veſſels, becauſe, according to a law ſo often mentioned, its debilitating energy chiefly falls upon them. In ſthenic diſeaſes, that have advanced to their height, or a little beyond it, a few drops of blood from the noſe, or a dropping of blood from the ſame, or any other part, demonſtrate only a prediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to indirect debility, but not an eſtabliſhment of

Did they eat and digeſt ſo completely, as that there was any reaſon for ſuppoſing their veſſels were filled with blood? No; long before the arrival of the diſeaſe their eating was puny, and conſidering the kind of matter they made uſe of, to wit, vegetable, it was not to be ſuppoſed more beneficial from its quality than its quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. What was the idea to be gathered from their ſymptoms, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the pulſe? The pulſe had all the marks of an aſthenic one; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weak, ſmall, and quick, like that of a new-born infant. What was the ſtate of their habit? Was it vigorous and robuſt? It was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; ſoft, delicate; the habit lax; a falling off in fleſh, with weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over the whole ſyſtem, and total loſs of appetite. What were the remedies employed to remove this ſuppoſed offspring of plethora? Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, repeated without end; other evacuations with the ſame freedom, and vegetable food in a fluid form, and a horizontal poſture, with their head lower than their body and under-extremities. Miſerable are the reſources of ignorance, and contemptible their execution! Fill a rigid tube full of water, open at both ends, and the fluid, no doubt, will run out at the end which is moſt below an exact horizontal poſition. But that is not the caſe with the fluids in living veſſels. The excitement, diſtinguiſhing them from all rigid inanimate tubes, counteracts the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of gravity, while its living ſtate remains: In proportion to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of which, the ſides of the veſſel will embrace their column of flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids, and prevent the flowing out of the fluids, in proportion to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of excitement; and before the gravity can act, the excitement muſt be extinguiſhed, and the living ſyſtem reduced to a lumpiſh maſs of dead matter. It is the latter, that enables them to produce that effect. And, therefore, bleeding diſcharges can never happen, either in health or ſthenic diatheſis, unleſs in that very high degree of it that approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to indirect debility, and even then, only in the forced, ſcanty, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſcribed in the text; whereas, after the eſtabliſhment of indirect debility, or in the caſe of direct, the great diſcharges only can happen, and that without force, in great plenty, but ſtill ſhort of what would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ψ. Thus it is not an exceſs in the quantity of blood, but laxity and atony from its defiency, that upholds the affair of bleeding diſcharges; which proceed <hi>in their courſe,</hi> not with <hi>any</hi> effort<note n="(r)" place="bottom">or active impulſe,</note>, but a diminution of tone: They are all aſthenic, and the aſthenic diatheſis, as far as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon them, conſiſts in direct debility.</p>

in thinking, by waſting the excitability, ends in indirect debility; or that deficient, weak, vacant ſtate of mind, uncapable of keeping up a train, which produces the ſame hurtful effect by direct debility. This faulty ſtate of the mind contributes greatly to weaken <hi>the ſyſtem</hi>

                  <p>CXL. Violent paſſions of mind, as great anger, keen grief, unbridled joy, going to ſuch a pitch as to deſtroy excitability, have the ſame effect as exceſſive thinking, and admit of all the ſame reaſoning.</p>
                  <p>CXLI. A force of paſſion riſing to the height of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting the excitability, induces that aſthenic diatheſis, which is occaſioned by indirect debility, and diſeaſes of that ſtamp.

                  <p>CXLII. On the contrary, when there is a deficiency of paſſion, as in melancholy, grief, fear, terror, deſpair, which are only lower degrees of joy, aſſurance, and hope, and imply no more than a diminution of exciting paſſions, not emotions <hi>of a nature</hi> oppoſite to thoſe, and poſitive; their tendency is to produce the aſthenic diatheſis, which depends upon direct debility.

Thoſe emotions are exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in drinking, dancing, in agreeable entertainments where the eye is dazzled with the ſplendour of the diſhes, of the company, and of all the objects around.</p>
                  <p>CXLIV. The energy of the ſame <hi>exerciſe of the ſenſes,</hi> when it is exceſſive, and carries the effects, juſt now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, too far, produces indirect debility.

The effect of the air<note n="(l)" place="bottom">upon the human body,</note>, independent of its qualities, as they are called, or its properties, and its uſe in ſupporting reſpiration, is leſs obvious to obſervation<note n="(m)" place="bottom">than the other powers that have been ſpoken of,</note>; at the ſame time it cannot be doubted, that its application to the whole ſurface of the body is a ſtimulus not to be diſpenſed with. The air is ſeldom applied in a pure ſtate: it is commonly blended with foreign matters that diminiſh its force of ſtimulus; and, while its ſalutary ſtimulus depends upon its purity, at the ſame time it is uncertain whether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver its purity goes ſo far as to ſtimulate in exceſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by produce ſthenic diatheſis. The baloons, lately invented, by which men get above the clouds, would ſerve excellently to throw light upon that matter, if it were not for the cold <hi>that</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="unknown:022373_0091_0FB86DD0A2C8DC88"/>
accompanies this progreſs. Be that as it may; ſince we never live in the pureſt air, and yet live commodiouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, it is, therefore, credible, that too pure an air has a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to ſtimulate in exceſs, and, therefore, produce ſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic diatheſis.</p>
                  <p>CXLVI. But, as nothing is more uſual than impurity of air, and every impurity diminiſhes its ſtimulus, a very impure air, or air blended with impure matters, without doubt debilitates, and produces aſthenic diatheſis. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, impure air is a frequent cauſe of typhus, as is evident from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ate of thoſe who died in the black hole of Calcutta. Whether ever the air, from an exceſs of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, produces aſthenic diatheſis, is the more doubtful, that, as has been ſaid, it is as yet undecided whether it produces ſthenic diatheſis or now.</p>
                  <p>Ε. Contagious matter, in ſo far as it may have any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to produce general diſeaſes, <hi>in</hi> one form produces ſthenic, in another aſthenic diſeaſes, and, therefore, acts like the ordinary hurtful powers of either ſort, and admits of all the ſame reaſoning. But, in ſo far as it only occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the eruption, without making any change in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement, it is to be referred to the local diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Ζ. To poiſons, if they act as general ſtimulants, all the reaſoning that has been employed with reſpect to the other hurtful powers, will apply. It is not, however, likely that they are general ſtimulants.</p>
                  <p>CXLVII. It is ſeldom from the ſeparate, almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways from the united operation of all the powers, that both the diatheſis, whether as remaining <hi>within the range</hi> of prediſpoſition, or riſing to the degree of actual morbid ſtate are produced, and from no inherent power in the ſyſtem.</p>

               <p>CXLVIII.

               <p>CXLIX. The cauſe of the aſthenic diatheſis ariſing from the ſame ſource, is, in conſequence of the debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hurtful powers, too little excitement of the living ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem every where, <hi>with the effect of</hi> impairing all the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſturbing ſome, giving a falſe appearance of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing others, but always debilitating<note n="(a)" place="bottom">It muſt now appear to the reader, to what ſimplicity the hitherto conjectural, incoherent, erroneous, myſterious, and enigmatical art of phyſic, is now reduced. It has been demonſtrated, that there are only two forms of diſeaſes, that the deviation from the ſtate of health, in which the morbid ſtate conſiſts, is not either repletion or inanition, or changes in the qualities of the fluids, whether of an acid or alkaline nature, or the introduction of foreign matters into the ſyſtem, or a change of figure of the extreme particles, or a diſproportion in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of the blood, or an encreaſe or decreaſe of the power of the heart and veſſels as regulating the circulation, or a rational principle governing the actions of the body, or an alternation in the extreme par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles as being of too large or too ſmall a ſize, or an alteration of the pores, as being too narrow or too capacious, or a conſtriction of the ſuperficial veſſels from cold, or a ſpaſm of them producing a reaction, as it is called, of the heart and interior veſſels, or any thing that any perſon has yet thought of reſpecting the cauſe and nature of morbid ſtate. On the contrary, it has been proved that health and diſeaſe are the ſame ſtate depending upon the ſame cauſe, that is, excitement, varying only in degree; and that the powers producing both are the ſame, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times acting with proper degree of force, at other times either with too much or too little; that the whole and ſole province of a phyſician, is not to look for morbid ſtates and remedies which have no exiſtence, but to conſider the deviation of excitement from the healthy ſtandard, in order to remove it by the proper means. The reaſoning part of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, it is expected, the reader will find irreprehenſible and unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and the practical part, from the aſtoniſhing cures that have upon innumerable occaſions been effected, will ever ſtand in ſupport of the truth and utility, as well as ſimplicity of the whole.</note>.</p>

               <p>CLII. How far the intellectual faculty, and the force of paſſion, are encreaſed, will be learned from a compariſon of them in this diatheſis, in good health, in the ſecond form of diſeaſes and prediſpoſition to it. In this way it is that the functions are firſt encreaſed.</p>

               <head>The Sthenic Diatheſis illuſtrated by an explanation of its Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.</head>
               <p>CLIII. The encreaſe of <hi>the force of</hi> the ſenſes, of the motions, of the intellectual faculty, and of the paſſions, depends upon the encreaſe of excitement in every one of their organs, among other actions, quickening the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the blood <hi>through them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>CLIV. The coming on of every ſthenic diſeaſe is announced by a ſhivering. It depends upon a diminiſhed perſpiration, by means of the diatheſis being <hi>exquiſitely</hi> ſtrong in the extreme veſſels of the ſkin. The ſame is the
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:022373_0095_0FB86DD678428AC8"/>
explanation to be given of the ſenſe of cold, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accompanies the ſhivering; and the ſame is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the dryneſs of the ſkin.</p>
               <p>CLV. In the ſame diſeaſes, the pulſe is ſtronger, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and fuller, and ſomewhat more frequent, than <hi>in its</hi> ſound <hi>ſtate.</hi> Its fulneſs and hardneſs is owing to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king animal food plentifully during the prediſpoſition. The force and frequency is occaſioned by the ſame and any other ſtimulus, as that of ſtrong drink; that of the diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible kind, and that of exerciſe, whether corporeal or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal: Nay all the ſtimulant hurtful powers are participant of the ſame effect.</p>
               <p>CLVI. If, in the progreſs of the diſeaſe, the pulſe ſometimes becomes weaker, ſofter, and quicker, that is a bad ſign, and occaſioned either by the debilitating plan of cure being puſhed beyond the proper bounds: or, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a neglect of that ſort of cure, it may be owing to ſome debility induced by the exceſs of excitement. The former <hi>of theſe</hi> is direct, the latter indirect debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; both to be avoided.</p>
               <p>CLVII. The complexion in the veſſels, which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a conſequence of a previous appearance of paleneſs, and great quantity of ſecreted fluids, is occaſioned by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion of blood, in conſequence of an exceſſive ſthenic diatheſis obſtructing the perſpiration. The ſame is the cauſe of the head-ach and pains in different parts. For, as the head-ach ſo quickly and eaſily yields to bleeding, it is, therefore, ſeldom to be ſuſpected of being owing to inflammation within the head. And <hi>the reaſon for ſo think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſtrengthened by this further circumſtance,</hi> that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation ariſing in general diſeaſes always affects an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part, as far as that fact has been enquired into<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Vide above, CXIII.</note>.</p>
               <p>CLVIII. The delirium alſo, that ſometimes ariſes in a violent ſtate of diſeaſe, is not to be imputed to inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:022373_0096_0FB86A5D6DF0C1E8"/>
and for the ſame reaſon; for it yields ſo much to bleeding and other evacuations, that there is no reaſon for ſuſpecting inflammation within the head. That abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of blood in the veſſels, diſtending theſe to exceſs, is the cauſe of the whole affair, is proved on the one hand by the redneſs of the face, implying ſuch abundance, and on the other by bleeding, removing the diſeaſe at once.</p>
               <p>CLIX. Thirſt and heat, which are alſo remarkable ſymptoms in ſthenic diſeaſes, depend upon the ſthenic dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis in the extreme veſſels of the fauces and ſkin; <hi>the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> ſo obſtructing the veſſels as not to allow a return of perſpiration, but to ſuffer, however, the blood to paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very neighbourhood of the ends of the veſſels, and, by means of the ſuppreſſion of the perſpiration, to accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, under the cuticle, the heat generated in the ſyſtem. Thus, in the throat, from an affection of the ends of the veſſels, the ſaliva and other fluids, by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ree <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>low of which the throat is lubricated, and freed from that ſenſe of dryneſs, which is called thirſt, are now confined<note n="(b)" place="bottom">and prevented to flow out,</note>, and thereby produce thirſt.</p>
               <p>CLX. Hoarſeneſs, cough, and expectoration, which are ſometimes obſerved in ſthenic diſeaſes, commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and ſucceed to each other in the following order. There is firſt often a hoarſeneſs, then a dry cough, then a cough with expectoration. The cauſe of the hoarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dry cough is an obſtruction of the exhalents and mucous veſſels, which terminate in the bronchia, ſtill occaſioned by a violent ſthenic diatheſis, and prevented from tranſmitting their contents to lubicrate the air-veſſels<note n="(c)" place="bottom">The bronchia are the diviſions of the wind-pipe running through the ſubſtance of the lungs, and blended with the blood-veſſels. In the ſubſtance of the lungs, beſides theſe two ſets of veſſels, the air-veſſels and blood-veſſels, there are likewiſe exhalants, ſmall arteries, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous glands, coming off from the extremities of the red arteries. The wind-pipe is covered with the latter; and the great quantity of mucus thrown up from the lungs, often in perfect health, and in innumerable caſes, both of ſthenic and aſthenic general diſeaſe, ſufficiently proves the exiſtence of the ſource from which they flow.</note>, ſo as that hoarſeneſs may be removed, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:022373_0097_0FB86A61C4D59838"/>
proceed with freedom. Again, the expectora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>next</hi> freely made, becauſe the diatheſis, being now diminiſhed, and allowing the ends of the veſſels to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed, and the fluids to be poured out in abundance upon the air-veſſels, is the occaſion of the fluids producing a commotion of the excitability over this whole organ, and by the convulſive motion, which is called cough, of being themſelves thrown out.</p>
               <p>CLXI. As the greater freedom of expectoration now implies an abatement of the diatheſis; ſo too great a flow and too long a continuance of it ſhows, that the diatheſis is now ruſhing in the aſthenic <hi>ſtate,</hi> either from indirect debility, as when the diſeaſe, in its progreſs, has much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted the excitability, or from direct debility as when the plan of cure, proper <hi>in kind,</hi> has been puſhed beyond the bounds.</p>
               <p>CLXII. Thoſe ſame ſymptoms<note n="(d)" place="bottom">mentioned juſt now,</note>, while they ſtop ſhort of the range of direct debility, or are not yet chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the indirect, are occaſioned by heat, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtimulates in exceſs, and removed by cold and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever acts as a weakening power.</p>
               <p>CLXIII. Paleneſs, ſhriveling of the ſkin, clearneſs of the urine, and bound belly, which chiefly happen about the beginning of the diſeaſe, ariſe from a degree of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atheſis, ſhutting up the ends of the veſſels in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that either nothing is excreted, or the thiner part, as in the urine, only eſcapes. The cure of the affection of the urine, of the obſtructed perſpiration and coſtiveneſs,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:022373_0098_0FB86A6484ED8538"/>
ſhows that the diatheſis is now gradually abating, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe becoming mild, and now upon the eve of being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly removed by emetics, purgatives, and ſudorifics, and the uſe of other debilitating remedies.</p>
               <p>CLXIV. In ſthenic diſeaſes, when they are gentle, the appetite is often not much diminiſhed, and oftener more food can be taken than is ſerviceable. But, unleſs the lighteſt vegetable matter only, and that in the form of watery potion, or in a fluid form, be given, every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of it will do harm.</p>
               <p>CLXV. But, when either from indulgence in food of a rich nature, or from employing a ſtimulant plan of cure, or from the diſeaſe having, from the beginning, ariſen from very violent, hurtful powers, and now attained its higheſt degree of violence; in any, or all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, both the other bad ſymptoms, mentioned above, break out directly, and the violent diſorders of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, or an accute pain of the thorax, ſhow themſelves indirectly.</p>
               <p>CLXVI. In a violent diatheſis, therefore, where there is little appetite for food, but a very great deſire for drink; with the latter the patient is by all means to be gratified; but the former ſhould be avoided, as producing loathing, ſickneſs at ſtomach, and vomiting, Thoſe ſymptoms are not uſually of long duration, unleſs when the diatheſis is now going, or actually gone, into the aſthenic ſtate by the means that have been mentioned above<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Vide laſt paragraph and a few immediately preceding it.</note>, and, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the other ſymptoms by the proper debilitating plan of cure, they go off; but when the ſtomach ſickneſs and vomiting are urgent, and begin now to be a little more obſtinate, and of a little more duration, one may know that they ſtill remain ſhort of the change into indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect debility, <hi>by the following marks:</hi> if the pulſe ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:022373_0099_0FB86A6611A08708"/>
moderation in its frequency, and does not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of its fullneſs and force; if artificial vomiting and purging diminiſh the morbid vomiting, and, in one word, if the debilitating plan of cure ſtill ſucceeds. But, it will then at laſt be underſtood that the diſeaſe is altogether changed, and its cauſe converted into the oppoſite, when thoſe ſymptoms every day encreaſe; when the pulſe becomes weaker and weaker; when gripes in the inteſtines, and liquid ſtools, are ſuperadded to the ſymptoms that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the ſtomach, and when the antiſthenic or debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting plan of cure is now of evident detriment<note n="(g)" place="bottom">See above, CIX.</note>.</p>
               <p>CLXVII. While the ſame ſymptoms<note n="(h)" place="bottom">of the ſtomach and inteſtines,</note> 
                  <hi>ſtill</hi> ſtop ſhort of indirect debility, the exceſſive excitement in the ſtomach being of quicker tendency to indirect debility there than any where elſe, upon account of the ſtomach's great ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and the force of the more powerful ſtimuli being chiefly exerted upon it, produces ſymptoms of diſturbance<note n="(i)" place="bottom">See above, LIV.</note>; for the moſt powerful ſtimuli, and thoſe that are ſignally powerful in producing ſthenic diatheſis<note n="(k)" place="bottom">as high ſeaſoned animal food, wine, ſpirituous drink, cordials, and the whole train of high diffuſible ſtimuli, ſome of theſe, as meat and wine, have no effect upon the external ſurface, or any other part: others, as ſome of the condiments, ſuch as muſtard and ſtrong ſpirits, and above all the diffuſible ſtimulants, as aether, camphor, and opium in a liquid form, do act upon the ſecond, and by their application to it ſupport their own internal uſe.

               <p>CLXVIII. The inflammation, which accompanies the phlegmaſiae<note n="(p)" place="bottom">diſeaſes that are ſthenic and accompanied with an inflammation of a part, as a portion of the lungs, the throat, ſome of the joints, and in which, as has been formerly ſaid, the inflammation is like any other ſymptom, an effect of the cauſe of the diſeaſe, not itſelf the cauſe,</note>, occupies an external part, as far as its nature has been yet aſcertained. And the reaſon of that is, that heat, which is the moſt powerful hurtful agent in thoſe diſeaſes, either alone, or alternating with cold, or
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:022373_0102_0FB86A6A927E0628"/>
ſucceeding to it, has much more power externally, where it is directly applied, than internally, where the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is nearly ſtationary, in ſtimulating, and, therefore, raiſing the general diatheſis, to the degree of actual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation in a part. Hence the throat, hence the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent joints, hence the face, where the form of inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is different<note n="(q)" place="bottom">as when the inflammation of eryſipelas appears there;</note>, hence the lungs, which are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an external part, becauſe the air has direct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to them, <hi>all theſe</hi> are affected with inflammation in preference to other parts. And, beſides the energy of the exciting hurtful power, juſt now mentioned, there is in the part, that is to undergo the inflammation, a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſibility<note n="(r)" place="bottom">See above, LIII. λ.</note> than in others, or a more accumulated exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability; by means of which it happens, that, of the parts that have been mentioned, <hi>ſometimes</hi> one, <hi>ſometimes</hi> another is affected, more than the reſt<note n="(s)" place="bottom">In the inflammatory ſore-throat the inflammation affects the throat, which is alſo ſometimes the ſeat of an eryſipelatus inflammation. In eryſipelas, ſometimes the face, ſometimes one of the legs, ſometimes the ear, ſometimes the temples are inflamed. I have frequently been affected with an eryſipelas, that begins with an acute inflammation and pain in one ear, which is thickened to four times its uſual dimenſion; from that it ſpreads over the whole hairy-ſcalp till it reaches the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the ear in the oppoſite ſide, never, however, affecting that ear; this progreſs has been ſometimes from the right to the left, ſometimes from the latter to the former, in proportion as either had been more expoſed than the other to heat, or the alternation of heat with cold, or their ſucceſſion to each other. This diſeaſe is ſthenic, but in a mild degree, and to be removed by coolneſs, cold water, low vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fluid diet, and a ſlight purge. It was once greatly aggravated by wine, ſpirituous drink, and the high diffuſible ſtimuli.

                     </gap>oſum. To theſe phlegmaſiae, accompanied with an inflammation of a part, depending upon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſe of the diſeaſe, and eſpecially upon the effect of temperature, may be added that which an inflammation in one of the ears accompanies, though this caſe is ſeldom admitted into the number of the phlegmaſiae. It is, indeed, ſometimes local, ariſing from local injuries, but is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly at others, a general diſeaſe, and to all intents and purpoſes a phlegmaſia.</note>. To this <hi>conſideration
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:022373_0103_0FB86A70AE430C50"/>
of the</hi> cauſe, it is to be added, that which ever of the parts we have mentioned has been injured, in whatever manner it may have undergone the inflammation peculiar to the phlegmaſiae, that part, in every after attack of a new phlegmaſia, is in more danger of being inflamed than the reſt. This is the true cauſe of the recurrence of ſome of the phlegmaſiae, as the inflammatory ſore throat, and rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm<note n="(t)" place="bottom">Those two diſeaſes, in young vigorous perſons, are very liable to be exceedingly troubleſome by the frequency of their occurrence. In the younger part of my life the violence in degree, and frequency of recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, of the ſthenic inflammatory ſore throat, was very diſtreſſing, as the leaſt variation of the external temperature, ſuperadded to a full nouriſhing diet, not without the ſtimulus of a chearful glaſs, was ready to renew, not only the inflammation, but the whole phaenomena of the diſeaſe. The ſame thing I have often obſerved in the frequent recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of rheumatiſm in perſons of the ſame age and habit, perhaps, with ſome difference of temperament. But it is to be obſerved, that, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the advance of life, and diminution of vigour, both theſe diſeaſes become much leſs frequent, and much leſs violent. Nor is any thing more common than their giving way at this time to a very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite diſeaſe, the gout, which depends upon a ſuperaddition of direct debility to the indirect, that laid the foundation of it. I am pretty cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my inflammatory fore throat, or eryſipelas, never happened ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly, nor without an addition of ſtimulant power, to thoſe that produce that diſeaſe, in conſequence of carrying to ſome exceſs the plan of cure ſuited to the removal or prevention of the gout.</note>. Peripneumony is a diſeaſe leſs frequent than any of the reſt of this form, becauſe "the ſeat of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation"
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:022373_0104_0FB86A73E0047CC8"/>
is exempted from many ſtimuli, liable to produce ſthenic diatheſis with its accompanying inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</p>
               <p>Η. As the inflammatory fever, catarrh, the gentle ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox, are unattended by inflammation (unleſs that in the laſt a local inflammation from a local cauſe, quite different from that which makes our preſent ſubject, takes place), and as the inflammation in peripneumony, violent eryſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas, and ſimilar other caſes of great violence, is found the higheſt in degree; for that reaſon the concluſion is, that the degree of inflammation, which is a ſymptom of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſthenic diſeaſes, is proportioned to the degree of the ſthenic diatheſis<note n="(u)" place="bottom">It ſhall by and by be ſhewed, that this ſort of inflammation is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a part of the general diatheſis, ſomewhat higher in degree than any other part, but far ſhort of the degree conſtituted by the whole general affection.</note>.</p>
               <p>CLXIX. The inflammation, in this caſe, is nothing elſe, but a ſtate of the inflamed part of a common nature with <hi>that in</hi> the reſt of the body. And as the inflammation is produced by a greater degree of excitement in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, than in any other equal part; ſo, before the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe comes on, of which the inflammation is only a part or ſymptom, the excitement of that part is underſtood to be proportionally greater than in any other part<note n="(x)" place="bottom">See above, par. L. and LI. Suppoſe the excitement in every part of the ſyſtem to be 45 at ſome point in the period of the prediſpoſition, and 54 in the part to be inflamed; after the coming on of the diſeaſe the ſame proportion will hold; when the excitement has now mounted up to 60, the excitement of a part will be underſtood to have gone to 69; keeping up ſtill the ſame proportion. But this 9 degrees of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter excitement in a part, comes far ſhort of the ſum total of excitement in all the parts affected with the general ſthenic diatheſis; that you may ſuppoſe 3000: and then the concluſion will be, that the general ſthenic diatheſis conſiſts in a ſum total of morbid affection, as 3000; while the inflammation of the part is only an affection of 3 degrees of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement.</note>.</p>

CLXX. This inflammation, which for the ſake of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is to be called general ſthenic inflammation, ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from another, which is a local af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ariſing from local hurtful powers, and depending upon a fault in the organ, or a ſolution of continuity<note n="(y)" place="bottom">Solution of continuity in all its forms, whether as being the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of puncturing, cutting, bruiſing, compreſſion, eroſion from acrid matter, or from heat, or cold, is always followed by an inflammation, which, when it goes on briſkly, and needs to have its violence reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould be called as is expreſſed in the next paragraph.</note>.</p>
               <p>CLXXI. To this the term of ſthenic local inflammation applies. The general always depends upon ſthenic diathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, is a ſymptom or part of it, never precedes it, always ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to it ſooner or later, ariſes from the ſame hurtful powers<note n="(b)" place="bottom">which produce the other ſymptoms,</note>, and is reduced by the ſame remedies. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction to which, the local affection, as it ariſes from local injury, producing a ſolution of continuity or deran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the texture of the part; ſo, if the labouring part is not very ſenſible, the affection extends no further. In the caſe of a part being endued with a high degree of ſenſibility, ſuppoſe the ſtomach, the inteſtines, among the internal parts; among the external, the tender ſubſtance under the nails; <hi>in theſe caſes,</hi> the effect of the inflammation is propagated over the whole ſyſtem, and in conſequence of an affection of all the veſſels, excites a tumult every where. The ſame local ſthenic inflammation, whether it be fixed in the part, or from its propagation, gives more general diſturbance, yields to no remedies, but thoſe that act upon the affected part firſt, and heal the ſolution of continuity<note n="(c)" place="bottom">or reparation of united ſubſtance,</note>. Let it ſuffice to have ſaid ſo much at preſent upon theſe inflammations, for the ſake of <hi>eſtabliſhing neceſſary</hi> diſtinctions as more is afterwards to be ſaid upon the local, in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place. There are as many inflammations ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:022373_0106_0FB86A7681012808"/>
univerſal and local, to be more fully explained in that part of our work where the proper order requires it.</p>
               <p>CLXXII. Inflammation, alſo, as often as it affects a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part, produces ſymptoms of diſturbance. Whether ever the general ſthenic inflammation affects the brain and its membranes, is hitherto not aſcertained<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Phrenitis has been thought, and commonly even defined, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the brain; an opinion that, however univerſal, ſeems to be liable to much doubt: nay, there are many reaſons for adopting an appoſite one, as will appear from the reaſoning in this paragraph of the text.</note>. And it is more probable, that the commotion of the head, and other diſturbing ſymptoms of phrenitis, do not depend upon inflammation, as the following phaenomena ſeem to ſhow: <hi>The</hi> firſt <hi>of thoſe is,</hi> the caſe by which the cure is affected, the whole tumult of <hi>ſymptoms</hi> readily yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bleeding, purging, and other aſthenic<note n="(e)" place="bottom">what are commonly called antiphlogiſtic, we call debilitating.</note> remedies; and, it not being very credible, that the effect of actual inflammation in a part ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſo neceſſary to life, could be ſo eaſily effaced. Then <hi>another argument againſt the ſame opinion is, that</hi> there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s no certain proof, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, of the exiſtence of inflammation <hi>during the diſeaſe.</hi> Next, analogy makes for the ſame concluſion <hi>which we are diſpoſed to draw;</hi> for, as it has been ſaid above, general inflammation does not ariſe internally in any general ſthenic diſeaſes<note n="(f)" place="bottom">See above, par. CXIII.</note>; on the contrary, as often as it occurs, it is always in an external part<note n="(g)" place="bottom">It was long an opinion, that the inflammation in rheumatiſm might be transferred to an internal part, as the ſtomach; but that, alſo, is now laid aſide, and all the caſes where there could be the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any ſuch transference, have been found to be caſes of the gout, or ſome analagous diſeaſe of debility.</note>. Hay, all the ſymptoms are ſuch as ariſe from the general ſthenic hurt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> powers,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:022373_0107_0FB86A784FFAC648"/>
and that, alſo, yield to the general antiſthenic remedies, and in proportion to their degree.</p>
               <p>CLXXIII. The ſame<note n="(h)" place="bottom">that we have aſſigned as the caſe of phrenitic affection alſo</note> is the cauſe of head-ach, redneſs of the eye, as well as of delirium.</p>
               <p>CLXXIV. There is, however, no reaſon to doubt, but that inflammation is the cauſe of that diſturbance, which happens to the lungs <hi>in peripneumony.</hi> To the part where the pain is <hi>felt</hi> externally, whatever part of the thorax it is, an actual inflammation is oppoſed internally. And, as the inflammation is proportioned to the degree of general ſthenic diatheſis, and never happens but in a high degree of that diatheſis; ſo that the pain is proportioned to the degree of inflammation<note n="(i)" place="bottom">The inflammation was ſuppoſed a chief and primary circumſtance, and its cauſe and ſeat, the cauſe and ſeat of the whole diſeaſe; while the general ſthenic diatheſis, and all the ſymptoms depending on it, was ſuppoſed the offspring of the inflammation. But the truth is, in every reſpect, the reverſe of this account. The general ſthenic diatheſis is the effect of the general exciting hurtful powers. As the effect of theſe, in a leſſer degree, it exiſts during the prediſpoſition, and before the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the diſeaſe; and, after the diſeaſe is come on, it ſubſiſts, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as ſuch, for, one, two, or three days, as afterwards, when the ſign of the inflammation, the pain, makes its appearance. It is only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of it, that induces the latter: and it is not to be cured by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of throwing any thing into the inflamed part, there being no ſuch thing to be found in nature, but by the ſeveral means of removing the common cauſe, that is, evacuant and other debilitating remedies. Thoſe, while, at the ſame time, they remove the other ſymptoms, by alſo removing the diſeaſe, prove that the common cauſe of the whole is the general diatheſis. The inflammation, therefore, like every other the cauſe of the general diſorder, is a conſequence, inſtead of being ſymptom.</note>; and the ſtate of the pulſe muſt be eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by paying a due regard to its cauſe. In <hi>the caſe of</hi> an high diatheſis, and high degree of inflammation, its effect, the pain, ſeated in ſome part of the thorax, ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:022373_0108_0FB86A7DDE29E0C8"/>
the ſternum, ſometimes nigh the nipples, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times farther back on either ſide, ſometimes in the back between or above the ſhoulders, is acute and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and the pulſe very hard and ſtrong. When the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atheſis, and the part of it <hi>we call</hi> inflammation, is leſs, the pain is leſs acute, more dull, and eaſier to be borne; the pulſe is<note n="(k)" place="bottom">not ſoft and yielding, according to the common notion, but</note> 
                  <hi>ſtill</hi> hard and ſtrong, though leſs ſo than in the other caſe. Afterwards, in the progreſs of the diſeaſe, the pain abaſes, becomes dull, the reſpiration which had been much diſturbed by it, becomes more eaſy and free. The pulſe now, which formerly was only leſs hard becomes truly <hi>poſitively</hi> ſoft, and that in proportion to the degree of indirect debility, occaſioned by a neglect of the proper plan of cure; or in proportion to the production of direct debility from the antiſthenic or debilitating plan of cure having been puſhed too far. But the hardneſs of the pulſe, and increaſe of pain, is never to be imputed to the inflammation being ſeated in the membrane; nor is the ſoftneſs of the former, and dullneſs of the latter, to <hi>be attributed</hi> to its occupying the ſoft parenchymatous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance<note n="(l)" place="bottom">Such, however, and many other diſtinctions, equally falſe, fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, and miſleading in the practice, have been at all times univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received by ſyſtematic, and lately by noſological writers.</note>, it being impoſſible that an inflammation, if it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied either of thoſe parts, ſhould not affect the next points of the veſſels in the other. The cauſe, therefore, of thoſe ſymptoms that has here been aſſigned, muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>CLXXV. The puſtles, which accompany certain ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henic diſeaſes, ariſe from a contagion, taken into the body, diffuſed over the whole, and, in paſſing out of it, detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along with the perſpirable fluid, under the ſcarf-ſkin. The cauſe of the diſtention, and, therefore, of the great number of puſtles, is the ſthenic diatheſis, taking place
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:022373_0109_0FB86A80484CFC18"/>
in a high degree over the whole body, but in a <hi>ſtill</hi> higher in the veſſels of the ſkin, for the reaſons formerly<note n="(m)" place="bottom">See above, par. CXIII. and CXIV.</note> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. In which operation the muſcular fibres of the veſſel, becauſes they are as much encreaſed in denſity, in ſo far as they are conſidered as ſimple ſolids, as they receive an encreaſe of tone, in ſo far as they are conſidered as living<note n="(n)" place="bottom">See Chap. V.</note>, are, on that account, ſo ſhortened, as not ſufficiently to tranſmit the <hi>imperceptible</hi> vapour of the perſpirable fluid. All the ſthenic hurtful powers have a tendency to produce this effect, but heat, in a degree within its ſtimulant range and ſhort of indirect debility, more than any of them. The ſame is the cauſe of coſtiveneſs.</p>
               <p>Θ Sthenic diſeaſes are often followed by debility, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times direct, at other times indirect, as is exemplified in the change of peripneumony into hydrothorax, the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of which is evident from what has formerly been ſaid.</p>

               <p>CLXXVIII. SHIVERING is not unuſual at the commencement of aſthenic diſeaſes of any conſiderable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity; and that, as often as its cauſe, a very deficient perſpiration takes place. In this caſe the cauſe of the deficiency is, from the weakneſs of the whole ſyſtem, that weakneſs of the heart and arteries, in conſequence of which they propel their fluids every where with difficulty, <hi>and</hi> in their extremities with <hi>ſtill</hi> more difficulty, or ſcarce at all.

explanation to be given of the ſenſe of cold, when it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies the ſhivering.</p>
               <p>CLXXIX. In aſthenic affections the pulſe is weak, ſoft, ſmall, and very quick. The ſoftneſs, when it can be perceived for the ſmallneſs, as well as the ſmallneſs, is occaſioned by an under-proportion of blood, ariſing, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the period of prediſpoſition, from a ſcantineſs of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal food, and an exceſs in the uſe of vegetable; or from a deficiency of aliment upon the whole, whether from the one or other ſource. The cauſe of the weakneſs and very great quickneſs of the pulſe is the ſame deficiency of nouriſhment, as well as of all the ſtimuli, ſuch as that of ſtrong drink, that of mental or corporeal exerciſe, and an under-proportion of blood.</p>

               <p>CLXXXIII. Neither in general, is delirium, and for the ſame reaſon,<note n="(g)" place="bottom">that has been juſt now mentioned,</note> to be imputed to inflammation. It is, on the contrary, to be attributed to a ſcantineſs of blood, and a deficiency of other ſtimuli.

Phyſicians, hitherto, had no diſtinct notion of a variety of inflammations; and had ſcarce any idea of any inflammation, but ſuch a one as was to be treated with bleeding and evacuation; nay, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, when they had no reaſon to ſuſpect inflammation at all, the mere circumſtance of pain was, in their eſtimation of it, ſufficient to warrant a profuſion of bleeding without end. But, the truth is, that pain may not not only ariſe from an inflammation, which they had no idea of, and which was to be cured by ſtimulants, but it ariſes from ſpaſms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, and even from emptineſs.</note>.</p>

In conſequence of the former, the throat being not ſufficiently lubricated with a due quantity of its reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective fluids, is ſcorched with thirſt. The effect of the latter is, that, the perſpirable fluid being detained under the cuticle, together with it the heat, which in a free perſpiration uſually goes off in waſte into the air, and remains nearly of the ſame degree, is accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and encreaſes. But the encreaſe of heat depends not on the ſtate of excitement, or, as it is commonly called, the principle of life, ſince it happens both in the ſthenic diatheſis, and, likewiſe in indirect, as well as direct, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. But the weakneſs of the veſſels on the ſurface of the body, under which the throat, and whatever part is acceſſible to air, is comprehended, is a part of the debility of the heart and arteries; the latter a part of that of the whole ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>CLXXXV. This aſthenic thirſt, which is a much more frequent and more violent affection than the ſthenic, is preceded by loſs of appetite; the loſs of appetite by loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of food; it is ſucceeded by ſickneſs at ſtomach, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, often an acute pain of the ſtomach, and other troubleſome ſymptoms; the explanation of which we next proceed to.</p>

Want of appetite, loathing of food<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Theſe ſymptoms of want of appetite, loathing of food, thirſt, ſickneſs at ſtomach, vomiting, and acute pain of the ſtomach, as well as thoſe that follow to the CXCV. and from that to the CXCVIII. form a chain of ſymptoms depending upon encreaſing debility, which, inſtead of being different in kind, are all connected by an uniform operation of nature. And they furniſh an inſtructive inſtance of the erroneous mode of judging of the nature of ſymptoms, and morbid affections, which has been ſo prevalent in all ſyſtems of phyſic, that we are yet acquainted with. However different in appearance, they are not only ſimilar, but all unite in forming one and the ſame kind of diſeaſe, one and the ſame morbid affection: which is proved by their ariſing all from one and the ſame ſet of hurtful powers, to wit, debilitating; and by their being cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by one and the ſame ſet of remedies, to wit, ſtimulant. The former powers may vary in degree, but they are all debilitating; and the latter may alſo act with different degrees of force, but they are all ſtimulant.

Beſides theſe ſucceſſive actions, the muſcular ſubſtance of the ſtomach is ſo conſtructed as to be provided with fibres, the motion of which, when the ſtomach is full, is upward and downward; when empty downward only. All theſe motions give the alimentary matter the mechanical agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation neceſſary to promote its mixture.</note>, and the excretion of a

This change is chiefly effected by the gaſtric fluid, to which, perhaps, a certain relation that the other fluids bear to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limentary matter in this living organ, contributes. Another means of promoting the ſolution that goes on in this proceſs is the heat of the ſtomach.</note> and to the effect of both a certain emptineſs of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is neceſſary. But none of theſe circumſtances can take place in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of debility. The fibres do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with force; the extreme veſſels do not pour out their fluids; the matter of food, formerly taken in, is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and properly mixed, and in that ſtate thrown out of the ſtomach; but continues in a great meaſure unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and indiſſolved. Hence it is, that there is no appetite for food, and in a higher degree of it, that a loathing takes place.</p>
               <p>CLXXXVII. In the ſame manner has thirſt been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained<note n="(n)" place="bottom">See par. CLXXXIV.</note>; and in the ſame manner is the ſickneſs at ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which is a higher degree <hi>of affection</hi> from the ſame cauſe; for when there is ſtrength and vigour, ſenſation is moſt agreeable in every part of the ſyſtem, as well as in theſtomach and neighbouring parts.</p>
               <p>CLXXXVIII. With reſpect to vomiting; it is the chief of all theſe affections, that we have been ſpeaking of: for to ſuch a height has the atony and laxity of the fibres <hi>in the ſtomach</hi> gone, when it comes on; to ſuch a degree has the collection of crude naſty matters proceeded, and the diſtention of the ſtomach from theſe laſt, and air let looſe <hi>is become ſo exquiſite,</hi> that the fibres are oppreſſed, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

perform their motion from the upper to the lower part, which is commonly called the periſtaltic motion. And, as in every caſe, both of health and diſeaſe, the tendency of that motion is always from the ſtimulus in an oppoſite direction; downward when the ſtimulus proceeds from the mouth, and upwards when it comes from the ſtomach; in that way it is that the crudities, and air let looſe, of which mention has been made, acting as a local ſtimulus, direct all the motion, that they excite, towards the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts <hi>of the canal.</hi> This inverted motion, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature, can never be agreeable; and hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the arrival of the vomiting, ſtomach-ſickneſs, ariſes; which when it continues for any time, muſt be violent, becauſe the local ſtimulus rouſes the muſcular fibres into violent and irregular motions.</p>
               <p>CLXXXIX. The cauſe of pain in the ſtomach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, and other parts, both internal and external, under a ſthenic diatheſis, is ſpaſm. Spaſm in any internal cavity, that is, in the organs of involuntary motion, is, by means of the debility in common <hi>to its ſeat</hi> with the whole body, a relaxation and atony of the fibres, and together with that a diſtending matter; what conſtitutes that matter in the ſtomach is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The effect of this matter in the diſtention that it gives, does not ſo much depend upon itſelf as upon the lax ſtate of the fibres di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended by it; for the fibres, when ſtrong and vigorous, eaſily repel the diſtending power, which overpowers them in this ſtate: but the relaxed fibres, of which we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yield more and more, <hi>and that</hi> in proportion to the urgent force exerted on them, till loſing all power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

During ſuch action and ſuffering, the ſenſible fibres undergo a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain violence; and hence the pain.

But its true cauſe is the laxity of the fibres, and their atony from the general debility, yielding to the diſtending force of the matter, and thereby loſing their tone and denſity more and more; while vomiting therefore encreaſes, ſtimulating removes the diſeaſe.</note>. In this way wine, aromatics, and volatile al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali, and, above all the reſt, the various forms of opium, diſlodge from its ſeat <hi>all</hi> ſuch <hi>hurtful</hi> matter without either vomiting or purging, and that without any difficulty, and in a very ſhort ſpace of time.</p>
               <p>CXC. The pain, which is ſo often troubleſome in the external parts of the body, alſo depends upon ſpaſm, but not with the conjunction of a diſtending matter. And a power takes the place of it, which is not to be referred to any matter, but to a certain effort of the will in moving a limb<note n="(p)" place="bottom">See LVIII,</note>. By means of that the ſpaſm is excited in the ſame manner as in the other caſe, by diſtention, and often with the moſt exquiſite pain, where, as the effect is the ſame, that is, a ſpaſm, ariſing from debility, and to be removed

by reſtoring the ſtrength; for that reaſon the cauſe alſo muſt be the ſame, and be reducible to debility, together with ſomething that altogether reſembles debility, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs a power equal to it. In this way <hi>of reaſoning</hi>
                  <note n="(q)" place="bottom">a way of reaſoning never made uſe of in medicine before, but which runs through, and influences moſt of the propoſitions in this work. It is further to be obſerved, that, upon no occaſion, can we ever arrive at an adequate knowledge of abſtract cauſes; that the eagerneſs of mankind to ruſh into wild and fanciful explanations of them, without any regard to real phaenomena of nature, has been the cauſe of all the falſe phaenomena that ever appeared in the world, and that the only ſure and faithful guide to the ſtudy of cauſes is a cautious and painful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of the effects and phaenomena of nature that proceed from them.

               <p>CXCI. There is another pain, leſs confined to the ſame part, more diffuſed, and equally troubleſome, which is not ſupported by diſtention but by another local ſtimulus, equally ariſing from debility, of equal <hi>tendency</hi> to encreaſe the debility, and, by its debilitating operation, together with the other ſymptoms of debility, haſtening on death. This pain ariſes from a concentrated acid, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times predominent in the alimentary canal, when under the influence of great debility, of which cholera chiefly is a clear example; but, beſides that, all the affections of the alimentary canal, that are accompained with vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a looſe belly, are more or leſs examples of it.</p>
               <p>CXCII. This acid is not the primary cauſe, but only a ſymptom ſupervening upon the diſeaſe, already formed in conſequence of the debility, its proper cauſe, and now fully eſtabliſhed, ariſing from the ſame ſource as the other ſymptoms, and to be removed by the ſame remedies.
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:022373_0119_0FB86A96C7FF41A8"/>
When the ſame acid has ariſen, it continues to encreaſe all debility that happens to be predominant, either in the firſt paſſages, or in the reſt of the body: And, while it exerts that operation over the whole body, its influence is in the part where it exiſts, and where the diminution of the force of the diſeaſe is moſt wanted.</p>
               <p>CXCIII. But, though it be itſelf in that way the offspring of debility, and of a tendency to create further debility, in the ſame manner as ſpaſm has been ſaid <hi>to be;</hi> ſtill there is not, either for the ſake of changing, or throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it out of the body, occaſion for any other indication of cure: For, as it has its riſe at firſt from a general cauſe, ſo upon that it all along depends; whatever has the effect of overcoming the other ſymptoms, has alſo that of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming this. For that purpoſe it is, that, as in the caſe of ſpaſm, ſtimulants, not emetics, nor purgatives, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other debilitating powers, are required.</p>
               <p>CXCIV. As the acid, which has been mentioned, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the pain in the internal parts, or in the organs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary motion; ſo in the external parts, or organs of voluntary motion, it is occaſioned by ſomething that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the ſame effect as the acid, that depends upon the will, and acts in conjuction with the convulſive <hi>ſtate;</hi> and, as in the caſe of ſpaſm, there is no matter that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds with the diſtending, ſo in this there is none to correſpond with that which produces the pain. Nay, as the ſpaſmodic caſe is repreſented by any cramp of the muſcles, ſo is the convulſive by any convulſion, but, above all, by epilepſy. Finally, as in the former, the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning from known effect to unknown cauſe proves the ſameneſs of the external and internal caſe, it equally proves their ſameneſs in the latter<note n="(r)" place="bottom">All this reaſoning with reſpect to ſpaſm and convulſion, ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be the ſame, and only a part in the whole, a link in the chain of the other aſthenic affections, which have been mentioned, as well as the facts and arguments next to be brought, which will ſerve to prove all that follow to be alſo the ſame, is, of itſelf, of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to mankind. In a particular manner, the whole tribe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the alimentary canal, and almoſt all thoſe of children, all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but the contagious eruptive ones, are both explained, and their principle of cure aſcertained, with geometrical exactneſs, Here, then, at once is a diſcovery, upon ſcientific principles, of the true nature, and certain cure, of more than one-half of the diſeaſes of the human race; the method of cure ariſing from this doctrine having never failed in any of them, and never ſucceeded upon a contrary plan, the debilitating and evacuant, ſo univerſally recommended by the authority of the ſchools. The ſpaſms and convulſions of the external parts, unleſs when immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in degree, are equally certainly removed by the new method, and even epilepſy and tetanus yield to it.</note>.</p>

CXCV. The ſimple courſe <hi>of morbid affection</hi> from its ſlighteſt to its moſt violent degree (to take a review of the ſubjects from the place where we ſet out), is, that begins with loſs of appetite, and is brought on by want of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of food and of other ſtimli, or by an overproportion of ſtimuli, and proceeds through all the intermediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to ſpaſmodic or convulſive pain. For the reaſons lately aſſigned, there is firſt no appetite for food, and if the patient perſeveres in the debilitating proceſs of cure, and food is not adminiſtered, ſuch, ſuppoſe, as can be taken in the form of ſoups, a loathing of it follows. By-and-by, if ſtill nothing is uſed to produce ſtimulant effect, thirſt will come on; there will be the moſt keen deſire for the moſt debilitating power, cold water, which will be preferred to the greateſt dainties, and will be greedily ſwallowed<note n="(s)" place="bottom">When this aſthenic thirſt comes on, it is the higheſt luxury in nature to be allowed a free indulgence in the uſe of cold water, which is always hurtful in proportion to the degree of its coldneſs.</note>.

perhaps, <hi>in ſome caſes</hi> a third, ruſhes inſtantly on to vomiting. When the affection riſes a little higher, during the vomiting a violent pain ariſes in the ſtomach, <hi>giving a ſenſation</hi> as if there were a bar of iron in it, forcibly ſtretching and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it acroſs<note n="(t)" place="bottom">A lady, after nurſing her twelfth child for ſeven months, was found by her huſband, a phyſician well acquainted with the new doctrine, very low ſpirited one evening. She was of a delicate, thin, exhauſted habit, and had been ſubject often before, towards the end of her peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of nurſing, to loſs of appetite, colic, dejection of ſpirit, and as often cured by removing the child from her breaſt, and putting her upon a rich ſtimulant regimen. Her friend and phyſician perceiving the cauſe of her dejection, ordered two of their daughters, who happened to be grown up, to ſit up and rock the child in the cradle all night, and alſo watch their mother to adminiſter to her the things he had ordered. They themſelves went to bed. The reader ſhould have been informed, that ſuch was this lady's lowneſs of ſpirits, that tears burſted from her eyes upon hearing the ſudden order for the weaning of the infant. He fell aſleep; but in an hour's time was wakened by the noiſe of a moſt violent vomiting ſhe had fallen into. She had a pain in her ſtomach at the ſame time, from her account of which the deſcription above was taken. All this had been occaſioned by her applying the child's mouth to her nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note>. When the affection becomes ſtill more ſevere, and the cauſe <hi>of the diſeaſe</hi> ſtill higher in degree, every kind of torture is undergone; an head-ach comes on with a feeling of ſtrokes like thoſe given by an hammer. Theſe ſymptoms of diſturbance are communicated to the alimentary canal, for the moſt part not immediately, but in conſequence of the diſeaſe remaining, and lurking, with an intervention of intervals of deceitful reſpite.

This happens in the warm countries, as the ſouthern parts of Europe, and eſpecially in the torrid zone, whether in Aſia, Africa, or America.</note>, the colic<note n="(x)" place="bottom">The colic has been commonly treated by purging and bleeding, and low diet; but in no inſtance has that treatment of it been ſucceſsful. Opiates were particularly forbidden upon the ſuppoſition of their conſtipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the belly; but the truth is, that the colic, as well as diarrhoea (which has been ſuppoſed a diſeaſe of an oppoſite nature, from the ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of looſeneſs of the belly, and coſtiveneſs to each other), are the ſame kind of affection, only differing in degree.

Sometimes in the progreſs of the ſame diſeaſe, eſpecially when treated only by evacuation and bleeding, a portion of gut is inſinuated into the cavity of the next portion. This is called in the art Volvulus, or Intus Suſceptio. The quick and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual cure of colic before the ſymptoms of volvulus make their appearance, is a good proof that the latter is induced by the purgative medicines, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to clear away the obſtructing cauſe, acting with ſuch relaxing effect, and urgent violence, as to turn back the inverted motion in one part, while it continues inverted in all the reſt, and particularly in the portion next to it.

This remark applies likewiſe to worms, for the cure of which no bounds were ſet to the uſe of purgatives, upon the idea of clearing away the ſtuff in which this vermin neſtled; a practice not ſo judicious as that of ſome fooliſh boys, who place their ſucceſs in bird-catching upon the chance of bringing down the neſts from the top of high trees, by throwing ſticks and ſtones at them; while other boys, both more ſenſible and alert, climb up and ſeize every one of them. The cauſe of worms is the ſame as that of all the other diſeaſes we have ſpoken of, differing in nothing but in what they all differ from each other, mere degree. Debility over all, but prevalent in the alimentary canal, occaſions a weakneſs both in all the other functions, and particularly in that of the periſtaltic motion. This ſtate implies a ſimilar weakneſs in the veſſels that pour their fluids into that cavity; their weakneſs implies an enlargement of their diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that enlargement an encreaſe of the quantity of fluids thrown in, without any encreaſed impulſe behind. Hence ariſes a colluvies of matter, which the encreaſed periſtaltic motion is not able to throw off. The colluvies is encreaſed by the uſe of vegetable matter and fruit taken into the ſtomach, and depoſiting their feculent parts on the inteſtines. The indication of cure is not to encreaſe either the general, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar part of the cauſe, by purging, and the uſe of other debilitating pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but to ſtrengthen the whole living ſyſtem; and eſpecially the inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinal canal, by the whole round of ſtimulant remedies diffuſible or dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. To this treatment the tabes and atrophia will yield in a few days, or even hours; the worms in as many weeks. And they are all increaſed by the common plan of cure, as univerſal experience has proved to a demonſtration.</note>,

As the cauſe of the diſeaſe proceeds, and the exciting hurtful powers prove more urgent; the external parts are drawn into conſent, and now the organs of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motion are affected. Sometimes the legs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the arms, and other parts, <hi>differently upon different occaſions,</hi> are tortured with cramps; ſometimes the thorax variouſly all round; ſometimes the ſhoulders, ſometimes the ſides, ſometimes the back, ſometimes the neck, are affected with pain, from which pains no part of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body is exempted, <hi>and</hi> the region of the lungs, of the liver, and of the ſtomach, are eſpecially liable to them. The ſmart pains that affect thoſe parts, and are ſuppoſed to

proceed from internal inflammation, are, in reality, owing to ſpaſmodic or convulſive affection<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Endleſs have been the bleedings and other evacuations employed to remove thoſe painful affections, and as diſmal has been the effect of that method of cure. The univerſal rule, ſuggeſted by the principles, and confirmed by the practice of this new doctrine, is to invigorate the whole ſyſtem, and apply any diffuſible ſtimulus, particularly laudanum, to the pained parts. By that practice I know not one cure, of ſome hundreds, that either I or my pupils have performed, that has failed. The gout will ſometimes make its attack in this way. But whatever be the particular force of diſeaſe, with which they may ſeem to have any connection, the only diagnoſis here neceſſary is to be ſure that the true peripneumony is not the morbid ſtate. When that is out of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and whether the painful complaint be denominated baſtard peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pneumony or not, the only indication of cure is what has been juſt now mentioned. A young lady, with whom I am nearly and tenderly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, has been often affected with an acute pain in her right ſide, moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed and ſolitary, ſometimes accompanied with a certain numbneſs and ſenſeleſſneſs in her extremeties, commonly with l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The effectual method of cure is to apply rags dipped in ladanum, volatile alkali, or aether, and renew them as often as they become dry, and to ſupport her internally with durable and diffuſible ſtimuli, proportioned in kind and quantity to the exigenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the caſe. This method of cure of a morbid affection, that upon the contrary debilitating evacuant plan would be readily and quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into an incurable aſthenic diſeaſe, has always proved infallible in removing the attacks, which never after return but when ſhe has enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled herſelf by keeping the houſe too much, and neglecting air, exerciſe, and the uſe of the other diffuſible ſtimuli. Friction uſed over all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected parts, is alſo found uſeful in ſupporting the ſtimulant operation of all the other remedies. There is in the fens of Lincoln, where an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent phyſician, and follower of this doctrine, practiſes, a diſeaſe call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a baſtard peripneumony; in which, though it had always baffled all the efforts of the common evacuant practice, he never loſt a patient, by exerciſing the contrary one.</note>. That this is their true origin is proved by the renewal of ſtimuli, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the affections, often immediately, always in a ſhort time, and reproducing the healthy ſtate. It is proved by
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:022373_0126_0FB86AA6123B1188"/>
the unſucceſsfulneſs of the contrary method of cure, <hi>which proceeds</hi> upon bleeding, the various modes of purgation and abſtinence. Nay, what even makes more for the ſame concluſion, is, that, while abſtinence almoſt alone is often ſufficient to produce the pains, rich diet alſo alone has been ſufficient to remove them<note n="(b)" place="bottom">This I have often experienced in the caſe of the gout. Before dinner, when my ſtomach was empty, I have limped in going abroad to dine. But after having made that meal heartily, and taken a glaſs or two of wine, have returned with a perfect firm ſtep, and free from all feeling of pain and uneaſineſs.</note>.</p>
               <p>CXCVII. The ſame pains, ſometimes combined with enormous motion<note n="(c)" place="bottom">as in the convulſive kind ſo lately ſpoke of, where the enormity of motion is ſometimes external and in the organs of voluntary motion, ſometimes internal, as in cholera and ſo forth.</note> ſometimes without it<note n="(d)" place="bottom">as in the ſpaſmodic pains, head-ach, pains in the legs and ſoies, where there is an inability to perform the due motion.</note>, are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely free from inflammation. To diſtinguiſh them, then from the pains that flow from inflammation or a ſimilar o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin, the concourſe of <hi>accompanying</hi> ſymptoms muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to. Sthenic diatheſis points out <hi>that whatever</hi> pains <hi>occur</hi> are ſthenic; and the information received from the aſthenic diatheſis is, that the pains <hi>appearing in it are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipant of its nature</hi> and as certainly aſthenic. This remark is of deep application to diſeaſes of daily occurrence, and overturns the common practice. Even head-ach, which is ſo frequent an affection, is ten times to be removed by the ſtimulant plan, for once that the contrary anſwers<note n="(e)" place="bottom">The true reaſon for all this, and innumerable errors in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, is that the leaders in the profeſſion never underſtood any diatheſis but a ſthenic one, or any indication of cure but an aſthenic, to which they gave the name of an antiphlogiſtic, as they did that of phlogiſtic to the diatheſis. By his reformation of the erroneous plan of cure, that his cotemporaries, the Alexipharmacs, had introduced, in the ſmall-pox and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He left alſo the meaſles as he had found that diſeaſe, and all other general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which are much more in frequency than 97 out of the 100, or 97 to 3 of the ſthenic. Great men had need to be cautious, as the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency in them, not to ſay eſſential miſtakes, never fails to lead their followers, who are commonly ſervile imitators, and implicit believers, into capital error. If ever they attempt any thing of themſelves it is commonly to raiſe a crazy ſuperſtructure upon a falſe foundation, it is commonly to refine upon error ad infinitum.</note>.</p>

CXCVIII. Symptoms of diſturbance occur alſo in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenic diſeaſes as well as the ſthenic. Such a ſtate of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance takes place in the alimentary canal in the caſes of hyſteria, colic, dyſpepſy, and the gout. Thus in the alimentary canal, beſides the pains, mentioned above, a certain ſenſe of burning, anguiſh, contortion and direful torture, <hi>exhibit a ſet of appearances,</hi> formidable in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree, both to the patient and by-ſtanders, and which beget a ſuſpicion of their proceeding from inflammation as their cauſe. But thoſe affections have nothing to do with inflammation as their cauſe, and that they depend upon a ſtate of the part quite the reverſe, has been proved by the the ſtimulant method of curing them turning out ſucceſsful in every inſtance in which it has been tried<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Till this doctrine appeared, it was impoſſible to eraſe from the minds of phyſicians an impreſſion that had been deeply made there, that, nothing but the only inflammation, that they were acquainted with, could be the cauſe of ſuch pain and torture, as is deſcribed in the text. I have more than once experienced the whole concourſe, here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and have always found them to yield to the moſt ſtimulant method of cure, that I could contrive. I once laboured under this modification of aſthenic diſeaſe for no leſs than ten days, and was always able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it in two hours, and procure an interval of complete eaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief for the reſt of the day. The remedies employed were the whole round of diffuſible ſtimuli, as opiates in all their forms, camphor, muſk, volatile alkali, and aether, &amp;c. By theſe the functions for the time were completely reſtored. But their ſtimulant effect was no ſooner perfectly gone off, that is, after the interpoſition of a long ſleep, through the night, than the ſymptoms returned with a violence little ſhort of what it had been the day before. This was proof poſitive, that their nature was aſthenic, or conſiſting in debility; ſince they yielded to ſtimulant reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and that the debility was exquiſitely great, ſince it required ſo high a degree of ſtimulant operation to remove it. While that is the undoubted fact, there is a nicety with reſpect to proportion to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to in this caſe. It is a rule, that the degree of curative means, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the cure of ſthenic or aſthenic diſeaſes, ſhould be accommodated to the degree of the diſeaſed ſtate or degree of the cauſe. If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> little of the curative means is employed a proportional part of the diſeaſe will remain: if too much, the diſeaſe will be more than removed, that is, another ſtate which may be morbid in another extreme, may take place. Too much was once employed in this affection, and the effect was, that the diſeaſe was not eradicated till the tenth day of its courſe from the beginning.</note>. The ſame
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:022373_0128_0FB86AA9160A5198"/>
fact is confirmed by the uſe of wine, opium and other diffuſible ſtimuli. After that, and ſtill in conjunction with their uſe, animal ſoups, and next ſolid meat, and the uſual way of living, and guarding againſt debility, effectually re-eſtabliſh the healthy ſtate<note n="(g)" place="bottom">The rule here is, if indirect debility be the cauſe, to begin with a high degree of ſtimulant cure, and gradually reduce it to the ordinay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that is ſufficient for the healthy ſtate. And the caution is to be ſure of this gradual reduction, otherwiſe the indirect debility will be liable to return the moment the effect of the ſtimuli is gone off. By an attention of this kind a diſeaſe depending upon indirect debility may be cured in in the ſixth part of the time, that would be taken up by the cure, when the remedies are every day carried beyond the due bounds. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if the indirect debility be in the table the effect of an application of 71 degrees of exciting power inſtead of 40, that is to ſay, the excitement is worn down to 9 inſtead of being up at 40; it is evident, that an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of 71 degrees by way of remedies, will leave the diſeaſe where it was. Suppoſe only 65 degrees of ſtimulant power adminiſtered; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement will fall to 66 and the waſted excitability riſe to 15. Next day let only a degree of exciting power as 60 be applied; then the degree of excitement will be that number, and that of excitability 20. Five degrees of exciting power ſtill leſs will reduce the morbid excitement to 55, and raiſe the excitability to 25. And ſo on may the matter go, till the excitability is raiſed to 40 and the excitement reduced to the ſame number. But, if the reduction be much leſs by the day, the cure will be proportionally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lower. Nay, ſuch an error may be committed as to encreaſe the diſeaſe inſtead of reducing it, which will happen, as often as a degree of ſtimulant power is applied, which is more than equivalent to that which produced the diſeaſe. All this attention and caution is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the cure of aſthenic diſeaſes of indirect debility; while that of thoſe of direct debility is eaſy and ſimple, to wit, to give the ſtimulants in ſmall proportion and often repeated, till the diſeaſe is removed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, which may happen, you can gueſs the proportion, which may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to remove the diſeaſe at once, or, at leaſt, twice.</note>. This plan
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:022373_0129_0FB86AADF08B7D80"/>
of cure proves to a demonſtration, that thoſe affections are moſt foreign both from ſthenic inflammation and every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſthenic diatheſis; <hi>and,</hi> beſides the general ſthenic inflammation, not appearing to affect internal parts, it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords another argument againſt inflammation in this caſe being the cauſe<note n="(h)" place="bottom">See CLXXXII. and CLXXXIII. par. above.</note>.</p>

But theſe were words only, while in fact the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of treatment of both was the ſame, at leaſt, in kind; and ſcarcely different in degree. To whatever part of any ſyſtem of phyſic we turn our attention, we conſtantly ſee one mode of practice running through the whole, and that too, notwithſtanding of the ſuppoſed great number of diſeaſes, very limited. It turns all upon bleeding, other evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſtarving, and ſome other trifling directions under the title of regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

as typhomania and the ſtarting of the tendons; partly to plethora, either alone and pure, or together with it mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: All theſe without diſtinction are evidently owing to the ſame cauſe, upon which all aſthenic diſeaſes depend, that is debility. Which is proved by the debilitating hurtful powers, whether acting directly or indirectly, alone producing thoſe diſeaſes; and by the remedies, the whole action of which depends on ſtimulus, alone relieving or removing them. But it is in vain to impute apoplexy to plethora<note n="(m)" place="bottom">or an over proportion of blood, ſee above, CXXXI.</note>; as if at that time of life, when the body is nearly worn out and almoſt bloodleſs, that is, when the uſual <hi>degree</hi> of aliment is neither deſired, nor taken in nor digeſted, more blood could be produced than in the flower and vigour of human life. On the contrary, at the time when apoplexy comes on, in conſequence of indirect debility, induced by old age and exceſſive excitement in the mode of living, the ſolids are languid, the quantity of fluids deficient, as alſo their fountain, the blood. Epilepſy depends upon the ſame debility, and the ſame ſcantineſs of fluids, only that its debility is oftener of the direct kind. Fevers may depend upon indirect debility, as in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent ſmall-pox<note n="(n)" place="bottom">The confluent ſmall-pox, as depending upon a very high degree of debility, is ranked among the high fevers in the after part of this work, becauſe the ſcale is not regulated by the appellations given by phyſicians, or by any of their erroneous diſtinctions, but by ſtrict re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the degree of excitement. And for the ſame reaſon is the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent cholera marked nearly in the ſame place; becauſe the debility, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king place in it, is nearly equal in degree to the moſt ſinking febrile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; in a word, becauſe the ſame degree of debilitating power produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the ſame degree of ſtimulant operation, removes the diſeaſes ſo aſſorted</note>, or where drunkenneſs has been the principal hurtful power producing them, but at the ſame time their moſt frequent cauſe is direct debility. And in
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:022373_0132_0FB86AB4C9EA40F8"/>
all the caſes, that have been juſt now mentioned, debility is the primary cauſe and final termination both of all the reſt of the ſymptoms and of thoſe of diſturbance.</p>
               <p>CCI. To the ſymptoms of diſturbance ſometimes alſo belong the following that affect the head; great head-ach in fevers, imbecillity of the intellectual function, confuſion of thought, and delirium, <hi>the laſt</hi> often ſufficiently fierce, though occuring in the higheſt degrees of debility, and leading to efforts beyond the ſtrength. This ſtate often happens towards the end of a nervous fever, eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Inflammation is apprehended, blood is let, but directly from the head; bliſters, which are extreme unction in the art, are clapped on, ſilence and darkneſs are preſcribed, even the moſt gentle ſtimulants are forbid. In conſequence of the emptineſs of the ſtomach, as well as of the veſſels of the whole body, and of the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of languor from the want of many ſtimuli, vertigo is ſuperadded to delirium, and the patient, deprived of ſtrength, ſenſe and intellect, breaths out his laſt.</p>
               <p>CCII. But in this caſe there is either no inflammation, or, if there be, it is altogether of a different nature from the general ſthenic one. That it is not the latter, the unſucceſsfulneſs of the debilitating plan of cure, and the incredible ſucceſs of that which firſt ſtimulates, and after fills the veſſels, afford certain proof: And that it is not any other inflammation is evinced by the ſo ſudden reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of health. Now, as an impaired uſe, or confuſion of the intellectual faculty is, in a certain degree, always the conſequence of debility, whether ariſing from any other ſource, or from emptineſs, or a general inanition of the veſſels, <hi>and that too</hi> even in thoſe, who are otherwiſe ſound; where is the wonder if, in the higheſt degree of inanition, compatible with life, in the higheſt degree of diminution of excitement, ſcarcely leaving a ſhadow of

life, alſo the higheſt degree of failure in the intellectual function, that is, delirium, among other inſtances of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired function, ſhould take place. Nay this very fact is certain, and proved to a demonſtration. Thus famine, thus drinking water contrary to cuſtom, after a courſe of drinking to exceſs, or both eating and drinking with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, a gloomy ſtate of the animal ſpirits, grief, terror, deſpair, not only induce a temporary delirium, but frequently bring on downright madneſs. The ſame concluſion applies to any conſiderable loſs of blood. For how many perſons, after being wounded either in line of battle or on the highway, have never after, and often du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a long life time, come to the right uſe of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. To ſay nothing of contuſions, wounds and other injuries, by which the texture of the brain is injured, as belonging to local diſeaſes, of which we are to treat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; how does cold induce death? Is it not, amidſt a diminution of all the other fuctions, by a delirium pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding death? From theſe facts, of ſuch weight, both from their number and validity, and that bring forward all the powers in ſupport of the argument, it muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that both head-ach, and every failure of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual function, in every degree, and that higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſuch failure, delirium, depend not at all upon general ſthenic inflammation, the only <hi>inflammation</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto known; but ariſe from the higheſt deficiency, both of other ſtimuli, and of that, which depends upon a proper fulneſs in the veſſels, that is, debility. Debility then is the moſt frequent cauſe of the ſymptoms, that have been mentioned, as is proved by the reſtoration of health ſo quickly upon the new plan of cure.</p>

The meaning in both is, that, as certain parts of the ſyſtem have more excitability than other (LI.), ſo thoſe parts, which in the diſeaſed ſtate are more affected than any other, that is, are either more excited, as in ſthenic inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or leſs, as in aſthenic, than any other, keep up the ſame proportion of diſparity before the arrival of the diſeaſe, before the appearance of any of the ſymptoms, and while, as yet, nothing but mere prediſpoſition has taken place. The truth of this propoſition is eſtabliſhed by that of another ſo comprehenſive as to extend to the whole ſubject of life; which is, that over the whole living creation, throughout the univerſe, health, prediſpoſition to diſeaſe, and diſeaſe itſelf, are the ſame ſtate, only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in degree, (vid. par.

It is, however brought as an example, that in a ſeeming exſpiring debility, the higheſt degree of aſthenic diatheſis, there may be an univerſal ſthenic debility, that requires bleeding.

For, when the confluent ſmall-pox is eſtabliſhed, the puſtles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The remedies of the diſtinct ſmall-pox, and of its accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying eruption, are cold, and whatever, by evacuation or otherwiſe, debilitates. The remedies of the confluent diſeaſe, as well as of its accompanying eruption, are heat, remaining within the indirectly debilitating degree, and all the powers, which ſtimulate as quickly, and as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as poſſible, and conſequently, the moſt diffuſible.</p>
               <p>CCXVII. They differ beſides in this, that all the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful powers in the diſtinct caſe are ſthenic; all in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent aſthenic. And this difference equally applies to both diſeaſes, and both eruptions.</p>
               <p>CCXVIII. And as the ſthenic or diſtinct puſtles have a direct tendency <hi>to produce</hi> aſthenic inflammation, and ſthenic eruption; ſo the tendency of the aſthenic or confluent, is <hi>as</hi> directly to gangrene, ſphacelus, and death.</p>

That this is the caſe, is proved by their being no eruption during the period of prediſpoſition, when ſome vigour ſtill remains;

For, whether the ſuppreſſion of perſpiration be the conſequences of a very great degree of ſthenic diatheſis, or of an equal degree of ſthenic as in the preſent caſe; all the foreign matter, that ſhould be thrown out of the ſyſtem along with the perſpirable, is, together with it, detained, and ſo detained below the cuticle, by ſtagnating, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a more acrid nature, it produces local inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either of a ſthenic or aſthenic nature, in proportion to the different nature of each, or rather of the habit of the body.</p>

By this means the phlogiſtic diatheſis, chiefly ariſing from the ordinary powers, and in part, as it would ſeem, from the contagious matter, is prevented or removed; the great flow of the fluids to the ſurface checked; and the diameters of the perſpiratory, as well as of all the other veſſels, kept open and patulous. But it had been long a queſtion with me, whether this debilitating operation might not be carried to far. If it be certain, as it is, that extreme debility ſuppreſſes perſpiration, ſurely the proceſs puſhed near to that degree muſt endanger that event. This phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non happening to my child, ſolved the doubt that I had not yet decided, and it ſeemed to be in perfect conformity to the principles of this doctrine, to underſtand, that, as this child had been formerly weak, and, perhaps, ſtill retained ſome degree of that ſtate, the further weakening him by the preparatory management, for the better regulating this diſeaſe, had been carried too far.

On the contrary, I ordered the child ſpirit and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a little of an opiate, then reſtored the meals that had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, and brought him about to his perfect health (for the ſmall-pox gave no trouble) in twelve or ſixteen hours.</note>.</p>

CCXXI. Heat is not peculiar to ſthenic pyrexiae<note n="(o)" place="bottom">Pyrexia is the word for ſthenic diſeaſes affecting the pulſe, called febrile, or fevers, very improperly, while the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Nor is it ſo confined to thoſe, as not alſo to ariſe in all the degrees of prediſpoſition to thoſe diſeaſes, and in proportion to each degree<note n="(p)" place="bottom">That heat takes place in prediſpoſition, is a matter of daily obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Thus, when a perſon has no other ſymptom of diſeaſe, it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten remarked, ſometimes by himſelf, ſometimes by another, who may have happened to feel his hands, that he is certainly not quite well as his hands are hot. When this heat happens, either in the hands or feet, without any cauſe to account for it conſiſtently with health, it is a ſure prelude of diſeaſe, that is, a ſure mark of a conſiderable prediſpoſition to to diſcaſe: and the kind of diſeaſe, of which it is the harbinger, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener aſthenic than ſthenic.</note>. But the matter does not end here. The ſame heat diſtinguiſhes all aſthenic diſeaſes, whether fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile, which is a diſtinction without any good meaning, or not <hi>febrile,</hi> and alſo the prediſpoſitions to them all, and <hi>that</hi> in proportion to the degree of debility. There is not a more certain mark of a departing diſeaſe, whether ſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic or aſthenic, that <hi>a return of</hi> that temperature, which is commonly called cool, to diſtinguiſh it from morbid heat.</p>
               <p>CCXXII. The heat is then only natural, when neither diatheſis is preſent. From that <hi>point</hi> it encreaſes, through all the degrees of encreaſed excitement, till indirect debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, from exceſs of ſtimulus, is eſtabliſhed; and it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes in proportion to the degree of excitement, rendering the perſpiratory veſſels always leſs and leſs patulous. It alſo encreaſes through all the degrees of diminiſhed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:022373_0145_0FB86AD14096BDD8"/>
to certain boundaries, which are fixed by a cauſe by-and-by to be explained, <hi>and encreaſes</hi> in proportion to the degree of decreaſing excitement, though the latter all along renders the perſpiratory veſſels more patulous; and, thereby, among other effects, diminiſhes the motion, both of all the veſſels, and particularly of the perſpiratory.</p>
               <p>CCXXIII. When the heat has now been the greateſt it can be, and the debility encreaſed in proportion, at laſt in the extremities, and afterwards gradually in the reſt of the body, cold, which is always a bad ſign, ſucceeds to it. In the progreſs of the debility motion begins to be very languid, firſt in the extreme veſſels of the extremities of the limbs, and then to be deſtroyed altogether. Hence, as heat, whether in due proportion, or in exceſs, depends upon the motion of the blood and other fluids, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in due proportion, in exceſs, or to a certain extent, in a deficient degree; if, therefore, the heat is either no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or next to nothing, as in the preſent caſe, the effect, together with the cauſe, by an univerſal law in nature, ceaſes. The ſame thing happens in both extremes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citability, that is, of exceſſive abundance in direct, and of nearly a ceſſation of it, in indirect debility; and ſo much more <hi>readily will this happen,</hi> becauſe, whatever be its ſource, debility is always the ſame.</p>
               <p>CCXXIV. Becauſe the excitement in ſthenic diſeaſes is for the moſt part much and equally encreaſed over the whole body; the heat, on that account, is alſo equally diffuſed over the whole. From which fact no caſes are excepted, but thoſe, in which, in certain parts, as the ſtomach, under a ſtrong diſpoſition to vomiting, and, therefore in danger of falling into indirect debility, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect debility either actually takes place, from the diſeaſe proceeding with an exceſſive force of ſtimulus; or direct debility comes on, when the debilitating plan of cure has been puſhed beyond the rule. But, ſo long as the ſthenic
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:022373_0146_0FB86AD2C6B940A0"/>
diatheſis is vigorous, and ſupports a high force of excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>CCXXV. The ſame thing happens in moderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Accordingly, through the whole courſe of prediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and in thoſe diſeaſes, where the matter has not gone ſo far as almoſt a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The effect of ceſſation of motion has been explained<note n="(q)" place="bottom">See above, CCXXIII.</note>, But, before that happens, if any ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of heat occurs in diſeaſes of moderate debility, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Not only in the gout, but alſo in other affections both of direct and indirect debility, a burning heat, chiefly diſtreſſing to the ſoles of the feet, torments the patient, eſpecially in walking. That that ariſes from debility, checking perſpiration, is proved by fatigue, cold, and other debilitating powers proving hurtful to it; and heat, reſt, and other ſtimulant powers, giving it eaſe.</p>
               <p>CCXXVI. It remains now, that it be explained, how too great excitement, in high ſthenic diſeaſes, impairs ſome functions, but never, by debilitating operation; and how too ſmall an excitement in violent aſthenic diſeaſes, gives an appearance of encreaſing ſome functions, but always a falſe one.</p>

Above that there is more force through all the ſteps of prediſpoſition, but with leſs durability and ſteadineſs; which is exemplified by the compariſon of hard labourers, who at the ſame time are well ſupported, and gentlemen, who live well, without uſing a proportionable degree of labour or exerciſe to prevent a luxuriant ſtate of vigour. When two ſuch perſons are ſubjected to a comparative trial of their vigour in any exertion, the former will be found to go through the exertion with more ſteadineſs, and to hold out longer and better than the other; even though his firſt efforts may have been inferior in force to thoſe of his antagoniſt. And the reaſon is evident; a moderate and proper degree of vigour, will bear an addition of ſtimulant operation longer than a higher degree of it approaching to morbid ſtate; becauſe the diſtance of the excitement from indirect debility, which puts an end to excitement, is greater in the former than in the latter caſe. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the well-ſupported labourer is 30 before he can reach an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe that leads up to 70; whereas that of the gentleman is perhaps not more than 20. The exertion in the ſtruggle adds ſtimulus; which will be better borne by him who has leaſt and yet enough, than by him who has more, but of a ſuperfluous degree, and more liable to run into the extreme of a ceſſation of excitement. The effect of the exertion in the labourer will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But the ſame ſtimulus of exertion in the gentleman will have the effect of firſt mounting up to 60, and by and by to 70, where the excitement begins to ceaſe.</note>, is evident from this double proof;

Beſides the affection of the muſcles, that has been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is ſcarce one muſcle in the whole body, free from one degree or other of the affection. Further, there is a moſt painful feeling over all, but eſpecially in the parts moſt affected.

The part of it called lock-jaw is frequently a ſymptom in fevers. But the diſeaſe is more frequent in warmer countries than this, as in the ſouth of Europe, where the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of heat is liable to run into indirect debility. It is moſt frequent of all in the Torrid Zone, where indirect debility is the moſt conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant on heat.

Hence no bounds were ſet to their emolient relaxing meaſures. Such were bleeding, other evacuations, and warm bathing.

What reaſon would a podagric have to thank any one, who ſhould convert the gout in him upon any violent attack, into a fatal dropſy? That ſort of treatment is not curing a diſeaſe but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing it, and even that to death. The convulſive ſymptoms of an aſthenic may paſs away; but the aſthenic remains. You may ceaſe to call it epilepſy; but dropſy ſtill ſhows that the cauſe of the diſeaſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, nay is prodigiouſly encreaſed. This fatal miſtake of an encreaſe of the diſeaſe upon the whole, for the cure of an inferior degree of it, proceeds from an improper uſe of directly debilitating powers in place of the proper ſtimulant ones. But there are caſes, where the laſt, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried too far, produce the ſame fatal miſtake. This in peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to get rid of the hard pulſe, and the acute pungent pain (ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, CLXXIV. and the notes), the bleedings are carried ſo far as to produce a fatal hydrothorax, or dropſy of the cheſt.</note>.</p>

The healthy and vigorous ſtate of motion conſiſts not in the degree of contraction, but within certain degree of that, in the well proportioned alternation between contraction and relaxation; of which we have proof indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this mode of motion being beſt performed in that middle ſtate of vigour, that intervenes betwixt the extreme of the healthy, or moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encreaſed vigour, and the other extreme of direct and indirect debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The encreaſe of vigour and excitement keep pace to a certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, even through ſome degrees of morbid exceſs of the latter: but a period, and that ſhort of indirect debility, arrives, as in peripneumony, where the excitement is encreaſed beyond the healthy ſtate, and muſt be reduced in order to reſtore the due healthy vigour. There are other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as that of mania, or ſthenic inſanity, where the conjoined encreaſe of vigour and excitement will ſtill go further. But in every caſe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of vigour, ſtill judging of it from its effects in the healthy ſtate, ceaſes before that of excitement; and, perhaps, we may make a ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards finding the boundary, by obſerving, that the greater the ſum total of exceſs of exciting power is, the ſooner does the point arrive, beyond which the vigour does not proceed. In peripneumony it ceaſes at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain period of the diſeaſe, where the ſalutary effect of bleeding and other debilitating means ſhows that the encreaſe of excitement is ſtill going on. But here the ſum total of excitement, conſidering the ſtate of all the other functions, is greater than in mania, where the function chiefly encreaſed in vigour is only that of voluntary motion, while all the functions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary motion are very little affected. From this inveſtigation we can clearly diſcern, that every encreaſe of excitement leads to a morbid encreaſe of vigour, and that there is, ſomewhere or other, a point in the ſcale of encreaſing excitement, and below the point of indirect debility, where the vigour is no further encreaſed; and this inference ariſes with reſpect to the practice, that we ſhould be very obſervant of both facts, as pointing out a very material diſtinction in the indications of cure; that in indirect debility being to ſtimulate, while that at the ceſſation of vigour is to continue to debilitate till the ſum total of exceſſive vigour be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the proper and healthy. The inability to the performance of motion in peripneumony is an inſtance of the latter; that of the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſame diſeaſe from exceſs of debilitating cure is an inſtance of the former.</note>

This falſe notion was carried to its moſt ridiculous pitch in the doctrine of ſympathy, and not rendered much more decent, after the word conſent of parts came to be ſubſtituted in its place. Thus, the common expreſſions were the ſympathy or conſent of the ſtomach with the head, of the ſtomach with the face, of the ſtomach with the external ſurface, of the latter with the internal, and particularly with the inteſtines, of the excretions with each other, of the feet with the kidneys, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And muſt we, <hi>giving up our fundamental principle after ſo complete an eſtabliſhment of it,</hi> allow, that the excitability over the whole body is not the ſame uniform, undivided property over all the ſyſtem; that the powers acting upon it are not the ſame, finally that matter can be created out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note n="(a)" place="bottom">It has been proved in the IVth chapter, Part. I. that the excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is one uniform, undivided property over all, and that, in whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver part of its ſeat it is acted upon, that action extends inſtantaneouſly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all; that though ſome parts, differently upon different occaſions, may be more acted upon than any other, equal in ſize and nervous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that that is only in ſo inſignificant a proportion as to have no effect in conſtituting an inequality of action in the ſyſtem. Again the force of the powers that act is a given force, being either weak, in due proportion, or exceſſive, or weak again from ultimate exceſs. Their effect then upon the ſyſtem, which receives their action in every degree in which it is communicated, and that with the utmoſt exactneſs, muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be the ſame, that is, either direct debility, health, ſthenic diatheſis or indirect debility. To apply this to the preſent caſe, the ſtomach can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be healthy, or under a prediſpoſition to ſthenic ſtate, and there by take in and digeſt, with the help of the other digeſtive organs, too much of the matter, from which blood is made; while the perſpiratory veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are too weak to perform their function of throwing off their excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious matter. On the contrary, the ſtate of the ſtomach muſt run through the whole living ſyſtem. If it can perform its functions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, or in whatever degree it performs it, all the other organs of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, the upper part of the inteſtines, biliary veſſels, the lacteals, the veins betwixt their common trunk and the heart, the heart through all its cavities, the whole arterial ſyſtem, and the colourleſs terminations of that ſyſtem, whether exhalant of glandular, and the excretory orifices of theſe, the inhalants, and all the venous blood returned by the arteries; laſtly, all the excretories upon the external and internal ſurface, all theſe will perform their functions in the ſame degree as the ſtomach whether properly or imperfectly. To promote the moſt perfect health all the exciting powers muſt be applied, each in its due proportion. And the want of any one or more many make ſome odds, which is inſignificant to this point. If a perſon has not had his uſual exerciſe a chearful glaſs will prepare him for ſleep. For want of the ſame exerciſe the appetite will be impaired, but ſo is the function of perſpiration. Too much exerciſe under heat will impair the appetite, but it alſo impairs the perſpiration after a perſon gets into a ſtate of reſt. In ſhort, any ſlight inequality from want of any one or more ſtimuli can be made up by others. See above, par. XLI.</note>? It is in vain to talk of the fattening of chickens

and cattle by keeping them from exerciſe and in a ſtate of reſt. The condition of health and diſeaſe is very different. In the former there is a certain latitude of the ſtrength of the ſtomach; in the latter, and eſpecially when debility is the cauſe, there is a proſtration of ſtrength. In fine, it is an univerſal and conſtant effect of all debility, to produce a deficiency of the fluids in the internal parts of the ſyſtem with a relaxation of the veſſels over all, eſpecially about their excretory terminations, and a diſcharge of the fluids by ſome out-lets. The death, that happens, during the time of an entertainment, is not to be imputed to an over proportion of blood, which cannot happen in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time. The drink has no effect in filling the veſſels. Nor do any perſons, but thoſe who are under direct or indirect debility, meet with ſuch an end, never thoſe, who have an over-proportion of blood; which, as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is gone, and the digeſtive powers deſtroyed, cannot be produced.

to blood; but in thoſe, in which upon account of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility propagated over the whole body, all the functions are in a ſtate of langour, and in which the only matter, ſuited to make blood, is either not applied, or not aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. In this way, the gout, apoplexy, epilepſy, palſy, aſthma and hyſteria, the indigeſtions of perſons, who have been formerly addicted to luxury, in ſince, thoſe very diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which make our preſent ſubject, the hemorrhages, as they are called and falſly defined by that term, laſtly; the far greateſt part of aſthenic diſeaſes, have been thought, at all times and by all phyſicians, to depend upon plethora with vigour, or plethora with mobility. But in fact and truth that both all the reſt of thoſe diſeaſes, and thoſe accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with bleeding diſcharge, depend upon a penury of blood and other debilitating powers is proved, by the conſtant failure of the antiſthenic plan of cure to the great diſgrace of the profeſſion, and by the incredible ſucceſs of the new ſtimulant plan. And with reſpect to the bleeding diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, conſider the perſons, affected with them in the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful powers, that precede them, and in the ſymptoms <hi>that attend them.</hi> During the whole period of prediſpoſition, quite delicate and weakly, they have very little appetite for food, and take very little, and what they take, is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and often rejected by vomiting. In their weak ſtate they are not ſupported by the ſtimulant <hi>operation</hi> of corporeal, or mental exerciſe, nor by that of the animal ſpirits, which are quite puny and dejected, nor by that of pure air <hi>which they are not able to go out to take,</hi> nor by that of agreeable ſenſation, nor by that of ſtrong drink, which, from the miſleading advice of their phyſicians, they look upon as poiſon, nor by that of the diſtention of the veſſels, which are not ſufficiently filled with blood, nor by that of the ſecretory ſmall veſſels, upon account of their ſtuggiſh motion, and ſtagnation of their degenerated fluids every where, and the direct debility conſtantly ariſing from that.</p>

What ſort of pulſe have they? Such, as it is in all diſeaſes of manifeſt debility, for inſtance, fevers, (in which laſt, which is ſurpriſing their favourite plethora, was ſeldom ſuſpected by them), ſmall, weak and very quick and almoſt empty. Upon the whole, what like are their intellectual functions, thoſe of paſſion and emotion, and their corporeal functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either in ſenſe, or motion whether of the voluntary or involuntary kind? All weak, all frail, all ſuch, as ſhow that they have not a third part of life to ſupport them. What, on the contrary, is the ſtate of thoſe, who abound in blood, and yet never experience diſcharges of it? They are ſtrong and full of vigour in all their functions, with redneſs of countenance, ſparkling eyes, ſtrong, hard and moderately frequent pulſe. Their appetite for food is keen, the quantity they take is great and well digeſted. As thoſe perſons, may experience droopings of blood of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and yet not often ſo they fall into no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges of blood. And it is in perfect conſiſtency with all that has been ſaid, <hi>to add,</hi> that the various forms of ſtrong drink, and theſe particularly, which are the ſtrongeſt, ſuch as are called ſpirits, are ſurpriſingly ſucceſsful remedies of bleeding diſcharges, in ſpite of every thing that has hitherto been thought to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in ſpite of rooted prejudices: But the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of opium<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Opium, though much uſed in the cure of certain ſymptoms of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, was never underſtood by thoſe phyſicians, who, in books and lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures aſſumed to themſelves the province of directing the profeſſion of phyſic. Every property they aſſigned to it was the reverſe of the truth. Inſtead of allowing it to be the ſtrongeſt ſtimulant in nature, they made it a ſedative; and, though they found great difficulty in finding a ſingle ſedative more, to help to make out their catalogue of a claſs of ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in nature, they were confident that it was one (ſee above, CCXXX. and the notes).

CCXXXVI. The cure of it, however, in all the caſes that depend upon direct debility, is by no means difficult<note n="(p)" place="bottom">I have experienced ſuch a caſe more than once, and have ſeen and treated it in great numbers. It is ſometimes a part of the concourſe of ſymptoms, that form that aſthenic caſe of diſeaſe, which is commonly called fever. A gentleman, under or about the thirtieth year of his age, had been ten days in a typhus fever, occaſioned by extreme cold, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to the debilitating effects left upon his habit by too great mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in his diet, and, certainly, not a good choice of the different arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of it. To aid the debilitating effects ariſing from theſe, he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced all the extremes of the heat and fatigue, that fall to a ſoldier's lot, in very warm countries. He was, over and above, of a ſmall ſize, ſlender and emaciated. He had alſo, from his infancy, been affected with a ſhort cough, ſometimes dry, and ſometimes with a little expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. During the courſe of his cure, he had been more than once bleeded, though his diſeaſe had uſhered itſelf in by a great profuſion of bleeding, which ſuddenly took him as he was on a journey in a cold day of about 44 miles in a carriage. He was vomitted, purged, bliſtered prodigiouſly, and gliſtered. The whole force of the old plan of cure was exhauſted upon him, and he ſo exhauſted by it, as to be given up for an incurable of two diſeaſes, a bad fever and rotten lungs. His face was hippocratic, he had the dead rattle, and his cough and expectoration were aſſiduous. By the ſtimulant new plan of cure he was put out of danger in ten days, and ſet upon his feet in as many more.</note>, unleſs the diſeaſe has proceeded beyond the boundary <hi>of admitting a cure,</hi> and life is now approaching to its end. The cure, however, is a good deal more difficult in the caſe of indirect debility, and for this <hi>good</hi> reaſon, that <hi>there is no other plan of </hi> cure but ſtimulating, to remove a diſeaſe occaſioned by an exceſs of ſtimulant operation<note n="(q)" place="bottom">See above, CIII.</note> Nay, the ſame debility, as ſhall afterwards be obſerved, produces the ſame relaxation both of the bronchia and of the reſt of the body, <hi>but it does</hi> not always produce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. With this profuſion of expectoration appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes in the form of fever<note n="(r)" place="bottom">See the laſt note (p).</note>, ſometimes in that of the gout, the phyſician has often a long ſtruggle, while he employs <hi>his</hi> diffuſible ſtimulants, <hi>the event of which is</hi>

ſuch, as to produce a complete reſtoration of health, <hi>and thereby to</hi> leave not the leaſt ſuſpicion, of there being any local affection in the lungs, which is ſo much the object both of the faith and fear of phyſicians<note n="(ſ)" place="bottom">A deſcription of this diſeaſe, in which the lungs are ſuppoſed to be affected with ulcers or tubercles, has been given in the note under this paragraph at (<hi>p</hi>). But, as the ſubject is both as new and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as any in this work, it may be proper to give a further illuſtration of it by the expoſition of another ſet of facts. Both in perſons liable to the gout, and other aſthenic diſeaſes, ſometimes of direct and at other times of indirect debility, and eſpecially in thoſe who have been much expoſed to cold, without the debilitating effect of the cold being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (vide par. CXXII), by an alternation with, or ſucceſſion of, heat, and in very many old people, eſpecially among the poorer ſort, who have been, and naturally are, much expoſed to various debilitating powers, there is often, eſpecially in winter, a very great cough and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration. This ſometimes goes to ſuch a height as to give ſuſpicion of the affection of the lungs juſt now ſpoken of. But the completeneſs of its cure, which when it ariſes from indirect debility, is effected by the uſe of animal food, avoiding vegetable, and fiſh, and by good wine and diluted ſpirits in moderate proportion at a time, but frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, avoiding claret and other French wines and all four and all beer-drink, unleſs perhaps a little warm porter in cold weather, and a very moderate uſe of diffuſible ſtimuli, keeping the feet and the body in general moderately warm; ſhows ſufficiently, that there had been no local affection in the lungs. When the debility of the diſeaſe is of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct kind, in which the cure is more difficult, there is, ſtill, as little reaſon to be apprehenſive of the pulmonary or any other local affection. For the cure of it alſo proves the contrary. In it the means of cure are to change the forms of ſtimulus, and to proceed from the uſe of the ſtronger to that of the weaker, till at length the patient can do without much of the very ſtrong ones. (See above, par. XCIX. and thoſe that follow). When the diſeaſe cannot be overcome in that way, the excitability muſt be underſtood to be worn out, and life come to its end; but ſtill from general debility, not local diſeaſe. For, if ever any lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affection does appear, it is always the laſt effect, not the primary cauſe. In this way I loſt two gentlemen, after having been able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them for many weeks, when the prognoſis upon the common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice did not allow them as many hours. The cauſe of their indirect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility had been hard drinking. But even in thoſe, who die of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed conſumption, there is not often reaſon for the ſuſpicion of tuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the lungs.

Of this we have the moſt certain proof in every day's experience, and in the confirmation of it, which the complete induction of the effects of all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing powers affords.<note n="(f)" place="bottom">To illuſtrate this, let us take the exciting powers one by one, and begin with wine. When a perſon is inſufficiently excited with reſpect to that ſtimulus, and riſes not, ſuppoſe, above 30° in his excitement, a glaſs carries him up 2°, another 2° more, and ſo forth, till after five glaſſes, and their effect in carrying him up to 40°, he finds himſelf well and vigorous in all his functions. But, ſtill, we are not ſo flimſily made, as not to bear a little of what is either too much or too little. Suppoſe him then to take five glaſſes more, and, conſequently, to be raiſed to 50°, or 10° above the ſtandard. As his ſpirits, his intellectual, and all his other, functions, were low, while his excitement remained below 40°, ſo they are all proportionably exalted by the time that his excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is elevated to 50°. Let him ſtill go on, and his intellectual func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will riſe ſtill higher; he will now diſplay the full extent of his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius: his paſſions and emotions, of whatever kind, will riſe in the ſame proportion; he will, in one word, be an example of the effects of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander's feaſt. Suppoſe, to bring him to all this he has ſwallowed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe he had before, other five glaſſes. Let him go on, till he has taken five glaſſes more, and we ſhall ſee the effect: In the courſe of time, employed in taking theſe, he gradually falls off in his ſpirits, in his intellectual, and in his corporeal, functions; his tongue, his feet, his eyes, his memory, his judgment, all, fail him; he, at laſt, becomes drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and then falls faſt a-ſleep. The ſame is the progreſs of excitement as it ariſes from labour or exerciſe through the day, whether of mind or body. The ſame is the effect of the ſtimulus of eating, eſpecially nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſtimulant things, and in great plenty. Before dinner, the occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of the former part of the day, are not yet ſufficient to prepare one for ſleep; which, however, after a heavy dinner, will, unleſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terference of ſome other ſtimulus prevent it, very readily happen to moſt people, eſpecially to thoſe, whoſe frailty, from age or any other cauſe, renders them more liable to be fatigued by the paſt operations of the day than others. The younger and more vigorous will be able to hold out to the end of the day; when they too, after having undergone the degree of ſtimulus neceſſary to give that waſte of excitability that diſpoſes to ſleep, will be overcome by it. The very flow of the blood in the veſſels, and the exerciſe of the involuntary motions, that keep it up, tend at laſt to the ſame effect. The ſame thing applies to the motion conſtantly going on in the ſtomach and inteſtines, as well as the motions that occur in all the ſecretory and excretory ſmall veſſels. Light, ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the eyes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And the proceſs, in every caſe, is, firſt a low, then a higher and higher, then the higheſt, vigour of all the functions; which, again, gradually falls till its termination in ſleep. We have, therefore, after viewing their effects ſingly, to ſuppoſe them, in one degree or in another, united, and ſleep the finiſhing effect of their united operations,</note>.</p>

CCXLI.

The ſame debility of either kind, with ſuch a ſtimulus, produces the morbid watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in which caſe it is a ſmall ſtimulus that acts as an irritating power<note n="(ſ)" place="bottom">Volumes have been filled with the doctrine of irritation as a cauſe of morbid ſtate, and the indications of cure and remedies to remove it have been equally tedious and laboured. In ſthenic diſeaſes, phlogiſtic diatheſis, inſtead of plethora and vigour (for the belief in which two laſt there might have been ſome foundation in that form of diſeaſes, ſee above from CXXXI. to CXXXIV.) has been the univerſal pathology; and bleeding, other evacuations, and cold, the univerſal idea, or, as it is called, indication of cure; and while they thought of no other method or means of cure for the aſthenic form of diſeaſes, the pathology, applied to them, was plethora with vigour or with mobility in other caſes, and, in the febrile, irritation. By irritation they explained the ſtartings of the tendons, the reſtleſſneſs, the frequency of the pulſe, the typhoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia or conſtant working, of ſo frequent occurrence and ſo noted a ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom in thoſe diſeaſes.

It is evident, that, to bring on ſalutary watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the one hand, or ſalutary ſleep on the other, or to convert both into ſalutary ſleep, if that be required by the circumſtances, the deficient degree of ſtimulus muſt be adminiſtered; that is five degrees to bring up the excitement from 10 to 15 degrees, and as many for the purpoſe of renewing the worn-out excitement by means of a new exciting power which may ſtill find a portion of excitability to act upon, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move certain ſtimuli, which, however ſlight and mild, are fatiguing and diſturbing to the ſyſtem in its weakened ſtate. Accordingly in fever, when the patient, amidſt every ſort of directly debilitating powers, had, beſides, wanted ſleep for ten days, a ſmall portion of an opiate given him every quarter of an hour, in 3 hours time laid him aſleep, which, in ſpite of an urgent cough and profuſe expectoration, laſted for 16 hours, and was followed by the moſt ſurpriſing relief. The continuance of this practice, with only an encreaſe of the doſes in proportion as the abundant excitability was gradually worn off, and alternating them with wine and beef ſoup, in ten days removed all danger. A child of three months had had no ſound ſleep for ten days, but had cried night and day from a complaint in his belly, which the ordinary practitioners would have called an obſtruction in the meſenteric glands. A large doſe of the tinctura thebaica, for the patient's age, was adminiſtered, which laid him in a profound ſleep, that continued near 36 hours, and at once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the diſeaſe. Numberleſs are the caſes of a kind ſimilar to this where the morbid watchfulneſs was partly from direct, partly from indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect debility, that have been conſtantly removed by the ſame practice. A child of 7 years of age, in a fever of great direct debility, in conſequence of a moſt rapid growth happening during the diſeaſe, which was not completely removed till near the end of ſeven weeks, after having been under the diſeaſe near a fortnight, was affected with the moſt conſtant diſpoſition to ſleep, ſo ſound that no noiſe or ſhaking of his body could awaken him. The adminiſtration of the opiate repeated in ſmall doſes till the effect took place, kept him awake. Some time after, in the courſe of the ſame lingering diſeaſe, when he had not yet acquired any permanent ſtrength, but was only better ſupported by the diffuſible and other ſtimuli, than he had been till I was called in, his predominant ſymptom came to be great watchfulneſs, which was partly the effect of a certain, though not a great, degree of excitement that the tincture and other cordial powers had given him. It, however, induced too great a degree of indirectly debilitating exertion for his ſtill very weak ſtate, and it, therefore, became neceſſary to give him an addition of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement to bring him to the ſtate of ſalutary and recruiting ſleep, and thereby to ſuſpend the action of a number of exciting powers, however ſlight their operation was, which were too much for the enfeebled ſtate of his ſyſtem, In the caſes of children whoſe diſeaſes are almoſt all aſthenic, and in other diſeaſes of high debility, inſtances of ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the diffuſible ſtimuli, (for more than one was employed upon this as well as many other occaſions) are equally numerous and ſurpriſing. In a very large practice I am ſure I never, in the very worſt caſes, loſt three patients.</note> In aſthenic diſeaſes the watching ſtate
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:022373_0178_0FB86B236BDF79D0"/>
for the moſt part is the conſequence of direct debility, with ſome power acting with ſlight ſtimulant effect; the reaſon of which is, that the diſeaſe depends upon more debility than that which conſtitutes ſleep. Hence it comes
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:022373_0179_0FB86B2485B0D538"/>
about, that every thing that ſtimulates, every thing that raiſes the excitement as it were to that point, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes <hi>the ſyſtem</hi> to ſleep, produces that effect by a ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, not a ſedative, virtue. In a ſmall degree of debility, where the excitement has fallen only a little below the point of ſleep, a very ſmall degree of ſtimulus, ſuch as a little animal food; if the weakneſs had been owing to vegetable food, ſuch as wine, or any drink of equal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, after a water regimen; ſuch as conſolation in affliction of mind; heat, when cold has been the debilitating pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; gentle exerciſe or geſtation; or <hi>the ſtimulus</hi> of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant train of thought, when one has been deprived of the ſtimulus of corporeal or mental exerciſe, is ſufficient.

Accordingly, in the exciting powers that act upon the excitability of our bodies, we find only one action, that of ſtimulating, varying only in its degree, to take place in all animal as well as vegetable bodies, nay in every thing that we know to poſſeſs life in the univerſe. We alſo find, to the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, only one property in living ſyſtems upon which it acts, that is, the excitability; and one effect produced by the mutual relation betwixt them in that reſpect, to wit, the excitement. Inſtead of the diſtracted notion of vortices, or atmoſpheres in rapid motion, governing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the planets, Sir Iſaac Newton found the whole planetary ſyſtems of the univerſe governed in their motions by one ſingle principle. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the infinite difference of habits and temperaments, I have found every individual preciſely the ſame as every other. Whatever produces the gout in one, will produce it in another, prepared to receive its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And whatever cures it in any one, cures it alſo in every other; and ſo forth with reſpect to every other diſeaſe. The deeper we explore the works of nature, the more will we be convinced of this wonderful ſimplicity, ſo that, to a philoſopher, all nature would appear the effect of one ſingle inſtrument in the hand of the all-wiſe all-powerful creator.</note> virtue. Thus in great debility, as
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:022373_0180_0FB86B26030DC8B8"/>
in fevers, as in a violent fit of the gout, diſturbing with tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary diſorder the internal parts, and in other ſimilar diſeaſes of debility, in which the violence of the diſeaſe keeps off ſleep; opium often, after the watchful ſtate has remained many days, brings on profound and ſound ſleep; in which caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the excitability is very abundant, and, therefore, can bear but a very ſmall force of ſtimulus, we ſhould, on that account, begin with the ſmalleſt degree of ſtimulus, and proceed gradually to more and more<note n="(c)" place="bottom">See above, par. CVII.</note>; till at laſt we arrive at the point of ſleep, which will ſoon happen, as it is placed much within the range of direct debility: And with reſpect to coma, or that ſleep which is not recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſuch is the effect both of other diffuſible ſtimuli and of opium, that it converts morbid ſleep into vigilance; vigilance, after a certain ſpace of time, into refreſhing ſleep, and, in that way, conducts <hi>the patient</hi> ſafely, gently, and pleaſantly, to health. But as the influence of the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulant operation, that ſupports excitement, is of ſo great importance, and as ſleep of longer duration than to prove refreſhing may ariſe even from good remedies, <hi>the rule to be obſerved when that happens</hi> is, whenever any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:022373_0181_0FB86B2AE53665D0"/>
of ſleep, upon account of too long a ſuſpenſion of ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulant action, has been of leſs ſervice than was expected, to ſhorten its next attack, and renew the operation of the ſtimulus.</p>
               <p>CCXLV. In aſthenic diſeaſes, and thoſe ariſing from indirect debility, in which ſleep is alſo kept off; in order both to reſtore it, and remove the other ſymptoms, and bring about the healthy ſtate, both other ſtimuli ſhould be employed according to the degree of debility requiring their uſe, and, when the degree of debility is very conſiderable, the diffuſible ſtimuli, and among the reſt opium, ſhould <hi>not be omitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>CCXLVI. Theſe are the times and circumſtances of the body in which opium produces ſleep. In all the other ſtates either of health or diſeaſe, it excites the functions both of body and mind, as well as of paſſion and emotion; among others it baniſhes ſleep and produces great activity and vigilance, Thus if any one is under the preſſure of ſleep without an evident cauſe, he will by opium be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſurpriſingly ſprightly, lively, and vigilant; it baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es melancholy, begets confidence, converts fear into bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, makes the ſilent eloquent, and daſtards brave. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, in deſperate circumſtances, and ſinking under a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliſh for life, ever laid violent hands on himſelf after ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>a doſe of</hi> opium, or ever will. In one word, through all the intermediate degrees of excitement from direct to indirect debility, opium is by far the moſt powerful of all the agents, and as ſuch muſt be moſt hurtful in ſthenic di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atheſis, becauſe, when added to the other ſtimulant pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, it not only baniſhes ſleep, but is liable to precipitate thoſe diſeaſes from the ſthenic ſtate to indirect debility, and from this laſt to death.</p>
               <p>CCXLVII. That the debility, upon which coma de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, is leſs than that which ſupports morbid vigilance,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:022373_0182_0FB86B2E05E6A2A8"/>
is proved, from the former being leſs dangerous, and more eaſily removed; yet, when its duration is in any degree conſiderable, or when it reſembles profound ſleep, care ſhould be taken to prevent the hurtful effect it may produce from direct debility<note n="(d)" place="bottom"> See above, par. CCXLI. and the note under it, as well as this whole chapter.</note>; in which caſe recourſe ſhould be had to the different forms of wine and opium, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of raiſing the excitement to that degree, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels the ſleepy ſtate, produces more ſtrength, and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the return of health<note n="(e)" place="bottom"> Phyſicians have had a more favourable idea of coma, or the ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate in fevers, than it merited. Inſtead of deſerving to be looked upon as a poſitively good ſign, enſuring a ſafe return of the diſeaſe, as they did; it was at beſt but a negative mark, implying that the ſlight ſtimuli acting upon the ſyſtem in a ſtate of high debility, and, therefore, by their operation, ſlight as it was, encreaſing the direct debility by the addition of the indirect to it, were kept off and hindered from producing that hurtful effect. Their authority in giving that judgment of it is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by their extreme ignorance of its nature.</note>.</p>
               <p>CCXLVIII. In the gout, in indigeſtion, of which examples have already been adduced, in diarrhoea and the colic, and many other aſthenic diſeaſes, particularly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing the alimentary canal, and chiefly affecting thoſe women who are exhauſted with frequent child bearing, and long and repeated nurſing; it often happens, that there is a ſtrong propenſity to ſleep, contrary to what happens to the ſame perſons in health, and the period of ſleeping at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack is prolonged, without the indulgence in it bringing any alleviation of the diſeaſe. The ſame thing happens to thoſe who have fallen into indirect debility from drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or any other cauſe. That this deſire for ſleep depends upon direct or indirect debility is evident from every thing that gives further debilily encreaſing the diſeaſe, and every thing that ſtrengthens, removing it. Among thoſe all ſtrong drink, and the preparations of opium, are peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly

               </p>
               <p>CCXLIX. Nor is it unconnected with this explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>the nature of</hi> ſleep and watching, and of both of them being ſometime repelled, ſometimes induced, by a certain degree of ſtimulus<note n="(f)" place="bottom"> See above, par.

               <p>CCL. From what has been ſaid, the analogy between watching and life, and ſleep and death, and their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the ſame laws of nature, that govern all the other functions, clearly appears; and the moſt ſolid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation has been adduced, that the moſt vigorous vigilance conſiſts in the higheſt degree of ſalutary excitement; that the middle and deep period of ſleep depends on the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt debility that is conſiſtent with the healthy ſtate; that true ſleep depends on a middle degree of indirect debility, and that both morbid ſleep and morbid watching are the offſpring of great debility, whether of the indirect or direct kind.</p>

               <head>The Cure of both the Diatheſes.</head>
               <p>CCLI. As the cauſe of both the diatheſes is that which has been formerly<note n="(a)" place="bottom">See above, par. CXLVIII.</note> related; the indication of cure, therefore, to be taken from that is, in the ſthenic diatheſis to diminiſh exceſſive excitement over the whole ſyſtem; in the aſthenic to encreaſe deficient excitement <hi>likewiſe over all the ſyſtem,</hi> till it be brought to that degree, which proves the cauſe of health.</p>
               <p>CCLII. The remedies that produce that effect in <hi>the cure of</hi> ſthenic diatheſis, are the powers, which, when their ſtimulant operation is exceſſive, produce that very diatheſis, in this caſe, acting with that ſlight and reduced force of ſtimulus, by which they produce leſs excitement than health requires, or by which they prove debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>CCLIII. The powers which produce the ſame effect in the aſthenic diatheſis, are thoſe that, when their ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus is ſmall, produce that diatheſis, <hi>in this caſe,</hi> exciting with that high degree of ſtimulus, by means of which they give more excitement, than ſuits the healthy ſtate, or by means of which they ſtimulate.</p>
               <p>CCLIV. In the ſthenic diatheſis that temperature<note n="(b)" place="bottom"> The ſame order is followed here, that has all along been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to wit, that of the enumeration of the powers in par. XI. and XIII. and that of the explanation of them, when viewed as the hurtful powers producing either diatheſis in Chap. I. Part II. and it will be kept to throughout the whole work. Nothing can be more ſimple and natural, and better ſuit the ſimplicity of the ſubject, while nothing is more artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and arbitrary than the arrangements either of Syſtematics or Noſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſts. Juſt order could never be expected from an erroneous and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed view of the ſubject to be treated of; while a clear conception of the ſubject as a whole, infallibly leads to a diſtinct diſtributi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

which is called heat, muſt by all means be avoided; <hi>and</hi> for this <hi>very good</hi> reaſon, that the only degree of it which proves debilitating, that is the exceſſive to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, cannot be carried to that height, in which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitates, without the riſk of hurtful or pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from the exceſs of ſtimulus<note n="(c)" place="bottom"> See above, par. CXV. Though very intenſe heat relaxes the ſimple and induces atony on the living ſolids, who, in a peripneumony, would think of uſing it with that view? That diſeaſe from its own vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, often mounts up ſo high in the ſcale of encreaſed ſtimulus, as nearly to approach the point of indirect debility, and it ſometimes actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally gains that point. The addition, therefore, of more ſtimulus from the application of heat, would enſure that effect, and thereby occaſion the converſion of the diſeaſe into a much worſe one, ſuch as hydrotho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax, or the dropſy of the breaſt.</note>.</p>
               <p>CCLV. But, when the diatheſis, and its cauſe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſtimulus, is gentle in the actual diſeaſed ſtate, there is no occaſion for forbidding that degree of heat, which accompanies <hi>the operation of</hi> ſweating and pediluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um<note n="(d)" place="bottom"> Pediluvium is the warm bath of the legs and feet.</note>; becauſe the waſte of fluids in the former, and the agreeable ſenſation in the latter, promiſe ſomewhat more advantage, than the moderate <hi>degree of</hi> heat <hi>employed in this caſe</hi> threatens diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>CCLVI. In a particular manner, after the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cold in an intenſe degree, muſt <hi>the application of</hi> heat be avoided, becauſe its operation, from the increaſe of the excitability by cold, becomes more effective<note n="(e)" place="bottom"> See above, par.

CCLVII. Cold is the beneficial <hi>degree of</hi> tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>in the cure of</hi> this diatheſis, <hi>but it muſt be cold</hi> not followed by any conſiderable degree of heat. That mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, therefore, in medical practice, of thinking cold hurtful in ſthenic diatheſis by a ſtimulant operation, ſhould be corrected; and its benefit in the ſmall-pox is not to be underſtood to ariſe ſo much from its mere debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting degree, as from avoiding the ſtimulus of heat after its operation. When the ſame precaution is employed, the ſame cold either alone, or in conjunction with other debilitating powers, has lately been found the moſt effectual remedy of catarrh<note n="(f)" place="bottom"> or the common cold in Engliſh, a name ſtampt upon it by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry blunder we have been ſpeaking of.</note>.</p>
               <p>CCLVIII. From which circumſtance, and becauſe a cap of freſh dug up earth put upon the head, has been of ſervice in phrenitis; and that degree of cold, which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces froſt and ſnow, when applied to the naked body, has removed a ſynocha accompanied with delirium<note n="(g)" place="bottom">
                     <p>It is called the common inflammatory fever, very improperly, as being no fever, but a general pyrexia, or affection of the whole ſyſtem, without inflammation or local affection, and producing heat over all and tumultuous effect upon the pulſe. Its proper generic name is pyrex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ia. See above par. LXVIII. where that appellation is aſſigned to it: an appellation to avoid miſtaking its nature, that ſhould be accurately attended to. Great miſchief has been occaſioned by this vague term. Thus when a perſon is ſaid to be affected with a diſeaſe; when it is aſked what diſeaſe it is, and the anſwer given, that it is a fever, immediately bleeding is thought of, though that, and every, evacuation is as hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in proper fever as it may be ſerviceable in the pyrexia. To give an example of this pyrexia, the particular appellation for which is ſynocha, or ſthenic pyrexial diſeaſe; many years ago, a perſon in the old town of Edinburgh, labouring under it, eſcaped the vigilance of his nurſe; flew naked out of the houſe in a very keen froſt with ſnow upon the ground, acroſs the ſtreets, paſſed over into the new town, and from that to the fields beyond it. He ſoon became ſenſible of his ſtate, ſtole into a houſe next to him, got ſome clothes thrown about him, and was carried home in a chair, perfectly cured of his diſeaſe. From which, and a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous number of facts to the ſame purpoſe, all concuring in the proof of the debilitating operation of cold, there can hardly ariſe a doubt in the mind, that in a certain high degree, if it could be conveniently uſed, or if there were occaſion to have recourſe to it for want of efficacious reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, it would at once remove the higheſt degree of ſthenic ſtate that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver occurs in diſeaſe, and reduce the excitement from the neareſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to 70 down to 40. Nay it might run into the oppoſite extreme and go all the way to death. But we ſhall, by and by, have occaſion to obſerve, that we are ſo well provided with effectual remedies as not to be under any temptation of ſtraining this to its height. And we ſhall alſo find that a number of remedies in a moderate degree are preferable to any one, or to a ſmaller number in a higher degree. The diſcovery of the principle upon which the cure of ſthenic diſeaſes turns, has ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled us to render the cure both more complete and exact, than it could have been without principle.</p>

becauſe cold is ſo efficacious <hi>a remedy</hi> in the ſmall-pox; it clearly follows, that the uſe of cold ſhould be extended to the whole range <hi>of</hi>

                     <p>I remember, when I was a young ſtudent, of hearing the old phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians in Edinburgh very gravely forbid a draught of cold water in an inflammatory pyrexia and even in a common catarrh, for fear it ſhould produce an inflammation in the ſtomach.</p>
                  </note>, is proved by its very high influence, when applied to the ſurface of the body in the ſmall-pox, in keeping up a freedom of perſpiration in proportion to the degree of its application. And its influence in producing atony with proportional laxity <hi>of the fibres of the veſſels,</hi> is in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the ſame obſervation<note n="(i)" place="bottom">
                     <p>The fibres being relaxed deſcribe a greater cavity, and hence the check given to the perſpiration by the contrary effect of the ſthenic dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis in encreaſing their denſity and diminiſhing their diameters, is taken off.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>CCLX. For the removal of aſthenic diatheſis the ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:022373_0188_0FB86B3BD8C4C260"/>
of heat is ſignally uſeful, and chiefly for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſon; that it muſt be as uſeful in this diatheſis, where the excitement is too low, as it is hurtful in the ſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic, by giving a further encreaſe of the excitement, too much encreaſed already. Hence in fevers, in the gout, in dyſpepſia, in the cholic, in rheumatalgia<note n="(k)" place="bottom"> or what is improperly, as it has been ſaid before, called the chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic rheumatiſm.</note>, and in all aſthenic diſeaſes, the ſyſtem is very much cheriſhed by heat, and debilitated by cold: Which, by its debilitating effect, is ranked among the powers that produce the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe<note n="(l)" place="bottom">
                     <p>No gouty perſon can bear the operation of much cold, and every one can endure more heat, than moſt other perſons. And the reaſon is evident: So debilitating a power muſt, in proportion to its degree, be peculiarly hurtful in all diſeaſes, in which the debility conſtituting their cauſe, runs high, as it naturally does in the gout, where it is encreaſed by the advance of age and other cauſes, and much more ſo in fevers.</p>
                  </note>, and is deſtructive in fevers.</p>
               <p>CCLXI. As cold is hurtful in aſthenic diatheſis in the proportion in which it is ſerviceable in the ſthenic<note n="(m)" place="bottom"> See par. CCLVIII.</note>; it is accordingly, for this further reaſon, to be avoided in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the higheſt debility, that, like intenſe heat, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxes the extreme veſſels, and produces a putrefaction in the fluids<note n="(n)" place="bottom">See above, CXVII.</note>.</p>
               <p>CCLXII. The more certainly to moderate the ſthenic diatheſis while as yet it remains within the range of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, a ſparing uſe ſhould be made of fleſh and the preparations from it, and vegetable diſhes uſed with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter freedom. But, when the ſame diatheſis is encreaſed to the degree, that conſtitutes diſeaſe, abſtinence from animal food, eſpecially in a ſolid form, and a free, but ſtill not exceſſive, uſe of vegetable matter, eſpecially in a fluid form, are the beſt means of removing it, as far as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of diet goes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="unknown:022373_0189_0FB86B3D474897F0"/>
CCLXIII. In that degree of this diatheſis, which does not exceed prediſpoſition, it is proper to avoid ſeaſoning, which is deſtructive in diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>CCLXIV. Watery drink is very ſuitable to it, and all pure and ſtrong drink hurtful, and that in proportion to the quantity of alkahol that it contains. The latter <hi>

                     </gap>ort of</hi> drink, unleſs <hi>taken</hi> very weak, is deſtructive in diſeaſes. In the number of which pure water, eſpecially with an addition <hi>of ſomething to</hi> acidulate <hi>it,</hi> is preferable to ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beer, which a great authority admitted. But the diffuſible ſtimuli in this diatheſis are above all others hurtful.</p>
               <p>CCLXV. Since the indirect ſtimulus of food aſſiſts the direct, that is, propagates itſelf over the whole body; for that reaſon bounds ſhould be ſet to the bulk even of the ſuitable matter<note n="(o)" place="bottom">See above, par. CXXVII.</note>.</p>
               <p>CCLXVI. In every degree of aſthenic diathſis, vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table food ſhould be avoided, and recourſe had as ſoon as poſſible to that, which conſiſts of meat and animal matter. And, as that can ſeldom be executed immediately upon account of the weakneſs of the ſtomach; the diffuſible ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muli ſhould, therefore, be uſed; ſuch as the <hi>different</hi> forms of wine when the debility is moderate, and opiates when it is greater. <hi>And at the ſame time,</hi> from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rich ſoups ſhould be given in great quantity upon the whole, and a gradual tranſition made to the uſe of more ſolid matter.</p>
               <p>CCLXVII. As it is animal matter in this caſe, that is of ſervice, ſo the degree of ſtimulus, that ſeaſoning adds to it, improves its effect<note n="(p)" place="bottom">See above, par. CXXV.</note>.</p>
               <p>CCLXVIII. During the prediſpoſition to aſthenic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, watery, cold, acid, fermenting drink is hurtful, and that proportion of pure ſtrong liquor, that the degree of debility requires, is beneficial. But after the diſeaſes

IN aſthenic diatheſis, and the diſeaſes depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon it, reproducing the <hi>loſt</hi> quantity of blood, is the moſt powerful remedy, when we, at laſt, find acceſs to it, as being the only means of reſtoring a ſtimulus of ſo much more power and efficacy, that its direct application is made to ſo great an extent of the ſyſtem<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Compare this with par.

When the debility is greater, and ſolid animal food can neither be taken, nor if taken, digeſted, broth made from it, as rich as poſſible, and as free of fatty matter, ſhould be carefully adminiſtred<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Compare this with par.

               <p>CCXCIII. As refilling the veſſels is the greateſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, becauſe its direct ſtimulus is applied over ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the ſyſtem; for that reaſon heat, which is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately applied to the whole ſurface of the body, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly affects the body to that extent, ſhould be next in virtue <hi>to it.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>CCXCV. To run over the liſt of ſtimuli, that anſwer this purpoſe, we muſt begin with the cure of that ſlighter loſs of fluids <hi>that occur</hi> in thoſe diſeaſes, and proceed to the more violent kinds of them.</p>
               <p>In a ſlight looſeneſs of belly, ſuch as happens in prediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to aſthenic diſeaſes, or in the ſlighter degrees of the latter; it will be commonly ſufficient to abſtain from ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable food, and from weak, watery drink, or that <hi>kind of it that</hi> ferments <hi>in the firſt paſſages,</hi> ſuch as the ſeveral drinks made from barley, called beers; to uſe animal food, as well ſeaſoned and as rich as poſſible, and free of all fatty matter; to drink pure wine, or ſpirit, in different degrees of ſtrength; and to take <hi>ſuch</hi> exerciſe <hi>as is</hi> gentle in degree, and often repeated<note n="(s)" place="bottom">See and compare, for the more clear underſtanding of this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, the CCLXVI.

CCXCVI. When the belly is ſtill, looſer and <hi>with that affected</hi> with gripes and pains, as happens in the violent diarrhaea, and in the dyſentery in which the looſe ſtools are accompanied with vomiting: or when, without theſe troubleſome ſymptoms <hi>affecting</hi> the belly, diſtreſſing vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting is an urgent ſymptom; or, when the vomiting is conjoined with a moiſture upon the ſurface, or macerating ſweat; or when ſweat is the only urgent ſymptom, and <hi>as ſuch</hi> waſtes the ſtrength, exhauſts the body, and diſſipates the fluids: in all theſe caſes, we muſt have immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the moſt diffuſible ſtimuli, and check ſuch an impoveriſhment of the fluids <hi>of the ſyſtem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>CCXCVII. In which caſe, the uſe of ſtimuli will be ſo much the more neceſſary, that other ſymptoms uſually accompany thoſe encreaſed excretions. Their great effca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſtimulant power, is proved by their ſingular virtue <hi>in removing</hi> thoſe and other <hi>ſymptoms,</hi> in fevers and other moſt violent ſthenic diſeaſes, nay, in the article of death itſelf, from ultimate debility.</p>
               <p>CCXCVIII. Accordingly, in ſpaſms and convulſions in the internal, in the external, parts<note n="(t)" place="bottom">See par.

               <p>CCXCIX. As, therefore, the energy of that ſtimulant virtue ſerves to check looſeneſs of the belly, and vomiting, or even ſweating, when theſe ſymptoms are gentle, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon a leſs violent <hi>degree</hi> of the cauſe; ſo that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

of its power, which is fitted to check theſe affections in the greateſt height of their violence, and to re-eſtabliſh the ſtate of health, is by far the greateſt of all the powers, which are ever applied to the human body; which may be known from this proof, that when the action of all the other powers by which life is ſupported is of no effect, they turn aſide the inſtant ſtroke of death.</p>
               <p>CCC. The moſt weak degree of the diffuſible ſtimuli<note n="(z)" place="bottom">See above par. CXXVI. ο. π. ρ. ς</note> are the white wines, except madeira, canary, good ſherry and the red wines, except port and ſpirits procured by diſtillation, ſo diluted, as to equal the ſtrength of the wines, or exceed it a little. Still higher than theſe are the latter <hi>taken</hi> pure, and higher ſtill, thoſe that have undergone many rectifications. The ſtrength of which is in proportion to the quantity of water expelled, and of the alkali retained.</p>
               <p>CCCI. A higher place in the ſcale is claimed by muſk, volatile alkali, camphor; our trials of which are not yet ſo complete, as to aſcertain its force exactly: next comes aether, and, laſt of all, opium. Of all which, however, unleſs, when, as they ſometimes do, they have loſt their effect by a continuance of their application, and are, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſubſtituted in place of each other for the ſake of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal of the operation of each; and when, in that way we make the complete round of them, for the ſake of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling extreme debility; <hi>in every reſpect,</hi> the preparations of opium are ſufficient for moſt purpoſes of high ſtimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</p>
               <p>CCCII. Together with all theſe<note n="(a)" place="bottom">They are animal ſoups, and ſolid meat (CCXC.) heat, (CCXCI.) ſtimulants (CCXCV.) diffuſible ſtimulants CCXCIX.)</note>, regard muſt be had to <hi>the articles of</hi> diet<note n="(b)" place="bottom">See par.

And, as in great debility, and the diſeaſes depending upon it, of the only ſuitable matter, that is meat, nothing ſolid can be taken; for that reaſon, the matter to be uſed muſt be fluid, but ſtrong. Animal ſoups ſhould be given ſparingly at a time, but repeatedly, in proportion to the degree of debility, and jellies both along with the diffuſible ſtimuli. After that, when, chiefly by means of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive ſtimuli, the ſtrength is in part reſtored; at firſt ſolid meat, likewiſe in ſparing quantities, but often repeated; then <hi>given</hi> more plentifully, and at greater intervals, ſhould be taken. <hi>In which progreſs</hi> the patient ſhould gradually recede from the uſe of the diffuſible ſtimuli.</p>
               <p>CCCIII. When now the diffuſible ſtimuli are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laid aſide, and the convaleſcent is given up to his uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner of living, and that management, which perſons in health commonly obſerve, (only that more care is taken <hi>than in perfect health,</hi> to avoid any thing that might prove hurtful); then it is, that every attempt of the phyſician ſhould be directed to the conſideration of the ſtrength of his patient, as returning, but not yet <hi>quite</hi> eſtabliſhed<note n="(c)" place="bottom">See above par.

His ſleep ſhould neither be too long, nor too ſhort, leſt the former produce direct, the latter indirect debility<note n="(d)" place="bottom">See par.

               <head>How the Remedies ſhould be varied.</head>
               <p>CCCIV. AS the hurtful powers, that produce prediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to diſeaſes, or diſeaſes themſelves, act ſome on one part, ſome on another, with ſomewhat more force than <hi>on any other equal part;</hi> and as ſuch a part is commonly that which they directly affect<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Par. XLIX.</note>; ſo the powers, which are employed as remedies, in order that their general effect may reach the whole body with the more certainty, ſhould be, <hi>in the ſame manner,</hi> differently applied to different parts.</p>
               <p>CCCV. The cure of any ſthenic diſeaſe whatever, is improperly entruſted to bleeding alone, though that is one of the moſt powerful of the debilitating remedies. And the reaſon is, that, though the excitability is ſufficiently reduced <hi>by that remedy</hi> in the greater blood-veſſels, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps too much, yet in the extremities of theſe, as well as in the reſt of the body, it is not ſufficiently reduced<note n="(b)" place="bottom">The action of every exciting power, whether ſalutary or hurtful, or curative, always extends over the whole body, the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eat of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citability, but ſtill with the inequality mentioned in the fourth Chapter of Part Firſt. This is the baſis of the diſtinction with reſpect to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſubject: which is, that, as every power acts moſt effectually on the part where its action is immediately exerted, it is better to truſt to a number, every one of which poſſeſſes that advantage, than rely on any one, however powerful otherwiſe; as by that means, whatever be the indication, whether it be to encreaſe or diminiſh excitement, the effect will be more equally produced over all in conſequence of there being a number of parts that have had a ſtrong action exerted upon them.</note>.
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:022373_0208_0FB867D361F603F8"/>
Nor is the alternation of bleeding with purging a perfect ſort of cure; becauſe, though the exceſſive excitement be ſufficiently, and more than ſufficiently, removed in the greater blood-veſſels, and in the innumerable ſmall arteries, whether exhalant or mucous, which diſcharge their fluids into the inteſtines; yet, neither on the perſpiratory ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the arteries, nor on the reſt of the body, is an equal debilitating energy exerted: for inſtance, the ſmall veſſels which open into the ſtomach, are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently relieved of their diſtending<note n="(c)" place="bottom">and therefore ſtimulating load, the ſtimulus in any veſſel being the quantity of its fluid.</note> load. And although vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting<note n="(d)" place="bottom">See par. CCLXIX.</note>, which has been improperly left out of the cure of ſthenic diſeaſes, and <hi>ſtill more</hi> improperly employed in <hi>every one of</hi> the aſthenic, ſhould be conjoined with the two remedies juſt now mentioned, even that would not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to produce an equality of diminiſhed excitement; as there would ſtill remain in the perſpiratory veſſels, the ſame ſtate of the excitement, which has been mentioned, as in the reſt of the body, that is not vaſcular. In vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſthenic diſeaſes, therefore, after diminiſhing the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, and in the ſlighter from the beginning <hi>of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,</hi> the addition of <hi>the operation of</hi> ſweat to the evacuations that have been ſpoken of, will produce a more equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of excitement, a more perfect ſolution of the diſeaſe. For by means of this evacuation, not only from the larger blood-veſſels, in the interior parts of the body, but from an infinity of outlets both of the external, and
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:022373_0209_0FB867D504671728"/>
internal ſurface of the body, an immenſe quantity of flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids, every where diſtending, and, <hi>thereby,</hi> producing a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great ſun of excitement, is withdrawn. But the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtops not even here. For, ſince in ſlight ſthenic affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons much nouriſhing food, and in them all, too much, can be taken; the conſequence of that muſt be, that, however much the quantity of the blood and other fluids has been diminiſhed, if the food, which is the only <hi>power</hi> that can produce blood, continues to be taken, all the veſſels, in proportion to the quantity that has been taken, will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain go on to be filled, and to be fired with the fewel of exceſſive excitement. To prevent which inconvenience, and to diminiſh excitement, ſtill with greater equality over the ſyſtem; abſtinence, or an allowance of vegetable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a fluid form, and watery drink, will have a very great effect. But neither does the matter end here. For, if, after taking all the precautions and ſecurities that have been recommended, the degree of heat, that proves hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful from its ſtimulus, be allowed to approach the external ſurface of the body; it will produce another inequality of excitement, however much that may have been properly and equally diminiſhed by the other means of cure. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the ſthenic diatheſis depends ſo much upon the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus of heat, directly affecting the ſkin<note n="(e)" place="bottom">See par. CXIII.</note>, and is, on that account, prevalent in the ſkin in preference to other parts; to make ſure of rendering the diminution of excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as equal as poſſible, the debilitating effect of cold ſhould be oppoſed to the high degree of excitement, which the heat has produced. When, at laſt, all the <hi>directions,</hi> which have been ſo fully pointed out, have been executed, <hi>ſtill</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produce the equality of excitement, ſuited to good health; it remains, that we be on our guard againſt the ſtimuli that ariſe from the intellectual functions and paſſions. For,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:022373_0210_0FB867D9567CBAA8"/>
as they have a great effect in producing ſthenic diatheſis<note n="(f)" place="bottom">See par. CXXXVIIII.

Nay, in the ſame way, we move that inanition of the veſſels which takes place in aſthenic diſeaſes in an exact proportion to their degree. For, as in that abundance of blood, which is the moſt powerful means of bringing on ſthenic diſeaſes, there is an opportunity of making a quick cure by immediate taking of blood; ſo it is only by inſenſible, gradual, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible, and obſcure ſucceſſive ſteps, that we open the acceſs to the removal of that penury of blood, which proves the moſt hurtful power in aſthenic diſeaſes, and effect the filling of the veſſels again.</p>

               <p>CCCX.

CCCXIX. The powers that ſupport plants, in every ſtate of life, are heat, air, moiſture, light, ſome motion, and their internal juices.</p>
               <p>CCCXX. The action of plants alſo conſiſts in ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus<note n="(g)" place="bottom">See XVII XIX. and notes.</note>; by means of which, the phoenomena peculiar to that ſort of life, ſenſe, ſome motion, and verdure, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited: and the cauſe of this ſtate is excitement, an effect in common to all exciting powers<note n="(h)" place="bottom">See Part I. Chap. II.</note>.</p>
               <p>CCCXXI. Nay, in this caſe too the exciting powers, when applied in due proportion, produce health; but their too great or too ſparing <hi>action</hi> occaſions diſeaſes, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition to diſeaſes; of which the former depend on an exceſſive, the latter upon a deficiency of ſtimulus. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, exceſs or ſcantineſs of moiſture, exceſſive heat or cold, by an equality of <hi>hurtful</hi> operation, lead to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and death, indirectly or directly. And, as the rays of the ſun or darkneſs, when their operation is either too great, or too long continued, prove debilitating, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer indirectly, the latter directly; ſo the alternate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of night to day, of darkneſs to night, ſeems to be the effect of an intention in nature, to prevent too great an effulgence of the light of day, or too long a continuance of it, from ſtimulating either in exceſs or in ultimate exceſs, and thereby inducing ſthenic diſeaſes, or thoſe of indirect debility; or to prevent an exceſs, or long continuance of darkneſs from producing direct debility, and the diſeaſes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to it<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Chap. IV. We have no leſs proof, than that of the univerſal feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mankind, of the truth of what has been advanced, with reſpect to the ſtimulus of light and the debilitating effect of darkneſs.</note>.</p>
               <p>CCCXXII. Nor do plants want their excitability, which, equally as in animals, <q>is not different in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent parts of its ſeat; nor is made up of parts, but one

               <p>CCCXXIII. This effect is alſo produced with the ſame inequality as in animals, being, for inſtance, greater in any part to which its exciting power is directly applied, than in any other equal part. And, as there are two reaſons for that fact in animals, the direct impreſſion of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon the part more affected, and a greater energy of the excitability of <hi>a part or relation to which it is ſo applied,</hi> than on that of any other equal part<note n="(l)" place="bottom">See XLIX. and addition L. LI.</note>; the very ſame is the fact with reſpect to plants. Further, as the exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability bears a greater relation to the impreſſion of the <hi>exciting</hi> powers, on the brain, the ſtomach, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, than on any of moſt of the other parts; ſo the part in plants, that correſponds to theſe parts, is the root, which is affected in the higheſt degree by the exciting powers. It is the root of plants, in preference to any of their other parts, to which the conflux of moiſture is made. The heat there is the beſt, which is neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, and therefore liable to produce ſthenic affection, nor ultimately exceſſive, and therefore ready to induce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct debility (both which diſadvantages are prevented by the depth <hi>of the ground</hi>); nor deficient, or what is called cold, which would bring on direct debility<note n="(m)" place="bottom">Hence it would appear, that it ſhould be a general rule in plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and harrowing to adapt the depth, where the ſeed is to be laid, to the ſtate of the ſurrounding temperature. It would ſeem, when other circumſtances are equal, that the ſeeds of plants may more ſafely lye ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially in warm than in cold countries. The ſame fact ſeems to be favoured by the difference of perfection that planted and natural woods attain in cold countries; the former, the ſeeds of which are lodged in a certain depth, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>CCCXXIV. But the only uſe of the ſoil, through the pores of which the powers that have been mentioned pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:022373_0219_0FB867EE15DC4488"/>
is to furniſh that ſort of a ſtrainer, by which the powers may neither, from the pores being too patulous, go down in too great quantity, and produce firſt a ſthenic, or too luxuriant a ſtate of the plant, and then indirect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; nor, from the contractedneſs of the pores, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiently admitted to the root, and occaſion indirect debility, or the decaying ſtate of a plant But that the ſoil is not otherwiſe neceſſary to the <hi>production of</hi> ſome <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of</hi> vegetable life, is proved by plants often living, to a certain degree, in pure water. That, however, it is uſeful as a filter, is proved by the good effect of ploughing, of braking the clods, of dividing the tough clay by lime and other abſorbent earths, and by theſe means relaxing the pores: <hi>On the other hand, we have proof of the ſame thing</hi> in the ſucceſs of contracting the pores by making ground, <hi>naturally</hi> too friable, more tenacious with dung, and covering light ground with rags and ſtones, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by keeping in both heat and moiſture.</p>
               <p>CCCXXV. From this <hi>view of the facts,</hi> the reaſon is evident, why every ſandy as well as clay ſoil, when the former has not received, and the latter parted with its toughneſs, is barren and unfruitful. Hence it is, that very hot ſummers and countries are hurtful to clay grounds, by ſhutting up the pores; and ſerviceable to friable and lean grounds, by diminiſhing their poroſity. Hence, dry ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ſuitable to low-lying rich grounds, which, from all quarters, conduct a quantity of moiſture around the roots of the plants; while rainy ſeaſons are thoſe that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in grounds that are high and of a thin ſoil.

of trees, and a great number of bare ſtones, covering every thing, which ſome perſons, of more induſtry than ſenſe, often remove with hurtful effect; their good effect being to give heat and keep in moiſture.

There are many circumſtances that give reaſon to believe, that this globe has undergone great changes, and that whatever is now ſea, has been land; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is land at preſent, has been ſea; and that the foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil <hi>kingdom of nature</hi> has not been more retentive of the reſpective form of each of its individuals. But whether the laſt, like animals and plants, have a ſort life, ſo as, after their manner, to be produced into living exiſtence, to grow, to run through a period equally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out growth and diminution of bulk, to decay, to die, and, in death loſe their proper form; the great duration of their age, and the ſhortneſs of ours, deprive us of any poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of learning.</p>
               <p>CCCXXVII. As all the motions of the planets, which latter were formed to remain and continue their courſes for ever, depend upon this one principle, to proceed ſtraight onward, according to the manner in which all projectiles move, and then by the influence of gravity, which affects them all, to be pulled downwards, and thereby, upon the whole, thrown into circular motions; ſo, in the leſſer and living bodies with which thoſe greater bodies are filled, that is, animals and plants, of which the whole ſpecies remain though the individuals of each ſpecies die; whatever is the cauſe of their functions, whatever gives commencement and perfection to theſe, the ſame weakens, and, at laſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes them. It is not, therefore, true, that ſome pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are contrived by nature for <hi>the preſervation of</hi> life and health, others to bring on diſeaſes and death. The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of them all is indeed to ſupport life, but in a forced way, and then to bring on death, but by a ſpontaneous operation.</p>

CCCXXX. The general ſthenic diſeaſes, without py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rexia and inflammation, are ſome of them called phlegm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſiae, others exanthemata. But they will all, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, be treated <hi>here</hi> according to their rank in excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the higheſt to the loweſt degree of excitement.</p>
               <p>CCCXXXI. The phlemaſiae and exanthematic diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes have the following ſymptoms in common to them. The firſt of theſe is that degree of ſthenic diatheſis, that diſtinguiſhes prediſpoſition<note n="(d)" place="bottom">From the firſt deviation from perfect health to the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of actual ſthenic diſeaſe, the ſthenic diatheſis takes place in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing ſcale from 40° to 55°.</note>. This <hi>diatheſis upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the diſeaſe,</hi> is ſucceeded by ſhivering, a ſenſe of cold, languor, and <hi>a certain feeling like that which we have in fatigue from labour, called by phyſicians,</hi> laſſitude. The pulſe at firſt, <hi>in every caſe,</hi> and in mild ones through their whole courſe is moderately frequent, and, <hi>at the ſame time,</hi> ſtrong and hard; the ſkin is dry, and there is a retention of other excretions<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Such as that by the belly, and that which pours out the ſaliva and mucus, and forms the matter of expectoration.</note>: The urine is red; there is great heat and often thirſt.</p>
               <p>CCCXXXII. The ſymptoms peculiar to phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae<note n="(f)" place="bottom">The phlegmaſiae are ſthenic diſeaſes, accompanied with inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in an external part, as has been ſaid ſomewhere before, according to the definition of noſologiſts. But, as there is no difference betwixt them and ſynocha or the catarrh, which latter are unaccompanied with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, we therefore pay no regard to the diſtinction; and ſhall regard nothing either in theſe or any other diſeaſes, but what is conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a real difference of excitement. It is the excitement by which we are to be guided through our whole diſtribution of diſeaſes.</note>, are an inflammation of an external part, or an affection nearly allied to it; while the general affection, for the moſt part, precedes this local one, and never ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to it<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Long before any part of this doctrine was diſcovered, when I was in ſearch of certain facts reſpecting peripneumony and pleuritis, I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered one which I was not looking for, of more importance than all the reſt put together. It had been aſſerted, by moſt ſyſtematics and all the noſologiſts, that the primary ſymptom in the phlegmaſiae was the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a part, I ſaw that was not true with reſpect to rheumatiſm, in which the general affection or pyrexia often rages one, two, or three days before the ſign of inflammation, pain, is perceived in any of the joints. I could alſo diſcern, that from the moment the pain and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation appeared in eryſipelas, or the roſe, there was alſo the general af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection equally conſpicuous. In ſhort, in no one of that ſet of diſeaſes, did the fact appear that the inflammation was primary, and the pyrexia, or affection of the whole ſyſtem dependent upon it. But as peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was ſaid in Edinburgh to be an exception, the detection I made equally diſproved that. In all the works of Morgagni, where perineu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and eryſipelas are treated, and in all thoſe of Trillerus, a profeſſed writer on that ſubject, and in a theſis in Sandiforth's Theſaurus, taken from no leſs than 400 caſes of that diſeaſe (for they are now by others, as well as me, conſidered as one), I found that in ſomewhat more than one-half of the given n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mber, which was very reſpectable, the general affection appeared from one to three days before the pain came on, and in all the reſt of the caſes, though for any thing theſe authors ſaid to the contrary, they might ſometimes have come on together, yet, that there was not one, in which it could be fairly alledged, that the pain was the firſt and primary appearance. Hence I found, that all the theories raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that hypotheſis of courſe fell to the ground. Indeed the fact is quite conſiſtent with every one here.</note>. This general affection, for the greater
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:022373_0224_0FB867FA877ACF68"/>
convenience of diſtinguiſhing it from fevers, is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated pyrexia<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Of this deſignation warning has been given more than once. See, note at CCCXXIX.</note>. In the exanthematic ſthenic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, an eruption of ſpots or puſtles, more or leſs crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the degree of the diatheſis, covers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifies the ſkin. <hi>The eruption appears upon the occaſion</hi> of a foreign, contagious matter, having been taken into the body, and detained below the cuticle.</p>
               <p>CCCXXXIII. The explanation of all thoſe ſymptoms eaſily flows from the doctrine delivered above. The ſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic diatheſis in the manner, that has been ſo fully explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

CLV. and CLVI. and particularly CLXXIV.</note>.</p>
               <p>CCCXXXIV. The frequency of the pulſe in ſthenic diſeaſes is moderate, becauſe, while the ſtimulus in the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem cannot fail to produce ſome <hi>frequency,</hi> the quantity <hi>of blood,</hi> to be thrown into quick motion, ſets bounds to it and prevents its riſing into quickneſs. But, <hi>at the ſame time,</hi> it is evident, that a quantity <hi>ſo great</hi> cannot be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with the ſame celerity, as an under proportion<note n="(l)" place="bottom">In, fevers and other aſthenic diſeaſes of great debility, from the weakneſs of the ſtomach and other digeſtive organs, and the ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of nutrient matter taken in, the quantity of blood which is diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every one of thoſe diſeaſes, cannot be more than one-third leſs than that which overfills the veſſels in ſthenic diſeaſes. Conſequently, by a given power, it may be propelled in the ſame proportion, that is, one-third faſter than in the ſthenic diſeaſes, which alſo appears in fact; for while 100 beats in a minute is a frequent pulſe in ſthenic diſeaſes, till their approach or actual converſion to indirect debility, the common frequency in fevers and the other high aſthenic diſeaſes, is 150 beats in the ſame time.</note>. The ſtrength of the pulſe is occaſioned by the degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement in the moving fibres of the veſſels, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called their tone, and by that of their denſity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as ſimple ſolids<note n="(m)" place="bottom">See above LIX. LX. and LXI.</note>. The hardneſs of the ſthenic pulſe is nothing elſe, than the continuance for ſome time of each ſtrong contraction, cloſely embracing a great co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of blood, and, thereby, as it were, reſembling a ſtretched rope<note n="(n)" place="bottom">See par. CLV. If it ſhould be alledged, that, though in fevers and the other caſes mentioned juſt now in the note (<hi>a</hi>), the deficient quantity of blood to be put in motion will account for the greater celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of motion, than in the diſeaſes which make the preſent ſubject; ſtill the great weakneſs of the heart, for want of the ſtimulus of a due quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of blood, as well as of many others, ſhould overbalance the effect ariſing from the ſmall quantity to be moved. But the anſwer to that objection is eaſy. It ariſes from the explanation of the ſtrength and hardneſs of the pulſe juſt now mentioned in the text. The febrile pulſe is indeed one-third quicker than the ſthenic pyrexial, but it is weak, and ſmall, and ſoft, while the other is ſtrong, and full, and hard. An equal force then of the heart to that in the ſthenic caſe is not required to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the difference of the effect. A third leſs of blood, with an equal force behind, will be driven not only one-third faſter, but with ſtrength and hardneſs.

That this is the exact ſtate of the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is proved by the great quantity of food taken with a good appetite, before the arrival of the diſeaſe, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the period of prediſpoſition; it is proved by the ſame and other powers, giving an unuſually great excitement o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole ſyſtem<note n="(o)" place="bottom">See the whole of the firſt Chapter of Part II, upon the powers producing ſthenic diatheſis.</note>, and, therefore, among <hi>their</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effects encreaſing the digeſtive energy; and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by evacuant, with other debilitating remedies, both preventing and removing the diſeaſes.

When the inflammation takes place on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the lungs, it is impoſſible it can be confined either to the ſubſtance of the lungs, or the membrane covering their ſurface.

Into this error, he had been led, by obſerving, that, after death, the interior ſubſtance of the liver exhibited ſigns of previous inflammation. And, as other diſſections ſhowed the membrane upon other occaſions to have been in a ſtate of inflammation, he thence drew his raſh concluſion. But it is to be obſerved, that the firſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned ſtate of the liver was not a phlegmaſiae at all, as it had not during life exhibited any of the ſymptoms of that diſeaſe, or even given any ſign of the preſence of inflammation. It is a caſe, then, we have nothing to do with upon this ſubject, even ſo far as it applies to the liver. But the extending the application to all the viſcera, which he was pleaſed to make the ſeats of ſome phlegmaſiae or other, was looſeneſs of reaſoning, and careleſſneſs of matter of fact, in extreme. A gentleman, whoſe works have lately been buried, without any ſtruggle or ſigns of life, but that of a feeble unintelligible ſound from within the tomb, which no living reaſon could make any ſenſe of in their life time, took it into his head to maintain (for the ſake of ſeeming to differ with men of name and reputation, his higheſt ambition), that the inflammation in the phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſiae was always ſeated in the membrane: The anſwer to which is given in the text.</note>.

Contagion is a certain matter, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible, of an unknown nature, and like moſt of the phoenomena of nature, only in any meaſure open to our enquiry in its evident effects. Taken from the body of one affected with it, or from any groſs matter (ſuch as clothes or furniture, where it happens to have been lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king), and received into a ſound body, it ferments without any change of the ſolids or fluids, it fills all the veſſels, and then is gradually ejected by the pores.</p>

And, as no effect, except ſthenic diathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, follows it, and the hurtful powers, that otherwiſe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually produce that diatheſis, always precede it, and an aſthenic or debilitating plan of cure always, and only, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds <hi>in removing it,</hi> and conſequently its effect no ways differs from the diſeaſes hitherto mentioned; it is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with juſtice, that the diſeaſes ariſing from it, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined with thoſe others, as belonging to the ſame form.</p>

                  <p>CCCLXXIV. The violent ſmall-pox is a ſthenic exan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema, on the third or fourth day of which, ſometimes latter, ſmall ſpots or points, inflamed, and by and by to be transformed into exact puſtules, break out; containing a liquor <hi>which,</hi> generally on the eighth day after the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, often latter, is changed into pus, and dwindles away in the form of cruſts. The eruption, the degree of which is always in proportion to that of the ſthenic diatheſis, in this caſe is the greateſt that ever occurs.</p>
                  <p>CCCLXXV. All theſe phoenomena are governed by the laws of fermentation, lately mentioned<note n="(g)" place="bottom">See above par. CCCLXVIII.</note>.

                  <head>The Deſcription of the violent Meaſles.</head>
                  <p>CCCLXXVII. The violent meaſles is a ſthenic exan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematic diſeaſe<note n="(i)" place="bottom">See above par. CCCLXVI.</note>, beginning with ſneezing, watery eyes,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:022373_0246_0FB86836CB1B9120"/>

                     </gap> branny ſcales. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, when preceded with a high degree of ſthenic diatheſis, is proportionally violent.</p>
                  <p>CCCLXXVIII. The ſneezing, watery eyes, dry cough, and hoarſeneſs, are catarrhal ſymptoms, and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, depend upon ſthenic diatheſis<note n="(k)" place="bottom">See above par. CLXXV.</note>. And, ſince they appear, four days or more, before the eruption, that is, before the matter might ſeem to have reached the affected parts, and are conſtant and univerſal; hence are we to ſuppoſe, that the ſthenic diatheſis follows the hurtful powers, that uſually produce it, and not entirely the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar matter in this caſe, and that it is indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the meaſles. But though that <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> ſhould be rejected, and it ſhould be contended, that thoſe ſymptoms ariſe from the <hi>contagious</hi> matter; it ſtill muſt be granted, that this diſeaſe differs, however, in nothing from the other ſthenic diſeaſes, but equally depends upon ſthenic diatheſis, and yields to antiſthenic or debilitating remedies. And it muſt be allowed, that, ſince the matter produces the ſame affect as the uſual hurtful powers, its operation muſt be abſolutely the ſame, <hi>and</hi> the cauſe of the diſeaſe the ſame. Conſequently, we find nothing in the indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cure, but what is in common to this diſeaſe with other ſthenic exanthematic ones, which is, that time muſt be given to the matter to paſs out of the body, and the perſpiration be conducted in the ſame manner, as the ſthenic diatheſis is uſually treated upon other occaſions<note n="(l)" place="bottom">See above par. XCVI.</note>.</p>
                  <p>CCCLXXIX. The eruption admits of the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning that has been delivered<note n="(m)" place="bottom">See above par. CCCLXXV.</note>. The circumſtance

of its being a violent diſeaſe when preceded by a violent ſthenic diatheſis, and mild in a degree of that dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, is a further inſtance of the little difference that there is betwixt the operation of contagion, and that of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary powers producing ſthenic diatheſis.</p>
                  <p>CCCLXXX. When the diatheſis runs ſo high as to ſuppreſs the perſpiration, the eruption often diſappears for a time, as if it went into the interior parts of the body: Which is a danger, that is chiefly threatened at the end of the diſeaſe; and ſhows, that this matter, in the ſame manner as the variolous, kindles up a ſymptomatic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation over the ſurface of the body, and then, by a further encreaſe of the diatheſis, ſuppreſſes the perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence, with other viſcera, the lungs<note n="(n)" place="bottom">That the lungs ſhould be inflamed in a violent ſtate of the diathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis in the meaſles is not to be wondered at; as the common catarrh, when its diatheſis runs high, is liable to produce the ſame effect. (See par. CCCXLIII<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> towards the end.) But, conſidering how many facts in medical writings I have found falſe, the effect of that on my mind, is to render the weight of teſtimony in favour of the various internal viſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra being ſo liable to be inflamed, from this ſuppoſed ſtriking in of the meaſly eruption, very light, and to diſpoſe me to doubt of the fact alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Which I am the more inclined to do, from the analogy of a broad fact in direct contradiction to it: Which is, that the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, depending upon the general diatheſis in ſthenic diſeaſes, never, as I have yet found, affects an interior part. (See par. CXIII. CLXVIII.) Neither is inflammation, from any other ſource, near ſo frequent in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts as vulgar opinion has taught us. Diſſection has ſhown inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the inteſtinal canal in dyſentery, or what is called in English the bloody flux. But that only happened under the evacuant, debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, vegetable, plan of cure: and, even in that caſe, ſeems to have been an ultimate, not an early, effect, much leſs a cauſe. And it has been ſhown, that what has been conſidered as a burning inflammation in the firſt paſſages, is not an inflammation at all. (See above par. CXCVIII.) Nay, even when inflammation does happen internally, it is never of the ſthenic, but always of the general, or local, aſthenic kind, and, when quickly cured, cannot be inflammation. If there be any truth in the frequency of inflammation towards the end of the meaſles, it muſt be of the aſthenic kind: Which is the more likely from its late appearance, and from a circumſtance that, though no where taken notice of, has great weight with me; which is, that as the diſtinct ſmall pox paſſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the confluent, peripneumony into dropſy of the cheſt, and any ſthenic diſeaſe with its diatheſis, into any aſthenic diſeaſe, and the diatheſis on which it depends; there is nothing in the nature of the animal oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and of the powers acting on it, to prevent the ſame converſion of ſthenic into aſthenic ſtate in the meaſles. And if, which is moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the alexipharmac practice, that was then uſed in this diſeaſe, indirect debility can induce ſuch a change, no diſeaſe has a fuller chance for it than the meaſles. But I am ſure, were the debilitating plan uſed from the beginning, no ſuch conſequence would happen.</note> are often inflamed.</p>

CCCLXXXI. The violent ſtate of the ſmall-pox, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from the great ſtimulus of the eruption, converts both the ſthenic diatheſis and eruption into the aſthenic ones, and thereby produces the confluent ſmall-pox, of which we are afterwards to treat. Whether any thing like that is the conſequence of the meaſles, is not yet aſcertained: But, as every exceſs of excitement, as in the converſion of peripneumony into a dropſy of the cheſt, is liable to run into indirect debility, it is, therefore, ſcarce to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that the ſame thing happens to this diſeaſe, which is inferior to none in violence.</p>

                  <head>The Deſcription of the violent Eryſipelas.</head>
                  <p>CCCLXXXII. The violent Eryſipelas is a phlegmaſia, always beginning with pyrexia, and followed by inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The inflammation is ſeated in ſome external part of the body, ofteneſt in the face, ſometimes in the throat, with redneſs, of an unequal edge, ſomewhat raiſed, creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one place to another, and attended with a ſenſe of burning.</p>

CCCLXXXIII. It is peculiar to this inflammation, and foreign from the other general ones, to invade the corpus mucoſum. To aſſign a reaſon for which is of no conſequence; ſince this inflammation does not differ from the others either in the operation of the exciting powers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it, or in that of the remedies which remove it.</p>
                  <p>CCCLXXXIV. The cauſe of the redneſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, in this as well as in every caſe, is an exceſſive quantity of blood in the inflamed veſſels; for the queſtion about the degree of redneſs is of no importance. There is leſs ſwelling in the inflamed part, <hi>than in other ſthenic inflammations,</hi> becauſe there is <hi>here</hi> a free ſpace betwixt the ſcarf-ſkin and true ſkin, allowing the effuſed humour room to ſpread and diffuſe itſelf. The ſame is the cauſe of the ſlow motion of the inflammation, and of the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of its edges. The ſenſe of burning is owing to an acrimony <hi>of the contained fluid,</hi> acquired by ſtagnation.</p>
                  <p>CCCLXXXV. The attack of the inflammation upon the face is not more dangerous than upon any other place, except when the diatheſis, upon which it depends, is great, rendering the inflammation proportionally great<note n="(o)" place="bottom">See par. LXXXV. CCCXLIII.</note>. In which latter caſe, whatever part is inflamed, the diſeaſe muſt be held for a ſevere one; but ſtill ſeverer, if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation ſeizes the face; in which caſe a great tumult of affection internally accompanies the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>CCCLXXXVI. When ſuch a ſthenic diatheſis, and affection of the head depending on it, happens, no diſeaſe is more dangerous, none more rapid in its race to death; while in a mild diatheſis no diſeaſe is milder.</p>

The reaſon of the greater joints being affected in this diſeaſe, and the leſſer ones in the gout, is the following: In rheumatiſm, becauſe both the reſt of the diſeaſe and the pains depend upon a violent ſthenic diatheſis: therefore it is, that the greater joints, which, for the reaſons aſſigned, undergo more of the diatheſis, have alſo a greater ſhare of the diſeaſe.

In this way infants undergo wonderful viciſſitudes of excitement, and within the ſhorteſt ſpaces of time.

The biaſs, in favour of the alexipharmac practice, for the cure of catarrh and meaſles, he never got over. His theories were vague, but with reſpect to the practice in the diſeaſes among which his refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation lay, they were innocent. He attained not any idea of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of diſeaſes depending on debility: And his practice was hurtful in them: He fell a victim to his gout, which could not have happened had he been acquainted with but one diſeaſe of the debility. His practice, even when right, was deſtitute of principle: He had no ſort of compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the doctrine of life as a whole, and as a department of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge diſtinct from all others. It would have been lucky, however, for poſterity, had his ſucceſſors done as much in aſthenic, as he did in ſthenic diſeaſes.

Catarrh is a phlegmaſia, in which, to the general ſymptoms mentioned before<note n="(u)" place="bottom">CCCXXXI.</note>, are added cough; hoarſeneſs; and firſt a ſuppreſſion, or ſlight encreaſe of the excretion from the noſe, ſauces, and bronchia, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed afterwards by a further encreaſe; ariſing from ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulant powers, often heat alone, but chiefly after a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious application of cold; and to be removed by debilitating powers, often by cold alone, guarding againſt heat<note n="(x)" place="bottom">See par.

                  <p>CCCCVIII. The explanation of the cough is the ſame as that given before. But it is freer, <hi>than in peripneumony,</hi> and not avoided, becauſe there is no inflammation in the neighbourhood to aggravate it, and raiſe pain<note n="(y)" place="bottom">See par. CLX. CCCLV.</note>.</p>
                  <p>CCCCIX. That the hoarſeneſs is owing to a ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the vapour that ſhould be exhaled into the bron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, may be known from this; that, when the hoarſeneſs has remained long, almoſt without expectoration and cough, or with a moderate degree of them, while the ſthenic diatheſis continued in full force, and did not abate in the bronchia; upon the diatheſis giving way, and the expectoration and cough becoming more free, the hoarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs abates, or goes off. That this can be effected by a
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:022373_0259_0FB86853C7905720"/>
ſtimulus of that kind and degree, that conſtitutes ſthenic diatheſis, is ſhown by <hi>the effect of</hi> ſtrained ſpeaking produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing temporary hoarſeneſs, by ſilence removing the hoarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and cold drink relieving it.</p>
                  <p>CCCCX. The ſuppreſſion of excretion is that of the mucus and exhalable fluid, related before<note n="(z)" place="bottom">See par. CCCCVIII.</note>, and it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the ſame explanation that was formerly given.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXI. That ſtimulants produce catarrh is evident from this, that heat alone, fulneſs in food, ſtrong drink, and moderate exerciſe, for certain produce it; cold, cold drink, ſpare diet, and reſt, as certainly and effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it. It was, therefore, a very unlucky miſtake, to think it aroſe from cold alone, and was to be cured by heat.

                  <p>CCCCXIII. The ſcarlet pyrexia is an exanthema<note n="(c)" place="bottom">See CCCXXX.</note>; about the fourth day of which, or later, the face ſwells ſomewhat, and at the ſame time the ſkin is here and there affected with a red effloreſcence, and then checquered with large ſpots; which are afterwards to unite, and in three days to end in little ſcales, as if branny ones. This erup-does not ariſe, but in conſequence of ſthenic diatheſis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from another ſource. And there is another ſimilar to this, which accompanies an oppoſite diſeaſe, afterwards to be mentioned.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXIV. The eruption, appearing at a certain time, and remaining for ſome time, muſt be imputed to the fermentation, requiring a certain time, different in different diſeaſes, and is to be explained in a ſimilar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as before<note n="(d)" place="bottom">See par.

                  <p>CCCCXV. The ſwelling of the face depends upon a greater degree of ſthenic diatheſis there, than any other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual part. And we are to imagine, that, beſides the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful powers that uſually produce it, it is encreaſed by the contagious matter, now approaching the ſurface.</p>

Hence, after its application, the diſeaſe that ariſes is ſometimes ſthenic, as this is, of which we have given a definition, ſometimes aſthenic, as that diſeaſe which we are afterwards to mention in its proper place.

                  <p>CCCCXVIII. The number of puſtules and crouded eruption is occaſioned not by the nature of the contagious matter, nor by its quantity, but by the ſthenic diatheſis, in ſo far as it is induced by the ſthenic hurtful powers, in which the matter has very little participation<note n="(f)" place="bottom">See par.

                  <p>CCCCXXXI. Although, in the diſeaſes that have juſt now been mentioned<note n="(r)" place="bottom">from CCCCXXV. to CCCCXXXII.</note>, the pulſe is commonly ſaid, and believed, to be not at all affected, that, however is not exactly the truth; for in mania, ſo long as it continues to be a ſthenic diſeaſe<note n="(s)" place="bottom">that is, ſo long as it is really mania,</note>, more or leſs of ſthenic ſtate can be perceived<note n="(t)" place="bottom">The characteriſtic of hardneſs of the pulſe is never wanting, and therefore alſo fulneſs.

                  <head>The Deſcription of Morbid Watchfulneſs.</head>
                  <p>CCCCXXXII. Pervigilium, or morbid watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is a ſthenic apyrexia<note n="(u)" place="bottom">See par. CCCCXXV.</note>; in which there is no ſleep,
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:022373_0265_0FB868620E09EEE0"/>
or no ſound ſleep, and the mind, in a ſtartled ſtate, is agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with vivid, ſtrong, or uneaſy impreſſions.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXXXIII. The hurtful powers, that produce perviligium, are the ſame with thoſe, that produce mania, but inferior in force. It is evidently produced by hard thinking, commotion, or diſturbance of mind, in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to other hurtful powers. The degree of thought, that has that effect, is not ultimately exceſſive; for, if it were, by effecting a temporary waſte of the excitability, it would produce ſound ſleep; or if it repelled ſleep, it could only act ſo, by means of indirect debility, the conſideration of which is foreign from this place<note n="(x)" place="bottom">See CXLI.</note>. And the ſame is the degree of diſturbance of feeling, that proves hurtful, in ſo far as it produces this diſeaſe: Every ultimate exceſs of which<note n="(y)" place="bottom">See CXLI.</note>, either ends in ſleep, or induces that vigilance, of which indirect debility is the cauſe. But it is not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle operation of the intellectual faculty, or of the ſtate of any paſſion, or one that happens but rarely, that proves adequate to the effect. For the effect, in that caſe, would be either too ſlight, or of too ſhort continuance; to merit the title of diſeaſe. It is an often returning, or deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, irritation upon the brain, and, therefore; one that leaves a laſting impreſſion, which has any conſiderable force in producing this diſeaſe. In this laſt way, an eager, inordinate, and vaſt deſire for the attainment of high ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of purſuit, the impulſe that hurries on to the revenge of a great injury, and the horror that ariſes upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration of it, the fear of future puniſhment for crimes, are held up to us as productive of high commotion of mind, in the examples of Cataline, Oreſtes, and Francis Spira. As often, therefore, as the mind is ſo excited in its ideas and paſſions, as not to be capable of being compoſed to reſt and ſound ſleep, after a certain ſhort continuance of thoſe,
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:022373_0266_0FB8686395B36F68"/>
or other ſtimuli; ſo often are we to conclude, that this diſeaſe takes place.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXXXIV. As the hurtful powers juſt now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned<note n="(z)" place="bottom">See the par. CCCCXXX. and CCCCXXXIII.</note>, produce this diſeaſe; ſo there are others, which belong not to this place, <hi>but</hi> are to be mentioned, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo repel ſleep.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXXXV. To pervigilium belong all the hurtful powers that have been already mentioned in mania<note n="(a)" place="bottom">See from CCCCXXVI. to CCCCXXXII.</note>, whether acting within or without the brain, but acting with leſs force, and which yield to the aſthenic plan of cure.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXXXVI. As the powers ſtimulating vigour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly in this way<note n="(b)" place="bottom">See CCCCXXXIII.</note>, and without any diminution of their ſum of ſtimulating, produce pervigilium; from that we learn that the cauſe of this diſeaſe is the ſame with that of the reſt of the ſthenic form of diſeaſes<note n="(c)" place="bottom">from CXLI to CXLVIII.</note>, and that the ſame is the ſtate of body in which every one of thoſe diſeaſes conſiſt: Nor is it underſtood, that different hurtful powers, but preciſely the ſame, with only a variation in the proportion of their force, which often happens to other ſthenic diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes precede <hi>this diſeaſe.</hi>
                  </p>

On the contrary, it is as much ſtronger than in health, or in the prediſpoſition to aſthenic diſeaſes, or in thoſe diſeaſes themſelves, as there is more vigour, and more excitement upholding that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, in the ſyſtem<note n="(e)" place="bottom">For a proof of their vigour maniacs have often four times the ſtrength, they uſed to have in health.</note>.

But, if the brain in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and in mania, is much more affected than the reſt of the body; there is nothing unuſual in that circumſtance; it being an univerſal fact with reſpect to both diſeaſes and the prediſpoſition to them, that ſome part is more affected <hi>than any other part</hi>

                  <head>A Deſcription of Obeſity.</head>
                  <p>CCCCXXXVIII. Obeſity is a ſthenic apyrexia<note n="(g)" place="bottom">See CCCCXXV.</note>; in which in conſequence of an exceſs of health, rich living, eſpecially in the article of food, and an eaſy ſedentary way of life, the ſat riſes to the degree of incommoding the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXXXIX. That obeſity, ſo defined, is a diſeaſe, is underſtood from the definition of diſeaſe<note n="(h)" place="bottom">See IV.</note>; and that it is a ſthenic diſeaſe, appears from the certain ſigns of ſthenic diatheſis in it. Of which, the ſtrong action of the ſtomach, whether the apetite or the digeſtion be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note n="(i)" place="bottom">See par. CCLXII.</note>, and the ſtrength of the other digeſtive organs, are a glaring proof.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXL. And as in this diſeaſe, the ſtimulus of the exciting powers, raiſes the excitement above that degree of it which ſuits good health, to that in which ſthenic diatheſis conſiſts, without which laſt there could not be ſuch force in the <hi>action of the</hi> ſtomach, and of the organs that form chyle and blood; ſo, it is in common to this with the other diſeaſes called ſthenic apyrexiae that the ſum of all the ſtimuli is much leſs than in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſeaſes of the ſame form, that is, thoſe with pyrexia and inflammation; that it never riſes to the extreme height at which indirect debility is produced, and is never indeed
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:022373_0268_0FB86869C4E403A0"/>
ſo great as to be ſufficient to have any conſiderable effect on the heart and veſſels.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXLI. But it happens to all thoſe diſeaſes, that both theſe laſt and all the other functions, get ſomewhat above the ſtandard of the ſound functions, and a great deal above aſthenic diatheſis. And the ſthenic apyrexiae differ from the other ſthenic diſeaſes chiefly in this, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing powers keep much within that degree <hi>of force,</hi> that waſtes the excitability much; as is perceived from the proof of the effect; for they are diſeaſes of much longer ſtanding than any other aſthenic diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXLII. From which fact, however, much the brain may be affected by its own proper ſtimuli; however great the quantity of blood in its veſſels may be; unleſs to the excitement ariſing from theſe, that <hi>excitement,</hi> which the other ſtimulant powers produce, be added, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the general effect will be much leſs, and that the united energy of all the powers has far more effect, than the ſeparate force of any.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXLIII. The diatheſis, then, in theſe diſeaſes, is, upon the whole, leſs than in the reſt of the ſthenic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; that of a part, as of the brain in mania and pervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilium, and of the blood-veſſels in obeſity, is pretty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. The whole is in general as great as that in the prediſpoſition to the other diſeaſes, and exceeding its force in the labouring part. Hence it comes out, that, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the nature of thoſe other diſeaſes, and ſimilar to the prediſpoſition to them, they are uſually of long ſtanding and duration, and for this reaſon, that the mediocrity of the ſum of ſtimulant operation never conſumes the excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and always produces too much excitement. The great tumult of ſymptoms in the brain and <hi>blood</hi>-veſſels in theſe diſeaſes does not imply a great ſum of excitement, for this reaſon, that the affection of a part, however for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, compared with the affection of all the reſt of the
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:022373_0269_0FB8686D337B2B30"/>
body, is infinitely inferior in its degree<note n="(k)" place="bottom">See par. XLIX. to LIII.</note>. However much, then, any ſtimulus preſſes upon a part, and from that ſpreads at large over the reſt of the body; unleſs, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, other ſtimuli, applied to other parts, ſuſtain its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſo as that the ſum of the operation of them all may deeply affect the whole body: the effect of the ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtimulus, making a figure in a part, will be leſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in the reſt of the body: In fine, it muſt be kept in mind, that every violent diſeaſe always ariſes from the excitement which the united force of ſeveral ſtimuli has produced.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXLIV. In theſe ſthenic apyrexiae, as a certain part, the brain in the two firſt, and the blood veſſels in the laſt<note n="(l)" place="bottom">See par. CCCCXLIII.</note>, is much more affected, and in greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than in the other ſthenic diſeaſes, becauſe the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the part is much leſs ſupported by ſtimuli acting upon the other parts; ſo the ſtimuli, acting in that way upon the labouring parts, are, however, underſtood to affect the reſt of the body, though leſs conſiderably. That this is the fact, is proved by there being <hi>in this caſe,</hi> no aſthenic diatheſis, and evidently ſuch a ſthenic one, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the prediſpoſition to other diſeaſes of the ſthenic form; by the remedies, which affect other parts, as it will by and by appear, being aiding in the cure here, and by powers of a contrary nature, always proving hurtful. Whence, it is an evident and certain truth, even here, where it might have been leaſt expected, that every ſtimulus that affects a part, affects the whole body, upon account of the excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility being one uniform, undivided, property over the whole.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXLV. With reſpect to obeſity in particular; that the other hurtful powers, as well as food, have more or leſs effect, one may know from the certain fact of the
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:022373_0270_0FB8686EC7B8A388"/>
digeſtive powers, which depend upon the influence of theſe <hi>powers,</hi> being of ſuch force and vigour, as to perform their function<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> more perfectly <hi>in fat perſons,</hi> than in others, who are, nevertheleſs, not by any means weak. Yet theſe hurtful powers are applied in a degree ſhort of that, which being ultimately exceſſive, or approaching nearly to that, puts an end to excitement by waſting the excitability, or which tends, by a high degree of diſturbance, to exhauſt the body.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXLVI. Thus paſſions are not with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons too ſtimulant; a circumſtance known to the generality of mankind, among whom it is an adage, that fat perſons are commonly good natured<note n="(m)" place="bottom">This muſt be taken with more than grains of allowance; ſince ſuch is the effect of the different motives to human action received from example and education, that the paſſions themſelves are drawn into a ſubſerviency to every perſon's predominant purſuit. I have known a perſon in Edinburgh get great credit for his integrity, though that was not extraordinary, from roughneſs of manners and an affectation of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionateneſs, while the diſſimulation of that real diſpoſition is the more general engine among men of promoting their intereſt.

They are averſe to bodily motion, by which all the functions, and particularly that of the veſſels, are much excited, and the perſpiration proportionally promoted; and <hi>they have</hi> ſo far reaſon for it, that all motion is more fatiguing to them than to others.

                  <p>CCCCXLVII. After explaining the peculiarities of theſe diſeaſes; <hi>it is now to be obſerved,</hi> that, ſince the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a part in general diſeaſe, depends upon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection, is of the ſame kind, ariſes from the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing powers, and is removed by the ſame remedies<note n="(o)" place="bottom">See part firſt, Chap.

It is with propriety, then, that all the diſeaſes that have been treated of, have been reduced not firſt to two genera, and after to ſpecies, but, without regard either to genera or ſpecies, only to two forms.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXLVIII. Further, as in all thoſe diſeaſes the whole morbid ſtate, either in ſo far as it is univerſal in the ſyſtem, or confined to a part, proves hurtful by giving too much excitement; and as the remedies, that remove the general morbid ſtate, alſo remove the portion of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a part, and are never to be directed to a part<note n="(p)" place="bottom">See par. LVI. and XCII.</note> with the view of removing, by their action upon it, the diſeaſe, as if all locked up in it; the meaning of all that is, to lay a ſure foundation for the eſtabliſhment of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeries, or ſcale, of encreaſing ſtrength from perfect

                  <p>CCCCXLIX. Peripneumony and phrenitis in the upper end are followed by two diſeaſes, that ſometimes equal them; the violent ſmall-pox and meaſles. Theſe two are ſucceeded by a diſeaſe, that ſometimes vies with them, the eryſipelas, when accompanied with a moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere affection of the head. Equal to this, not in danger, but for the moſt part in the degree of diatheſis; rheumatiſm comes next. Next to rheumatiſm is marked the mild and gentle eryſipelas, <hi>far ſhort of thoſe above it in violence,</hi> and claiming nearly an equal place to the ſthenic cynanche, being much more nearly allied to the latter than any of the former. Thoſe are the diſeaſes accompanied with pyrexia and inflammation.</p>

Cold diminiſhes the eruption in the ſmall-pox: It makes it diſappear in the meaſles. What then? Take a nearer view of the fact: Is its effect in both theſe caſes to be ſuppoſed the ſame, or different? How comes any perſon to know, that the matter, which has diſappeared, is driven into the interior parts? What proof will you bring of that?

good ſenſe, that, a great part of mankind, even thoſe who take upon them the buſineſs of teaching and taking the lead of others, in no caſe, ever think of exerciſing a moment's reflection of their own? But, in this caſe, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that the action of cold is peculiar, becauſe, after the eruption, <hi>which it is ſuppoſed to check,</hi> has diſappeared, all the ſymptoms encreaſe in rage and violence.

If it was by the former, the cauſe of the miſchief muſt be imputed to them; which, as has been ſaid juſt now<note n="(b)" place="bottom">in the laſt paragraph but one.</note>, produce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive excitement after a previous application of cold, and more than without it; if the latter, <hi>or debilitating powers were uſed,</hi> then there would not be wanting a ſuſpicion, that cold had a concern in the effect. But it is not ſo: And, in every caſe, in which the action of cold has been followed by ſthenic diatheſis, the true cauſe of that effect is not ſufficiently guarding againſt the ſtimulus of heat, as well as that of other noxious powers. And this is moſt clearly proved by the uſe of heat being poſitively ordered, inſtead of being forbid, in the common practice. Nor is that to be wondered at: For if the cauſe of catarrh<note n="(c)" place="bottom">See from CCCCVII. to CCCCXII.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived phyſicians ſo much, the catarrhal ſymptoms in the meaſles could not fail to deceive them.

If that doctrine heſitated not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſweating in the rage of a peripneumony, and that too by means of the moſt heating ſtimulant powers; does it therefore follow that a plan of cure muſt be admitted, which rejects the certain and ſafe uſe of that remedy, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the moſt gentle means? If it was the opinion of
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:022373_0287_0FB868950BAE99C0"/>
Dr. Sydenham, that heat ſhould be avoided in the cure of ſthenic diſeaſes, <hi>which was quite right,</hi> as heat certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the excitement; are we, for that reaſon, to avoid that tolerable degree of heat, which accompanies a remedy the moſt powerful in reſtoring the healthy ſtate, and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, deprive ourſelves of great benefit upon the whole? If ſuch perſons did not know, that ſeveral remedies dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed excitement more powerfully than <hi>any</hi> one; and, if they were to be forgiven for that; were they alſo to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for not ſeeing, what any empiric might have ſeen, that is, that ſome things were of ſervice, and others of diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; was that want not of genius, which is not required of them, but of common ſenſe, alſo to be pardoned? If thinking without a leader, and making any ſort of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, was too much, and not to be expected from them; is it not ſomewhat ſurpriſing, that out of a thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who had treated of every part of medicine, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained different ſentiments from one another, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure right, and, no doubt, wrong too, they could ſqueeze no information, but always trod in the footſteps of one ſingle man?</p>
                  <p>CCCCLXXVII. Sweat, therefore, after the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that has been mentioned, is to be excited, and ſo much the more determinedly, if there ſhould ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtill wanting to the complete return of health, ſome degree of ſthenic diatheſis ſtill remaining, and a ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tendency to it ſhould appear.</p>
                  <p>CCCCLXXVIII. When the ſigns of a ſpontaneous ſweat ariſing are perceived, nothing more is to be done, but firſt to lay the clothes about the patient, remove the ſheets, put the blankets next to his body, guard againſt the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of air, and keep up the diſcharge for a ſufficient length of time, at leaſt ten or twelve hours. If, by this management, there ſhall enſue a copious and univerſal flow of ſweat, there will be no occaſion for giving a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.

After it has ſucceeded, and encreaſed the relief formerly procured; if it ſhould ſink in towards the end it, ſhould at laſt be ſupported by Dover's powder, or by laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anum alone, covering the body, ſo as that it may get as quickly as poſſible to the ſurface, till the expected bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit be obtained. And to this management it muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that, if a draught of cold water be ſometimes given, and then the body well covered up and properly managed, the buſineſs often ſucceeds to our wiſh. But, as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſes, that belong to this part of our indication, the ſweating muſt then only be ſet on foot, when the medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity of the diatheſis, procured by the other remedies, will permit; ſo in the ſmall-pox and meaſles, becauſe there is occaſion for a certain time to allow the matter to paſs away, we muſt alſo keep that in our eye, and never be too early in making trial of this remedy. Laſtly, if the heat ſhould happen to prove hurtful, if at any time the flow of the ſweat ſhould be attended with leſs relief, or with ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, it ſhould be immediately ſtopped: For it was not for no purpoſe, but for that of making the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſupply the defects of one another, and of reducing the excitement more equally over the whole body, that a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was recommended.</p>
                  <p>CCCCLXXIX. In all the caſes of a violent diatheſis, all the remedies that have been mentioned, are more or leſs, and differently on different occaſions, in proportion as the remaining part of diatheſis may require, each in a larger or ſmaller quantity, to be brought into play, and the curative circle enlarged: And beſides them,</p>
                  <p>CCCCLXXX. Some of ſlighter conſequence, ſuch as acids and nitre; ſome of uncertain <hi>uſe,</hi> ſuch as leeching, cupping, and bliſtering, are mentioned, as of the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Of theſe, the acids, in ſo far as they render the drink more agreeable, and, in an affection of the lungs do not produce cough, and prove, in a certain meaſure,
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:022373_0289_0FB86898C9B49E80"/>
refrigerant, are to be permitted; and more certainly, if there ſhould be a deſire for them. Every body ſhould know, that the refrigerant power of nitre is leſs than is commonly thought. In rheumatiſm, and the ſthenic cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanche if the latter ſhould be unuſually ſevere, bliſters, leeches, and cupping-glaſſes, applied in the neighbourhood of the inflamed parts, may, in ſome meaſure, be of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Nor does there ſeem to be any reaſonable objection to the clapping a cap of recently dug-up earth upon the head in the caſe of phrenitis.</p>

                  <p>CCCCLXXXII. In all theſe caſes, not even with the exception of rheumatiſm, which depends upon a very great diatheſis, bleeding is not neceſſary; and with the exception of that diſeaſe, bleeding, with any degree of freedom, is hurtful: For, when the excitement is not the greateſt, and, on the contrary, is moderate, ſcarce exceeding that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that produces the prediſpoſition to other diſeaſes; in that caſe it is abſurd to make uſe of a moſt debilitating power, by way of a remedy, as if we had to combate a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry violent diſeaſe. And, ſince the intention in bleeding is to prevent an ultimate exceſs of exciting power from
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:022373_0290_0FB8689A9C2035E8"/>
producing a ceſſation of excitement in death, an event of which there is not the leaſt danger, in a moderate diatheſis, ſuch as that, which is the cauſe of the diſeaſes here in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for that reaſon, the cure muſt be adapted to the cauſe, and bleeding muſt be either abſtained from altogether, or very ſparingly uſed.</p>
                  <p>CCCCLXXXIII. It is not, therefore, only in diſeaſes of debility, which belong to the other form (in moſt of which it has, nevertheleſs, been, and ſtill is, the cuſtom, to ſpill more or leſs of the vital fluid); but alſo in all the diſeaſes of this form, except the very violent ones, that the lancet is to be reſtrained.</p>
                  <p>CCCCLXXXIV. Though in rheumatiſm the diathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis often runs conſiderably high, the uſual profuſe bleeding, is not, however, required. For, as every diatheſis is always greater in ſome parts than in any other equal one, ſo it is with the ſthenic diatheſis <hi>in this caſe;</hi> which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound much greater upon the ſurface of the body, than in any other equal ſpace within. And the reaſon is, that the moſt powerful noxious agent, heat, ſucceeding to cold, or ſo alternating with it, that its own ſtimulus is encreaſed by its effect<note n="(r)" place="bottom">See XXXVII.</note>, directs its principal energy to the ſurface of the body. Hence, after exceſſive bleeding, the diſeaſe, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, often obſtinately recurs. The cauſe of which fact, if the principles of this doctrine be well underſtood, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obſcure. Bleeding diminiſhes the ſthenic diatheſis chiefly in the red veſſels, leſs in any of their extremities, leaſt of all in the perſpiratory veſſels, and thoſe diſpoſed of in the tract of the muſcles; and ſtill leſs in the laſt, becauſe the operation of the bleeding is counteracted by that of heat: Which is an explanation confirmed by the certain teſtimony of phyſicians; who often complain that their favorite remedy ſails them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="277" facs="unknown:022373_0291_0FB8689BC8A0B998"/>
CCCCLXXXV. Upon which account, ſweating, which we ſpoke of <hi>ſo</hi> lately, is remarkably adapted to <hi>she cure of</hi> this diſeaſe: To it, therefore, after a previous bleeding to twelve ounces, and obſerving the rule of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature and diet before directed, muſt we have immediate recourſe, if the diatheſis happens to be conſiderably vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and is ſignalized by heat <hi>of the body,</hi> by pains raging moſt in the night time, and by a ſtrong and hard pulſe. In order to render the ſweat univerſal, and of ſufficient du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it ſhould be brought out by Dover's powder, or laudanum, <hi>as before</hi> hinted, and kept up for twelve hours in full <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>CCCCLXXXVI. In this caſe, after the ſweating courſe, and alſo in that of a ſimple ſynocha, of the ſcarlet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ever, of the ſthenic ſore-throat, of catarrh, eryſipelas, and the gentle ſmall-pox and meaſles, when the diatheſis is ſomewhat conſiderable, but far ſhort of that rage which conſtitutes the caſe of cure firſt taken notice off; we ſhould uſe either a very ſmall bleeding, and then chiefly the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations before-mentioned<note n="(s)" place="bottom">See CCCV.</note>; then a ſlight and ſhort ſweat ought to be kept up not longer than eight or ten hours; and, during the whole time <hi>of the cure,</hi> we ſhould go on with abſtinence, weak drink, reſt of body and mind, and cold, unleſs in the time of ſweating, and even then, with as little heat as poſſible; and, finally, with tranquillity of mind, as theſe were formerly enjoined: The united uſe of which is perfectly equal to the removal of any of theſe diſeaſes; but there will not always be occaſion for them all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="278" facs="unknown:022373_0292_0FB8689EB0BE5CF0"/>
CCCCLXXXVII. Often ſo gentle a diatheſis occurs, that one or two of them, once or twice employed, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the cure: So ſlight a diatheſis that is, in which, unleſs for a little at firſt, the ſhivering, langour, and then heat, is very moderate, pointing out a proportional ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diatheſis upon the ſurface; in which there is ſcarce any laſſitude, ſhowing the ſame moderation of diatheſis in the organs of voluntary motion; in which the vigour of the ſtomach remains, manifeſting a moderate exceſs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement in it; in which, in fine, the other functions, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole body are ſufficiently calm, and only ſuffer conſpicuouſly in the labouring part: In theſe caſes, often a ſingle purge with glauber's ſalt, often, without that, cold, reſt, and abſtinence, have conducted the morbid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement to its ſalutary degree. A thouſand times has the ſthenic cynanche, a thouſand times has catarrh and the ſimple ſynocha, nay eryſipelas itſelf with affection of the face, been in that way removed. And the ſcarlet fever is often ſo gentle as to yield to the ſame management.</p>
                  <p>CCCCLXXXVIII. In this way muſt a conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard be had to the degree of excitement and diatheſis in the method of cure, and often terms muſt be diſregarded. For, as it was with this view, that the ſimple ſynocha was before diſtinguiſhed from the phrenitic, and the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eryſipelas from the violent; ſo, it often happens, that catarrh riſes to that magnitude that threatens or brings on a peripneumony, and that the latter proceeds with much more gentleneſs than uſual. In which circumſtances, it is the degree of excitement alone, that ought to govern the phyſician, without reſpect to names.</p>
                  <p>CCCCLXXXIX. Another uſeful caution here is, to judge of the ſtate of the pulſe, of the temperature upon the ſkin, and of the ſkin in other reſpects, with good ſenſe, and due reflection upon theſe principles. The frequency of the pulſe in all ſthenic diſeaſes is moderate: With that
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:022373_0293_0FB868A069DC8D80"/>
there is conjoined ſome hardneſs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ulneſs. Whenever, therefore, the pulſe is very quick, it is to be ſuſpected, that the ſthenic diatheſis has paſſed into the aſthenic, the exceſſive excitement into a ceſſation of excitement, or that the diſeaſe has been ſthenic from the beginning. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move which doubt and aſcertain the truth, the habit of body, the age, muſt be conſidered, and an enquiry be made to know, whether the diſeaſe has been preceded, or not, by contagion. Heat of the ſkin is in common to theſe diſeaſes and fevers, which are diſeaſes of an oppſite ſtamp, and therefore a doubtful mark. Which, as it depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an interruption of perſpiration, from whatever ſource, is never to be ſtrained into a proof of the ſtate of excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And, ſince dryneſs of the ſkin, which is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the ſame diſeaſes however different from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the aſthenic diſeaſes depends upon debility; in order to know the amount of what that ſymptom means, the other ſymptoms and the exciting hurtful powers, ſhould be conſidered. In fine, the only enquiry ſhould be, whether the excitement is abundant or deficient, and all the ſigns ſhould be conſulted with that view; nor are we to judge raſhly of any peculiar form.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXC. When, therefore, the ſigns, that have been related, are compared with all the reſt and with the diathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, we are then to ſet about the antiſthenic or ſtimulant plan of cure. The violent ſthenic diſeaſes, which we firſt conſidered can ſcarce be confounded with the contrary ones; the more gentle are daily confounded. But, while it is eaſy to diſtinguiſh them from the aſthenic diſeaſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling them; if, however, any perſon ſhould think the <hi>marks of</hi> diſtinction ambiguous, let him know, that, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account of that gentleneſs, <hi>though the diſeaſe under exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination ſhould</hi> be aſthenic, blood is not even to be let, much leſs <hi>under the apprehenſion that they may turn out</hi> aſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic to which laſt ſo debilitating a power is deſtructive, as

it has <hi>ſo</hi> often <hi>already</hi> been ſaid upon former occaſions; and, with that information, let him underſtand, that his method of cure <hi>conducted</hi> in that way, will be fenced and ſecured from all miſtake. For, if the diatheſis, though ſthenic, be ſlight, bleeding will often precipitate it into the oppoſite, and will at the beſt be uſeleſs<note n="(t)" place="bottom">Suppoſe the diatheſis be two degrees above the higheſt of the points of prediſpoſition, at 57°; and bleeding to the degree of producing 35° of debilitating influence be employed; it is evident, the excitement will go down not only the 17° neceſſary to bring it to to the point of health, but ſink to 22°, that is, 3° below the range of prediſpoſition to aſthenic diſeaſe, and therefore compleat the converſion of the ſthenic into an aſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henic diſeaſe.</note>. If, on the contrary, the diſeaſe that paſſes for a ſthenic one, ſhould, in its progreſs, ſhow itſelf an evident aſthenic one; in that caſe every drop of blood that may have been taken will go to the encreaſe of the diſeaſe<note n="(u)" place="bottom">See CCLXIX.

CCCCVI. towards the end.</note>.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXCI. As abſtinence, cold, and the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the belly are ſufficient to prevent a gentle ſtate of the ſmall-pox; ſo when that proper preparatory plan has been neglected, and now a crowded eruption appears; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe, trial muſt be made alſo of the other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies<note n="(y)" place="bottom">CCCCLIII. to CCCCLXVIII.</note>, except ſweat. But ſweat muſt be avoided, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the tendency of the ſtimulus accompanying it, by encreaſing the ſthenic diatheſis on the ſurface, would be to check the perſpirable fluid, and detain the contagious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under the ſcarf-ſkin, and produce that pyrexia, ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatic of the inflammation, which is called the ſecondary fever. This particularity of cure is taken from the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity of the ſymptom juſt now mentioned, and forms
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:022373_0295_0FB868A39C9DCE40"/>
no objection to the principles of this work. In perfect conſiſtency with which, though there is all the proof that can be derived from ſure practice, that the remedies we have mentioned are ſufficient; yet, before the eruption comes on, there is nothing can be objected either to ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or bleeding, as remedies in common to this with every other ſthenic diſeaſe<note n="(z)" place="bottom">The ſmall-pox is, in one word, to be treated as any ſthenic diſeaſe, according to its degree of morbid ſtate, and the eruption is only to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded during the period of its exiſtence, either with reſpect to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of ſweating then, or of any thing elſe.</note>. In fine, as the ſucceſs of low di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, cold and purging, in this manner, is certain; at the ſame time, the other remedies, that remove ſthenic diathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, in this caſe likewiſe operate to the ſame effect<note n="(a)" place="bottom">It is not, that low diet, cold, and purging, operate by any peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity, but becauſe they debilitate to the degree, and in the manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, of the other remedies.</note>. It was proper to ſay ſo much for the ſake of ſhowing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptional ſteadineſs and univerſality of the principles of this work. Nor are we to think, that the ſmall-pox and meaſles, differ from other ſthenic diſeaſes attended with pyrexia, but in the particularity of their eruption in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a certain courſe, and not admitting of an accelerated cure.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXCII. We are not to wait the arrival of the ſymptoms of debility, that follow a violence of diatheſis, and threaten certain death by indirect debility, with the view, forſooth, that, when they have happened, we may cure them: On the contrary, they ought to be prevented by the early adminiſtration of the remedies, <hi>now ſo</hi> fully commented upon. If that ſhould be omitted, the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the diſeaſes that will be the conſequence, and which is altogether an aſthenic conſideration, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the aſthenic form.</p>

CCCCXCIII. As often as ſthenic diatheſis happens to be conjoined with the pyrexia, which is induced by the operation of ſtimulants, of acrid ſubſtances, of compreſſion, of obſtruction, and ſimilar hurtful powers acting upon a ſenſible part, of which we have examples in gaſtritis, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritis, nephritis, cyſtitis, hyſteritis, hepatitis, or the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the ſtomach, of the inteſtines, of the kidnies, of the bladder of urine, of the womb, of the liver<note n="(b)" place="bottom">See LXXXI.

And, when neither it nor the aſthenic diatheſis is preſent, nothing ſhould be attempted: But, if the aſthenic diatheſis ſhould be preſent, which very readily may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; the ſtimulant plan ſhould be proceeded upon, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a very bad diſeaſe<note n="(c)" place="bottom">As aſthenic diſeaſes to ſthenic ones are in the proportion of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeven to three of the hundred; ſuch alſo muſt be the frequency of prediſpoſition to them: The inference from which is, that as we are ſeldom in the moſt perfect ſtate of health, and conſequently, for the moſt part, under ſome degree of prediſpoſition, all the chances are greatly in favour of that prediſpoſition being the aſthenic one. Hence, the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of treating all local diſeaſes in the ſame way, and as if they were general ſthenic ones. Death has been too often the conſequence of that practice, when the local fault, for which it was intended, was no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In ſuch circumſtances, however fully the perſon may have lived, wine is withheld, fluid vegetable matter preſcribed, and the routine of every ſpecies of evacuation gone through. Diſmal are the conſequences of gun-ſhot wounds on this plan of cure. Turn back to the paragraphs LXXX. and LXXXI. and the notes ſubjoined to them.</note>. Nor, when that is as much as poſſibly attended to, are we to forget, that, in ſo doing, the principle affection is not touched; that, on the contrary, it is its effect, not its cauſe, that is tampered with; and that the full conſideration <hi>of ſuch caſes</hi> belongs to the local diſeaſes, afterwards to be taken notice of.</p>

CCCCXCIV. Beſides all the remedies now mentioned, it is of advantage in every degree of diatheſis to keep the mind eaſy and unruffled with paſſion or emotion; a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that in the very high degrees of the diatheſis is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly neceſſary. Our attention will eſpecially be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to this particular, when we obſerve, that the ſtimulus of thinking and of any paſſion, carried to a great height, has had a ſhare in the production of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXCV. In mania, therefore and pervigilium, this direction muſt be particularly, and as much as poſſible, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to. In the latter of which diſeaſes, thinking, and every ſtate of commotion, and more certainly an habitual practice in them, muſt be ſhunned, eſpecially before go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bed. When the patient is reſting there, he ſhould have ſtupid books read to him, all inordinate deſire, the propenſity to revenge, the remembrance of every degree of criminality, of which he may have been guilty, ſhould be diverted from his recollection<note n="(d)" place="bottom">See above CCCCXXXIII.</note>.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXCVI. That fact of great conſequence, to give corroboration to this whole doctrine, is confirmed by this other, that the ſame things, which are ſerviceable in pervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilium, or the morbid watchful ſtate, are alſo ſerviceable in mania, or madneſs, only adminiſtered in a higher degree, as that is a diſeaſe of a higher degree of excitement. Thus, it is not eaſe and tranquillity of mind that are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed here, both of which are quite gone, but a ſtate op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to that high commotion <hi>of ſpirits</hi> and irregular vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in the exerciſe of the intellectual function: And, as an exceſſive energy of the intellectual powers, or of the animal ſpirits, or both, are the moſt noxious powers in this caſe; for that reaſon, the patient ſhould be ſtruck with fear and terror, and driven, in his ſtate of inſanity, to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair: As a remedy againſt the great excitement of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans

                  <p>CCCCXCVII. If, in phrenitis the brain, in peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony the lungs, in rheumatiſm the external joints, poſſeſs more diatheſis than any other part; why may not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia and pervigilium conſiſt more in an affection of the brain, upon which the principal noxious powers act, than of the other parts, over which the influence of thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is leſs conſiderable? Laſtly, ſince remedies, the firſt action of which falls upon other parts, are of ſervice in thoſe diſeaſes<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Part I. Chap. II.</note>, that proves, that not even in them, where you might moſt be diſpoſed to believe it, the whole morbid affection depends upon the part conſpicuouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; but that the whole body is concerned in it, that the excitability is one uniform undivided property over all; that the force both of the exciting hurtful powers and of the remedies is directed to the whole, with the inequality ſo often mentioned<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Part I. Chap. IV.</note>; and that the foundations of this doctrine are ſure and ſtable.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXCVIII. As theſe are the principal hurtful powers in mania and pervigilium, and the brain principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected; ſo in obeſity, the hurtful powers moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable are animal food<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Becauſe no effect can ariſe without a cauſe, the exciting powers, therefore, muſt here have operated with more force, than in the other caſe; and if it ſhould be objected, that the circumſtances in both caſes were equal, the difference then muſt be ſet to the account of the greater vigour of the excitability in the caſe of obeſity.</note> and reſt, or ſedentary life; in conſequence of which laſt, the ſtimulus of exerciſe, which,
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:022373_0299_0FB86527169138C0"/>
by wearying and fatiguing the body, tends to indirect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, is underſtood to be wanting. But, ſince, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of uſing the ſame food, both in quality and quantity, and the ſame <hi>indulgence in</hi> reſt <hi>and caſe,</hi> ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons become fat, others continue lean; from thence it is aſcertained, that all the digeſtive powers have more force in the former, than in the latter, and conſequently, that the other exciting hurtful powers have contributed to the effect, and that a proportional excitement follows. Of the hurtful powers, that belong to this place, an eaſy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the intellectual faculty, <hi>and</hi> tranquillity of mind, which are moderate ſtimuli, favour obeſity; over ſtrained thinking, and habitual indulgence in paſſion, ſuch as that of anger, <hi>the repetition of which conſtitutes</hi> ill nature, oppoſe it. Corporeal motion, which diminiſhes the quantity of fluids in the ſyſtem, and, as often as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, proves fatiguing and debilitating, oppoſes it. Equally unfavourable to it is hard drinking; which, in a ſimilar manner, wears out the excitement, by conſtantly waſting the excitability from the high degree or long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of its ſtimulus. On the contrary, the powers that favour it, are thoſe that act gently, and with ſome exceſs: but never attain that high degree of activity, that inclines to indirect debility: They are powers that go on ſoftly and pleaſantly, that particularly keep up moderation in the perſpiration, and thereby fill the veſſels with blood; but, becauſe motion is avoided, they do not very much encreaſe the excitement of the veſſels, and by means of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of motion <hi>kept up in the latter,</hi> allow a fluid, that would otherwiſe paſs off by the external pores of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, to turn aſide into the cells of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at. Hence, though, as it has been ſaid before, an abundance of blood is indeed a very great ſtimulus; yet, without other ſtimuli, and that moſt powerful one, which muſcular motion affords; it is evident, that a conſiderable degree of ſtimulus can be borne
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:022373_0300_0FB86529C8705EB0"/>
without any conſiderable diſeaſe, and that it always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a prediſpoſition to ſthenic diſeaſes, but does not immediately bring them on. Hence, it is underſtood what place in the ſcale of exceſſive excitement, or of ſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic diatheſis, obeſity holds; what the degree of ſtimulant power is, and what the ſtimuli in particular, are that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it.</p>
                  <p>CCCCXCIX. As the degree of curative force muſt be accommodated to the degree of force in the cauſe<note n="(i)" place="bottom">See CIX.</note>; <hi>hence it muſt be obſerved,</hi> that for the cure alſo of this diſeaſe the common indication is ſufficient<note n="(k)" place="bottom">XLVIII. CCCCLIII.</note>; that is, that the exceſs of excitement muſt be reduced to the ſalutary degree, and a remedy oppoſed to every hurtful power, equal to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of it.</p>
                  <p>D. In this caſe, therefore, as food is the principal hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful power, leſs of it ſhould be given, and more exerciſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in. Theſe are ſufficient for the cure<note n="(l)" place="bottom">CCCCXCVIII.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DI. But, for the ſake of bringing both <hi>further</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as well as illuſtration of this doctrine; it is to be obſerved, that all the powers, which very much affect the excitement, and in a greater degree, than the hurtful power of this diſeaſe mentioned above, and that have a tendency, <hi>by their ſtimulant operation,</hi> to indirect debility, have the ſame effect; that they either prevent or cure obeſity, and continue productive of that effect, till <hi>they induce</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of meagerneſs which is connected with debility.</p>
                  <p>DII. The beſt method of lowering the diet, is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine a quantity of vegetable matter with a moderate por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion animal. The next <hi>rule</hi> to that, is to refrain from the latter, and uſe the former in greater abundance. The firſt of theſe is ſuitable to all ſuch perſons as are liable to diſeaſes of debility, ſuch as the gout, the indigeſtion that after a long time ſucceeds to luxury, aſthma, epilepſy, and
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:022373_0301_0FB8652B9F251178"/>
ſimilar others. The latter management is more accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to thoſe, who otherwiſe enjoy great vigour, are under prediſpoſition to ſthenic pyrexia, and in the flower of their age. But, it is not, even in the latter ſtate of the body, to be proſecuted, unleſs for a time; becauſe, ſuch is the debilitating influence of that practice, that, while it is ſufficient to remove any degree of obeſity, eſpecially with the addition of exerciſe, it is found to have ſignal efficacy in producing aſthenic diatheſis, and all the diſeaſes depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on that.</p>

               <p>DIII. THE form of aſthenic diſeaſes, and which is to be called aſthenia, for the ſake of diſtinguiſhing it from the form of ſthenic diſeaſes, which is called ſthenia, is a ſtate of the living body, in which all the functions are more or leſs weakened, often diſturbed, almoſt always with a more conſpicuous affection of ſome <hi>function.</hi> In the treatment of which, that order will be obſerved, in which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs from the ſmalleſt diſeaſe <hi>of this kind</hi> to the greateſt, through all the intermediate degrees, is to be followed out.</p>
               <p>DIV. <hi>In</hi> this <hi>part of our ſubject,</hi> there occurs a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſymptoms; of which, becauſe it is without mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and even miſleading, no uſe is to be made in marking the ſcale of diſeaſes. But, for the ſake of placing what is about to be delivered in a clearer, if not a more ſpecious, point of view, we ſhall begin with a ſimple enumeration of the principal diſeaſes to be afterwards fully treated of.</p>
               <p>DV. The aſthenic diſeaſes are macies, inquietude, or reſtleſſneſs without ſleep, the aſthenic amentia, the ſcabby
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:022373_0303_0FB8652F09398AB0"/>
eruption, the ſlight diabetes, the aſthenic ſcarlet fever, the rickets; the haemorrhaeae, or general bleeding diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſuch as menorrhaea, or a morbid exceſs of the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, epiſtaxis, or bleeding from the noſe, haemorrhois, or the piles: and alſo three morbid ſtates ſeemingly in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance oppoſite to theſe, the loitering, impaired, or ſuppreſſed menſtruation, next come thirſt, vomiting, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion, diarrhaea, or looſe belly, and colic without pain; after theſe the affections of children, as the worms, the general conſumption, called tabes, dyſentery and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lera in the gentle ſtate of theſe two; angina, the ſcurvy, the gentle hyſteria, rheumatalgia, aſthenic cough, cyſtirhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a, or mucus diſcharge from the bladder; the gout of ſtrongiſh perſons, aſthma, cramp, anaſarca, dyſpepſia with pain, the violent hyſteria, the gout of weakened perſons, the hypochondriaſis, dropſy, chin-cough, epilepſy, or the falling ſickneſs, palſy, the lock-jaw, apoplexy, tetanus; laſtly fevers, as the quartan, tertian, and quotidian, <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittents</hi> or <hi>remittents,</hi> dyſentery, and cholera, both in their violent degree, ſynochus, ſimple typhus, the gangrenous ſore throat, the confluent ſmall-pox, the peſtilential typhus, and the plague.</p>
               <p>DVI. This ſcale of aſthenic diſeaſes is to be underſtood <hi>in</hi> this way, that thoſe diſeaſes, which in their moſt uſual ſtate are ſlight, and claim a higher place in the ſcale, are ſometimes more, ſometimes moſt, violent; and thoſe that in their moſt common ſtate are ſevere, ſuch as the gout of weakened perſons, the peſtilential fevers, and the plague itſelf, ſometimes proceed with the greateſt gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<note n="(a)" place="bottom">See par. CCCCL.</note>
               </p>
               <p>DVII. The affections of parts, which often accompany thoſe diſeaſes, ſuch as ulcer, tumor, encreaſed excretion, bleeding diſcharge, inflammation, ſpaſm, convulſion, point out indeed ſome degree of debility <hi>as their cauſe,</hi> but in
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:022373_0304_0FB86532B8E5CFA8"/>
ſuch ſort that the ſame degree may happen without them. Hence, becauſe it is the influence of debility that is funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally regarded in this ſcale; with the diſeaſes, that are often conjoined with theſe affections, others, without them, as hyſteria and the cramp are blended; and, with the caſes that are accompanied with ſpaſm and convulſion, dropſy is conjoined, by keeping to the idea of an equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of debility; <hi>and all</hi> this without any regard to remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable ſymptoms, but keeping the degree of debility only in view. Neither is the violent cholera kept back from its place among fevers, which laſt are diſtinguiſhed by failure in the intellect and affections of the head, becauſe it ſhews a degree of debility equal to the febrile. The idea in proportioning this diviſion is to ſhow, that true morbid energy does not conſiſt in an affection of any parts, but of the whole body; and that the <hi>reſtoration of</hi> health is not to be attempted by a change of <hi>the ſtate of</hi> parts only, but, <hi>without excluding that,</hi> by a change of the ſtate of the whole ſyſtem.</p>

                  <head>Of the Cauſe of Menſtruation.</head>
                  <p>DXXIII. The cauſe of menſtruation is a conformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the veſſels that pour out the blood <hi>in this diſcharge,</hi> taking place at a certain time of life, that is, about the age of puberty, and a ſtimulant energy in women, more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than in the females <hi>of the other ſpecies of animals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>DXXIV. Of other animals there are very few, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males of which undergo any ſort of menſtruation out of the venereal orgaſm.</p>
                  <p>DXXV. As all the veſſels are gradually unfolded in the courſe of the growth of the body, ſo the ſame thing happens to the genital and uterine veſſels, but laſt of all to theſe. The ends of the latter, terminating, on the ſides of the womb about the age of puberty, are at laſt ſo very much expanded, as now to tranſmit firſt the ſerous part of the blood, and then, after an effort kept up for ſome time, paſs to formal blood.</p>
                  <p>CXXVI. At this time of life a great change over the whole ſyſtem takes place. Now the deſire for coition, a ſtimulus, never experienced before, produces a commotion over the whole body; and, in preference to other parts, in the genitals of both ſexes, in the female, over the whole region of the ovaria, womb, and vagina: By this ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, the uterus, its ſeat, being nearly inceſſantly ſolicited, is the more powerfully affected, the more there is of exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, hitherto acted upon by no ſuch ſtimulus, exiſting in the ſyſtem. Hence, among other organs, the muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fibres of the next veſſels, as well as the nerves interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with them, undergo the higheſt degree of excitement: This excitement encreaſing over the whole ſyſtem, again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes that in the uterus: The mutual contact of the ſexes,
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:022373_0309_0FB8653B17B19CE0"/>
whether in kiſſing, in ſhaking hands, or otherwiſe, fires both ſets of genitals, and the uterus in a remarkable manner; but the actual embrace produces the higheſt degree of that effect. The remembrance of each embrace remains, renews the dear idea of the delightful ſcene, and continues more or leſs to excite the uterus.</p>
                  <p>DXXVII. This new affection is further cheriſhed and nouriſhed by every ſtimulus that is uſually applied to the ſyſtem: Hence, in the abſence, in the preſence, of the beloved object, at all times generally, ſcarce with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>that which paſſes</hi> in dreaming, a ſtimulus ſo ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the more powerful, that its novelty implies, that the excitability in this caſe is entire, rouſes the fibres of the veſſels, already ſufficiently unfolded, to violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions. The blood is carried into the region of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus with the greateſt rapidity, a rapidity momentarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, in proportion as the blood, by powerfully diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the veſſels, and agitating them by its impetuous flow, ſtimulates the fibres more and more, and thereby encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the activity by which it is driven on. This is the firſt cauſe of menſtruation: In that way, the two circumſtances, a ſufficient enlargement of the diameters of the veſſels, and the ſtimulus acting more powerfully, from its novelty, upon the unwaſted excitability<note n="(h)" place="bottom">See DXXIII.</note>, are ſufficient for the whole buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>DXXVIII. This ſtate is not inconſiſtent with other ſtates of the body, but bears an analogy to ſome well known ones: Accordingly, different veſſels, from the <hi>mere</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their diameters, are ſubſervient to different pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: The perſpiratory veſſels are deſtined to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a vapour, the excretory veſſels of the alimentary canal to that of a thing fluid, the renal veſſels to that of a groſſer one; ſo as to take off our ſurpriſe at finding veſſels
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:022373_0310_0FB8653F9F893630"/>
fitted, by their degree of diameter, for the purpoſe of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting red blood.</p>
                  <p>DXXIX. The reaſon that the females of other animals do not menſtruate but in their orgaſm, and not at other times, is, that it is only at certain times that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to that energy of ſtimulus which produces menſtrua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>DXXX. How much is owing to the ſtimulus juſt now mentioned<note n="(i)" place="bottom">See DXXIII. DXXVI.</note>, in the production of menſtruation, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evident from the following chain of facts: Which are, that, the leſs addicted to love women are, the leſs they menſtruate; the more they give way to that paſſion, the freer do they experience this diſcharge within certain boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries; that, before puberty, and after the time of life when menſtruation ceaſes (which are the two periods, at which the fitneſs for effective love has not yet commenced, or is now paſſed,) the menſtrual diſcharge is conſtantly wanting; that the privation of enjoyment, which, by <hi>its</hi> debilitating <hi>effect,</hi> produces chloroſis<note n="(k)" place="bottom">or the green ſickneſs.</note> and other ſimilar diſeaſes, is remarkable for bringing on a menorrhoea, or a retention of menſtruation; and, finally, that girls, who are of a forward growth, of great ſtrength, and large limbs, and conſequently ſooner ripe for love, are <hi>alſo</hi> more early in menſtruation; while thoſe, who are weakly, puny, and of a ſmall ſize, and, conſequently, later in attaining to the period of puberty, are proportionally late in attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt menſtrual diſcharge. Laſtly, if, like all the other functions, that of love is limited at the ſame time by its duration and degree; and if, as the commencement of the love embraces is more or leſs early, it is proportionally more early or late in coming to its final termination, and if the duration of menſtruation does not uſually exceed that period; that fact alſo, <hi>which it certainly is,</hi> added to
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:022373_0311_0FB86541B8503E98"/>
thoſe above, gives weight to our concluſion, and ſhows, in a clearer point of view, how much menſtruation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the venereal emotion. It is to be aſſerted, therefore, again<note n="(k)" place="bottom">DXXIII. DXXVI.</note>, that, beſides the conformation of the veſſels, ſuited to <hi>the function of</hi> menſtruation, and the ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus which has been mentioned(k), there is occaſion for no other <hi>circumſtance to explain</hi> either commencement, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, or continuation, of the menſtrual diſcharge.</p>
                  <p>DXXXI. The cauſe of full menſtruation, and that of a moderate degree of it, happening within the boundaries of health, is the ſame; only differing in degree; the degree of the latter being ſmaller, and that of the former greater.</p>
                  <p>DXXXII. And, as the ſtimuli, mentioned above, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, why women menſtruate more than the females of other animals; ſo their immoderate operation upon wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſerves to ſhow, why <hi>their effect,</hi> the menſtrual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, becomes greater than natural<note n="(l)" place="bottom">Women menſtruate more than other females, becauſe they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to a higher degree of the ſtimulus, which is its cauſe; and ſuch women as are expoſed to more of the ſame ſtimulus than others, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo experience more of the effect, preciſely upon that ſame principle.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DXXXIII. The ſtimuli that produce abundant men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruation, ſhort of morbid ſtate, are unchaſte ideas, and a high energy of paſſion. In this way, the influence of reading to ones' ſelf, or to others, of converſation, of pictures, contrived to kindle up luſtful appetite, and the uncovering of parts that modeſty conceals, which all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a lively impreſſion on the imagination of the thing ſo much deſired; can be indiſtinctly felt by none perhaps but eunuchs. The ſame is the effect of nouriſhing food, and generous drink, and high ſeaſoning; and hence the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, without meat and drink love ſtarves: Likewiſe, that degree of exerciſe, or <hi>even</hi> labour, that does not prove fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing, but that keeps within the boundary of ſtimulant
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:022373_0312_0FB865429DEFD180"/>
operation; as alſo an abundance of blood, both from that circumſtance and from rich diet; laſtly, frequent and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent dalliance, or <hi>inconceſſa bujus imitatio;</hi> all theſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the menſtrual diſcharge, in proportion to the high degree of their ſtimulus, but ſtill do not carry their effect to morbid exceſs.</p>
                  <p>DXXXIV. The ſame concluſion applies to the effect of theſe ſtimuli, which was formerly applied to an over-proportion of blood producing ſthenic diatheſis: For the ultimate end of all the ſtimuli, that produce exceſſive menſtruation, is ſuch, that, if exceſſive menſtruation and an encreaſe of love be the conſequence of the exceſs of the ſtimuli, one or other of the following muſt be the effect: that is, it will either be ſuch as remains within the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of health, or ſuch, as firſt produces ſthenic diatheſis, and then, in a higher degree of it, runs rapidly into indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect debility.</p>
                  <p>DXXXV. That this is the fact, is proved by the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful powers that produce exceſſive and morbid menſtruation; and by remedies, that are ſtimulant and ſuited to fill the veſſels, removing the diſeaſe according to our late diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and alſo by the unfortunate effect of the debilitating evacuant plan of cure in the ſame diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>DXXXVI. As it is ſtimulant operation that produces both proper menſtruation and that which goes to a little exceſs; ſo, when once menſtruation is eſtabliſhed, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and ſtimulus, that have been mentioned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, are ſufficient to ſupport it. The ſame opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is renewed during every interval of menſtruation: The ſtimulus acts and quickens the motion of the blood in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part, but chiefly in that where it is moſt powerful and moſt required, that is, in the region of the womb: The blood thrown into quick motion, and ruſhing with a more rapid flow, encreaſes its cauſe, the ſtimulus: And, as this mutual ſtimulus continues inceſſantly to affect the
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:022373_0313_0FB8654406CB22C0"/>
women through the whole interval, when they are allowed ſcope of love; the uterine veſſels are gradually unfolded, till at laſt, within three weeks, or a lunar month, they are opened to their ultimate extremities: And, when the fluid, firſt ſerous for a little, and afterwards ſanguine, and afterwards ſerous again for a little, has flowed one, two, or three days, in healthy perſons, the veſſels are at laſt ſhut up.</p>
                  <p>DXXXVII. During the whole time of this proceſs, the more excitability there is, and conſequently at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of each menſtrual effort, the more violently the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus acts, and produces proportionally more excitement: And it has, from this time, always leſs and leſs effect to the end, in proportion as the excitability is more waſted; though, till the excitability, in ſo far as it has a relation to the ſtimulus, is altogether exhauſted, the ſtimulus always adds ſomething to the ſum of excitement,<note n="(m)" place="bottom">See XXXVI.</note>, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly leſs and leſs. The ſame is the explanation of the operation of food, of drink, and of all the exciting pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <p>DXXXVIII. As what has been ſaid of the ſtimulus, productive of menſtruation, is conformable to the effects of all the other ſtimuli; the ſame is its conformity to the whole ſum of menſtrual effect from the beginning to the end of the proceſs. Thus, in the beginning of that long period, the force of ſtimulus is far the greateſt, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its novelty, and the unwaſted ſtate of excitability that relates to it. At this period, above all others, love in perſons in health is exquiſite; and, in conſequence of the ſtimulus which excites it, menſtruation, when once eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, is moſt exactly performed; that is, it does not, either from deficiency or exceſs, deviate into morbid ſtate.</p>
                  <p>DXXXIX. But after the beginning of this function, and when now the office of menſtruation is eſtabliſhed;
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:022373_0314_0FB8654A3468A040"/>
becauſe in this, as well as every other function, the exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability is gradually diminiſhed in the progreſs of life, the ſtimulant power alſo has gradually leſs, and, at laſt, no effect: Conſequently, in the ſame gradual way, the power of love in women, and, in proportion, that of menſtrua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is diminiſhed, and at laſt altogether extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>DXL. While both the faculties, that of love as well as that of menſtruation, in this way decreaſe from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end; ſo, menſtruation is often interrupted, in pregnancy, in ſuckling, in the diminution or ſuppreſſion of menſtruation. This interruption in the two former i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> natural, and ſuitable to health; <hi>but</hi> in the diminution or ſuppreſſion of the menſtrual evacuation, it becomes mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</p>
                  <p>DXLI. Since the ſtimulus with the conformation of the veſſels is the cauſe of menſtruation, and the latter depends upon the former; ſo again the defect of the ſtimulus, and, therefore, of the conformation, produces both the retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, diminution, and, at laſt, the complete ſuppreſſion of the diſcharge.</p>
                  <p>DXLII. Whether ever the defect of menſtruation, like that of perſpiration, or of any internal excretion, as that in the fauces and alimentary canal, is ſometimes to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to ſthenic diatheſis, is uncertain, for this reaſon; that, while the diameters of the ſmall veſſels on the ſkin and in the inteſtines are more nearly allied to ſuch a contraction for a reaſon <hi>formerly</hi> aſſigned<note n="(n)" place="bottom">LVII. LXII. CXII. CXIII.</note>; ſo great a force of excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo high a degree of ſthenic diatheſis, as would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſhut up veſſels deſtined to the tranſmiſſion of blood, is not eaſy to be conceived. And the doubt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> further encreaſed by <hi>a certain fact; which is,</hi> that both in the retardation of the menſtrua, and in all the degrees of their diminution to their total ſuppreſſion, when local af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:022373_0315_0FB8654B89DF5BE8"/>
is out of the queſtion, there are evident proofs of a debilitating cauſe.</p>
                  <p>DXLIII. To aſcertain that fact, which is of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conſequence for this reaſon, that it directly intereſts the method of cure, and, if not explained, would leave a gap in our principles; <hi>we have to obſerve,</hi> that, as ſome men, in conſequence of the ſtimulus of exceſſive love, in the caſe of a moſt beautiful woman being the ſubject of it, have, by means of ſthenic diatheſis, been ſo inflamed as to fall into a temporary fit of impotence, and been cured by bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo, beſides that that is a rare fact<note n="(o)" place="bottom">I remember one inſtance in Dr. Whyte, and I think I have only heard of another.</note>, it is not very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the patulous uterine veſſels can be ſo contracted in their diameters, as to be incapable of tranſmiting their fluid. Nay facts contradict it: The retardation or defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of menſtruation receive a temporary alleviation from the debilitating plan of cure; but the diſcharge is not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally alſo brought back, on the contrary it is more kept off: But allowing an over-proportion of blood and an exceſs of ſtimulus to be the cauſe of the firſt deficiency of menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, after it has been removed by bleeding and the reſt of the debilitating plan of cure, can it again be the cauſe of a diſeaſe, which reſiſts a degree of evacuant and debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating plan of cure, that would cure ten peripneumonies? And ſince any ſtimulus, as well as <hi>that of</hi> an over-propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of blood, may, from its exceſſive force, go into indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect debility; why may not the ſame thing happen in a diſappointment in love, and firſt deficiency of menſtruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and, in both caſes, atony, uſhering in manifeſt debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not exceſs of tone, be the cauſe? As peripneumo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, where the over-proportion of blood and ſthenic diathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis is by far the greateſt <hi>that ever happens,</hi> in conſequence of indirect debility paſſes into hydrothorax; why may not a ſimilar cauſe in this caſe produce a ſimilar effect?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="302" facs="unknown:022373_0316_0FB8654D08AA8950"/>
DXLIV. The cauſe, then, of deficient menſtruation, whether partial or complete, is a languid excitement over the whole body, eſpecially in the uterus, from a deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the ſtimulus of love<note n="(p)" place="bottom">DXXIII. DXXVI. DXXIX.</note>, and of all thoſe ſtimuli that ſupport it<note n="(q)" place="bottom">DXXVI. DXXVII. DXXXII. DXXXVII.</note>, and from a penury, or under-proportion of blood.</p>
                  <p>DXLV. That that is the fact, is proved by the hurtful powers mentioned in the retardation of menſtruation, and other debilitating ones in every deficiency of that diſcharge, producing each diſeaſe; it is proved by the ſtimulant and filling plan of cure removing it, and alſo by the hurtful effect of the debilitating plan of cure<note n="(r)" place="bottom">DXXXV.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DXLVI. The remedies for the cure of retarded men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruation are, rich food, generous drink, geſtation, exerciſe accommodated to the ſtrength, pediluvium and ſemicupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, or the warm bath of the under-extremities, and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in love<note n="(s)" place="bottom">DXXVI.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DXLVII. The ſame remedies are required for the ſuppreſſion, and the ſame, but inferior in their degree of force, for the diminution of menſtruation: When there is an unuſual force of the diſeaſe, either in degree or durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we muſt have recourſe to the aſſiſtance of the diffuſible ſtimuli.</p>

                  <p>DXLVIII. Menorrhoea is an effuſion of blood from the uterus, or an over-copious menſtruation, or too long a continuance of it in a more moderate degree of the exceſs, accompanied by all the ſymptoms of aſthenia.</p>
                  <p>DXLIX. This diſeaſe is occaſioned not by an over-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of blood, not by a vigorous ſtate of body, but by

an over-proportion of the former, and an exhauſtion of the latter. The hurtful powers, therefore, that produce it, are food not nouriſhing enough, or too ſmall a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what is ſo, watery drink, or that over-proportion of pure ſtrong drink that produces indirect debility, exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive heat, or cold not prevented from its debilitating opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by any ſtimulus, and ſalacity.</p>

Its moſt frequent ſource by far is weakneſs, being the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant ſometimes of too long ſuckling, ſometimes of the diarrhoea incident to women, waſted with a long courſe both of that and repeated pregnancies.</p>
                  <p>DLVII. There are two cauſes of as many affections which have got only one name between them, that of thirſt: The one is ſthenic, the other aſthenic<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The former ariſes from the ſtimulus of ſalt, of rich and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

meals, of heat and labour, and ſome others; never ending in vomiting till the ſthenic ſtate is over, which is ſeldom. Its cure, with which we have here no concern, is cold water and the ſeveral debilitating powers.</p>
                  <p>DLVIII. The aſthenic thirſt, which is our preſent ſubject, depends always on pure debility, ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct, ſometimes direct<note n="(b)" place="bottom">CLXXXV.</note>. Its tendency is always to ſtomach ſickneſs, and, as that encreaſes, to vomiting<note n="(c)" place="bottom">See CLXXXVII. CLXXXVIII.</note>; and when the vomiting becomes any way conſiderable, the conſequence is that moſt acute pain, which a cramp in the ſtomach produces<note n="(d)" place="bottom">See par. CLXXXIX.</note>, and the other affection formerly explained<note n="(e)" place="bottom">CXC. to CXCV. and from that to CXCVIII.</note>. This progreſs is ſpontaneous, direct, and for the moſt part rapid.</p>
                  <p>DLIX. The hurtful powers here are all debilitating. The indirectly debilitating hurtful powers are, debauch in eating and drinking<note n="(f)" place="bottom">CXXVIII.

DLX. A corruption of the common maſs of fluids, whether it be called acrimony, or putrefaction, has no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in the cauſe; becauſe, while life remains, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the veſſels upon their reſpective fluids continues, ſuch a faulty ſtate of the fluids cannot make its havock over ſuch an extent of the ſyſtem, that being only the effect of a ceſſation of motion of the fluids under heat; nor can it happen, but in the extreme veſſels and excretory ducts, which, by their atony, do occaſion ſuch a ceſſation of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and likewiſe in the alimentary canal.</p>
                  <p>DLXI. The cauſe of this thirſt is the common one of every aſthenia, but predominant in the throat and ſtomach, upon account of the atony of the ſalivary, and other excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ducts<note n="(s)" place="bottom">CLXXXVI. CLXXXVII.</note>.</p>

In a ſlighter degree of thirſt a glaſs or two of brandy, or of any ſimilar ſpirit, or, which is a better rule, given till the complaint is removed, is ſufficient. It ſhould be either pure, or diluted with a very little hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note n="(t)" place="bottom">The addition of cold water counteracts, that of hot co-operates with, the effect, which has been aſcertained in a thouſand trials.</note>.

                  <p>DLXXI. The hurtful powers, producing all thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, are in common to them with every aſthenia; that is, they are every thing that has an effect of debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the whole ſyſtem, and eſpecially the alimentary canal: Such as, at this age, are, milk not nouriſhing enough, and at the ſame time aceſcent and flatulent; want of food, or made of watery matter and bread; cold, and moiſture, the latter encreaſing the effect of the former; habitual vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting and purging; too little dandling; miſtiming ſleep, and meals, and every part of management; naſtineſs; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure air; a neglect of natural likings and diſlikings.</p>
                  <p>DLXXII. The remedies are the converſe of all thoſe, nouriſhing exciting milk; three or four meals a day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting chiefly of warm milk, pure animal ſoups, not weak, with a mixture of flower of bread of the ſame kind; heat without being carried ſo far as to produce ſweat, or too much redneſs, and free from moiſture; laying aſide every ſort of evacuation; a great deal of dandling and geſtation; a proper timing of ſleep, of food; and of every part of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of theſe delicate ſyſtems; cleanlineſs; tepid ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in cold weather, and cold bathing in warm; and pure air, being out in the fields as often as poſſible in all but moiſt weather; ſuch a judicious attention to deſires and propenſities, as not to neglect ſcratching any part that itches<note n="(b)" place="bottom">See above DXVIII.</note>.</p>

If thoſe ſhould not ſucceed to the <hi>phyſician's</hi> mind, which will ſeldom be the caſe; in the ſame affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and more certainly in worms, and ſtill more certainly in the tabes, or general conſumption, with the remedies that have been ſpoken of, the more diffuſible ſtimuli of opium and muſk ſhould be alternated.

The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy termination of them hitherto, is to be imputed not to their cauſe, but to the depravity of the common method employed for their cure<note n="(d)" place="bottom">I cannot help repeating again, becauſe the importance of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject calls upon me to do ſo; that the practice of the new plan of cure, in all the diſeaſes of children, as well as in the others lately ſpoken of, has ever ſucceeded in my hands, as well as in thoſe of my pupils, to a miracle. I cannot ſay that I ever met with an inſtance where it could be ſaid to have failed. Let then who will compare that account with the known mortality that is every day the reſult of any other practice yet thought of in the profeſſion.</note>: Nay, though they do dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into local affection, as in the inſtance of the tabes, or general conſumption, ending in an obſtruction of the

                  <p>DLXXVIII. The hurtful powers producing this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, are the common aſthenic ones, appearing in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing form: It is cold in this caſe, but conjoined with moiſture in the northern ſeas, and, as <hi>we may well ſuppoſe,</hi> in the parts of the ſouthern ocean of the ſame temperature, that generally produces the peculiar form of the diſeaſe.

                  <p>DLXXIX.

                  </p>
                  <p>DLXXX. And this fact is confirmed by both the true and falſe method <hi>employed</hi> for its cure: For, though nearly all the common powers concur in the production of ſcurvy; if, however, it be conſidered, how eaſily, upon the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the hurtful powers, and the patient getting a ſhore,

the diſeaſe is got under, by freſh meat, either with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out greens, by wine, geſtation, and exerciſe, in fine, by the recovery of his uſual manner of living; it will be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to entertain a doubt of its being both an aſthenia, and by no means a violent one.

                  <p>DLXXXV. The cauſe of the diſeaſe is the uſual one of any aſthenia, predominant in the moving fibres of the muſcles, ſituated below the ſkin over the whole ſurface of the body.</p>
                  <p>DLXXXVI. Its worſt morbific powers are, penury of blood, cold, eſpecially with the addition of moiſture im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure air, and beſides theſe, as many of the other powers that act by a debilitating operation as happen to be applied, contribute, in proportion to the degree in which they are applied to the morbid effect. Of theſe exceſſive indolence and the reverſe are particularly hurtful.</p>
                  <p>CLXXXIII. As all ſtimulants contribute to the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the healthy ſtate; ſo the moſt powerful of them in this caſe is nouriſhing food, friction, geſtation, wine, taken in moderation, exerciſe, rather frequent than violent, and being as much as poſſible in the open air. If it is an acknowledged fact, that rheumatalgia is one of the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of phyſicians, it is more ſo than has been hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; it being an aſthenic diſeaſe, while they at all times made uſe of the ſame kind of cure, as if it had been

                  <head>Of the Aſthenic Cough.</head>
                  <p>DLXXXVIII. The aſthenic cough is an aſthenia, which with the conſtant ſymptoms of the latter, depends upon a frequent expectoration, that the cough excites; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting every age which has been under the influence of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther direct, or indirect debility, and therefore old age, which is unavoidably the prey of indirect debility.</p>
                  <p>DLXXXXIX. As conſiſting in indirect debility, it is the effect of an exceſſive violence of all ſtimuli that have been applied either for a ſhort time, or for a great part of life, their operation coming to the ſame amount, that of the former from its degree, and that of the latter from its long continuance<note n="(i)" place="bottom">See above XXIX. XXX. and CCCCI.</note>. In ſo far as its cauſe is direct deblity, a deficiency of all the ſtimuli, leaving the excitability to be accumulated, allows this form of aſthenia to happen from the ſpontaneous tendency of nature, of which life is only a forced ſtate<note n="(k)" place="bottom">So great is nature's tendency to that particular encreaſe of exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which forms the matter of expectoration in this diſeaſe, that every caſe of death from diſeaſe is an inſtance of it. Hence the dead rattle in the throat is univerſally the expiring ſymptom. See LXXII, and CCCXXVI.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DXC. The cough, which depends upon indirect debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is cured by reducing the ſtimulus which occaſioned it, gradually and cautiouſly to the proper and natural degree
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:022373_0330_0FB8656DCD5D4B90"/>
And when it originates from indirect debility, the encreaſe of the ſtimulus, <hi>the want of which occaſioned the diſeaſe,</hi> till the degree of excitement, which conſtitutes health is repla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, effects the cure.</p>
                  <p>DXCI. Such is the nature of direct and indirect debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; that if the remedies of the former be puſhed beyond the boundary, the cough appears again; and the ſame is the event of the ſame exceſs in the uſe of the remedies of the latter<note n="(l)" place="bottom">See par. XXXIII. XXXIV. and XLIII. XXX. CXXXIV. and eſpecially CCXXXIII. to CCXXXVI.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DXCII. Frequent and violent cough with copious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration has been always held for a ſure mark of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation or faulty ſtate in the lungs. That faulty ſtate was eſteemed to be of a ſthenic nature, and to give aſſurance of the preſence ſometimes of phthiſipneumony, or conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from an ulcer in the lungs, ſometimes baſtard peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pneumony, ſometimes of a burning inflammation in the alimentary canal. In the former caſe an ulcer, or, in their way of ſpeaking, and what amounts to the ſame thing, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles were believed the cauſe of the diſeaſe; in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond caſe inflammation either in the intercoſtal muſcles, or a different one from that, which in true peripneumony was, in their opinion, its primary cauſe, was conſidered as the cauſe; and in the laſt caſe, no one of them would have heſitated a moment to have aſcribed the ſtate of the bowels, to the only inflammation they were acquainted with, that which requires bleeding and evacuation for its cure. And no other enquiry was made, but whether the matter that was ſpit up, was mucus or pus. To aſcertain that premiums were propoſed.</p>
                  <p>DXCIII. But, in fact, beſides that no phthiſipneumony, no baſtard peripneumony, as they call it, no inflammation in the alimentary canal, was ever cured by antiſthenic

And yet the whole tumult, hitherto ſo alarming, could be ſtopt in a few hours, and quite cured in as many days.</p>
                  <p>DXCIV. And, who does not know, that there are many perſons, who have an immoderate cough, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional expectoration for a whole and long life time, whoſe lungs, however, are ſound, and free from any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic taint? How often in phthiſipneumony itſelf after finiſhing its courſe, and at laſt terminating in death, has the whole fabric of the lungs been found upon diſſection as ſound as ever happens in death from any cauſe<note n="(m)" place="bottom">There are ſeveral caſes upon record, of the lungs after death from a confirmed conſumption, having been found perfectly ſound. A moſt reſpectable pupil of mine went to Liſbon with a young gentleman of conſiderable rank in Scotland, under a confirmed conſumption, whom he brought back perfectly freed from his diſeaſe. He alſo ſaved either two or three ladies, I am not juſt now ſure which; equally given up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the common practice. He happened to aſſert before the phyſician of the factory, that a perſon juſt dead of the ſame diſeaſe had no local af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the lungs, and upon diſſection it was found to be as he had ſaid. I have reſtored many phthiſipneumoniacs, but am obliged to own, that I have loſt three, to whom I was called too late. Their loſs, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mortified me, becauſe there were many reaſons for my ſetting my heart upon their cure.

To paſs over the ſthenic cough, with which we have nothing to do in this part of our ſubject<note n="(n)" place="bottom">See CLX. CCXXXIII.</note>; the cauſe of the aſthenic is the ſame as that of any aſthenia, but more vehement in the fountain of expectoration, to wit, the exhalant and mucus arteries, the ſecreted fluids of which, inſpiſſated by ſtagnation <hi>in the bronchia,</hi> compoſe the matter to be expectorated.</p>
                  <p>α<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> α<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The moſt powerful of the aſthenic hurtful agents in exciting aſthenic cough, is cold, juſt as heat has been demonſtrated the moſt hurtful agent in catarrh<note n="(o)" place="bottom">See par. CCCCVII. to CCCCXII.</note>. Nay, in the aſthenic cough, ſuch is the rage of cold, that the ſlighteſt breath of air reaching the body, excites a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious tumult of coughing, and brings out the whole ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſubſequent ſymptoms; and heating the body in the bed as ſoon allays the cough, prevents the threatening, and cures the urgent diſturbances.</p>
                  <p>DXCVI. In this as well as the ſthenic cough, it is the ſerous and mucous fluids that chiefly flow to the bronchia. Which bear their preſſure for a little, till, diſtended by the load, they can bear it no longer. The diſagreeableneſs of the ſtimulus excites a commotion in the excitability of the labouring part, and, therefore, over its whole ſeat, and rouſes the excitement. A cough ariſes, and throws off its cauſe, the collected humours.</p>
                  <p>DXCVII. This diſeaſe is always to be treated for its cure, firſt with ſtimulant remedies, and then with ſuch as

If indirect debility has been the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bific power, ſtill we muſt ſtimulate, but at firſt with a force of ſtimulus little leſs than that, which occaſioned the diſeaſe, and then with ſtill leſs; and, after changing, from time to time, the form of the ſtimulus, with leſs ſtill; till we come down to the ſtimuli that are agreeable to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thoſe that ſuit the moſt perfect health<note n="(p)" place="bottom">See par. CIII.</note>. In that way is ebriety, in that way is every form of intemperance, to be treated. If direct debility has been the cauſe, the cure will be a good deal more eaſy: That is we muſt go on to ſtimulate more and more, till we get up to that point of excitement, to which we came down in <hi>the caſe of</hi> indirect debility. In this way is the firſt ſtage of phthiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pneumony, as well as its middle courſe, and alſo baſtard peripneumony, nay, moſt caſes of the debility affecting young people, and the diſeaſe to which the name</p>

But why do they preſcribe vomiting?—They heard that from their maſter's deſk at ſchool, and found, that the ſame authority, was the reaſon of others for doing the ſame thing. Why vomiting? For the ſame reaſon, and becauſe a relique of the doctrine of morbific matter has run through all their ſyſtems. Hence in bleeding diſeaſes, the univerſal rule has been to bleed; in vomiting to give emetics, in diarrhaea to give cathartics, in imitation, forſooth of nature. The ſymptoms of diſeaſe have been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for efforts of the conſtitution to remove the diſeaſe. It is now, however, proved that there are no ſuch efforts.

DCII. This diſeaſe may be called the indigeſtion or dyſpepſia of the luxurious, that is, depending upon indirect debility; while dyſpepſia may be denominated the ſame diſeaſe, that is the gout of perſons under direct debility, as having every ſymptom of the gout, except the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation<note n="(s)" place="bottom">There are very few perſons, who at one time or another in their life have not experienced painful twitches in ſome part or other of one of their feet, eſpecially when they happened to be in a ſtate more languid and ſluggiſh than ordinary. Every which caſe may be conſidered as a gout in miniature. But when the whole phenomena, except the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, happen to any perſon, call it dyſpepſia, or what you will; it is to all intents and purpoſes a gout. Indeed, from all that has been ſaid through this work, general morbid ſtate appears to be a very ſimple af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, being nothing but an encreaſe or diminution of the cauſe of the functions or powers of life, without any other difference, but that of the mere appearance of the ſymptoms to our ſenſes, an appearance by which, when we look no further for information, we are alſo conſtantly deceived.</note>. For, in diſeaſes, ſo little is there in names, that not only thoſe diſeaſes, of which we have been juſt now treating, but likewiſe aſthma, hyſteria, the cholic, and moſt of the diſeaſes, which have taken their appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from any remarkable diſturbance of the alimentary canal, are equally prevented and cured by the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of cure preciſely.

                  </p>
                  <p>DCIX. What had hitherto deceived phyſicians, <hi>and paſſed</hi> for a cauſe of the gout, was the appearance of vigour and an over proportion of blood, in moſt podagrics, from the bulk of ſimple ſolids in conſequence of their way of life, and often from <hi>great</hi> ſtrength. But, good men! they never recollected, that vigour and a great quantity of blood was not a property inherent in animals, but that it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon foreign circumſtances every day and every hour<note n="(c)" place="bottom">X.

<pb n="328" facs="unknown:022373_0342_0FB8658304B12430"/>
there be the leaſt probability, that the former will, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>his preſent</hi> abſolute want, continue plethoric and vigorous; and that the latter, from being now cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with unuſual plenty, will continue empty, as he had been before? Is the fundamental propoſition of this doctrine, in which it has been demonſtrated, that we are nothing of ourſelves, and that we are altogether governed by foreign powers, to be forgot? Is a perſon liable to the gout, who has for twenty years undergone an exceſs of ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulant operation, about the fortieth year of his age, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven afterwards, to be reckoned fuller of blood and more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, either than another perſon who has lived lower, or then himſelf twenty years before? Where, pray, was the neceſſity of comparing gouty perſons with others free from <hi>all bias to</hi> that diſeaſe, and not comparing them with themſelves<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Such is the effect of the powers operating upon us, that a certain degree of that operation produces an effect that would not ariſe under another. If the accuſtomary operation has been moderate, habit will render the excitement ariſing from it, in ſome meaſure, ſufficient for the demands of the ſyſtem: Hence, day-labourers are ſupported upon leſs ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus than gentlemen. Again, which is a circumſtance liable to happen to the latter, if the accuſtomary operation has been exceſſive, there will be a neceſſity for a continuation of ſome degree of the exceſs. A podagric may be ſtronger than a labourer, and yet, fall into the gout. For, though compared with the other perſon, he is ſtrong; compared with himſelf at another time, he is weak: And the reaſon is, that though he is ſtill bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupported than the labourer, he is worſe ſupported, than the uſual ſtate of his ſyſtem requires. Further, the labourer, though he falls not into the gout, may, by carrying his moderation too far, fall into indigeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſome other diſeaſe, in every eſſential reſpect the ſame as the gout. A double inference ariſes here: Which is, that, though both exceſs and deficiency can be borne to a certain degree, ſo as to require a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them, or a gradual correction, yet they ſhould both be avoided as entailing that ſort of neceſſity for their continuance while their effect makes no ſort of compenſation, being, at beſt, not the beſt ſtate, that of perfect health, but a ſtate of prediſpoſition to diſeaſe; the one to ſthenic and at laſt indirect debility; the other to aſthenic, as depending on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect debility. The perfect rule for enſuring the healthy ſtate, is to keep within the extremes of exceſs and defect, and thereby produce the due degree of excitement; and to apply all the exciting powers equally, each in its due proportion. The due degree may be ſecured by one or a few, but the equality of it over the ſyſtem can only be ſecured by their equal application. This propoſition goes to the bottom of two extenſive doctrines, that of life, and that of morals; the laſt of which has as yet not attained to any thing like a fundamental principle. I intend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the idea upon ſome future occaſion. I know a book filled with valuable ethic facts, but have not yet had time to conſider, whether they all point to a general one, in which they all agree, and which reflects proof and confirmation upon them; without which it would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>DCXXIII. The hypochondriaſis is an aſthenia, in which, with the ſymptoms of dyſpepſy, there is a noiſe in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flatulency, and uneaſineſs, and a rooted opinion in the patient, of the diſeaſe being always worſe than it is. The way is paved to the diſeaſe by a dry ſet of ſimple ſolids, and that temperament, in which there is a natural ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to paſſion; which, however, once excited riſes to the higheſt violence, and continues long with obſtinacy. It is further diſtinguiſhed by a fixed attention of mind, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the patient is liable to dwell to exceſs upon any purſuit or ſtudy, and not to be eaſily diverted to another, as alſo by

                  <p>DCXXV. Since the ſtate of the ſimple ſolids is a ſtate given by nature, and not to be changed by art, and the only indication of cure left in the phyſicians power, is to fit a certain degree of excitement to that given ſtate, which is exactly the caſe in this diſeaſe; <hi>it follows,</hi> therefore, that the ſtimulus of food, drink, and others, ſhould be employed in the cure of hypochondriaſis.

                  <head>Of Dropſy.</head>
                  <p>DCXXVI. Dropſy is an aſthenia, commonly in the form of an anaſarca, with a ſwelling in ſome viſcus, which, for the moſt part, at leaſt in the beginning, attacks ſome place in preference to others, and more than any other.</p>
                  <p>DCXXVII. The cauſe of dropſy, in ſo far as it reſpects the collection of water, is eaſily explicable upon this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, but altogether inexplicable upon any other. For the univerſal debility, that is laxity and atony, is chiefly predominant in the extreme red arteries, and the exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants immediately continued from theſe, as well as in the commencements of the abſorbent veins; and, of the ſame kind of veſſels, it is often urgent in a particular part in preference to others.</p>
                  <p>DCXXVIII. As all the debilitating hurtful powers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in producing this, as well as any other aſthenia; ſo thoſe powers have the greateſt influence in this caſe, that preſs moſt urgently upon the vaſcular ſyſtem. Hence, as <hi>we ſee</hi> in the converſion of peripneumony into the dropſy of the cheſt, profuſe bleeding, and a large draught of cold

water, when the body is fatigued, over-heated, and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with thirſt, are the moſt powerful agents in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this diſeaſe. The hurtful effect of the latter of which, in every caſe of debility, when its operation is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by no ſtimulus, has been more than ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained above<note n="(r)" place="bottom">See par. CXVII. to CXXIV.</note>. Beſides, in this caſe, when all the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are open, the water flowing to their moſt weak termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, paſſing out by theſe, and being not at all tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the exhalants into the abſorbents, is collected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every neighbouring cavity<note n="(s)" place="bottom">LIX. LX. LXI.</note>. And hence the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the urgent ſymptom in this diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>DCXXIX. To this aſthenia belong all the watery ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, which do not ariſe from a local affection, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on pure debility. And, therefore, if at any time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other form of aſthenia, whether from wrong treatment, or other hurtful powers, in its progreſs terminates in this effuſion; every ſuch caſe ſhould be held as a proper drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy<note n="(t)" place="bottom">See LXXXI.</note>; and it ſhould be ever preſent to our recollection, that there are only two general diſeaſes, and that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions hitherto received, are devoid of all ſolid founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Accordingly, both from other improprieties, and particularly from bleeding, epilepſy, palſy, the gout, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in real dropſy. Nay, the ſame is the termination of peripneumony itſelf, when it is either converted into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct debility, from the debilitating plan of cure having been puſhed to exceſs, or into direct debility, from having been left to itſelf, and the body not ſufficiently debilitated. The affections, confined to parts, which are conſidered as the remote cauſes of dropſy, will be treated among the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſeaſes, to which they belong.</p>
                  <p>DCXXX. After this explanation of the nature of drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, the cure of it, provided that it be a proper one, and early

If long before the effuſion there was no internal complaint, if the diſeaſe rather came on ſuddenly, and in conſequence of evident hurtful powers, and yields to the firſt part of the curative means, there is no reaſon to doubt of a cure.</p>
                  <p>DCXXXI.

The remedies are alſo the uſual ones; that is diet, as nouriſhing and ſtimulant as poſſible; firſt in a fluid form, when the ſolid cannot be admitted upon account of the debility of the ſtomach; then, alſo in a ſolid; and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with both, ſtrong drink, ſuch as the beſt wine that can be got, fermented ſpirit, ſometimes pure, ſometimes diluted. If the diſeaſe does not yield to theſe, after their uſe has been continued for a proper length of time; recourſe muſt be had to the diffuſible forms: By this means, when the effuſion has not yet attained to that high degree that conſtitutes a local affection, not to be altered by any ſtate of the excitement, this aſthenia can be as eaſily cured as any other.</p>
                  <p>DCXXXII. But, when a great quantity of water has now got into ſome large cavity, it ſhould immediately be removed by the catheter; when that has been done, and the emptied cavity ſecured with as much care as poſſible, and the ſtrength ſupported by wine, ſtrong drink, and any ſtimulus more diffuſible, we muſt return to the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Epilepſy is an aſthenia; the diſtinguiſhing ſymptoms of which are, ſome heavineſs of intellect, dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the exerciſe of the ſenſes; and then a very impaired ſtate, or temporary extinction of the latter, accompanied with various convulſions over the body: Fits, conſiſting of ſuch a concourſe of ſymptoms uſually return afterwards at uncertain ſpaces of time, and <hi>each of them</hi> terminates in a foaming at the mouth.</p>
                  <p>DCXXXIV. As all the debilitating hurtful agents are productive of this diſeaſe; ſo the loſs of the blood and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fluids, exceſs in venery, paſſions, ſuch as fear, terror, aſſiduous and intenſe thinking in great geniuſes; a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of that kind of ſtimulus in ſtupid perſons, are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſo<note n="(x)" place="bottom">See above par.

                  <p>DCXXXV. But the appearance of ſymptoms is a thing full of fallacy, and, unleſs the nature of the hurtful powers producing them, and of the remedies removing them, be throughly underſtood, it is incomprehenſible. To ſolve the preſent difficulty about poiſons, and to ſettle <hi>the queſtion,</hi> whether the ſymptoms belong to univerſal, or local diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; we muſt conſider, whether the latter one produced

If the former is the cauſe, the affection muſt be conſidered as local<note n="(z)" place="bottom">See above CCXXIV.</note>; if the latter be the truth, the diſeaſe muſt be held for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral one, and a true, but a great aſthenia. Nor muſt we forget, that a great many ſymptoms of general diſeaſes, from the ſame origin, are diſſimilar; and many from diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, nay, oppoſite cauſes are ſimilar; that many local ſymptoms have a great reſemblance to thoſe of general diſeaſes, and that they ſometimes, by a moſt falſe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, counterfeit epilepſy, ſometimes apoplexy, ſometimes certain other general diſeaſes beſides.</p>
                  <p>DCXXXVI. For the purpoſe of preventing this diſeaſe, we muſt both avoid other debilitating powers, and thoſe that have the greateſt power in producing it. The veſſels ſhould be filled, by giving food as nouriſhing, and as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual in producing blood as poſſible; the indulgence in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery muſt be moderated, chearfulneſs and tranquillity of mind muſt be favoured, and agreeable train of thinking muſt be found, and all the objects of the ſenſes, which give them diſturbance, guarded againſt; the ſtrength muſt be fortified by recruiting exerciſe, by the peruvian bark, if the approach of the fits can be perceived, and by wine and the more diffuſible ſtimuli. A length of ſleep, that is a medium betwixt too long and too ſhort a continuance of it, ſhould be kept up.

Upon his falling into another I was ſent for, and brought him above in twenty minutes, as I am told, (for I did not wait,) ſo completely, that he got out of bed, and ate a hearty meal of beef ſtakes.

When the fit is ſlight and of ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it terminates in health; but the conſequence of a higher degree and greater duration of it is death.</p>

And beſides theſe, all the common debilitating powers that produce any aſthenia, directly or indirectly; great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the nervous ſyſtem by means of to too diffuſible ſtimuli; more affecting the circumference of the body, where the organs of voluntary motion are chiefly ſeated, and the internal parts and the brain leſs; as is evident in ebriety, gluttony, and every ſort of intemperance; likewiſe an indolent way of life, which as commonly connected with theſe hurtful powers, have all the ſame tendency.</p>

For the indication of cure, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the ſame as in epilepſy as the energy of the cauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates more immediately upon the ſurface of the body, conſequently according to what has been ſaid upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of epilepſy, the principal remedies are thoſe, that have the greateſt power in invigorating the ſurface of the body: Such are friction, geſtation, that degree of exerciſe which the ſtrength can bear, for the purpoſe of rouſing by their powerful operation, the languid excitement in the fibres of the muſcles; likewiſe a proper degree of heat of pure air, and therefore, as much as poſſible, the open air; laſtly, as none of the powers endued with ſtimulant virtue, by any means ſhould be omitted, in order that the excitement, which is of great conſequence in every cure, be more equal and vigorous all over; ſo in that extreme debility which produces ſuch an impotency of voluntary motion, as it is of the greateſt conſequence to make an impreſſion upon the principal ſymptom; we ſhould, therefore, <hi>employ</hi> a great deal of an opiate, (CXXX. and CCXXX.) the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of which, upon the ſurface, is the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>of all</hi> other powers, and preſs the cure, till ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of returning motion be procured; and then, without neglecting of the aſſiſtance of any of the other ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muli,

The heads of the patients are large and not well formed, their necks ſhort and thick: The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ariſe from both direct and indirect debility, but chiefly from the latter. Of the indirect debilitating powers, the moſt powerful is the luxury of food, drink, and ſloth, which, after its courſe of ſtimulating and filling the veſſels is run, is truly debilitating and productive of a penury of fluids: And, as each ſort of debility is encreaſed by the other, and conſequently the indirect by the direct, ſo that is remarkably the caſe in this diſeaſe. Hence the effect of the debilitating plan of cure is ſo pernicious in apoplexy, that it is received as a rule, that the third fit is not often, the fourth never, got the better of.</p>
                  <p>DCXLV. The cauſe of epilepſy, palſy, and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, is the ſame with that of every aſthenia; affecting
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:022373_0357_0FB865A45EFEE020"/>
the head leſs in palſy, excepting in the beginning and end, but greatly in the two others; and in all the three produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a diſturbance in the organs of voluntary motion. This diſturbance, whether the motion be deſtroyed or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, in convulſion ſeemingly encreaſed, amounts to the ſame thing, and, as was formerly explained, depends upon debility<note n="(l)" place="bottom">LVIII. CCXXX.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DCXLVI. The ſame here too is the indication of cure; with that, which runs through this whole form of diſeaſes, and the force of the remedies is eſpecially, and as much as poſſible, to be directed to the parts moſt affected. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, therefore, the fits, in every reſpect alarming and full of danger, we ought to recollect, how far indirect debility has a ſhare in producing this diſeaſe, and how far the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect concurs with it; and alſo conſider the operation of a greatly advanced age. All exceſſive ſtimulus, therefore, muſt be avoided in ſuch a manner, that the body may be invigorated and direct debility guarded againſt, the ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant plan of cure ſhould be ſet on foot with moderation and accuracy; and, in the place of the forms of ſtimuli, that have, either from long or exceſſive uſe, loſt their ſtimulant operation, according to the rule of nature, others, which the excitability, yet not worn out with reſpect to them, can receive, ſhould be ſubſtituted, that is, the kinds of food, of drink, and of diffuſible ſtimuli, ſhould be changed all round, and upon the failure of each lately uſed one, to return to thoſe that have been long ago laid aſide<note n="(f)" place="bottom">CCCI.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DCXLVII. The three diſeaſes we are treating of, are commonly ſuppoſed to ariſe from a plethora, attacking the head, and proving hurtful by compreſſion upon the brain.

                  <p>DCXLIX. The lock-jaw is a leſs degree of tetanus, its ſpaſm being confined to the lower jaw and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts. This is a rare affection, without others e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually conſpicuous; as being a formidable ſymptom of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and wounds. When the former of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>DCL. Since it never ariſe immediately after a wound is inflicted, but uſually happens, either when the latter is healed up, or after a conſiderable interval of time; <hi>the inference from that</hi> is that it either ariſes from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and duration of the pain, which is always a cauſe of very much debility, or from that debility, which the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al antiſthenic plan of cure produces, or from an unknown taint in the ſubſtance of the nervous ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>DCLI. That it depends upon debility we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, from every ſort of ſpaſm always depending on debility<note n="(i)" place="bottom">CLXXXIX. CXI.</note>; from tetanus, which is preciſely the ſame

                  <p>DCLII. Tetanus is an aſthenia, and, therefore, always affecting perſons under debility, whether direct or indirect; in which, ſometimes with conſciouſneſs, ſometimes not, ſometimes with difficulty, ſometimes with freedom of reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration, the whole body, or the neck and its neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood only, are bent ſometimes forward, ſometimes back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and held faſt by a rigid ſpaſm.</p>
                  <p>DCLIII. Tetanus is the offspring of cold countries, as the northern parts of Europe, but rarely; more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the warm ſouthern regions of that diviſion of the world; but moſt frequently of the torrid zone. The rare <hi>caſe,</hi> ſuch as that among us, is the ſequel of a debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſcarce uſual in other general diſeaſes: On the contrary, it almoſt always ariſes from that unuſual debility, which is occaſioned by a lacerating wound, through which fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red bones are daſhed, increaſing the ſum of that debility that exiſted before, or that happened to be induced in the courſe of the cure.

The fever of this kind, which returns every fourth day, and is therefore called a quartan, is milder than that which receives the name of tertain, from its recurrence being on the third day, and the latter is milder than that which, from its return every day, is denominated quotidian. The diſeaſe, that degenerates into a remittent or continued form, is of a worſe nature than that which is regular in its returns, or that which puts off fits, and protracts the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals <hi>betwixt them:</hi> And, the form and type of each caſe being given, the whole ſet is both of more frequent recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and of a more ſevere kind in hot, than cold, climates.</p>
                  <p>DCLVIII. That this ſort of fever depends upon debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity throughout the cold fit, is proved by the ſymptoms, by the exciting hurtful powers, and by the method of cure, whether ſucceſsful, or the contrary.</p>

from this ſort of argument and certainty in point of fact, we derive the moſt ſolid conviction, that there is nothing in this diſeaſe different from other aſtheniae, but that it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agrees with them in the exciting hurtful powers, in the cauſe, and in the cure.

Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny circumſtances in the courſe of diſeaſes, that eſcape the obſervation both of patients and phyſicians, are of hourly and momentary occurrence, and ſufficient, when their importance is weighed according to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of this doctrine, to account for the variations in the progreſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. We ſhall, by and by, ſee that the circumſtances of heat, from the gratification of indulging in which the patient is not to he turned aſide by any advice, is, with its conſequences upon the whole ſyſtem, ſufficient to account for the gradual converſion of the cold into the hot, and the hot, into the ſweating, ſtages.</note>.

And the reaſon of that is, that the exciting hurtful powers in the ſame proportion are either removed, or more gentle in their operation; in one word, the excitement is encreaſed for the time. The variation of types is not owing to a matter, ſubject to the ſame va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation: For, if that were the caſe, how could the ſame caſe run through all the forms, ſometimes of intermiſſion, ſometimes of remiſſion, and at other times of nearly going on with a continued movement and the contrary? Is the matter, which is ſuppoſed to produce each form, in order to produce another form, changed into that matter, which is ſuppoſed neceſſary to the latter<note n="(t)" place="bottom">The ancients ſuppoſed, that every type aroſe from a matter ſuited to produce it. Now, ſuppoſe a quotidian type to depend upon any giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en matter, and a tertian upon any other, different from that; when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther type is changed into the other, are we to ſuppoſe that the matter is alſo changed, and ſo forth of the reſt?</note>?

                  <p>DCLXIV. To enquire into the return of fits; it is not peculiar to this form of fevers, to have a return of the general affection after its temporary ſolution; the ſame thing happens to the gout, as often as a return of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe again ſucceeds to a return of health<note n="(y)" place="bottom">DCLVI.</note>, and for the ſame reaſon<note n="(z)" place="bottom">DCLVII.</note>: For, as thoſe diſeaſes are repelled by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorating means, ſo they are brought back by the debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating powers, which were their firſt cauſe. Accordingly, when the diſeaſe is left to itſelf, when it is treated by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitating plan of cure, it perſeveres in returning; when it is treated with Peruvian bark, and ſtill more certainly by the forms of wine and diffuſible ſtimuli, and when that mode of cure is perſiſted in, till the ſtrength is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, it never returns.</p>
                  <p>DCLXV. The tertian vernal fevers of Scotland go off without medicines, in proceſs of time, firſt in conſequence of the heat of the bed, and then, as the ſummer ſets in, by baſking in the rays of the ſun, and by a moderate uſe of food

and ſtrong drink, <hi>their duration</hi> commonly <hi>not exceeding</hi> the ſpace of three months. In all the ſouthern regions, and even in England, the Peruvian bark, when the whole cure is entruſted to it, often fails, and they are not removed but by very diffuſible ſtimuli<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Dr. Wainman, as it was ſaid before, found that to be the caſe in the fens of Lincolnſhire. From which we may learn how little depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is to be had on the facts in medicine, as they are delivered from deſks or in books; from both which we have always been taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Peruvian bark was a catholicon in intermittent fevers. But, if it fails in the cure of the mild ſtate of that diſeaſe in this country, what muſt we think of its efficacy in the malignant intermittents and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittents of the warm countries? And, if that medicine, with its univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal high character, ſhall turn out next to an impoſition, what are we to think of teſtimonies in favour of any thing? One of the ways of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtering the bark is in ſtrong wine or ſpirit, and it can hardly be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in that compound form it may have been of ſervice. But where ſhall we find a panegyriſt on the bark, who will make any allowance for the powerful medicine conjoined with it? They talk of it as a vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, without allowing it any other credit. In the ſame manner, at all times, have many powers of great operation been overlooked in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts given us of remedies, and the merit of the cure imputed to the moſt inert. I have moſt generally found an analogy betwixt the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that are, in reality, powerful, and our ordinary ſupports of health. The wines and ſtrong drinks are certainly a part of diet with moſt people, and ſo is opium among the Turks. But what analogy can be found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſame ordinary ſupports of life, the ſame durable and natural ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muli, and the bark of a tree, whether brought from South America, or growing among ourſelves? I will not pretend to ſay, that the bark is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of all virtue: but I muſt have greater proofs of its power over diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe than I have yet met with, before I can retract much of what I have ſaid.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DCLXVI. The debility during the cold ſtage is the greateſt, that of the hot leſs, and that of the ſweating ſtage, which ends in health for the time, is the leaſt of all. Hence, in a gentle degree of the diſeaſe, as cold is the moſt hurtful power, the conſequence is, that its effect is gradually taken off by the agreeable heat of the bed or of the ſun, and the
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:022373_0371_0FB865C2A0E3C8D8"/>
ſtrength, thereby gradually drawn forth. The heart and arteries, gradually excited by the ſame heat, acquire vigour, and at laſt, excited in their perſpiratory terminations by the ſame ſtimulus the moſt hurtful ſymptom being thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, they reſtore the hot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>DCLXVII. When the force of the diſeaſe is greater, theſe powers are ineffectual; and, unleſs the moſt powerful remedies are applied, the diſeaſe, inſtead <hi>of producing</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, ruſhes head-long into the remittent ſtate only, or even into thoſe very obſcure remiſſions, which give the appearance of a continued diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>DCLXVIII. And, ſince in every caſe of diſeaſe of any energy, the diſeaſe returns, for this reaſon, that either the leſſer force, by which it is kept up, is not ſtopt by a leſſer force of remedies, or the greater force of the former by a greater force of the latter<note n="(b)" place="bottom">For the curative force muſt be always accommodated to the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The ſtimulus of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal motion, which is a great and rough indirectly debilitating power, is often too long continued, after a typhus fever has begun its inſidious attack upon the habit; and hence the after-part of the diſeaſe becomes more ſevere and dangerous.

The guarding againſt guſts of paſſion and emotion, as well as mental exertion, is all upon the ſame principle.

The dram drinkers know the remedy, but they know not its bounds. They have recourſe to a glaſs of ſtrong ſpirit, and they would be right if they ſtopt at one, two, or a very few, according to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, that their former habit may render neceſſary, and take no more than what gave them an appetite for ſolid nouriſhing animal food; which, whatever the quantity that is required to produce it be, is the beſt general rule: But they go on, and every day till that of their death, which ſoon arrives, renew the diſeaſe. The rule is to take a little of what proved hurtful, till a return of appetite comes on: After eating a little, a walk or a ride will add more ſtimulus: The air, in which the exerciſe or geſtation is performed, will furniſh another. In that way, more ſtrength will be acquired in proportion as a greater number or ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muli have waſted more excitability, and with more equality. A ſecond day's management by applying the ſtimuli in a ſtill leſſer degree, will commonly remove all the complaints.

In a ſimilar manner, an excitability that has been accumulated from defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of ſtimuli for a number of weeks or months, will require a ſpace of time, ſomewhat proportioned to that, to wear it out in the manner moſt ſuitable, to reſtore the loſt vigour. Some health will be ſooner brought about, but the effectuating of perfect health muſt be a work of time. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the direct debility of a few days will be eaſily removed in a few days. In fevers, and every caſe of high debility, the accumulation of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citability for want of ſtimulant power to produce excitement, muſt be eſtimated by the number of ſtimuli that have been withheld, as well as the degree of force of each of them.

What then is required as to the idea of the cure? Since moſt of thoſe, which are the ordinary ſtimuli, by which the ordinary health is ſupported, cannot be applied; the proper idea is to look out for a power in nature, that can, as nearly as poſſible, ſupply, both the degree and equality of ſtimulant operation that is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Such a power we find in the few diffuſible ſtimuli, and particularly in opium (See par. CXXX.) Any of thoſe act powerfully on the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and diffuſe proportional excitement over the ſyſtem. So ſoon and effectually do they pervade it, and act with the moſt powerful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the ſurface, that it is often an object of attention in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to think of means to prevent it from going too far. By the bleſſed uſe of thoſe remedies, the excitement of the ſtomach is reſtored, ſo that with a return of appetite, food can be taken in, and digeſted, in ſo far as the powers of that organ go; which are confined chiefly to the firſt part of digeſtion, or what is called the firſt concoction. Next the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement is reſtored in the other digeſtive organs, in the duodenum, in the biliary veſſels, the pancreatic duct, in the lacteal veſſels, through their whole courſe from the inteſtines to their common receptacle, as all the veſſels that return lymph from every part of the body, in the veins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the thoracic duct and the heart, in all the cavities of the latter, in all the red arteries, in the colourleſs terminations of all theſe, whether exhalant or glandular, and whether only ſimple ſeparating, or alſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, the property of the fluid they ſecrate, in all the internal cavities of the body, in the commencing extremities of the abſorbent veſſels, and in their progreſs through their lymphatic trunks to the receptacle in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them with the lacteals, which are a part of their number, in the thoracic duct again; as alſo from that to the heart, and from the heart to the extremities of the arteries: Laſtly, the influence of excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is extended to theſe terminations of the arterial ſyſtem, whether exhalant or glandular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which perform the ſeveral functions of excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious ſecretion and excretion, by which every portion of fluids, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come uſeleſs, or, if they were retained, hurtful to the ſyſtem, are thrown out by their ſeveral emunctories. When, by the uſe of the diffuſible ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muli, the ſtomach, and all the organs can perform their reſpective func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the natural ſtimuli begin to be reſtored; the ſtomach, the inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, the lacteals and blood veſſels, and all the other veſſels, are gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally filled with their reſpective fluids; the muſcles on the ſurface, and the muſcular fibres recover their tone and denſity; the brain recovers its vigour; heat and air can be now reſtored to the ſurface; exerciſe can now add its uſeful ſtimulus; and all the functions return to their uſual capability of being acted upon by the uſual and ordinary exciting powers.</note>, ten or twelve drops of laudanum given every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

This is a ſort of affection, that happens in parts leſs ſenſible, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to common language, or more devoid of excitabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>DCXCVI. The ſecond part, likewiſe made up of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganic affections, occurs in parts <hi>of the ſyſtem,</hi> whether inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or external, that are very ſenſible, endued with a great deal of excitability<note n="(b)" place="bottom">The excitability is here not talked of in its comparative ſtates of abundance or deficiency, but in the degree in which any part poſſeſſes it in preference to other parts. It is uſed in the ſenſe of the greater or leſſer vitality of parts: Accordingly we can ſay, that ſome parts poſſeſs an exquiſite ſenſibility, as the ſtomach, the brain, and inteſtines, and, I believe, moſt of the interior, ſoft, fleſhy parts, and the ſhut cavities; and externally, the parts immediately under the nails; that others poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs leſs, as the bones, ligaments, and cartilages and ligaments; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, the cuticle, or ſcarf-ſkin.

                  <head>Of the Inflammation in the Stomach.</head>
                  <p>DCCVIII. The principal ſymptoms in gaſtritis are, pain in the region of the ſtomach, a burning heat, deep ſeated, encreaſed by every thing that is either ate or drank, or in any ſhape taken into the ſtomach; hiccup, an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to vomiting, and the ſudden throwing up what is taken in; and the pulſe ſoon getting into a ſtate of debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, quickneſs, ſwiftneſs, and hardiſhneſs.</p>
                  <p>DCCIX. The exciting hurtful powers, and which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſolution of continuity <hi>in this caſe,</hi> are ſuch as act by cutting, pricking or eroſion. Such are the ſmall bones of fiſhes, ground glaſs, or Cayan pepper and ſuch like things.</p>
                  <p>DCCX. Inflammation is a conſequence of the wound or eroſion, that are the effect of the operation of thoſe <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing powers:</hi> The effect of which, in the very ſenſible organ of the ſtomach, is to diffuſe the diſturbance before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned<note n="(c)" place="bottom">DCXCVI.</note> over the whole ſyſtem. The burning heat and pain, inſeparable from every inflammation, and the anxiety<note n="(d)" place="bottom">CLXXI. CCCXLV.</note>, are the offſpring of the inflammation<note n="(e)" place="bottom">CLXXI.</note>: And, of them, the anxiety is more peculiar to the ſtomach, the latter being its accuſtomary ſeat<note n="(f)" place="bottom">CCCXLV.</note>, and the pulſe becomes ſuch as has been related, becauſe it is peculiar to every rude, fixed, and permanent <hi>local</hi> ſtimulus<note n="(g)" place="bottom">XVII.</note>; to weaken, and <hi>to be</hi> ſo much the <hi>more liable to that effect,</hi> the greater the excitability <hi>of the part</hi> is. Hence, in the external parts of the body, that are leſs endued with excitability, a pretty conſiderable inflammation by no means affects the pulſe or the body any way generally; though even there, when a part is ſenſible, as in the caſe of a burn ſpread to any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or of a thorn having been thurſt below the nails, an

                  <p>DCCXI. The diſeaſe is eaſily known, both from the ſymptoms <hi>above</hi> deſcribed, and, with not a little more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, from the known taking in of the hurtful powers; and, over and above, by this particular ſign, that, as it has been ſaid before, with uſ ſuch marks, inflammation ſcarce ſeizes upon an internal and ſhut part<note n="(k)" place="bottom">CXIII. and CLXVII. The ſtomach is ſometimes inflamed from a ſchirrous tumor occupying the pylorus; and that caſe alſo is taken in by the ſyſtematic and noſological writers, as belonging to their gaſtritis: But the conſideration of it does not belong to this head of local diſeaſes, but to the third diviſion of them. At the ſame time, both it and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe are local diſeaſes, and not phlegmaſiae, differing from the phlegm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſiae, ſo fully treated of in the third part of this work.

DCCXXXVI. Becauſe, in this caſe aſthenic diatheſis is commonly ſuppoſed to ariſe over the whole body, upon account of the irritation from the wound; the antiſthenic plan of cure is, therefore, always employed through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe; and the uſe of opium, which, <hi>in this caſe</hi> is conjoined with the antiſthenic, or ſtimulant remedies, is admitted only for the purpoſe of acting as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dative and duller or pain, is admitted: Conſequently, upon account of the fear of a fever being to ſupervene, though often a great quantity of blood is loſt by the wound; ſtill large bleeding is practiſed, the belly is purged, nouriſhment is withheld, ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

But all this is a method of cure <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted upon</hi> an erroneous theory, which is proved by all the principles of this doctrine, and by the very unfortunate iſſue of that practice. In a perſon, who has loſt a great deal of blood an over-proportion of blood, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the cauſe of ſthenic diatheſis: Neither can any tolerable reaſon be aſſigned for the profuſe evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the ſerous fluid, or for not <hi>rather</hi> ſupplying new fluids by the uſe of food. It is in vain to accuſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of the pulſe, as a ſign of an exceſs in the quantity of blood, and of to much vigour, or of any irritation that wants an antiſthenic plan of cure: For, beſides its hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if the pulſe is not, at the ſame time, ſtrong and full; it has been now often above demonſtrated, that all its cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity depends upon debility and penury of blood<note n="(z)" place="bottom">See par.

Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as the ſthenic diatheſis depends upon the general ſthenic hurtful powers, as the energy of pain, from local affection, and particularly inflammation, has no tendency to induce that diatheſis, but <hi>the contrary one of</hi> debilitating<note n="(a)" place="bottom">DCCX.</note>; that is another reaſon for the ſuppoſition of the habit, either
