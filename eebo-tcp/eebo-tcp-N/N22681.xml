         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The particular view of the society, in proposing this subject, is, that the solution of this most useful problem may, if possible, be rendered so plain and easy, as to be readily learned by every mariner, even of moderate capacity, who understands the common rules of arithmetic; and thus be introduced into general practice.</p>

To answer this end, the stove should be cheap, and of durable mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials; should afford the necessary degree of a salubrious and durable heat, with the least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of fuel possible; and should be capable of being employed both for the purpose of warming the room, and cooking provisions for the family.—The society have been informed, that stoves made of brick are, in many respects, superior to those made of metal; especially, in the saving of fuel, and preserving a more equable degree of heat.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. No performance, invention or improvement, on any of the subjects proposed, for which a patent or any other reward shall have been obtained, before presenting it to the society, shall be considered as entitled to the premium.</p>

               <head>MR. I. H. DE MAGELLAN, OF LONDON,</head>
               <p>HAVING made a donation, to the society, of <hi>two hundred guineas,</hi> to be vested in a permanent fund; that the interest arising therefrom may be disposed of, in annual premiums, to the authors of the best discoveries or most useful improvements, relating to Navigation, or to Natural Philosophy, mere Natural History only excepted;—the following are the rules and conditions, adopted by the society, for the disposition of the proposed premiums, in conformity to the intention of the Donor, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. The candidate shall send his discovery, invention or improvement, addressed to the President or one of the Vice-Presidents of the society, free of postage or other charges; and shall distinguish his performance by some motto, device or other signature, at his pleasure. Together with his discovery, invention or improvement, he shall also send a sealed letter, containing the same motto, device or signature, and subscribed with the real name and place of residence of the author.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Persons of any nation, sect, or denomination whatever, shall be admitted as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates for this premium.</p>
               <p n="3">III. No discovery, invention or improvement shall be entitled to this premium, which hath been already published, or for which the author hath been publicly rewarded elsewhere.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The candidate shall communicate his discovery, invention or improvement, either in the English, French, German, or Latin language.</p>
               <p n="5">V. All such communications shall be publicly read or exhibited to the society, at some stated meeting, not less than one month previous to the day of adjudication; and shall at all times be open to the inspection of such members as shall desire it. But no member shall carry home with him the communication, description or model, except the officer to whom it shall be entrusted: nor shall such officer part with the same out of his custody, without a special order of the Society for that purpose.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The society having previously referred the several communications, from candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for the premium then depending, to the consideration of the twelve counsellors and other officers of the society, and having received their report thereon, shall, at one of their stated meetings, in the month of December, annually, after the expiration of this current year (of the time and place, together with the particular occasion of which meeting, due notice shall be previously given, by public advertisement) proceed to the final adjudication of the said premium: and after due consideration had, a vote shall first be taken on this question, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "Whether any of the communications, then under inspection, be worthy of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed premium?" If this question be determined in the <hi>negative,</hi> the whole business shall be deferred till another year: But if in the <hi>affirmative,</hi> the society shall proceed to determine, by ballot, given by the members at large, the discovery, invention or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement most useful and worthy. And that discovery, invention or improvement which shall be found to have a majority of concurring votes in its favour, shall be successful. And then, <hi>and not till then,</hi> the sealed letter accompanying the crowned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, shall be opened and the name of the author announced as the person entitled to the said premium.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. No member of the society who is a candidate for the premium then depending, or who hath not previously declared to the society, either by word or writing, that he has considered and weighed, according to the best of his judgment, the comparative merits of the several claims then under consideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall sit in judgment, or give his vote, in award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the said premium.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. A full account of the crowned subject shall be published by the Society as soon as may be, after the adjudication, either in a separate publication, or in the next succeeding volume of their transactions, or in both.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The unsuccessful performances shall remain under consideration, and their authors be considered as candidates for the premium, for <hi>five</hi> years next succeeding the time of their presentment; except such performances as their authors may, in the mean time, think fit to withdraw: And the Society shall annually publish an abstract of the titles, object or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of the communications so under consideration, such only excepted as the society shall think not worthy of public notice.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The letters containing the names of authors whose performances shall be rejected, or which shall be found unsuccessful after a trial of five years, shall be burnt before the society without breaking the seals.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. In case there should be a failure in any year, of any communication worthy of the proposed premium, there will then be two premiums to be awarded in the next year. But no accumulation of premiums shall entitle an author to more than one premium for any one discovery, invention or improvement.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. The premium shall consist of an oval plate of solid standard gold, of the value of <hi>Ten Guineas.</hi> On one side thereof shall be neatly engraved a short Latin motto suited to the occasion—together with these words, <hi>The premium of</hi> I. H. De Magellan, <hi>of London, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the year</hi> 1786. And on the other side of the plate shall be engraved these words, <hi>Awarded by the A. P.
