         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

At <hi>North Yarmouth,</hi> and other places at the Eaſtward, the Indians killed ſundry Cattel, came into Houſes, and threatned to knock the people on the Head; and at ſeveral Times gave out Reports, that they would make a <hi>War</hi> upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that they were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to do ſo, by the <hi>French.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> behaving themſelves ſo inſultingly, gave juſt occaſion of great ſuſpicion. In order for the finding out the <hi>Truth,</hi> and to Endeavour the preventing of a <hi>War,</hi> Capt. <hi>Blackman,</hi> a Juſtice of Peace, with ſome of the Neighbourhood, of <hi>Saco</hi> River, Seized ſeveral <hi>Indians</hi> that had been bloody murderous <hi>Rogues,</hi> in the firſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dian War</hi>; being the chief Ring Leaders, and moſt capable to do miſchief.

and to bring in the reſt to a Treaty.

And in the mean Time, the ſaid <hi>Indians,</hi> were well provided with Proviſions, and Suitable Neceſſaries The reſt of the Indians Robb'd the Engliſh, and took ſome Engliſh Priſoners: Whereupon Poſt was ſent to <hi>Boſton.</hi> Sir <hi>Edmond Androſs</hi> being at <hi>New-York,</hi> the Gentlemen of <hi>Boſton</hi> ſent to <hi>Falmouth,</hi> ſome Souldiers for the Defence of the Country, and alſo the Worſhipful Mr. <hi>Stoughton,</hi> with others, to Treat with the <hi>Indians,</hi> in order for the Settling of a <hi>Peace,</hi> and getting in of our Engliſh Captives. As ſoon as the ſaid Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men arrived at the Eaſt-ward, they ſent away one of the <hi>Indian</hi> Priſoners, to the reſt of the <hi>Indians,</hi> to Summon them, to bring in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh they had taken; Alſo, that their <hi>Sachims</hi> ſhould come in, to treat with the Engliſh, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

yet our Engliſh Gentlemen did conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to it, in hope of getting in our Captives, &amp; putting a ſtop to further Trouble.

Such was their Treachery! Our Gentlemen ſtaid days to wait their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; but ſeeing they did not appear at the place appointed, they Returned to <hi>Falmouth,</hi> and brought the Indian Priſoners; expecting that the other <hi>Indians</hi> would have ſent down ſome Reaſon, why they did not appear at the place appointed, and to make ſome excuſe for themſelves. But inſtead of any compliance, they fell upon <hi>North Yarmouth,</hi> and there kill'd ſeveral of our Engliſh. Whereupon the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts were ordered to get into Garriſons, and to be upon their Guard, until further Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from Sir <hi>Edmond Andros</hi>; and that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Priſoners ſhould be ſent to <hi>Boſton</hi>; which

A.</hi> Returning from <hi>New-York,</hi> ſet them all at Liberty; not ſo much as taking care to Redeem thoſe of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> for them, that were in their hands. I had kept one at <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> a Priſoner to be a Guide into the Woods, for our Engliſh, to find out the Haunts of our Heathen Enemies. But Sir <hi>E. A.</hi> ſent an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to me, that upon my utmoſt peril, I ſhould ſet the ſaid Indian at Liberty, and take care that all the Arms, that were taken from him, and all the reſt of thoſe Capt. <hi>Blackman</hi> had Seized, ſhould be delivered up to them, without any Orders to Receive the like of ours from them.</p>

                     <p>It will be readily Acknowledged, that here was enough done, to render the <hi>Indians</hi> Inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, for not coming in, upon the <hi>Proclamation,</hi> which Sir <hi>Edmond Andros,</hi> then Governour of <hi>New-England,</hi> immediately Emitted thereupon, requiring them, to Surrender the <hi>Murderers,</hi> now among them.

miſtake not, the <hi>Bravest Act</hi> in the <hi>War,</hi> fell out upon it. <hi>Modockawando</hi> is now come, according to his Promiſe a Twelve-Month ago. Captain <hi>Convers,</hi> was lodg'd in <hi>Storers</hi> Garriſon at <hi>Wells,</hi> with but Fifteen men; and there came into <hi>Wells,</hi> Two Sloops, with a Shallop, which had aboard Supplies of <hi>Ammunition</hi> for the Souldiers, and <hi>Contribution</hi> for the Needy. The <hi>Cattel</hi> this Day came <hi>Frighted,</hi> and <hi>Bleeding</hi> out of the Woods, which was a more certain <hi>Omen</hi> of <hi>Indians</hi> a coming, than all the <hi>Prodigies</hi> that <hi>Livy</hi> reports of the <hi>Sacrificed Oxen. Convers</hi> immediately iſſued out his Commands unto all Quarters, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the <hi>Sloops</hi> juſt then arrived. The <hi>Sloops</hi> were Commanded by <hi>Samuel Storer,</hi> and <hi>James Gouge,</hi> and <hi>Gouges</hi> being Two miles up the <hi>River,</hi> he wiſely brought her down undiſcovered, unto <hi>Storers,</hi> by the advantage of a Miſt then prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A careful <hi>Night,</hi> they had on't! The next <hi>Morning,</hi> before <hi>Day-Light,</hi> one <hi>John Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> a Stranger that came in the Shallop on a Viſit, came to Captain <hi>Conver's</hi> Garriſon, where the Watch invited him in; but he choſe rather to go aboard the Sloops, which were little more than a Gun-ſhot off; and, alas, the Enemy iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from their Lurking places, immediately Siez'd him, and haled him away by the Hair of the Head, (in ſpite of all Attempts uſed by the Garriſon, to Recover him) for an <hi>horrible Story,</hi> to be told by'nd by concerning him.

Exhorting 'em to Courage, and Aſſuring 'em, that if they would Courageouſly fall upon the Engliſh, all was their own. The <hi>Speech</hi> being Ended, they fell to the <hi>Work,</hi> and with an horrid Shout and Shot, made their Aſſault, upon the Feeble <hi>Garriſon</hi>: but the Engliſh anſwered with a brisk Volley, and ſent ſuch a Leaden Showre among them, that they retired from the <hi>Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> to ſpend the Storm of their Fury upon the <hi>Sloops.</hi> You muſt know, That <hi>Wells-Harbour</hi> is rather a <hi>Creek</hi> than a <hi>River,</hi> for 'tis very Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and at low water, in many places <hi>Dry</hi>: nevertheleſs, where the Veſſels ride, it is <hi>Deep</hi> enough, and ſo far off the Bank, that there is from thence no Leaping aboard.

Such an Engine they underſtood how to Shape, without having Read, (I ſuppoſe) the Deſcription of the <hi>Pluteus</hi> in <hi>Vegetius</hi>! This <hi>Chariot</hi> they puſh'd on, towards the <hi>Sloops,</hi> till they were got, it may be, within <hi>Fifteen yards</hi> of them; when, lo, one of the <hi>Wheels</hi> to their Admiration Sunk into the Ground.

Stepping to the <hi>Wheel, Storer</hi> with a well placed Shot, ſent <hi>him</hi> after his <hi>Mate</hi>: So the Reſt thought, it was beſt let it ſtand as it was. The Enemy kept Galling the <hi>Sloops,</hi> from their Several Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and calling 'em to Surrender, with many fine promiſes to make them <hi>Happy,</hi> which ours anſwered with a juſt <hi>Laughter,</hi> that had now and then a mortiferous <hi>Bullet</hi> at the End of it. The Tide Riſing, the <hi>Chariot</hi> overſet, ſo that the men behind it lay open to the <hi>Sloops,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Diſpenſed an horrible Slaughter among them; and they that could get away, got as faſt, and as far off, as they could. In the Night, the Enemy had much Diſcourſe with the <hi>Sloops</hi>; they Enquired. <hi>Who were their Commanders?</hi> and the Engliſh gave an Anſwer, which in ſome other Caſes, and Places, would have been too true, <hi>That they had a great many Commanders:</hi> but the Indians Replyed, <hi>You ly, you have none but</hi> Convers, <hi>and we will have him too before Morning</hi>!

The Scout <hi>Return'd,</hi> into the very Mouth of the Enemy, that lay before the Garriſon; but the <hi>Corporal,</hi> having his Wits about him, call'd out aloud, (as if he had ſeen Captain <hi>Convers</hi> making a Salley forth upon 'em,) <hi>Captain, Wheel about your men round the Hill, and we ſhall Catch 'em, there are but a Few Rogues of 'em!</hi> Upon which the <hi>Indians</hi> imagining, that Captain <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> had been at their <hi>Heels,</hi> betook themſelves to their <hi>Heels</hi>; and our Folks got ſafe into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Garriſon.

The <hi>Women</hi> in the Garriſon, on this occaſion took up the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Stroke, and not only brought Ammunition to the <hi>Men,</hi> but alſo with a <hi>Manly</hi> Reſolution fired ſeveral Times upon the Enemy. The Enemy finding that Things would not yet go to their minds, at the <hi>Garriſon,</hi> drew off, to Try their Skill upon the <hi>Sloops,</hi> which lay ſtill a breſt in the Creek, laſh'd faſt one to another.

When they were come to the Garriſon, they went to look for the Tracks of the Strange men, that had been ſeen, and ſaw ſeveral Tracks; and whilſt they were looking on them, they ſaw one, which look'd like an <hi>Indian,</hi> having on a Blue coat, and his Hair Ty'd up behind, Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a Tree, and looking on them.

                              <p>I might have given you a larger Account; only ſeveral who Saw and Heard ſome of the moſt Remarkable things, are now beyond Sea. However, I hope, the Subſtance of what is written, will be enough to Satisfy all Rational Perſons, that <hi>Glocester</hi> was not Alarumed laſt Summer, for above a Fortnight together, by real <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> but that the <hi>Devil</hi> and his Agents, were the cauſe of all the Moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which at this Time befel the Town; in the Name of whoſe Inhabitants, I would take

His Excellency ſent away Captain <hi>Convers,</hi> to draw off the fitteſt of the Officers and Souldiers, quartered in the Eaſt, for a March, and cauſing about Three Hundred and Fifty more to be Levied, gave him, what he had merited above a year ago; even a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>Major</hi> and Commander in Chief over theſe Forces. While Major <hi>Convers</hi> was at <hi>Wells,</hi> hearing of ſome Indians, that were ſeen in the Woods, he Surpriſed them all, and finding that they had cut off a poor Family at <hi>Oyſter River,</hi> he gave the chief of them, ſomething of what <hi>they</hi> alſo had merited. Going to <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi>

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing then to <hi>Saco,</hi> they began another <hi>Fort,</hi> which was carried on by that worthy Gentleman Major <hi>Hook,</hi> and the truly commendable Captain <hi>Hill,</hi> and proved a matter of Good Conſequence unto the Province. While theſe Things were doing, ſome time in <hi>July,</hi> the Straggling Indians did ſome Spoil, upon <hi>Quaboag,</hi> a remote Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, in the Road unto <hi>Connecticut</hi>; but Advice being diſpatch'd unto the Towns upon <hi>Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut</hi>-River, a party immediately Salley'd out after the Spoilers, and leaving their Horſes at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of a <hi>Swamp,</hi> whither by their Track they had followed them, they come upon the Secure Adverſary, and kill'd the moſt of them, and Recovered the Captives, with their Plunder; and Returning home, had ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for ſo brisk an Action.</p>

Several perſons Remarkably Eſcaped this Bloody Deluge, but none, with more Bravery, than one <hi>Thomas Bickford,</hi> who had an Houſe, a Little Palliſado'd, by the River Side; but no man in it beſides himſelf. He dexterouſly put his Wife, and Mother, and Children aboard a Canoo, and Sending them down the River, he <hi>Alone,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to the Defence of his Houſe, againſt many Indians, that made an Aſſault upon him.

They firſt would have perſwaded him, with many fair <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and then, terrified him with as many Fierce <hi>Threatnings,</hi> to yield himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he flouted and fired at them, daring 'em, to come if they durſt.

In fine, The pittiful Wretches, deſpairing to <hi>Beat</hi> him out of his Houſe, e'en left him in it; whereas many that opened unto them, upon their Solemn En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of giving them Life and Good Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were barborouſly butchered by them; and the Wife of one <hi>Adams,</hi> then with Child, was with horrible Barbarity Ripped up. And thus there was an End of the <hi>Peace,</hi> made at <hi>Pemma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid</hi>! Upon this, the Friends of Mrs <hi>Urſula Cutt,</hi> (Widow of Mr <hi>John Cutt,</hi> formerly Preſident of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi>) deſired her, to leave her Farm, which was about a Mile above the Bank Expoſed unto the Enemy, on the South ſide of <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> River.

The Indians Then Kill'd this Gentlewoman, and Three other People, a little before they had Finiſhed a point of Husbandry, then in their Hand. Nor did the Storm go over ſo: Some Drops of it fell upon the Town of <hi>Groton,</hi> a Town that lay, one would think, far enough off, the place, where was the laſt <hi>Scene</hi> of the <hi>Tragedy.</hi> On <hi>July</hi> 27.

                     <p>BUt now <hi>Bommaſeen</hi> is fallen into our Hands, let us have a little Diſcourſe with him.</p>
                     <p>Behold, Reader, the Troubles, and the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of <hi>New-England!</hi> That thou mayſt a little more Exactly Behold the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the matter, I'l Recite certain paſſages, occurring in a Diſcourſe that paſs'd between this <hi>Bommaſeen</hi> (who was one of the <hi>Indian Princes,</hi> or, <hi>Chieftanes,</hi>) and a Miniſter of the Goſpel, in the year. 1696.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bommaſeen,</hi> was, with ſome other Indians, now a Priſoner, in <hi>Boſton.</hi> He deſired a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with a Miniſter, of <hi>Boſton,</hi> which was granted him. <hi>Bommaſeen,</hi> with the other <hi>Indians</hi> aſſenting and aſſerting to it, then told the Miniſter, That he pray'd his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi>; inaſmuch as he was afraid, that the <hi>French,</hi> in the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> which they taught the <hi>Indians,</hi> had Abuſed them. The Miniſter Enquired of him, What of the Things taught 'em by the <hi>French,</hi> appear'd moſt Suſpicious to 'em? He ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>French</hi> taught 'em, That the Lord JESUS CHRIST, was of the <hi>French Nation</hi>; That His Mother, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was a <hi>French Lady</hi>; That they were the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who had Murdered him; and,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:000873_0127_0FAC93B516645490"/>
That whereas He Roſe from the Dead, &amp; went up to the Heavens, all that would Recommend themſelves unto His Favour, muſt Revenge His Quarrel upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as far as they can. He ask'd the Miniſter, whether theſe Things were ſo; and pray'd the Miniſter to Inſtruct him in the True <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter conſidering, that the Humour and Manner of the <hi>Indians,</hi> was to have their Diſcourſes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, with much of <hi>Similitude</hi> in them, Look'd about for ſome Agreeable object, from whence he might with apt <hi>Reſemblances</hi> Convey the <hi>Idae's</hi> of Truth unto the minds of Salvages: and he thought, none would be more Agreeable to <hi>them,</hi> than a <hi>Tankard of Drink,</hi> which happened then to be ſtanding on the Table. So he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in this <hi>Method</hi> with 'em.</p>
                     <p>He told them, [ſtill with proper Actions painting, and pointing out the <hi>Signs</hi> unto them,] That our Lord JESUS CHRIST, had given us, a <hi>Good Religion,</hi> which might be Reſembled unto the <hi>Good Drink in the Cup,</hi> upon the Table.</p>
                     <p>That if we Take this <hi>Good Religion,</hi> (even that <hi>Good Drink,</hi>) into our Hearts, it will do us <hi>Good,</hi> and preſerve us from <hi>Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Gods <hi>Book,</hi> the <hi>Bible,</hi> is the <hi>Cup,</hi> wherein that <hi>Good Drink,</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> is offered unto us.</p>
                     <p>That the <hi>French,</hi> having the <hi>Cup</hi> of <hi>Good Drink,</hi> in their Hands, had put <hi>Poiſon</hi> into it; and then made the <hi>Indians</hi> to Drink that <hi>Poiſoned Liquor,</hi>

                     <p>That, it was plain, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had put no <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> into the <hi>Good Drink</hi>; for they ſet the <hi>Cup</hi> wide open, and invited all men, to <hi>Come</hi> &amp; <hi>See</hi> before they <hi>Taſt</hi>; even, the very <hi>Indians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for we Tranſlated the <hi>Bible</hi> into <hi>Indian.</hi> That they might gather from hence, that the <hi>French</hi> had put <hi>Poiſon</hi> into the <hi>Good Drink</hi>; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as the <hi>French</hi> kept the <hi>Cup</hi> faſt Shut, (the Bible in an <hi>Unknown Tongue,</hi>) and kept their <hi>Hands</hi> upon the <hi>Eyes</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> when they put it unto their mouths.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> Expreſſing themſelves to be well-Satisfied, with what the Miniſter had hitherto ſaid, pray'd him, to go on, with ſhowing 'em, what was the <hi>Good Drink,</hi> and what was the <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> had put into it.</p>
                     <p>He then ſet before them diſtinctly the chief <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> with all the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and Sincerity of a <hi>Protestant:</hi> Adding upon each, <hi>This is the Good Drink, in the Lords Cup of Life</hi>: And they ſtill profeſſed, <hi>That they liked it all.</hi>

                     <p>Whereupon, he demonſtrated unto them, how the <hi>Papists</hi> had in their Idolatrous <hi>Popery,</hi> ſome way or other Depraved, and Altered, every one of theſe <hi>Articles</hi>; with Scandalous <hi>Ingredients</hi> of

                        <hi>To obtain the Pardon of your Sins, you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs your Sins to God; &amp; pray to God, That He would Pardon your Sins, for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, who dyed for the Sins of His People: God Loves Jeſus Chriſt infinitely, and if you place your Eye on Jeſus Christ only, when you beg the Pardon of your Sins, God will Pardon them.

                     <p>He then added; <hi>The French have put Poiſon in to this Good Drink; They tell you, that you muſt confeſs your Sins to a Prieſt, and carry skins to a Prieſt, and Submit unto a Penance enjoyned by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Murderer was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous kind of a <hi>Giant</hi> among the Indians; a Fellow Reputed Seven Foot High: This Fellow kill'd the poor old man in cold Blood, after he had Surrendred himſelf a Priſoner: But behold, Before many Hours were out, this famous and bloody Fellow accidently Shot himſelf to Death, by his Gun going off, when he was fooliſhly pulling a Canoo to the Shore with it.</p>

much doubted, <hi>What Indians!</hi>) have in this War, made ſeveral Deſcents upon ſome of the upper Towns, that were our moſt <hi>Northerly Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements</hi> upon <hi>Connecticut</hi> River. But the Pious, and Honeſt People in thoſe Towns, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways given them a brave Repulſe, and had a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Experience of the Divine Favour to them, in their preſervations. <hi>Deerfield</hi> ha's been an Extraordinary Inſtance of Courage, in keeping their <hi>Station,</hi> though they have lived all this while in a very <hi>Pihahiroth</hi>; and their worthy Paſtor, Mr. <hi>John Williams,</hi> deſerves the Thanks of all this Province, for his Encouraging them all the ways Imaginable, to <hi>Stand</hi> their ground. Once the Enemy was like to have Surpriſed them into a grievous Deſolation; but <hi>he,</hi> with his Praying, and Valiant, little Flock, moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily Repelled them. And now, about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>July,</hi> 1698. a little before Sun ſet, <hi>Four Indians,</hi> killed a Man and a Boy, in <hi>Hatfield</hi> Meadows; and carried away Two Boys, into Captivity.

After a Travel of near Twenty Miles, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <hi>Indians,</hi> in their <hi>Canooes</hi> coming up the
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:000873_0151_0FAC93CAC638E928"/>
River, but on the other ſide of it, within a Rod or Two, of the oppoſite Shore: Whereupon they ſo <hi>Shot,</hi> as to <hi>Hitt</hi> one of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and then they all Jump't out of the <hi>Canooes,</hi> and one of the Boyes with them. The <hi>wounded Salvage</hi> crawled unto the Shoar; where, his <hi>back</hi> being broken, he lay in great Anguſh, often Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring with his Hatchet, for to knock out his own <hi>Brains,</hi> and tear open his own <hi>Breaſt,</hi> but could not: and another <hi>Indian</hi> ſeeing the Two Boyes getting one to another, deſign'd 'em a Shot, but his Gun would not go off: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he followed 'em with his Hatchet, for to have knock'd 'em on the Head; but juſt as he come at 'em, one of our men ſent a <hi>Shot</hi> into him, that Spoilt his Enterprize; and ſo the Boyes getting together, into one <hi>Canooe,</hi> brought it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the Friends thus concerned for them. Theſe good men, ſeeing their Exploit perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus far; <hi>Two Indians</hi> deſtroy'd, and <hi>Two Children</hi> delivered, they fell to <hi>Praiſing of God</hi>; and one young man particularly, kept thus Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing himſelf; <hi>Surely, Tis God, and not we, that have wrought this Deliverance</hi>! But, as we have ſometimes been told.

                     <p>This is but like a paſſage mentioned in the Life, of that Excellent man Mr. P. <hi>Henry,</hi> lately publiſhed.

                        <hi>Two</hi> Things we will venture to Inſert.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> For <hi>our ſelves,</hi> at home, Let us Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber an awful Saying of our <hi>Goodwin,</hi> quoted by my Reverend Friend, Mr. <hi>Noyes,</hi> in his late Excellent Sermon at our Anniverſary <hi>Election.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>As you Look for <hi>Storms</hi> in <hi>Autumn,</hi> and <hi>Frosts</hi> in <hi>Winter,</hi> ſo Expect <hi>Judgments,</hi> where the Goſpel hath been Preached; for the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of the Covenant muſt be Avenged.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly. For <hi>the Church</hi> abroad, I am far from deſerting, what was Aſſerted, in the Sermon Preached at our Anniverſary Election, in the year, 1696.
<q>The <hi>Tidings</hi> which I bring unto you, are, That there is a <hi>Revolution,</hi> and a <hi>Reformation,</hi> at the very Door, which will be vaſtly more wonderful, than any of the Deliverances yet ſeen by the Church of God, from the Beginning of the World, I do

not ſay, That the <hi>Next year</hi> will bring on this <hi>Happy Period</hi>: but this I do ſay, The Bigger part of this Aſſembly, may, in the courſe of Nature, Live to ſee it. Theſe Things will come on, with horrible Commotions, and Concuſſions, and Confuſions: The mighty Angels of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, will make their Deſcent, and ſet the World a <hi>Trembling</hi> at the Approaches of their Almighty Lord: They will <hi>Shake</hi> Nations, and <hi>Shake</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and <hi>Shake</hi> mighty Kingdoms, and <hi>Shake once more, not Earth only, but Heaven alſo.</hi>

                  <p>WHen the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were Engaged in a WAR, they made choice of a <hi>Priest</hi> among them, to Serve ſome of their greateſt Occaſions in it, and after a <hi>Sacred Unction</hi> beſtow'd upon him, we are told by <hi>Maimonides,</hi> he was call'd <hi>Maſhuach Milchamah,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Unctus Belli</hi>; which was as much as to ſay, <hi>The Prieſt of the War.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To bring unto a People profitable Advices &amp; Reflections upon a WAR, wherein they are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and ſound the <hi>Silver Trumpet,</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, with agreeable Notes unto them in it, is to do in ſome ſort, the Office of the <hi>Maſhuach Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamah</hi>

                  <p>The Hiſtory of a long <hi>War,</hi> hath, with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible care of <hi>Truth,</hi> been given you. The Author Earneſtly prayes, that if the leaſt material <hi>Miſtake</hi> have happened in the Hiſtory, <hi>He</hi> may be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, &amp; <hi>It</hi> may be corrected. The Noiſe that may be made, by a few Sordid People, here &amp; there, in a Room <hi>Tophetized</hi> with Smoke, and Rhum, and Spittle, and Malice, and <hi>Lyes,</hi> crying out concerning the moſt Conſcientious Eſſayes, to preſerve <hi>Memorable Truths, They are a parcel of Lies</hi>! He values not. But he now tenders to the Acceptance of the more <hi>Civilized Readers,</hi> an Improvement of <hi>Memorable Truths,</hi> which it was <hi>His</hi> Duty to <hi>make,</hi> &amp; it will be <hi>Theirs</hi> to <hi>mind.</hi>

<q>Let Chriſtians no where ſit down without Good Miniſters, but let them rather tarry where they are, as <hi>Ezra</hi> tarryed by the River <hi>Ahava,</hi> till he had got ſome <hi>Levites</hi> to go with them.</q>
And it was even Then obſerved, That places which made Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings any long while without Miniſters, were with miſerable <hi>Unſettlements</hi> broken all to pieces.

If the Lamentable Experience which you have

their Land,</hi> at the Time of their going up to the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> this one bring, was enough to prove, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was come, and the <hi>Paſſover</hi> no longer commanded. It ſhows, That there is a <hi>Strange Operation</hi> of God, upon the <hi>minds</hi> of men, to curb and check, and blind the <hi>Evil-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> Well; We have had our <hi>Frontier Towns,</hi> in many of which, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath been Worſhipped, and Sought, and Serv'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. Had the Lurking <hi>Enemy</hi> done as they might have done, how eaſily might one dozen of them, have kept the Towns in ſuch perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and perplexing <hi>Alarms,</hi> as would have cauſed them, even to have broken up! And what <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known miſchiefs</hi> might a few more of 'em, have brought upon our Scattered Plantations. I do again, and again ſay, This is from the <hi>Strange Operation</hi> of God, upon the <hi>Minds</hi> of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that they have no more <hi>Diſturbed our Land.</hi> For my own part, I will <hi>obſerve</hi> it, and <hi>Admire</hi> it, in ſuch Terms as <hi>Auſtin</hi> uſed upon a Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Providence; <hi>Quiſquis non videt, Caecus; Quiſquis videt, nec Laudat, Ingratus; Quisquis Laudanti reluctatur, Inſanus</hi>: They are <hi>Blind,</hi> and <hi>Mad,</hi> that are Inſenſible of it!</p>
                  <p>Yet again, Have not our <hi>Engliſh Priſoners</hi> been favoured with ſuch a <hi>Remembrance of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> in the <hi>midſt of Wrath,</hi> as ought never to be <hi>Forgotten</hi>?

This <hi>One Thing</hi> will be thought by ſome, almoſt as Great and Strange an Inſtance of an Immediate Interpoſition of the <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as the muzzling of the Lions in the Den of <hi>Daniel!
