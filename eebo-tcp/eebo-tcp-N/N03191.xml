            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I could not but take Notice of the</hi> Crowded Aſſembly <hi>when it was Delivered, Many (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) being led by their Curioſity to</hi> hear ſome New thing <hi>and obſerve what our Sentiments and Diſpoſitions were under ſuch an Awful hand of God, And Oh that our Behaviour at this Day, may be ſuitable and becoming both in the Eyes of GOD and Men!</hi>

Moſes <hi>giving a relation of the Solemnity of that Day when the Law was given from</hi> Mount Sinal, <hi>thus Expreſſe h himſelf, Deut.</hi> 4.32, 33. But ask now of the days that are paſt which were before thee, ſince the day that God creared man upon earth, and ask from the one ſide of heaven unto the other, whither there hath been any ſuch thing, is this great thing is, or hath been heard like it, Did ever people hear the Voice of God, ſpeaking out of the midſt of the fire, as thou haſt heard and live?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Never was any Diſpenſation in all its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to be Compared to that, It was a wonder how their frail Natures could Endure the Majeſty and Terror of the Lord, that they were not quite oppreſſed by the over-bearing Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>However, Somthing like this; We alſo have</hi> heard the Voice of God, ſpeaking out of the midſt of the Fire <hi>and</hi> yet we Live. <hi>And it is hard to ſay whither the greatneſs of the Danger, or the wonderfulneſs of our Preſervation be moſt to be Admired; And poſſibly one End of his, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us into the Danger was to ſhew his great power and mercy in our Signal Preſervation &amp; Eſcape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We alſo like the</hi> People of Iſrael, <hi>were thrown into great fear and Conſternation, and perhaps
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:003861_0005_10020664DB648AF0"/>like them were ready to promiſe, Let the Lord pleaſe to declare unto us his Will in a more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and gentle way and</hi> we will hear it and do it. <hi>If any ſuch Impreſſions were made upon us, no doubt the Lord approves of them ſo far as to deſire they may be laſting. Deut.</hi> 5.29. Oh! that there were ſuch an heart in them, that they would fear me and keep my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments always, that it might be well with them and with their children for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doubtleſs You are perſwaded, that it is not Enough to be a little ſtartled and put on a face of Seriouſneſs for a time, We muſt</hi> think on our ways <hi>and</hi> turn our feet into God's teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <hi>And tho' frowns and Severities alone, be they ever ſo ſharp and awful, will not produce an happy change of Heart and Life, Yet by diſpoſing us to be more Serious and thoughtful, they may prepare the way for God's grace to Effect this deſirable Change; when</hi> every Valley is Exalted <hi>and</hi> every Mountain and hill made Low, <hi>then the</hi> Glory of the Lord may be revealed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have in the following Diſcourſe, taken the Opportunity, to recommend and preſs ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars for the Amendment of our Conduct, which now it is put into Your hands, I truſt you will peruſe with a ſuitable regard, For</hi> are there not with us, Even with us Sins againſt the Lord?

               <hi>Every one may Know</hi> the Plague of their own Hearts <hi>and Diſcern the</hi> Error of their ways, <hi>if they would ſet themſelves diligently to Enquire, Let us then</hi> Search and try our ways and turn again unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God hath graciouſly begun of Late a good work in the Country, We hear of great Numbers of People</hi> asking the way to Zion with their faces thitherward; <hi>Why ſhould we be</hi> the Laſt to bring the King back to his Throne? <hi>Yea, why ſhould we</hi> come behind <hi>the very</hi> Chiefeſt Chriſtians?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is Certainly our Intereſt as well as Duty, to get Near to our God and keep Near to our God, to walk in all his Ways and keep his Commandments, as he Commanded our Fathers; And who can tell what</hi> reſerves of Mercy <hi>of this Kind, he may have in ſtore for us? When he pleaſeth to work, there is Nothing can Let it, Then the</hi> hearts of the raſh ſhall underſtand Knowledge; <hi>the moſt ſtubborn tempers ſhall Yield and the</hi> Heart of Stone <hi>be Changed into</hi> An Heart of Fleſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If this may but be</hi> the fruit, <hi>even to</hi> take away all our Sin, <hi>If by this, our</hi> Iniquity may be purged, <hi>We ſhall have reaſon to bleſs the Stroke that drives us home to our God and directs our feet into the path of Life.</hi>

            <p>IN this Pſalm, David begins by ſaying, that <hi>Praiſe waited for God in Zion</hi> and <hi>unto him the Vow ſhall be performed.</hi> What if we ſhould conjecture Now, that this may poſſibly have reference to that period of time, when David finding a little reſpite from his Wars and having Conquered <hi>Jebus</hi> (which was afterward, called <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) and particularly taken the Strong-hold of <hi>Zion,</hi> which was called the

            <p>Praiſe <hi>waited</hi> or was <hi>Silent</hi> for God, (as the Hebrew word ſignifies) now in Zion, The Servants of God ſtood ready, as ſoon as the Ark ſhould be brought in, and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God be ſet up there, to Celebrate his praiſe and there he ſhould be praiſed from Generation to Generation.</p>
            <p>And not only God's peculiar people the Jews but Proſelites and people out of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, brought by the Fame of the God of

            <p>As to their Preſent ſtate indeed, he Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth it to be bad Enough, Iniquities prevailing and abounding among them (In his Predeceſſor's reign, too little care had been taken about the Exerciſe and Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of religion, Neither had he that juſt authority in his own Court as yet, which were to be wiſhed, while the Sons of Zer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viah were frequently too hard for him) But then he Exerciſeth faith, that God would graciouſly pardon their Iniquities and heal their backſlidings. Ver. 3. <hi>Iniquiries prevail against me: as for our tranſgriſſions thou ſhalt purge them away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now he refreſheth himſelf with the Conſideration of the bleſſedneſs of their condition, who ſhall he admitted to approach into the preſence of God in the way of his appointment (a thing too little underſtood and Valued by vulgar and carnal minds) ver. 4. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chuſeſt and cauſeſt to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts; we ſhall be ſatisfied with the goodneſs of thy houſe and of thy holy temple.</hi>

Why may it not be thought that David hath particular reference to himſelf here? Eſpecially when we compare the words with a Sam. 6.21. — <hi>It was before the Lord which choſe me before thy Father.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Now come in the words of the Text, which ſeem a little to cloud and Darken this glorious proſpect, wherein he ſaith, <hi>By terrible things in righteouſneſs, wilt thou anſwer us.</hi>

            <p>If the foregoing Expoſition ſhould hold and may be allowed, whither theſe words may not refer to the breach that was made upon <hi>

Certainly, it was an awful and terrible thing, And it was done <hi>in Righteouſneſs</hi> too, however ſevere it might ſeem; David was much affected with it, And it put a ſtop to the bringing home of the Ark for ſome years afterwards.</p>
            <p>Some Interpreters Expound theſe words of the terrible Judgments which God is wont to Inflict upon the Enemies of his Church and People; They pray to him in their diſtreſs, when they are ſet upon and uſed hardly by their Enemies and the Lord

            <p>Other Interpreters, tell us, that this may be underſtood, <q>Of the rebukes which God in his providence gives ſomtimes to his own People, He often anſwers them by terrible things for the Awakening and Quickning of them, But always in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, He neither doth them any wrong, nor means them any hurt; for Even then he is the God of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, By wonderful things, Things which are very Surprizing, Things that ſtrike an Aw upon us wilt thou anſwer us; The holy freedom that we are admitted unto in God's Courts, and the Nearneſs of our approach unto him, muſt not at all abate our reverence and godly fear of him, <hi>For he is terrible in his holy places,</hi> Pſal. 68.34, 35.<note n="†" place="bottom">

We may Conſider, <hi>That yet at the ſame time He is the God of their Salvation.</hi> So he is ſtyled in the Text, And this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is as Comfortable and refreſhing, as the other is awful and Terrifying Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things from an almighty, ſtern and inexorable Judge are overwhelming indeed, but when they come from a reconciled Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the God of our Salvation, this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration may well ſuſtain and bear us up; Often in Scripture is the Lord ſtyled, the <hi>God of Salvation,</hi> and the <hi>God of our Salvation.</hi> 1 Chron 16.35. <hi>Save us, O God of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Pſal. 24.5. <hi>He ſhall receive — righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs from the God of his Salvation.</hi> Pſal. 68.19, 20. — <hi>Even the God of our Salvation, He that is our God is the God of Salvation and unto God the Lord belong the iſſues from Death.</hi> And frequently elſewhere.</p>
            <p>In two reſpects principally the Lord our God may fitly be ſtyled the God of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>On the account of the Eminent Salvations and Deliverances given to his people in times of Danger, Difficulty and Diſtreſs.</hi> Whatever Salvations they receive God is the Author of them, Whatever means or Inſtruments are uſed, he is the principal Cauſe and they
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003861_0027_100265F35245AC60"/>are effectual only in his hand; When De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is near people, God many times reſcues them from the ſtrokes of it and that very remarkably, He puts them a little out of the way of it, He ſhields and covers them and as it were hides them in the Hollow of his hand that they ſhall not be at all hurt; In Battles, when Deſtruction is fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on every ſide, In Storms at Sea and in Tempeſts and other Dangers on Shore, The Lord covers their heads, is their Shield and the God of their Salvation; We wonder how they Eſcaped when we come afterwards to reflect and Conſider of it; We ſhould have thought it almoſt Impoſſible that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in ſuch Circumſtances, in ſuch a Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could have Eſcaped Death; but God preſerveth them by his power and goodneſs and they receive little or no hurt; The Pſalmiſt uſeth many metaphorical yet apt Expreſſions to ſet this forth. Pſal. 91.3—7. <hi>Surely he ſhall deliver thee from the ſnare of the fowler and from the noiſom peſtilence, He ſhall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings ſhalt thou truſt, His truth ſhall be thy ſhield and buckler, Thou ſhalt not be afraid of the Terror by Night, nor the arrow that flyeth by Day, Nor for the peſtilence that walketh in Darkneſs, nor for the Deſtruction that waſteth at Noon-day; a thouſand ſhall fall at thy ſide and ten thouſand
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003861_0028_10020685E1CD88B0"/>at thy right hand, but it ſhall not come nigh thee.</hi> On this account he is the God of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Creatures</hi> may be <hi>Means</hi> of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but He is the <hi>God</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He may be ſtyled, The God of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that <hi>he is the Author of their Eternal Salvation from Sin and all the fatal Conſequences thereof.</hi> When all had been ruined and loſt by mans Apoſtaſy from God, he graciouſly deviſed means for their recovery and <hi>laid help upon One that is mighty to Save,</hi> He ſent his Son into the world to take our Natures upon him and therein to make Satisfaction for our Offences, to lay a foundation for our recovery and reconciliation to God; He hath ordered this good News to be brought to our Ears and Life and Happineſs to be offered us in his Name; If any of the Sons of men, hearing of theſe things, do cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt upon his own terms, it is he that Enableth them to do it; <hi>He ſaveth them and calleth them with an holy Calling, not according to their works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace;</hi> And Finally, he brings them ſafely at laſt, through many Hardſhips and tryals, temptations and difficulties to Everlaſting Life; On this account He is (as he is here termed) <hi>the God of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:003861_0029_1002069A2FA9B4B8"/>
And Even when perſons fall by temporal Judgments, as Eli and Uzza and Joſiah and others did, it would be hard to think or ſay, that they muſt needs on that account, come ſhort of Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the <hi>IMPROVEMENT.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Doth the God of their Salvation ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times manifeſt himſelf to his people by Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things in Righteouſneſs? <hi>Then it is a weakneſs even in them to Expect, that the Courſe of his providential dealings with them, ſhould be always Smooth, gentle and eaſie.</hi> They may look that ſomtimes he will <hi>write bitter things againſt them,</hi> that he will <hi>ſhew them hard things</hi> and <hi>cauſe them to Drink the wine of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as the Expreſſions are, Job 13.26. Pſal. 60.3. It is Enough, that he is <hi>the God of our Salvation</hi> and that he will take a father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Care of them that <hi>Love him</hi> and <hi>deſire to fear his Name</hi> and that at length their <hi>Souls</hi> ſhall be <hi>bound up in the bundle of Life;</hi> They muſt not think to be Exempt from the Common Accidents, troubles and ſorrows of Life, No, nor from Extraordinary ſtrokes Neither, at what time or in what manner it ſhall pleaſe our heavenly Father to inflict them.</p>

II. Doth the God of our Salvation ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times manifeſt himſelf to his people by Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things in Righteouſneſs? <hi>Then it is not for them to Murmur and Complain, no, not ſo much as to think hardly of the providence of God, when ſuch things happen to them.</hi> All is done in Righteouſneſs, There is Enough in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to juſtify even a much greater Severity, Our mouths muſt be ſtopped from <hi>Charging God fooliſhly,</hi> and we muſt ſay with the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,</hi> Iſal 103.10. <hi>He hath not dealt with us after our ſins nor regarded us according to our iniquities.</hi> Or. Lan. 3.22. <hi>It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions fail not.</hi> Inſtead of finding fault or thinking hardly, it will become us on ſuch Occaſions, with <hi>Job.</hi> to fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Adore.

            <p n="3">III. Doth the God of our Salvation ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times manifeſt himſelf to his people, by Terrible things in Righteouſneſs? <hi>Then all their religious Friends that hear of ſuch ſevere diſpenſations of divine providence, towards any perſon or people, ſhould be ſure to pity, Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with and pray for them.</hi> They ſhould put themſelves in their place and Imagine that their <hi>Souls</hi> are <hi>in their Souls ſtead;</hi> If they have Opportunity they may do very well to get about them, direct, counſel and

Job 2.11. — <hi>They had made an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment together to Come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</hi> People ſhould not be careleſs and unconcerned about what befals others, while their Condition cries to them in that Language, Job 19.21. <hi>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends, for the hand of God hath touched me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. Doth the God of our Salvation ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times manifeſt himſelf to his people by Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things in Rightcouſneſs? <hi>It becomes them then in ſuch a day, to Conſider what the can and Language of ſuch providences is, and to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as readily and punctually as ever they can, with the Lord's deſign and Intention.</hi> There is a meaning in all ſuch providences, which we ſhould be ſollicitous and Inquiſitive to find out, with a reſolution to Comply with; Now we need the <hi>Interpreter, One of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,</hi> which Elihu ſpeaks of, to <hi>ſhew unto man his uprightneſs,</hi> Job 33.23.

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:003861_0032_1002068922490DC8"/>
And this brings me to Diſcourſe more particularly of the Awful Diſpenſation of divine providence towards Us of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation the laſt Lord's Day.</p>
            <p>We had finiſhed our forenoon's Service and were returned again to the houſe of the Lord, when no ſmall Storm came over us, which prevented diverſe of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from aſſembling together with us; No ſooner had we, that were met, riſen up to worſhip and ſcarce had we begun to utter our ſelves before the Lord, when a dreadful Thunder-Clap broke upon us, with an ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Noiſe, as if diverſe Cannon had been Diſcharg'd at once; <hi>The fire of God fell</hi> among us, rending the Houſe in a wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which I may not ſtand, neither would it be ſo proper, now to Deſcribe; Striking down to the ground great Numbers of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Burning and wounding ſeveral in a moſt ſorrowful manner; One deſirable Youth after a little ſtruggle preſently Expiring, the Lightning having licked up his ſpirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond recovery.</p>
            <p>Others, upon the application of proper remedies, being brought to their Senſes, were after a while carried home, where ſome of them ſtill are the Lord's priſoners,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003861_0033_100265FA4CD47068"/>waiting upon the ſame hand that wounded, graciouſly to heal and reſtore, And others are come <hi>Halting</hi> hither to Day, to give thanks to the <hi>God of their Salvation;</hi> All of us Stunned and aſtoniſhed with the ſudden and ſurprizing Blow; Methinks the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sound is ſtill in our Ears and we ſhall ſcarce forget it to our Dying Day, Thus did the <hi>God of our Salvation anſwer us by Terrible things in Righteouſneſs;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It can ſcarre be Expreſſed by words the Concern, the Surprize, the Conſternation that was among us on that Occaſion, Every ones Countenance was changed at what had happened Uncertain whither there might not be ſomthing yet more Severe preſently to follow.</p>
            <p>When we could a little recover our ſelves, then the Cries of friends for them that needed help, were very pitiful and affecting.</p>
            <p>We ran to the aſſiſtance of One, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Another and Another and Another in every corner of the Houſe, wanted us at the ſame time; We were all buſied in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good offices for our friends, of one kind or another, to recover them that were quite ſtunned with the blow, to revive them that
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003861_0034_1002068CA1122020"/>fainted and bind up the wounded and at length (when they were in condition for it) to attend and bear them to their ſeveral homes; And only one, by the awful diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of providence, was carried off dead, beyond all poſſibility of recovery; Thus inſtead of the uſual Exerciſes of the Lord's Day, this was our Imployment for that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, And when we had ſent off our dear friends ſufficiently attended, we had no more time left, but only to call together the remains of the Congregation and in a ſhort and humble addreſs to God, to give thanks for our preſervation and bewail the <hi>burning which the Lord had kindled;</hi> So we haſtened home to the farther aſſiſtance of our wounded and Languiſhing friends and alſo to bemoan and Comfort them that had been ſo awfully bereaved.</p>
            <p>The Lord himſelf was pleaſed to preach to us more Immediately, that afternoon in a tremendous manner, cauſing ſuch a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, trembling and Conſternation, as it did at Mount-Sinai, at the giving of the Law. Exod. 20, 18, 19. <hi>And all the people ſaw the thunderings and the lightnings and the voice of the trumpet and the mountain ſmoaking and when the people ſaw it, they removed and ſtood afar off. And, they ſaid unto Moſes, Speak thou with us &amp;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003861_0035_100265FCC3525780"/>we will hear, but let not God ſpeak with us, leſt we die.</hi> The Apoſtle relating this matter, adds ſome more Circumſtances, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.18-21</p>
            <p>Too often (we muſt Confeſs) we have made too light of the Calls and warnings that have been given us by men, but <hi>how ſhall we Eſcape if we turn away from him, that</hi> thus <hi>ſpeaketh from Heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall Caſt what I have farther to ſay upon this Occaſion into the following method.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>I ſhall Conſider what Conſtructions may poſſibly and alſo what ought to be made, of this aſtoniſhing diſpenſation of divine providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>I ſhall call upon the whole preſerved Congregation never to forget, but always to praiſo God for their Eminent Deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>I ſhall put you upon Sympathizing with the more Immediate Sufferers and eſpecially with them who have been ſo ſorely bereaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, Fourthly, <hi>I ſhall Invite and preſs you, Every one to make that wiſe and good improvement of this providence, which our heavenly Father now Expects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:003861_0036_100265FE4647D960"/>
1. I ſhall Conſider, <hi>What Conſtructions may poſſibly and alſo what Ought to be made, of this aſtoniſhing Diſpenſation of divine providence.</hi> In ſuch caſes, Every one have their Sentiments, all perſons have their Say; Some perhaps may Cenſure us as <hi>greater Sinners</hi> than Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, becauſe we have <hi>Suffered ſuch things;</hi> Others, that are more forſaken of ſenſe and reaſon, may Interpret it, as a Teſtimony from Heaven, againſt our Obſervation of Holy Time and profeſſing to ſpend it in the worſhip and ſervice of God; To theſe laſt I would ſay, That when we are commanded, <hi>not to forſake, the aſſembling of our ſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the manner of ſome is,</hi> When the word is to, be <hi>preached in ſeaſon</hi> and <hi>out of ſeaſon;</hi> when a Seventh part of our time hath been set apart from the beginning and made Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to the ſervice of God and the care of our Souls, by a Statute for Ever; We may Eaſily paſs by ſuch Cenſures as theſe and pity thoſe that offer them, Could we Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve holy time and attend theſe religious Duties in a right manner we might Eaſily Juſtify our ſelves both to God and the world, for our Obſerving them at all.</p>
            <p>To the firſt, I would ſay, in our Bleſſed Saviour's words, <hi>Judge not that ye be not Judged,</hi> And put them upon remembring what he alſo ſaid, Luke 13: 1, —5. <hi>There
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003861_0037_1002068FD5546360"/>were preſent at that ſeaſon, ſome that told him of the Galileans whoſe blood Pilate had mingled with their ſacrifices, And Jeſus anſwering ſaid unto them, Suppoſe ye that theſe Galileans were ſinners above all the Galileans, becauſe they ſuffered ſuch things? I tell you Nay, but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh; Or thoſe Eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and ſlew them, Think ye that they were ſinners above them that dwelt in Jeruſalem? I tell you Nay, but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may be allowed, poſſibly, to make ſome ſuch returns unto men.</p>
            <p>But before the Lord our God, we muſt fall down and adore his Soveraignty, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his righteouſneſs, Kiſs the rod, accept the puniſhment of our Iniquity and own that he hath puniſhed us Leſs than our Iniquities have Deſerved, while he thus <hi>ſpits in our Faces</hi> and <hi>makes</hi> us an <hi>Example</hi> before the world. There is no Juſtifying our ſelves before him, Nor may we Expoſtulate the matter with him, ſaying, <hi>Wherefore haſt thou done this unto us?</hi> There hath been Enough and Enough amiſs in our Conduct, to draw down this and heavier Calamities upon our heads. We muſt ſay with Judah, Gen. 44.16 <hi>What ſhall we ſay unto the Lord? what ſhall we ſpeak? or how ſhall we clear our ſelves? God hath
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003861_0038_10026600F04D20A8"/>found out the Iniquity of his Servants.</hi> And, Oh! may the fruit of it be to purge away our Sin and make us partakers of his holineſs.</p>
            <p>From all our Fellow-ſervants, who are wiſe and Conſiderate and that are partakers of the true ſpirit of Chriſtianity, we promiſe our ſelves, their pity and prayers, that they will <hi>not deſpiſe our Sufferings,</hi> but will cordially Commend us to him, who is able to <hi>make all things work together for our good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>I ſhall call upon the whole preſerved Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation never to forget, but always to praiſe God for their Eminent Deliverance.</hi> We might have died by Scores and by Hundreds, Yea, the whole Congregation might have been diſpatch'd at once into Eternity. The Houſe might have been burnt about our Ears, Death came round about us, Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hovered over us, Diverſe were bro't to the gates of Death, the very brink of the pit, and one actually carried thither, more likely to have lived many Years the moment before, than multitudes of us; How is it that we have Eſcaped, but only that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our heavenly Father to have Care of our Lives and mix abundance of Mercy with this Judgment; And ſhall we not now cry out in the Language of the Text, <hi>O God of out Salvation! O God of our Salvation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:003861_0039_1002069220FC9C50"/>
We are as ſo many <hi>brands plucked out of the Burning;</hi> when we were all of us, as it were thrown into the <hi>fiery ſurnace,</hi> our <hi>Lives</hi> were <hi>precious in God's ſight;</hi> And though ſome were more Scorched in the flames, yet they are now in a fair way of recovery, And upon the moſt of us, not ſo much as the <hi>ſmell of fire hath paſſed,</hi> And that promiſe hath been, Even Literally fulfilled unto us, Iſa. 43.2, — <hi>When thou walkest through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is well worthy of Remark, that there were many Inſtances of perſons, who but juſt before, removed from their uſual places of Sitting, Some to avoid the rain that came down upon them, Some moved with fear and ſome (perhaps) for no mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt reaſon, who, if they had Continued but ever ſo little longer in the places where they were, would have been in Eminent hazard of Immediate Death, whither by the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which ſtruck very near thoſe places with a dreadful force and Effects; Or by the fall of pieces of Timber from the roof, ſo large and long, as might have cruſhed many to Death at once, or at leaſt, made them Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for their whole Lives;</p>
            <p>So narrowly have we Eſcaped; ſo ſignally did providence Exert it ſelf for our preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003861_0040_10026603818C87B8"/>And ſhall we not now ſay and ſing with the pſalmiſt, Pſal. 103.1, 2, 4. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within one bleſs his holy Name, Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul and forget not all his benefits. Who redeemeth thy life from deſtruction, who crowneth thee with loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tender mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some (perhaps) may pleaſe and bleſs themſelves, that they were not preſent in the Congregation that awful Day and ſo, that they were more out of the way of Danger; But to have been preſent &amp; been witneſſes, as we were, not only of God's <hi>terrible Majeſty,</hi> with which he was then pleas'd to <hi>Aray</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but of his <hi>tender Care and goodneſs</hi> to his Unworthy people, It is a <hi>rich Experience,</hi> well worthy to be laid up in Everlaſting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, Eſpecially if God will pleaſe to bleſs it too for our ſpiritual good, as (it is to be hoped) he will.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>I ſhall put you upon Sympathizing with the more Immediate Sufferers &amp; Eſpecially with them, who have been ſo Awfully bereaved.</hi> We, who have Eſcaped better, ſhould bear a tender Regard to them who have fared worſe; We might have been in their places and they in ours, had it ſo pleaſed God; Now as they that <hi>know the heart of a Stranger,</hi> do better know and are more inclined to ſhow kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003861_0041_100206989539AF70"/>and do good offices unto Strangers than others be, So we, that were ſo near the Danger and did ſo narrowly Eſcape, It is to be preſumed, can better Sympathize with them that did more ſmart by it, And the rather, becauſe this is one good way to ſhew our thankfulneſs to God, for our deliverance; Their wounds and ſores and bruiſes &amp; lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhould, in a ſort, be felt by Each of us and we ſhould be ready to do all manner of good offices about them. And, I bleſs God, that there is no manner of reaſon of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of any backwardneſs on this ſcore.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall we ſay to, or do for our dear Friends, that have been Called to part with, a near and dear Relation, in ſo awful and ſolemn a manner?</p>
            <p>Perhaps, it would but aggravate grief, to obſerve that he was a very <hi>promiſing &amp; deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Youth,</hi> One that had Eſcaped more Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted in his Manners, in this dangerous time, One that by his Diſcreet Conduct had recommended himſelf to every ones Eſteem, and that none had any <hi>Evil thing to ſay of him;</hi> Juſt arrived to his Freedom; Juſt ſetting out in the world, which he might have done with good advantage; His Parents promiſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much from him and even ſaying with the parents of Noah, <hi>This ſame ſhall Comfort us concerning our work and the toil of our Hands.</hi>

Hither he was come that Day, to worſhip with us and it ſeems he muſt not be Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though propoſals were made of his going ſome other ways (for he choſe to worſhip with us, now that matter was left to his own choice and diſcretion) And here the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God met with him, on <hi>a good Day,</hi> in a <hi>good place</hi> and (we truſt) <hi>on a good Deſign;</hi> He falls in the Sanctuary (where ſome good people have wiſhed to Expire, if it were the will of God) and <hi>Dyes</hi> at the very <hi>horns of the Altar;</hi> He was obſerved to be more than ordinarily thoughtful and Concerned, as the Storm gathered and blackned and drove more fiercely upon us; And who can tell but that he <hi>dyed praying for himſelf and us?</hi> Who can ſay, but that <hi>our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, looking</hi> upon the <hi>Youth,</hi> might <hi>Love him,</hi> cloath him with the bright robes of his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſo receive him to his Mercy?</p>
            <p>Theſe are things that we muſt leave, They are not to be Determined by us; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would ſay to his bereaved Relations, <hi>Sorrow not,</hi> my Friends, <hi>as they that have no hope;</hi> We know your Tryal is great &amp; you will have need of abundance of Grace and patience to behave ſuitably under this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign diſpenſation of divine providence.

So, do you labour to Acquieſce in the diſpenſations of an holy God and ſay, <hi>The Will of the Lord be done.</hi> Eſpecially ſince you have much more to Quiet you under his hand.</p>
            <p>And the good Lord make up to you this Loſs in Spiritual and better bleſſings and give you <hi>a Name better than that of Sons and of Daughters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have ſeen the Sympathy of your Fellow-Servants, how forward they have been to mingle their Tears with yours, in our late (almoſt) univerſal attendance at his Funeral, We all look'd on with pity and join'd in Imploring mercies from the God of Heaven, And now, May we all be Edified by your Example of patience, Submiſſion and reſignation to the will of God, that we may learn the better how to behave, if Ever God ſhould call us out to any the like Trial;</p>
            <p>And the Lord prepare us, Every one, for our Diſſolution, at what time and in what manner ſoever it may come, that then we <hi>may be found of him in peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>I ſhall invite and preſs you, Every one, to make that wiſe and good Improvement of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which our heavenly Father now Expects:</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:003861_0044_10026609F970C1F8"/>The Eve, both of GOD and Men will be now more upon us, to obſerve what our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and behaviour will be after this; Some things are Evident, what is plainly our Duty at this Day and ſome things may Eaſily be Searched out and come at, if we will be at the pains to Examine;</p>
            <p>Shall we not think now Every one of us, What if it had been our Lot to have been ſtruck dead at once in that awful Day, when Death was ſo very Near us? What condition ſhould we have been in? Was our peace made with God? Had we gotten an Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt? Was there no guilt lying Unpardoned upon our Souls? If ſo, we ſhould then only have been haſtened a little ſooner into the preſence of our Redeemer, and aſcended, as in a <hi>Chariot of fire,</hi> into the region of the bleſſed; But if we had been <hi>yet in our Sins,</hi> Unregenerate, Unconverted, <hi>Alienated from the life of God, Servants to diverſe Luſts and pleaſures,</hi> it would have been a dreadful ſtroke indeed upon us, We ſhould have gone from one fire to a worſe and it had been <hi>good for us that we had never been born;</hi> Methinks every profane Sinner, when he remembers it, may <hi>Yet</hi> tremble at his very Narrow Eſcape, to think how near he was to his being paſt all hope and help and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Well, now we are all ſpared a little
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003861_0045_1002069FC06A6A30"/>Longer and have a little more time to think and to <hi>ſet, our Souls in Order,</hi> if we have but the heart to do it, And ſurely the loud Call, which we have had from heaven, ſhould be ſufficient to rowze us; Shall we ſtill put off and Delay? Shall we ever cry to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when God is ſaying, <hi>To Day? To Day if ye will hear his Voice, Harden not your hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Great Deſign of the Goſpel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of all religion is, to bring us to <hi>Love</hi> and to <hi>Fear God</hi> and to Subject our ſelves to him, To help us to Govern well our paſſions and affections, our appetites &amp; inclinations; To make us juſt and righteous, kind and Benevolent and uſeful to all that are about us, good Neighbours and good men, Thus it is repreſented, Tit. 2. 11, — 14. <hi>For the grace of God, that bringeth ſalvation hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all men, Teaching us, that denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and wordly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world, Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that bleſſed hope and glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us that he might redeem us from all Iniquity and purify to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſince we are fallen by our Iniquity and there is a Neceſſity of a <hi>Saviour, Surety</hi> and <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and us, upon
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:003861_0046_100206B20E019628"/>whoſe account we may be <hi>accepted in God's ſight, Repentance towards God</hi> and <hi>Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are much Inſiſted upon in the New Teſtament Act. 20.21, <hi>Teſtifying both to the Jews &amp; alſo to the Gentiles, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Heb. 6.-1—<hi>The foundation of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from dead works and of faith towards God.</hi> And often elſewhere. Theſe are the things that we muſt Enquire after and not reſt till we can find them in our ſelves; Wherefore now eſpecially ſince we have been under ſuch Awakening Diſpenſations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us Every one reform what hath been amiſs in our Conduct and teſtify againſt Sin in Others.</hi> We all know, better than other perſons, what <hi>Sins</hi> they be that do moſt <hi>Eaſily beſet us</hi> and moſt frequently prevail againſt us, We muſt be beſt acquainted with the <hi>Plague of our own hearts</hi> and whatever our faults and Irregularities be, whither we have Indulg'd our ſelves in any of the kinds of Evil Speaking, taking God's Sacred Name in Vain, or Injuring of men; Whither we are addicted to the Sins of Intemperance and Unchaſtity, to Injuſtice and Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to Uncharitableneſs and Cruelty, or what ever other Fault it be; Let us ſearch it out and put it away, For why ſhould
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:003861_0047_1002660EA0F2AD58"/>we Indulge our ſelves in any thing ſo Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and fatal, that is like to End in Death? Let us think, <hi>What fruit</hi> we have already had in theſe things, They have done us no ſervice and we have reaſon to <hi>be aſhamed of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having Reformed our ſelves, let us go forth to teſtify and appear againſt Sin, where ever it is to be met with; From this day, let us not be mealy-mouth'd; If others will tranſgreſs the Laws of God, let us be ſo free &amp; bold as to tell them of it; Let thoſe that are in Authority Exert their Power for the Suppreſſing of Vicious practiſes, as they that do not mean to <hi>bear the Sword in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pray</hi> alſo <hi>for me, that Utterance may be given me, that I may ſpeak the Word boldly and as I ought to ſpeak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let wildneſs &amp; Extravagance ceaſe from this Day forward and Oh! that this Stroke which hath been upon us, might thro' the bleſſing of God, produce a greater Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, Sanctity and regularity in our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us ſet our ſelves Carefully to practiſe, the great Duties of righteouſneſs and mercy, which would make us bleſſings in our places and uſeful to all that are about us.</hi> So <hi>Daniel</hi> Counſelled
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:003861_0048_100206A48F476850"/>
               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan. 4.27. <hi>Wherefore, O king, let my counſel be acceptable unto thee and break off thy ſins by righteouſneſs and thine iniquities by ſhewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thy tranquillity.</hi> Let us learn to be juſt to our ſelves, and not live in Idleneſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality or any ways of unneceſſary Expence. And then, let us be juſt to other people, giving to Every one their due, and <hi>doing to them, as we would have them to do unto us,</hi> Let there be no <hi>grinding of the faces of the Poor,</hi> No Impoſing upon the weak, ſimple and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, any more among us; Yea, let us learn to <hi>deviſe Liberal things</hi> and <hi>ſhew mercy with Chearfulneſs.</hi> There will be ever among us, ſome that are Poor, ſome that are Afflicted, ſome that are in Diſtreſs; From theſe we muſt not <hi>turn away our Eyes,</hi> or <hi>ſhut up our bowels of Compaſſion,</hi> but run and even fly to their aſſiſtance and relief; How much Religion lies in this the proceſs at the great day of Judgment may inform us, where our bleſſed Saviour tells us that all theſe things ſhall be Conſidered and brought to an account, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Apoſtle James informs us, Jam. 1.27. <hi>Pure religion and undefiled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and the Father is this, to viſit the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and widows in their affliction and to keep himſelf unſpotted from the world.</hi>

3. <hi>Let us live in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Inſtrumental Duties of religion which are Deſigned to bring us to the Love of God and our Neighbour and uſe them as means for this farther End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such as reading, hearing, meditating, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining our ſelves, and attending upon the Ordinances of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>We muſt make Conſcience of doing theſe things, becauſe God hath Commanded them and makes uſe of them as Means to bring us to an Intimate Acquaintance with Jeſus Chriſt, to fill our hearts with Love to God, to make us fit for Service and meet for the Inheritance among the Saints in Light here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; Wherefore let me Exhort you Every one to ſtudy and peruſe your Bibles and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate in the Law of God Day and Night, This is the Rule by which we muſt live and by which we muſt one day be Judged, We had need Endeavour therefore that we may be intimately Acquainted therewith;</p>
            <p>Get alone, frequently, by your ſelves, to think what Condition you are in and <hi>what you muſt do to be Saved,</hi> to call your ſelves to a ſtrict Account and accompliſh a moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Search. Then and there <hi>pray to your heavenly Father that ſeeth in ſecret and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſeeth in ſecret ſhall reward you openly.</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:003861_0050_10026611A973FFE0"/>And let me beſeech all ſuch as are Maſters of Families to ſet up and keep up practical Religion there, <hi>walking within your Houſes with perfect hearts, that God may come and Dwell with them.</hi> Oh! Why are not <hi>your Voices heard in the Morning</hi> and why in the <hi>Evening</hi> are you ſo very <hi>Silent;</hi> The Lord grant that we may ſee this Fruit of the Frown that hath been upon us, that there may not be found One Prayerleſs Family among us any more; If hitherto you have not Learned the way to the Throne of Grace, begin this very Night and now take it upon you to Open your mouths to the Lord; And the Lord grant you according to your wants and the deſires of your Hearts, Yea, when ever you come in your anguiſh and bitterneſs of your Hearts, then let the Lord pleaſe to <hi>hear in heaven his Dwelling place</hi> and <hi>grant you anſwers of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſhall I not prevail that the Sanctuary may be more frequented? Let no perſons place be Empty, when God gives you an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to be preſent, that you may not miſs of any good for your Souls; <hi>Love the Habitation of God's Houſe, the place where his honour dwelleth,</hi> But come ſtill <hi>in the multitude of God's mercies</hi> and <hi>worſhip in his Fear towards his holy temple:</hi> From <hi>this time</hi> forward <hi>keep your feet when you go to the Houſe of God and be

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Voice of the Lord</hi> which we have lately heard, was not meant ſo much to drive us from our place of publick Worſhip, as to make us Cautious, Serious &amp; Devout when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we Come thither, Now we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that <hi>God is a Spirit</hi> and <hi>they that Worſhip him</hi> ſhould do it <hi>in ſpirit and in Truth,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And why do <hi>More</hi> Live in the Neglect of the Lord's Supper? As if he had never ſaid to us, <hi>Do this in the remembrance of me,</hi> Or as

               <hi>To Conclude,</hi> We have heard that a Work of God hath been happily begun &amp; carried on, in ſome parts of the Country, People, in a general way, being greatly Concern'd for the Everlaſting welfare of their Souls; It may be the Lord means good unto Us alſo (When will he think upon us!) and begins with this <hi>Terrible Stroke,</hi> For there was need of ſomthing very Awakening to Rouze us out of that deep Security, into which many of us were fallen, But this alone will not do; It may ſtartle and make us tremble for a time, but we ſhall ſoon get over it and return again to folly, unleſs the Lord pleaſe to ſend down his Effectual grace, to pour out the Spirit of grace and Supplication to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it; The caſe may be ſomthing reſembled by that paſſage, we meet with, in, 1 King. 19. 11, 12, — <hi>And behold the Lord paſſed by and a great and ſtrong wind rent the mountains and brake in pieces the rocks before the
