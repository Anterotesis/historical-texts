            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <div type="testimonial">
                     <head>ADVERTISEMENT By Mrs. EUGENIA STANHOPE, Mother of the Gentlemen to whom theſe Letters were wrote.</head>
                     <p>THE death of the late Earl of Cheſterfield is ſo recent, his family, his Character, and his Talents ſo well known, that it would be unneceſſary to attempt any account of his Lordſhip's life. But, as theſe letters will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably deſcend to poſterity, it may not be improper to explain the general ſcope of them, and the reaſon that induced him to write on the ſubject of education.</p>
                     <p>It is well known that the late Earl of Cheſterfield had a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſon, whom he loved with the moſt unbounded affection, and whoſe Education was, for many years, the chief engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his life. After furniſhing him with the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable treaſures of ancient and modern learning, to thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions he was deſirous of adding that knowledge of men and things, which he himſelf had acquired by long and great experience. With this view were written the following let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; which, the reader will obſerve, begin with thoſe dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of inſtruction adapted to the capacity of a boy, and riſing gradually by precepts and monitions, calculated to direct and guard the age of incautious youth, finiſh with the advice and knowledge requiſite to form the man, ambitious to ſhine as an accompliſhed courtier, an orator in the ſenate, or a miniſter at foreign courts.</p>
                     <p>In order to effect theſe purpoſes, his Lordſhip, ever anxious to fix in his ſon, a ſcrupulous adherence to the ſtricteſt mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, appears to have thought it the firſt, and moſt indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable object—to lay, in the earlieſt period of life, a firm foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in good principles and ſound religion. His next point
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:013324_0021_0F90F0E204393128"/>
was, to give him a perfect knowledge of the dead languages, and all the different branches of ſolid learning, and by the ſtudy of the beſt ancient authors; and alſo ſuch a general idea of the ſciences as it is a diſgrace to a gentleman, not to poſſeſs. The article of inſtruction with which he concludes his ſyſtem of education, and which he more particularly enforces through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole work, is the ſtudy of that uſeful and extenſive ſcience, the knowledge of mankind: in the courſe of which, appears the niceſt inveſtigation of the human heart, and the ſprings of human actions. From hence we find him induced to lay ſo great a ſtreſs on what are generally called accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as moſt indiſpenſably requiſite to finiſh the amiable and brilliant part of a compleat character.</p>
                     <p>It would be unneceſſary to expatiate on the merits of ſuch a work, executed by ſo great a maſter. They cannot but be obvious to every perſon of ſenſe; the more, as nothing of this ſort has (I believe) ever been produced in the Engliſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. The candour of the public, to which theſe letters appeal, will determine the amuſement and inſtruction they afford. I flatter myſelf, they will be read with general ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; as the principal, and by far the greater part of them were written when the Earl of Cheſterfield was in the full vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his mind, and poſſeſſed all thoſe qualifications for which he was ſo juſtly admired in England, revered in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and eſteemed wherever known.</p>
                     <p>Celebrated all over Europe for his ſuperior talents as an epiſtolary writer, for the brilliancy of his wit, and the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of his extenſive knowledge, will it be thought too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous to aſſert, that he exerted all thoſe faculties to the utmoſt, upon this favourite ſubject—education? And that, in order to form the mind of a darling ſon, he even exhauſted thoſe powers which he was ſo univerſally allowed to poſſeſs?</p>
                     <p>I do not doubt but thoſe who were much connected with the author, during that ſeries of years in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e wrote the following letters, will be ready to vouch the truth of the above aſſertion. What I can, and do aſcertain is, the authenticity of this publication; which compriſes not a ſingle line, that is not the late Earl of Cheſterfield's.</p>
                     <p>Some, perhaps, may be of opinion, that the firſt letters in this collection, intended for the inſtruction of a child, then der ſeven years of age, were too trifling to merit publication. They are however inſerted by advice of ſeveral gentlemen of learning, and real judgment; who conſidered the whole as abſolutely neceſſary, to form a compleat ſyſtem of education.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:013324_0022_0F90EC7FEC914958"/>
And, indeed, the reader will find his Lordſhip repeatedly telling his ſon, that his affection for him makes him look upon no inſtruction, which may be of ſervice to him, as too trifling or too low; I, therefore, did not think myſelf autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed to ſuppreſs what, to ſo experienced a man, appeared re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the completion of his undertaking. And, upon this point, I may appeal more particularly to thoſe, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fathers themſelves, know how to value inſtructions, of which their tenderneſs and anxiety for their children, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly make them feel the neceſſity. The inſtructions' ſcattered throughout thoſe letters, are happily calculated,

                        </gap> parts of others, are loſt; which, conſidering the tender years of Mr. Stanhope, at that time, cannot be a matter of ſurprize, but will always be one of regret. Wherever a complete ſenſe could be made out, I have ventured to give the fragment.</p>
                     <p>To each of the French letters, throughout the work, an Engliſh tranſlation is annexed: in which I have endeavoured to adhere, as much as poſſible, to the ſenſe of the original: I wiſh the attempt may have proved ſucceſsful.</p>
                     <p>As to thoſe repetitions, which ſometimes occur, that many may eſteem inaccuracies, and think they had been better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched: they are ſo varied, and their ſignificancy thrown into ſuch, and ſo many different lights, that they could not be altered without mutilating the work. In the courſe of which the reader will alſo obſerve his Lordſhip often expreſsly declaring, that ſuch repetitions are purpoſely intended, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate his inſtructions more forcibly. So good a reaſon urged by the author for uſing them, made me think it indiſpenſably requiſite not to deviate from the original.</p>
                     <p>The letters written from the time that Mr. Stanhope was employed as one of his Majeſty's Miniſters abroad, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not relative to education, yet as they continue the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Lord Cheſterfield's letters to his ſon, and diſcover his ſentiments on various intereſting ſubjects, of public as well as private concern, it is preſumed they cannot fail of being acceptable to the public. To theſe are added ſome few de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached pieces, which the reader will find at the end of the fourth volume. The originals of thoſe, as well as of all the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013324_0023_0F90F0E2C2452188"/>
letters; are in my poſſeſſion, in the Earl of Cheſterfield's hand-writing, and ſealed with his own ſeal.</p>
                     <p>I beg leave to add, that if the following work proves of as much utility to the youth of theſe kingdoms, as the letters were to the perſon for whoſe immediate inſtruction they were written, my utmoſt wiſhes will be gratified; and I ſhall eſteem myſelf happy in reflecting, that, though a woman, I have had the moſt real of all ſatisfactions,—that of being of ſome uſe to my country.</p>

                     <p>EVERY page of this valuable work brings to recollection that admired nobleman, the writer, ſo univerſally eſteemed the finiſhed model of a complete gentleman, and able ſtateſman. We are reminded by his inſtructions that he was himſelf an elegant pattern of all he recommends, and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſtandard of taſte, wit, politeneſs, and every brilliant and ſolid quality which can adorn the man of ſenſe, of letters, and of faſhion. Such was the all-accompliſhed nobleman, who here unites the tenderneſs of an indulgent parent with the abilities of a wiſe teacher, to conduct in the paths of knowledge, virtue and honour, a favourite ſon, whoſe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare would ſeem to conſtitute his ſupreme happineſs. Whether he playfully inſtructs the child in the firſt rudiments of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or more gravely admoniſhes the man to purſue the higher duties of human wiſdom, we equally admire the hand of a maſter: wit, humour, argument, eloquence, entreaty, perſuaſion, are all employed to enforce his precepts.

                     <p>AT your age love of pleaſures is extremely natural, and the enjoyment of them not unbecoming; but the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at your age, is miſtaking the object, and ſetting out wrong in the purſuit. The character of a man of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure dazzles young eyes; they do not ſee their way to it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly, and fall into vice and profligacy. I remember a ſtrong inſtance of this a great many years ago. A young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low determined to ſhine as a man of pleaſure, was at the play called the LIBERTINE DESTROYED, a tranſlation of <hi>le Feſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>in de Pierre</hi> of Moliere's. He was ſo ſtruck with what he thought the fine character of the libertine, that he ſwore he would be the <hi>Libertine deſtroyed.</hi> Some friends aſked him, whether he had not better content himſelf with being only the libertine, but without being <hi>deſtroyed?</hi> To which he anſwered with great warmth, "No; for that being deſtroyed, was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the whole." This, extravagant as it ſeems in this light, is really the caſe of many an unfortunate young fellow, who, captivated by the name of pleaſures, ruſhes indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and without taſte, into them all, and is finally <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</hi> I am not ſtoically adviſing, nor parſonically preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, to be a ſtoic at your age: far from it: I am pointing out to you the paths to pleaſure, and am endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to quicken and heighten them for you. Enjoy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but let them be your own, and then you will taſte them; but adopt none: truſt to nature for genuine ones. The pleaſures that you would feel, you muſt earn; the man who gives himſelf up to all, feels none ſenſibly. Sardanapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, I am convinced, never felt any in his life. Thoſe only who join ſerious occupations with pleaſures, feel either as they ſhould do. Alcibiades, though addicted to the moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful exceſſes, gave ſome time to philoſophy, and ſome to buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Julius Caeſar joined buſineſs with pleaſure ſo properly, that they naturally aſſiſted each other and tho' he was the huſband of all the wives at Rome, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ound time to be one of the beſt ſcholars, almoſt the beſt orator, and abſolutely the beſt General there. An uninterrupted life of pleaſures is as inſipid as contemptible. Some hours given every day to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious buſineſs, muſt whet both the mind and the ſenſes, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy thoſe of pleaſure. A ſurfeited glutton, an emaciated ſot, and an enervated rotten whore-maſter, never enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to which they devote themſelves; but they are only ſo many human ſacrifices to falſe Gods. The pleaſures of low-life are all of this miſtaken ſpecies, merely ſenſual, and diſgraceful to nature; whereas thoſe of high-life, and in good company,
<pb facs="unknown:013324_0025_0F904D7CE791F588"/>
(though poſſibly in themſelves not more moral) are more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, more refined, leſs dangerous, and leſs diſgraceful; and, in the common courſe of things, not reckoned diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at all. In ſhort, pleaſure muſt not, nay cannot, be the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of a man of ſenſe and character; but it may be, and is, his relief, his reward. It is particularly ſo with regard to women, who have the utmoſt contempt for thoſe men, that, having no character, nor conſideration with their own ſex, fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volouſly paſs their whole time in <hi>ruelles</hi> and at <hi>toiletts.</hi> They look upon them as their lumber, and remove them whenever they can get better furniture. Women chuſe their favourites more by the ear, than any other of their ſenſes, or even their underſtandings. The man whom they hear the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the men, will always be the beſt received by them.

                        <head>CHAP. I. The Paſſage from Plymouth to Madeira, with ſome account of that Iſland.</head>
                        <p>HAVING received my commiſſion, which was dated the 25th of May 1768, I went on board on the 27th, hoiſted the pennant, and took charge of the ſhip, which then lay in the baſon in Deptford Yard. She was fitted for ſea with all expedition; and ſtores and proviſions being taken on board, ſailed down the river on the 30th of July, and on the 13th of Auguſt anchored in Plymouth Sound.</p>
                        <p>While we lay here waiting for a wind, the articles of war and the act of parliament were read to the ſhip's company, who were paid two months wages in advance, and told that they were to expect no additional pay for the performance of the voyage.</p>
                        <p>On Friday the 26th of Auguſt, the wind becoming fair, we got under ſail, and put to ſea. On the 31ſt, we ſaw ſeveral of the birds which the ſailors call Mother Carey's Chickens, and which they ſuppoſe to be the forerunners of a ſtorm; and on the next day we had a very hard gale, which brought us under our courſes, waſhed over-board a ſmall boat belonging to the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain, and drowned three or four dozen of our poultry, which we regretted ſtill more.</p>
                        <p>On Friday the 2d of September we ſaw land, between Cape Finiſter and Cape Ortegal, on the coaſt of Gallicia, in Spain; and on the 5th, by an obſervation of the ſun and moon, we found the latitude of Cape Finiſter to be 42. 53. North, and its longitude 8. 46. Weſt, our firſt meridian being always ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to paſs through Greenwich; variation of the needle 21. 4. Weſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="2" facs="unknown:013324_0029_0F90F0E5B9A0EA18"/>
During this courſe, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of obſerving many marine animals, of which no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt has hitherto taken notice; particularly, a new ſpecies of the <hi>Oniſcus,</hi> which was found adhering to the <hi>Meduſa Pelagica;</hi> and an animal of an angular figure, about three inches long and one thick, with a hollow paſſing quite through it, and a brown ſpot on one end, which they conjectured might be its ſtomach; four of theſe adhered together by their ſides when they were taken, ſo that at firſt they were thought to be one animal, but upon being put into a glaſs of water they ſoon ſeparated, and ſwam about very briſkly. Theſe animals are of a new genus, to which Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander gave the name of <hi>Dagyſa,</hi> from the likeneſs of one ſpecies of them to a gem: ſeveral ſpecimens of them were taken adhering together ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the length of a yard or more, and ſhining in the water with very beautiful colours. Another animal of a new genus they alſo diſcovered, which ſhone in the water with colours ſtill more beautiful and vivid, and which indeed exceeded in variety and brightneſs any thing that we had ever ſeen: the colouring and ſplendour of theſe animals were equal to thoſe of an Opal, and from their reſemblance to that gem, the genus was called <hi>Carcinium Opalinum.</hi> One of them lived ſeveral hours in a glaſs of ſalt water, ſwimming about with great agility, and at every motion diſplaying a change of colours almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely various. We caught alſo among the rigging of the ſhip, when we were at the diſtance of about ten leagues from Cape Finiſter, ſeveral birds which have not been deſcribed by Linnaeus; they were ſuppoſed to have come from Spain, and our gentlemen called the ſpecies <hi>Motacilla velificans,</hi> as they ſaid none but ſailors would venture themſelves on board a ſhip that was going round the world: one of them was ſo exhauſted that it died in Mr. Banks's hand, almoſt as ſoon as it was brought to him.</p>
                        <p>It was thought extraordinary that no naturaliſt had hitherto taken notice of the <hi>Dagyſa,</hi> as the ſea abounds with them not twenty leagues from the coaſt of Spain; but, unfortunately for, the cauſe of ſcience, there are but very few of thoſe who traverſe the ſea, that are either diſpoſed or qualified to remark the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities of which Nature has made it the repoſitory.</p>
                        <p>On the 12th we diſcovered the iſlands of Porto Santo and Madeira, and on the next day anchored in Funchiale road, and moored with the ſtream-anchor: but, in the night, the bend of the hawſer of the ſtream-anchor ſlipped, owing to the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the perſon who had been employed to make it faſt. In the morning the anchor was heaved up into the boat, and carried out to the ſouthward; but in heaving it again, Mr. Weir, the maſter's mate, was carried overboard by the buoy-rope, and went to the bottom with the anchor: the people in the ſhip ſaw
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:013324_0030_0F90F0E674BBCD38"/>
the accident, and got the anchor up with all poſſible expedition; it was however too late, the body came up intangled in the buoy-rope, but it was dead. When the iſland of Madeira is firſt approached from the ſea, it has a very beautiful appearance; the ſides of the hills being intirely covered with vines almoſt as high as the eye can diſtinguiſh, and the vines are green when every kind of herbage, except where they ſhade the ground, and here and there by the ſides of a rill, is intirely burnt up, which was the caſe at this time.</p>
                        <p>On the 13th, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, a boat, which our ſailors call the product boat, came on board from the officers of health, without whoſe permiſſion no perſon is ſuffered to land from on board a ſhip. As ſoon as this permiſſion was obtained, we went on ſhore at Funchiale, the capital of the iſland, and proceeded directly to the houſe of Mr. Cheap, who is the Engliſh conſul there, and one of the moſt conſiderable merchants of the place. This gentleman received us with the kindneſs of a brother, and the liberality of a prince; he inſiſted upon our taking poſſeſſion of his houſe, in which he furniſhed us with every poſſible accommodation during our ſtay upon the iſland; he procured leave for Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander to ſearch the iſland for ſuch natural curioſities as they ſhould think worth their notice; employed perſons to take fiſh and gather ſhells, which time would not have permitted them to collect for themſelves; and he provided horſes and guides to take them to any part of the country which they ſhould chuſe to viſit. With all theſe advantages, however, their excurſions were ſeldom puſhed farther than three miles from the town, as they were only five days on ſhore; one of which they ſpent at home, in receiving the honour of a viſit from the governor. The ſeaſon was the worſt in the year for their purpoſe, as it was neither that of plants nor inſects; a few of the plants, however, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in flower, by the kind attention of Dr. Heberden, the chief phyſician of the iſland, and brother to Dr. Heberden of London, who alſo gave them ſuch ſpecimens as he had in his poſſeſſion, and a copy of his Botanical Obſervations; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, among other things, a particular deſcription of the trees of the iſland. Mr. Banks enquired after the wood which has been imported into England for cabinet work, and is here called Madeira mahogany: he learnt that no wood was exported from the iſland under that name, but he found a tree called by the natives Vigniatico, the <hi>Laurus indicus</hi> of Linnaeus, the wood of which cannot eaſily be diſtinguiſhed from mahogany. Dr. Heberden has a book-caſe in which the vigniatico and mahogany are mixed, and they are no otherwiſe to be known from each other than by the colour, which, upon a nice examination, appears to be ſomewhat leſs brown in the vigniatico than the mahogany; it is therefore in the higheſt degree probable, that
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013324_0031_0F90F0E740324B00"/>
the wood known in England by the name of Madeira mahogany, is the vigniatico.</p>
                        <p>There is great reaſon to ſuppoſe that this whole iſland was, at ſome remote period, thrown up by the exploſion of ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous fire, as every ſtone, whether whole or in fragments, that we ſaw upon it appeared to have been burnt, and even the ſand itſelf to be nothing more than aſhes: we did not, indeed, ſee much of the country, but the people informed us that what we did ſee was a very exact ſpecimen of the reſt.</p>
                        <p>The only article of trade in this iſland is wine, and the manner in which it is made is ſo ſimple, that it might have been uſed by Noah, who is ſaid to have planted the firſt vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard after the flood: the grapes are put into a ſquare wooden veſſel, the dimenſions of which are proportioned to the ſize of the vineyard to which it belongs; the ſervants then, having taken off their ſtockings and jackets, get into it, and with their feet and elbows, preſs out as much of the juice as they can: the ſtalks are afterwards collected, and being tied together with a rope, are put under a ſquare piece of wood, which is preſſed down upon them by a lever with a ſtone tied to the end of it. The inhabitants have made ſo little improvement in knowledge or art, that they have but very lately brought all the fruit of a vineyard to be of one fort, by engrafting their vines: there ſeems to be in mind as there is in matter, a kind of <hi>vis inertiae,</hi> which reſiſts the firſt impulſe to change. He who propoſes to aſſiſt the artificer or the huſbandman by a new application of the principles of philoſophy, or the powers of mechaniſm, will find, that his having hitherto done without them, will be a ſtronger motive for continuing to do without them ſtill, than any advantage, however manifeſt and conſiderable, for adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the improvement. Wherever there is ignorance there is prejudice; and the common people of all nations are, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to improvements, like the pariſh poor of England with reſpect to a maintenance, for whom the law muſt not only make a proviſion, but compel them to accept it, or elſe they will be ſtill found begging in the ſtreets. It was therefore with great difficulty that the people of Madeira were perſuaded to engraft their vines, and ſome of them ſtill obſtinately refuſe to adopt the practice, though a whole vintage is very often ſpoiled by the number of bad grapes which are mixed in the vat, and which they will not throw out, becauſe they increaſe the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the wine: an inſtance of the force of habit, which is the more extraordinary, as they have adopted the practice of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafting with reſpect to their cheſnut-trees, an object of much leſs importance, which, however, are thus brought to bear ſooner than they would otherwiſe have done.</p>
                        <p>We ſaw no wheel-carriages of any ſort in the place, which perhaps is not more owing to the want of ingenuity to invent
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013324_0032_0F90F0E7F6CFEFC8"/>
them, than to the want of induſtry to mend the roads, which at preſent, it is impoſſible that any wheel-carriages ſhould paſs: the inhabitants have horſes and mules indeed, excellently adapted to ſuch ways; but their wine is, notwithſtanding, brought to town from the vineyards where it is made, in veſſels of goat-ſkins, which are carried by men upon their heads. The only imitation of a carriage among theſe people is a board, made ſomewhat hollow in the middle, to one end of which a pole is tied, by a ſtrap of whitleather: this wretched ſledge approaches about as near to an Engliſh cart, as an Indian canoe to a ſhip's long-boat; and even this would probably never have been thought of, if the Engliſh had not introduced wine veſſels which are too big to be carried by hand, and which, therefore, are dragged about the town upon theſe machines.</p>
                        <p>One reaſon, perhaps, why art and induſtry have done ſo little for Madeira is, Nature's having done ſo much. The ſoil is very rich, and there is ſuch a difference of climate between the plains and the hills, that there is ſcarcely a ſingle object of luxury that grows either in Europe or the Indies, that might not be produced here. When we went to viſit Dr. Heberden, who lives upon a conſiderable aſcent, about two miles from town, we left the thermometer at 74, and when we arrived at his houſe, we found it at 66. The hills produce, almoſt ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly, walnuts, cheſnuts, and apples in great abundance; and in the town there are many plants which are the natives both of the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, particularly the banana, the guava, the pine-apple or anana, and the mango, which flouriſh almoſt without culture. The corn of this country is of a moſt excellent quality, large grained and very fine, and the iſland would produce it in great plenty; yet moſt of what is conſumed by the inhabitants is imported. The mutton, pork, and beef are alſo very good; the beef in particular, which we took on board here, was univerſally allowed to be ſcarcely inferior to our own; the lean part was very like it, both in colour and grain, though the beaſts are much ſmaller, but the ſat is as white as the fat of mutton.</p>
                        <p>The town of Funchiale derives its name from <hi>Funcho,</hi> the Portugueſe name for fennel, which grows in great plenty upon the neighbouring rocks, and, by the obſervation of Dr. Heber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, lies in latitude of 32. 33, 33.

It is ſituated in the bottom of a bay, and though larger than the extent of the iſland ſeems to deſerve, is very ill built; the houſes of the principal inhabitants are large, thoſe of the common people are ſmall, the ſtreets are narrow, and worſe paved than any I ever ſaw. The churches are loaded with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, among which are many pictures, and images of favourite ſaints, but the pictures are in general wretchedly painted, and the ſaints are dreſſed in laced clothes. Some of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013324_0033_0F90F0E8BAB3E0B8"/>
the convents are in a better taſte, eſpecially that of the Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, which is plain, ſimple, and neat in the higheſt degree. The infirmary in particular drew our attention as a model which might be adopted in other countries with great advantage. It conſiſts of a long room, on one ſide of which are the windows, and an altar for the convenience of adminiſtering the ſacrament to the ſick: the other ſide is divided into wards, each of which is juſt big enough to contain a bed, and neatly lined with gally-tiles; behind theſe wards, and parallel to the room in which they ſtand, there runs a long gallery, with which each ward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates by a door, ſo that the ſick may be ſeparately ſupplied with whatever they want without diſturbing their neighbours. In this convent there is alſo a ſingular curioſity of another kind; a ſmall chapel, the whole lining of which, both ſides and ceil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is compoſed of human ſculls and thigh bones; the thigh bones are laid acroſs each other, and a ſcull is placed in each of the four angles. Among the ſculls one is very remarkable; the upper and the lower jaw, on one ſide, perfectly and firmly cohere; how the oſſification which unites them was formed, it is not perhaps very eaſy to conceive, but it is certain that the patient muſt have lived ſome time without opening his mouth: what nouriſhment he received was conveyed through a hole which we diſcovered to have been made on the other ſide, by forcing out ſome of the teeth, in doing which the jaw alſo ſeems to have been injured. We viſited the good Fathers of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent on a Thurſday evening, juſt before ſupper-time, and they received us with great politeneſs; <q>We will not aſk you, ſaid they, to ſup with us, becauſe we are not prepared, but if you will come to-morrow, though it is a faſt with us, we will have a turkey roaſted for you.</q> This invitation, which ſhewed a liberality of ſentiment not to have been expected in a convent of Portugueſe Friars at this place, gratified us much, though it was not in our power to accept it. We viſited alſo a convent of nuns, dedicated to <hi>Santa Clara,</hi> and the Ladies did as the honour to expreſs a particular pleaſure in ſeeing us there: they had heard that there were great philoſophers among us, and not at all knowing what were the objects of philoſophical knowledge, they aſked us ſeveral queſtions that were abſurd and extravagant in the higheſt degree; one was, when it would thunder; and another, whether a ſpring of freſh water was to be found any where within the walls of their convent, of which it ſeems they were in great want. It will naturally be ſuppoſed that our anſwers to ſuch queſtions were neither ſatisfactory to the Ladies, nor, in their eſtimation, honourable to us; yet their diſappointment did not in the leaſt leſſen their civility, and they talked, without ceaſing, during the whole of our viſit, which laſted about half an hour.</p>
                        <p>The hills of this country are very high; the higheſt, Pico
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013324_0034_0F8FFA32721A9190"/>
Ruivo, riſes 5,068 feet, near an Engliſh mile, perpendicularly from its baſe, which is much higher than any land that has been meaſured in Great Britain. The ſides of theſe hills are covered with vines to a certain height, above which there are woods of cheſnut and pine of immenſe extent, and above them foreſts of wild timber of various kinds not known in Europe; particularly two, called by the Portugueſe <hi>Mirmulano</hi> and <hi>Pao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branco,</hi> the leaves of both which, particularly the <hi>Paobranco,</hi> are ſo beautiful, that theſe trees would be a great ornament to the gardens of Europe.</p>
                        <p>The number of inhabitants in this iſland is ſuppoſed to be about 80,000, and the cuſtom-houſe duties produce a revenue to the king of Portugal of 20,000 pounds a year, clear of all expences, which might eaſily be doubled by the product of the iſland, excluſive of the vines, if advantage was taken of the excellence of the climate, and the amazing fertility of the ſoil; but this object is utterly neglected by the Portugueſe. In the trade of the inhabitants of Madeira with Liſbon the balance is againſt them, ſo that all the Portugueſe money naturally going thither, the currency of the iſland is Spaniſh; there are indeed a few Portugueſe pieces of copper, but they are ſo ſcarce that we did not ſee one of them: the Spaniſh coin is of three deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; Piſtereens, worth about a ſhilling; Bitts, worth about ſix pence; and Half-bitts, three pence.</p>
                        <p>The tides at this place flow at the full and change of the moon, north and ſouth; the ſpring tides riſe ſeven feet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular, and the neap tides four. By Dr. Heberden's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, the variation of the compaſs here is now 15. 30. Weſt, and decreaſing; but I have ſome doubt whether he is not miſtaken with reſpect to its decreaſe: we found that the North point of the dipping needle belonging to the Royal Society dipped 77. 18.</p>
                        <p>The refreſhments to be had here, are water, wine, fruit of ſeveral ſorts, onions in plenty, and ſome ſweetmeats; freſh meat and poultry are not to be had without leave from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and the payment of a very high price. We took in 270 lb. of freſh beef, and a live bullock, charged at 613 lb. 3,032 gallons of water, and ten tuns of wine; and in the night, between Sunday the 18th and Monday the 19th of September, we ſet ſail in proſecution of our voyage.</p>
                        <p>When Funchiale bore North, 13 Eaſt, at the diſtance of 76 miles, the variation appeared by ſeveral azimuths to be 16: 30 Weſt.</p>

                        <p>ON the 21ſt of September we ſaw the iſlands called the Salvages, to the north of the Canaries; when the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal

of theſe bore S. ½ W. at the diſtance of about 5 leagues we found the variation of the compaſs by azimuth to be 17:50. I make theſe iſlands to lie in latitude 30:11. North, and diſtant 58 leagues from Funchiale in Madeira, in the direction of S. 16 Eaſt.</p>
                        <p>On Friday the 23d we ſaw the Peak of Teneriffe bearing W. by S. ½ S. and found the variation of the compaſs to be from 17:22, to 16:30. The height of this mountain, from which I took a new departure, has been determined by Dr. Heberden, who has been upon it, to be 15, 396 feet, which is but 148 yards leſs than three miles, reckoning the mile at 1760 yards. Its appearance at ſunſet was very ſtriking; when the ſun was below the horizon, and the reſt of the iſland appeared of a deep black, the mountain ſtill reflected his rays, and glowed with a warmth of colour which no painting can expreſs. There is no eruption of viſible fire from it, but a heat iſſues from the chinks near the top, too ſtrong to be borne by the hand when it is held near them. We had received from Dr. Heberden, among other favours, ſome ſalt which he collected on the top of the mountain, where it is found in large quantities, and which he ſuppoſes to be the true <hi>natrum</hi> or <hi>nitrum</hi> of the ancients: he gave us alſo ſome native ſulphur exceedingly pure, which he had likewiſe found upon the ſurface in great plenty. On the next day, Saturday the 24th, we came into the north-eaſt trade wind, and on Friday the 30th ſaw Bona Viſta, one of the Cape de Verd Iſlands; we ranged the eaſt ſide of it, at the diſtance of three or four miles from the ſhore, till we were obliged to haul off to avoid a ledge of rocks which ſtretch out S. W. by W. from the body, or S. E. point of the iſland, to the extent of a league and a half. Bona Viſta by our obſervation lies in lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 16 N. and longitude 21:51 Weſt.</p>
                        <p>On the firſt of October, in latitude 14:6 N. and longitude 22:10 W. we found the variation by a very good azimuth to be 10:37 W. and the next morning it appeared to be 10,. This day we found the ſhip five miles a-head of the log, and the next day ſeven. On the third, hoiſted out the boat to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover whether there was a current, and found one to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, at the rate of three quarters of a mile an hour.</p>
                        <p>During our courſe from Teneriffe to Bona Viſta we ſaw great numbers of flying fiſh, which from the cabbin windows appear beautiful beyond imagination, their ſides having the colour and brightneſs of burniſhed ſilver; when they are ſeen from the deck they do not appear to ſo much advantage, becauſe their backs are of a dark colour. We alſo took a Shark, which proved to be the <hi>Squalus Charcharias</hi> of Linnaeus.</p>
                        <p>Having loſt the trade wind on the third, in latitude 12:14, and longitude 22:10., the wind became ſomewhat variable, and we had light airs and calms by turns.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="9" facs="unknown:013324_0036_0F90F0EAE3A83838"/>
On the ſeventh, Mr. Banks went out in the boat and took what the ſeaman call a Portugueſe man of war; it is the <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuria Phyſalis</hi> of Linnaeus, and a ſpecies of the <hi>Molluſca.</hi> It conſiſted of a ſmall bladder about ſeven inches long, very much reſembling the air-bladder of fiſhes, from the bottom of which deſcended a number of ſtrings, of a bright blue and red; ſome of them three or four feet in length, which upon being touched ſting like a nettle, but with much more force. On the top of the bladder is a membrane which is uſed as a ſail, and turned ſo as to receive the wind which way ſoever it blows: this mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane is marked in fine pink coloured veins, and the animal is in every reſpect an object exquiſitely curious and beautiful.</p>
                        <p>We alſo took ſeveral of the ſhell-fiſhes, or teſtaceous animals, which are always found floating upon the water, particularly the <hi>Helix Janthina</hi> and <hi>Violacea;</hi> they are about the ſize of a ſnail, and are ſupported upon the ſurface of the water by a ſmall cluſter of bubbles, which are filled with air and conſiſt of a tenaceous ſlimly ſubſtance that will not eaſily part with its contents; the animal is oviparous, and theſe bubbles ſerve alſo as a <hi>nidus</hi> for its eggs. It is probable that it never goes down to the bottom, nor willingly approaches any ſhore; for the ſhell is exceedingly brittle, and that of few freſh water ſnails is ſo thin: every ſhell contains about a tea-ſpoonful of liquor, which it eaſily diſcharges upon being touched, and which is of the moſt beautiful red purple that can be conceived. It dies linen cloth, and it may perhaps be worth enquiry, as the ſhell is certainly found in the Mediterranean, whether it be not the <hi>Purpura</hi> of the ancients.</p>
                        <p>On the 8th, in latitude 8:25. North, longitude 22:4. W., we found a current ſetting to the ſouthward, which the next day in latitude 7:58. longitude 22:13, ſhifted to the N. N. W. ¾ W. at the rate of one mile and a furlong an hour. The variation here, by the mean of ſeveral azimuths, appeared to be 8:39. Weſt.</p>
                        <p>On the tenth, Mr. Banks ſhot the black-toed gull, not yet deſcribed according to Linnaeus's ſyſtem; he gave it the name of <hi>Larus erepidatus:</hi> it is remarkable that the dung of this bird is of a lively red, ſomewhat like that of the liquor procured from the ſhells, only not ſo full; its principal food therefore is probably the <hi>Helix</hi> juſt mentioned. A current to the N. W. prevailed more or leſs till Monday the 24th, when we were in latitude 1:7. N. and longitude 28:50.</p>
                        <p>On the 25th, we croſſed the line with the uſual ceremonies in longitude 29:30., when by the reſult of ſeveral very good azimuths, the variation was 2:24.</p>
                        <p>On the 28th, at noon, being in the latitude of Ferdinand <hi>Noronha,</hi> and, by the mean of ſeveral obſervations by Mr. Green and myſelf, in longitude 32:5. 16. W., which is to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013324_0037_0F90F0EB08B9C7A8"/>
of it by ſome charts, and to the eaſtward by others, we expected to ſee the iſland, or ſome of the ſhoals that are laid down in the charts between it and the main, but we ſaw neither one nor the other.</p>
                        <p>In the evening of the 29th, we obſerved that luminous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the ſea which has been ſo often mentioned by navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators, and of which ſuch various cauſes have been aſſigned; ſome ſuppoſing it to be occaſioned by fiſh, which agitated the water by darting at their prey, ſome by the putrefaction of fiſh and other marine animals, ſome by electricity, and others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it into a great variety of different cauſes. It appeared to emit flaſhes of light exactly reſembling thoſe of lightning, only not ſo conſiderable, but they were ſo frequent that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eight or ten were viſible almoſt at the ſame moment. We were of opinion that they proceeded from ſome luminous animal, and upon throwing out the caſting net our opinion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: it brought up a ſpecies of the <hi>Meduſa,</hi> which when it came on board had the appearance of metal violently heated, and emitted a white light: with theſe animals were taken ſome very ſmall crabs, of three different ſpecies, each of which gave as much light as a glow-worm, though the creature was not ſo large by nine tenths: upon examination of theſe animals Mr. Banks had the ſatisfaction to find that they were all entirely new.</p>
                        <p>On Wedneſday the 2d of November, about noon, being in the latitude of 10:38. S. and longitude 32:13. 43 W., we paſſed the line in which the needle at this time would have pointed due north and ſouth, without any variation: for in the morning, having decreaſed gradually in its deviation for ſome days, it was no more than 18 W. and in the afternoon it was 34 Eaſt.</p>
                        <p>On the 6th, being in latitude 19:3 South, longitude 35:50 Weſt, the colour of the water was obſerved to change, upon which we founded, and found ground at the depth of 32 fathoms; the lead was caſt three times within about four hours, without a foot difference in the depth or quality of the bottom, which was coral rock, fine ſand, and ſhells; we therefore ſuppoſed that we had paſſed over the tail of the great ſhoal which is laid down in all our charts by the name of <hi>Abrothos,</hi> on which Lord Anſon ſtruck ſoundings in his paſſage outwards: at four the next morning we had no ground with 100 fathom.</p>
                        <p>As ſeveral articles of our ſtock and proviſions now began to fall ſhort, I determined to put into Rio de Janeiro, rather than at any port in Brazil or Falkland's Iſlands, knowing that it could better ſupply us with what we wanted, and making no doubt but that we ſhould be well received.</p>
                        <p>On the 8th, at day-break, we ſaw the coaſt of Brazil, and about ten o'clock we brought to, and ſpoke with a fiſhing-boat; the people on board told us that the land which we ſaw, lay to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013324_0038_0F90F0EBB22D7198"/>
the ſouthward of <hi>Sancto Eſpirito,</hi> but belonged to the captain-ſhip of that place.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went on board this veſſel, in which they found eleven men, nine of whom were Blacks; they all fiſhed with lines, and their freſh cargo, the chief part of which Mr. Banks bought, conſiſted of dolphins, large pelagic ſcombers of two kinds, ſea bream, and ſome of the fiſh which in the Weſt Indies are called Welſhmen. Mr. Banks had taken Spaniſh ſilver with him, which he imagined to be the currency of the continent, but to his great ſurprize the people aſked him for Engliſh ſhillings; he gave them two which he happened to have about him, and it was not without ſome diſpute that they took the reſt of the money in piſtereens. Their buſineſs ſeemed to be to catch large fiſh at a good diſtance from the ſhore, which they ſalted in bulk, in a place made for that purpoſe in the middle of their boat: of this merchandize they had about two quintals on board, which they offered for about 16 ſhillings, and would probably have ſold for half the money. The freſh fiſh, which was bought for about nineteen ſhillings and ſix pence, ſerved the whole ſhip's company; the ſalt was not wanted. The ſea proviſion of theſe fiſhermen conſiſted of nothing more than a caſk of water, and a bag of Caſſada flour, which they called <hi>Farinha de Pao,</hi> or wooden flour, which indeed is a name which very well ſuits its taſte and appearance. Their water caſk was large, as wide as their boat, and exactly fitted a place that was made for it in the ballaſt; it was impoſſible therefore to draw out any of its contents by a tap, the ſides being, from the bottom to the top, wholly inacceſſible; neither could any be taken out by dipping a veſſel in at the head, for an opening ſufficiently wide for that purpoſe would have endang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the loſs of great part of it by the rolling of the veſſel: their expedient to get at their water, ſo ſituated, was curious; when one of them wanted to drink, he applied to his neighbour, who accompanied him to the water caſk with a hollow cane about three feet long, which was open at both ends; this he thruſt into the caſk through a ſmall hole in the top, and then ſtopp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the upper end with the palm of his hand, drew it out; the preſſure of the air againſt the other end keeping in the water which it contained; to this end the perſon who wanted to drink applied his mouth, and the aſſiſtant then taking his hand from the other, and admitting the air above, the cane immediately parted with its contents, which the drinker drew off till he was ſatisfied.</p>
                        <p>We ſtood off and on along the ſhore till the 12th, and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively ſaw a remarkable hill near Santo Eſpirito, then Cape St. Thomas, and then an iſland juſt without Cape Trio, which in ſome maps is called the iſland of Trio, and which being high, with a hollow in the middle, has the appearance of two iſlands
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013324_0039_0F90F0F1D3D83728"/>
when ſeen at a diſtance. On this day we ſtood along the ſhore for Rio de Janeiro, and at nine the next morning made ſail for the harbour. I then ſent Mr. Hicks, my firſt Lieutenant, before us in the pinnace, up to the city, to acquaint the Governor, that we put in there to procure water and refreſhments; and to deſire the aſſiſtance of a pilot to bring us into proper anchoring ground. I continued to ſtand up the river, truſting to Mr. Belliſle's draught, publiſhed in the <hi>Petit Atlas maritime,</hi> Vol. II. No. 54, which we found very good, till five o'clock in the evening, expecting the return of my Lieutenant; and juſt as I was about to anchor, above the iſland of Cobras, which lies before the city, the pinnace came back without him, having on board a Portugueſe officer, but no pilot. The people in the boat told me, that my Lieutenant was detained by the Viceroy till I ſhould go on ſhore. We came immediately to an anchor; and, almoſt at the ſame time, a ten oared boat, full of ſoldiers, came up and kept rowing round the ſhip, without exchanging a word: in leſs than a quarter of an hour, another boat came on board with ſeveral of the Viceroy's officers, who aſked, Whence we came; what was our cargo; the number of men and guns on board; the object of our voyage, and ſeveral other queſtions, which we directly and truly anſwered: they then told me, as a kind of apology for detaining my Lieutenant, and putting an officer on board my pinnace, that it was the invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cuſtom of the place, to detain the firſt officer who came on ſhore from any ſhip on her arrival, till a boat from the Viceroy had viſited her, and to ſuffer no boat to go either from or to a ſhip, while ſhe lay there, without having a ſoldier on board. They ſaid that I might go on ſhore when I pleaſed; but wiſhed that every other perſon might remain on board till the paper which they ſhould draw up had been delivered to the Viceroy, promiſing that, immediately upon their return the Lieutenant ſhould be ſent on board.</p>
                        <p>This promiſe was performed; and, on the next morning, the 14th, I went on ſhore, and obtained leave of the Viceroy to purchaſe proviſions and refreſhments for the ſhip, provided I would employ one of their own people as a factor, but not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. I made ſome objections to this, but he inſiſted upon it as the cuſtom of the place. I objected alſo againſt the putting a ſoldier into the boat every time ſhe went between the ſhip and the ſhore; but he told me, that this was done by the expreſs orders of his court, with which he could in no caſe diſpenſe. I then requeſted, that the Gentlemen whom I had on board might reſide on ſhore during our ſtay, and that Mr. Banks might go up the country to gather plants; but this he abſolutely refuſed. I judged from his extreme caution, and the ſeverity of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions, that he ſuſpected we were come to trade; I therefore took ſome pains to convince him to the contrary. I told him,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013324_0040_0F90F0F2B8F07638"/>
that we were bound to the ſouthward, by the order of his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannic Majeſty, to obſerve a tranſit of the planet Venus over the Sun, an aſtronomical phaenomenon of great importance to navigation. Of the tranſit of Venus, however, he could form no other conceptio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, than that it was the paſſing of the North Star through the South Pole; for theſe are the very words of his interpreter, who was a Swede, and ſpoke Engliſh very well. I did not think it neceſſary to aſk permiſſion of the Gentlemen to come on ſhore during the day, or that, when I was on ſhore myſelf, I might be at liberty, taking for granted that nothing was intended to the contrary; but in this I was unfortunately miſtaken. As ſoon as I took leave of his Excellency, I found an officer who had orders to attend me wherever I went: of this I deſired an explanation, and was told that it was meant as a compliment; I earneſtly deſired to be excuſed from accepting ſuch an honour, but the good Viceroy would by no means ſuffer it to be diſpenſed with.</p>
                        <p>With this officer, therefore, I returned on board, about twelve o'clock, where I was impatiently expected by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who made no doubt but that a fair account of us having been given by the officers who had been on board the evening before, in their paper called a <hi>Practica,</hi> and every ſcruple of the Viceroy removed in my conference with his Excellency, they ſhould immediately be at liberty to go on ſhore, and diſpoſe of themſelves as they pleaſed. Their diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment at receiving my report may eaſily be conceived; and it was ſtill increaſed by an account, that it had been reſolved, not only to prevent their reſiding on ſhore, and going up the country, but even their leaving the ſhip; orders having been given, that no perſon except the Captain, and ſuch common ſailors as were required to be upon duty, ſhould be permitted to land; and that there was probably a particular view to the paſſengers in this prohibition, as they were reported to be Gentlemen ſent abroad to make obſervations and diſcoveries, and were uncommonly qualified for that purpoſe. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander dreſſed themſelves, and attempted to go on ſhore, in order to make a viſit to the Viceroy; but they were ſtopped by the guard-boat which had come off with our pinnace, and which kept hovering round the ſhip all the while ſhe lay here, for that purpoſe; the officer on board ſaying, that he had particular orders, which he could not diſobey, to ſuffer no paſſenger, or any officer, except the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to paſs the boat. After much expoſtulation to no purpoſe, they were obliged, with whatever reluctance and mortification, to return on board. I then went on ſhore myſelf, but found the Viceroy inflexible; he had one anſwer ready for every thing I could ſay, That the reſtrictions under which he had laid us,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013324_0041_0F90F0F4361AD098"/>
were in obedience to the King of Portugal's commands, and therefore indiſpenſible.</p>
                        <p>In this ſituation I determined, rather than be made a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in my own boat, to go on ſhore no more; for the officer who, under pretence of a compliment, attended me when I was aſhore, inſiſted alſo upon going with me to and from the ſhip: but ſtill imagining, that the ſcrupulous vigilance of the Viceroy muſt proceed from ſome miſtaken notion about us, which might more eaſily be remove by writing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> in converſation, I drew up a memorial, and Mr. Banks drew up another, which we ſent on ſhore. Theſe memorials were both anſwered, but by no means to our ſatisfaction; we therefore replied: in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which ſeveral other papers were interchanged between us and the Viceroy, but ſtill without effect. However, as I thought ſome degree of force, on the part of the Viceroy, to enforce theſe reſtrictions, neceſſary to juſtify my acquieſcence in them to the Admiralty; I gave orders to my Lieutenant, Mr. Hicks, when I ſent him with our laſt reply on Sunday the 20th, in the evening, not to ſuffer a guard to be put into his boat. When the officer on board the guard-boat found that Mr. Hicks was determined to obey my orders, he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to force, but attended him to the landing-place, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the matter to the Viceroy. Upon this his Excellency refuſed to receive the memorial, and ordered Mr. Hicks to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the ſhip; when he came back to the boat, he found that a guard had been put on board in his abſence, but he abſolutely refuſed to return till the ſoldier was removed: the officer then proceeded to enforce the Viceroy's orders; he ſeized all the boat's crew, and ſent them under an armed force to priſon, putting Mr. Hicks at the ſame time into one of their own boats, and ſending him under a guard back to the ſhip. As ſoon as he had reported theſe particulars, I wrote again to the Viceroy, demanding my boat and crew, and in my letter incloſed the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial which he had refuſed to receive from Mr. Hicks: theſe papers I ſent by a petty officer, that I might wave the diſpute about a guard, againſt which I had never objected except when there was a commiſſioned officer on board the boat. The petty officer was permitted to go on ſhore with his guard, and, having delivered his letter, was told that an anſwer would be ſent the next day.</p>
                        <p>About eight o'clock this evening it began to blow very hard in ſudden guſts from the South, and our long boat coming on board juſt at this time with four pipes of rum, the rope which was thrown to her from the ſhip, and which was taken hold of by the people on board, unfortunately broke, and the boat which had come to the ſhip before the wind, went adrift to windward of her, with a ſmall ſkiff of Mr. Banks's that was faſtened to her ſtern. This was a great misfortune, as the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013324_0042_0F8FFA3419A53B38"/>
being detained on ſhore, we had no boat on board but a four oar'd yawl; the yawl, however, was immediately manned, and ſent to her aſſiſtance; but, notwithſtanding the utmoſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the people in both boats, they were very ſoon out of ſight; far indeed we could not ſee at that time in the evening, but the diſtance was enough to convince us that they were not under command, which gave us great uneaſineſs, as we knew they muſt drive directly upon a reef of rocks which ran out juſt to leeward of where we lay: after waiting ſome hours in the utmoſt anxiety, we gave them over for loſt, but about three o'clock the next morning had the ſatisfaction to ſee all the people come on board in the yawl. From them we learnt that the long-boat having filled with water they had brought her to a grappling and left her; and that, having fallen in with a reef of rocks in their return to the ſhip, they had been obliged to cut Mr. Banks's little boat adrift. As the loſs of our long-boat, which we had now too much reaſon to apprehend, would have been an unſpeakable diſadvantage to us, conſidering the nature of our expedition, I ſent another letter to the Viceroy, as ſoon as I thought he could be ſeen, acquainting him with our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and requeſting the aſſiſtance of a boat from the ſhore for the recovery of our own; I alſo renewed my demand that the pinnace and her crew ſhould be no longer detained; after ſome delay his Excellency thought fit to comply both with my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and demand; and the ſame day we happily recovered both the long-boat and ſkiff, with the rum, but every thing elſe that was on board was loſt. On the 23d, the Viceroy, in his anſwer to my remonſtrance againſt ſeizing my men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the boat, acknowledged that I had been treated with ſome incivility, but ſaid that the reſiſtance of my officers, to what he had declared to be the King's orders, made it abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary; he alſo expreſſed ſome doubts whether the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, conſidering her ſtructure and other circumſtances, was in the ſervice of his Majeſty, though I had before ſhewed him my commiſſion; to this I anſwered in writing, That, to remove all ſcruples, I was ready to produce my commiſſion again. His Excellency's ſcruples however ſtill remained, and in his reply to my letter, he not only expreſſed them in ſtill plainer terms, but, accuſed my people of ſmuggling. This charge I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident was without the leaſt foundation in truth. Mr. Banks's ſervants had indeed found means to go on ſhore on the 22d, at day-break, and ſtay till it was dark in the evening, but they brought on board only plants and inſects, having been ſent for no other purpoſe. And I had the greateſt reaſon to believe that not a ſingle article was ſmuggled by any of our people who were admitted on ſhore, though many artful means were uſed to tempt them even by the very officers that were under his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency's roof, which made the charge ſtill more injurious and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013324_0043_0F90F0F70F3182D8"/>
provoking. I have indeed ſome reaſon to ſuſpect that one poor fellow bought a ſingle bottle of rum with ſome of the clothes upon his back; and in my anſwer I requeſted of his Excellency, that if ſuch an attempt at illicit trade ſhould be repeated, he would without ſcruple order the offender to be taken into cuſtody. And thus ended our altercation, both by conference and writing, with the Viceroy of Rio de Janeiro.</p>
                        <p>A friar in the town having requeſted the aſſiſtance of our ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, Dr. Solander eaſily got admittance in that character on the 25th, and received many marks of civility from the people. On the 26th, before day-break, Mr. Banks alſo found means to elude the vigilance of the people in the guard-boat, and got on ſhore; he did not however go into the town, for the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal objects of his curioſity were to be found in the fields: to him alſo the people behaved with great civility, many of them invited him to their houſes, and he bought a porker and ſome other things of them for the ſhip's company; the porker, which was by no means lean, coſt him eleven ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and he paid ſomething leſs than two for a Muſcovy duck.</p>
                        <p>On the 27th when the boats returned from watering, the people told us there was a report in town, that ſearch was making after ſome perſons who had been on ſhore from the ſhip without the Viceroy's permiſſion; theſe perſons we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured to be Dr. Solander and Mr. Banks, and therefore they determined to go on ſhore no more.</p>
                        <p>On the 1ſt of December, having got our water and other neceſſaries on board, I went to the Viceroy for a pilot to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us to ſea, who came off to us; but the wind preventing us from getting out, we took on board a plentiful ſupply of freſh beef, yams and greens for the ſhip's company. On the 2d, a Spaniſh packet arrived with letters from Buenos Ayres for Spain, commanded by Don Antonio de Monte Negro-y Valeſco, who with great politeneſs offered to take our letters to Europe: I accepted the favour, and gave him a packet for the Secretary of the Admiralty, containing copies of all the papers that had paſſed between me and the Viceroy; leaving alſo duplicates with the Viceroy, to be by him forwarded to Liſbon.</p>

We immediately caſt anchor, and ſent to the fort to enquire the reaſon of what had happened: our people brought us word, That the Commandant had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no order from the Viceroy to let us paſs; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch an order, no veſſel was ever ſuffered to go below the fort. It was now, therefore become neceſſary that we ſhould ſend to the Viceroy to enquire why the neceſſary order had not been given, as he had notice of our departure, and had thought

fit to write me a polite letter, wiſhing me a good voyage. Our meſſenger ſoon returned with an account, that the order had been written ſome days, but by an unaccountable negligence not ſent.</p>
                        <p>We did not get under ſail till the 7th; and, when we had paſſed the fort, the pilot deſired to be diſcharged. As ſoon as he was diſmiſſed, we were left by our guard-boat, which had hovered about us from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>It is remarkable, that, during the laſt three or four days of our ſtaying in this harbour, the air was loaded with butterflies: they were chiefly of one ſort, but in ſuch numbers that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands were in view in every direction, and the greateſt part of them above our maſt-head.</p>
                        <p>We lay here from the 14th of November to the 7th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, ſomething more than three weeks, during which time Mr. Monkhouſe, our Surgeon, was on ſhore every day to buy our proviſions; Dr. Solander was on ſhore once; I was ſeveral times on ſhore myſelf, and Mr. Banks alſo found means to get into the country, notwithſtanding the watch that was ſet over us. I ſhall, therefore, with the intelligence obtained from theſe Gentlemen, and my own obſervations, give ſome account of the town, and the country adjacent.</p>
                        <p>Rio de Janeiro, or the river Januarius, was probably ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from its having been diſcovered on the feaſt-day of that ſaint: and the town, which is the capital of the Portugueſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in America, derives its name from the river, which indeed is rather an arm of the ſea, for it did not appear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any conſiderable ſtream of freſh water; it ſtands on a plain, cloſe to the ſhore, on the weſt ſide of the bay, at the foot of ſeveral high mountains which riſe behind it. It is neither ill deſigned, nor ill built; the houſes in general are of ſtone, and two ſtories high; every houſe having, after the manner of the Portugueſe, a little balcony before its windows, and a lattice of wood before the balcony. I computed its circuit to be about three miles; for it appears to be equal in ſize to the largeſt country towns in England, Briſtol and Liverpool not excepted; the ſtreets are ſtraight, and of a convenient breadth, interſecting each other at right angles; the greater part however lie on a line with the citadel, called St. Sabaſtian, which ſtands on the top of a hill that commands the town.</p>
                        <p>It is ſupplied with water from the neighbouring hills, by an aqueduct which is raiſed upon two ſtories of arches, and is ſaid in ſome places to be at a great height from the ground, from
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013324_0045_0F90F0F95B0816F8"/>
which the water is conveyed by pipes into a fountain in the great ſquare that exactly fronts the Viceroy's palace. At this fountain great numbers of people are continually waiting for their turn to draw water; and the ſoldiers, who are poſted at the Governor's door, find it very difficult to maintain any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity among them. The water at this fountain however is ſo bad, that we, who had been two months at ſea, confined to that in our caſks, which was almoſt always foul, could not drink it with pleaſure. Water of a better quality is laid into ſome other part of the town, but I could not learn by what means.</p>
                        <p>The churches are very fine, and there is more religious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade in this place than in any of the Popiſh countries in Europe: there is a proceſſion of ſome pariſh every day, with various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignia, all ſplendid and coſtly in the higheſt degree: they beg money, and ſay prayers in great form, at the corner of every ſtreet.</p>
                        <p>While we lay here, one of the churches was rebuilding; and to defray the expence, the pariſh to which it belonged had leave to beg in proceſſion through the whole city once a week, by which very conſiderable ſums were collected. At this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money, which was performed by night, all the boys of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain age were obliged to aſſiſt, the ſons of Gentlemen not being excuſed. Each of theſe boys was dreſſed in a black caſſock, with a ſhort red cloak, hanging about as low as the waiſt, and carried in his hand a pole about ſix or ſeven feet long, at the end of which was tied a lantern: the number of lanterns was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally above two hundred, and the light they gave was ſo great, that the people who ſaw it from the cabbin windows thought the town had been on fire.</p>
                        <p>The inhabitants, however, may pay their devotions at the ſhrine of any ſaint in the calendar, without waiting till there is a proceſſion; for before almoſt every houſe there is a little cupboard, furniſhed with a glaſs window, in which one of theſe tutelary powers is waiting to be gracious; and to prevent his being out of mind, by being out of ſight, a lamp is kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly burning before the window of his tabernacle in the night. The people indeed are by no means remiſs in their devotions, for before theſe ſaints they pray and ſing hymns with ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, that in the night they were very diſtinctly heard on board the ſhip, though ſhe lay at the diſtance of at leaſt half a mile from the town.</p>
                        <p>The government here, as to its form is mixed; it is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding very deſpotic in fact. It conſiſts of the Viceroy, the Governor of the town, and a council, the number of which I could not learn; without the conſent of this council, in which the Viceroy has a caſting vote, no judicial act ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: yet both the Viceroy and Governor frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

perſons to priſon at their own pleaſure, and ſometimes ſend them to Liſbon, without acquainting their friends or family with what is laid to their charge, or where they may be found.</p>
                        <p>To reſtrain the people from travelling into the country, and getting into any diſtrict where gold or diamonds may be found, of both which there is much more than the government can otherwiſe ſecure, certain bounds are preſcribed them, at the diſcretion of the Viceroy, ſometimes at a few, and ſometimes at many miles diſtance from the city.

                        <p>The inhabitants, which are very numerous, conſiſt of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe, Negroes, and Indians, the original natives of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The townſhip of Rio, which, as I was told is but a ſmall part of the Capitanea, or province, is ſaid to contain 37,000 White perſons, and 629,000 Blacks, many of whom are free; making together 666,000, in the proportion of ſeventeen to one. The Indians, who are employed to do the King's work in this neighbourhood, can ſcarcely be conſidered as inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; their reſidence is at a diſtance, from whence they come by turns to their taſk, which they are obliged to perform for a ſmall pay. The guard-boat was conſtantly rowed by theſe people, who are of a light copper colour, and have long black hair.</p>
                        <p>The military eſtabliſhment here conſiſts of twelve regiments of regular troops, ſix of which are Portugueſe and ſix Creoles; and twelve other regiments of provincial militia. To the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars the inhabitants behave with the utmoſt humility and ſubmiſſion: and I was told that if any of them ſhould neglect to take off his hat upon meeting an officer, he would immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be knocked down. Theſe haughty ſervitudes render the people extremely civil to any ſtranger who has the appearance of a Gentleman. But the ſubordination of the officers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Viceroy is enforced with circumſtances equally mortifying, for they are obliged to attend in his hall three times every day to aſk his commands: the anſwer conſtantly is. "There is nothing new." I have been told, that this ſervile attendance is exacted to prevent their going into the country; and if ſo, it effectually anſwers the purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>It is, I believe, univerſally allowed, that the women, both of the Spaniſh and Portugueſe ſettlements in South America, make leſs difficulty of granting perſonal favours, than thoſe of any other civilized country in the world. Of the Ladies of this town ſome have formed ſo unfavourable an opinion as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that they did not believe there was a modeſt one among
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013324_0047_0F90F0FAE6009788"/>
them. This cenſure is certainly too general; but what Dr. Solander ſaw of them when he was on ſhore, gave him no very exalted idea of their chaſtity: he told me, than as ſoon as it was dark, one or more appeared in every window, and diſtinguiſhed thoſe whom they liked, among the Gentlemen that walked paſt them, by giving them noſegays; that he, and two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who were with him, received ſo many of theſe favours, that, at the end of their walk, which was not a long one, they threw whole hatfuls of them away. Great allowance muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be made for local cuſtoms: that which in one country would be indecent familiarity, is a mere act of general courteſy in another; of the fact, therefore, which I have related, I ſhall ſay nothing, but I am confident it is true.</p>
                        <p>Neither will I take upon me to affirm, that murders are frequently committed here; but the churches afford an aſylum to the criminal: and as our cockſwain was one day looking at two men, who appeared to be talking together in a friendly manner, one of them ſuddenly drew a knife and ſtabbed the other; who not inſtantly falling, the murderer withdrew the weapon, and ſtabbed him a ſecond time. He then ran away, and was purſued by ſome Negroes who were alſo witneſſes of the fact; but whether he eſcaped or was taken I never heard.</p>
                        <p>The country, at a ſmall diſtance round the town, which is all that any of us ſaw, is beautiful in the higheſt degree; the wildeſt ſpots being varied with a greater luxuriance of flowers, both as to number and beauty, than the beſt gardens in England.</p>
                        <p>Upon the trees and buſhes ſat an almoſt endleſs variety of birds, eſpecially ſmall ones, many of them covered with the moſt elegant plumage; among which were the humming-bird. Of inſects too there was a great variety, and ſome of them very beautiful; but they were much more nimble than thoſe of Europe, eſpecially the butterflies, moſt of which flew near the tops of the trees, and were therefore very difficult to be caught, except when the ſea breeze blew freſh, which kept them nearer to the ground.</p>
                        <p>The banks of the ſea, and of the ſmall brooks which water this part of the country, are almoſt covered with the ſmall crabs called <hi>Cancer vocans;</hi> ſome of theſe had one of the claws, called by naturaliſts the hand, very large; others had them both remarkably ſmall, and of equal ſize, a difference which is ſaid to diſtinguiſh the ſexes, that with the large claw being the male.</p>
                        <p>There is the appearance of but little cultivation; the greater part of the land is wholly uncultivated, and very little care and labour ſeem to have been beſtowed upon the reſt; there are indeed little patches or gardens, in which many kinds of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean garden ſtuff are produced, particularly cabbages, peas, beans, kidney-beans, turnips, and white radiſhes, but all

much inferior to our own water melons and pine apples are alſo produced in theſe ſpots, and they are the only fruits that we ſaw cultivated, though the country produces muſk melons, oranges, limes, lemons, ſweet lemons, citrons, plantains, bananas, mangos, mamane apples, acajou or caſhou apples and nuts; jamboir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of two kinds, one of which bears a ſmall black fruit; cocoa nuts, mangos, palm nuts of two kinds, one long, the other round; and palm berries, all which were in ſeaſon while we were there.</p>
                        <p>Of theſe fruits the water melons and oranges are the beſt in their kind; the pine apples are much inferior to thoſe that I have eaten in England; they are indeed more juicy and ſweet, but have no flavour; I believe them to be natives of this country, though we heard of none that at this time grow wild; they have, however, very little care beſtowed upon them, the plants being ſet between beds of any kind of garden-ſtuff, and ſuffered to take the chance of the ſeaſon. The melons are ſtill worſe, at leaſt thoſe that we taſted, which were mealy and inſipid; but the water melons are excellent; they have a flavour, at leaſt a degree of acidity, which ours have not. We ſaw alſo ſeveral ſpecies of the prickle pear, and ſome European fruits, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the apple and peach, both which were very mealy and inſipid. In theſe gardens alſo grow yams, and mandihoca, which in the Weſt Indies is called Caſſada or Caſſava, and to the flour of which the people here, as I have before obſerved, give the name of <hi>Farinha de Pao,</hi> which may not improperly be tranſlated, Powder of poſt. The ſoil, though it produces tobacco and ſugar, will not produce bread-corn; ſo that the people here have no wheat-flour, but what is brought from Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, and ſold at the rate of a ſhilling a pound, though it is generally ſpoiled by being heated in its paſſage. Mr. Banks is of opinion, that all the products of our Weſt Indian iſlands would grow here; notwithſtanding which, the inhabitants import their coffee and chocolate from Liſbon.</p>
                        <p>Moſt of the land, as far as we ſaw of the country, is laid down in graſs, upon which cattle are paſtured in great plenty; but they are ſo lean, that an Engliſhman will ſcarcely eat of their fleſh: the herbage of theſe paſtures conſiſts principally of creſſes, and conſequently is ſo ſhort, that though it may afford a bite for horſes and ſheep, it can ſcarcely be grazed by horned cattle in a ſufficient quantity to keep them alive.</p>
                        <p>This country may poſſibly produce many valuable drugs; but we could not find any in the apothecaries ſhops, except pareira brava, and balſam capivi; both of which were excellent in their kind, and ſold at a very low price. The drug trade is probably carried on to the northward, as well as that of the dying woods, for we could get no intelligence of either of them here. As to manufactures, we neither ſaw nor heard of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013324_0049_0F90F0FCF365F198"/>
any, except that of cotton hammocks, in which people are carried about here, as they are with us in ſedan chairs; and theſe are principally, if not wholly, fabricated by the Indians.</p>
                        <p>The riches of the place conſiſts chiefly in the mines, which we ſuppoſed to lie far up the country, though we could never learn where, or at what diſtance; for the ſituation is concealed as much as poſſible, and troops are continually employed in guarding the roads that lead to them: it is almoſt impoſſible for any man to get the ſight of them, except thoſe who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed there; and indeed the ſtrongeſt curioſity would ſcarcely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any man to attempt it, for whoever is found upon the road to them, if he cannot give undeniable evidence of his having buſineſs there, is immediately hanged up upon the next tree.</p>
                        <p>Much gold is certainly brought from theſe mines, but at an expence of life, that muſt ſtrike every man, to whom cuſtom has not made it familiar, with horror. No leſs than forty thouſand negroes are annually imported, on the king's account, to dig the mines; and we were credibly informed, that, the laſt year but one before we arrived here, this number fell ſo ſhort, probably from ſome epidemic diſeaſe, that twenty thouſand more were draughted from the town of Rio.</p>
                        <p>Precious ſtones are alſo found here in ſuch plenty, that a certain quantity only is allowed to be collected in a year; to collect this quantity, a number of people are ſent into the country where they are found, and when it is got together, which ſometimes happens in a month, ſometimes in leſs and ſometimes in more, they return; and after that, whoever is found in theſe precious diſtricts, on any pretence, before the next year, is immediately put to death.</p>
                        <p>The jewels found here, are diamonds, topazes of ſeveral kinds, and amethyſts. We did not ſee any of the diamonds, but were informed that the Viceroy had a large quantity by him, which he would ſell on the King of Portugal's account, but not at a leſs price than they are ſold for in Europe. Mr. Banks bought a few topazes and amethyſts as ſpecimens: of the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pazes there are three ſorts, of very different value, which are diſtinguiſhed here by the names of Pinga d'agua qualidade pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meiro, Pinga d'agua qualidade ſecundo, and Chryſtallos arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillos: they are ſold, large and ſmall, good and bad together, by octavos, or the eighth part of an ounce; the beſt at 4s. 9d. All dealing, however, in theſe ſtones is prohibited to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, under the ſevereſt penalties: there were jewellers here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, who purchaſed and worked them on their own account; but about fourteen months before our arrival, orders came from the court of Portugal, that no more ſtones ſhould be wrought here, except on the King's account: the jewellers were ordered to bring all their tools to the Viceroy, and left without any means of ſubſiſtence. The perſons employed here to work ſtones for the King are ſlaves.</p>
                        <p>

The coin that is current here, is either that of Portugal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting chiefly of thirty-ſix ſhillings pieces; or pieces, both of gold and ſilver, which are ſtruck at this place: the pieces of ſilver, which are very much debaſed, are called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Here is alſo a copper coin, like that in Portugal, of five and ten ree pieces. A ree is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal coin of Portugal, ten of which are equal in value to about three farthings ſterling.</p>
                        <p>The harbour of Rio de Janeiro is ſituated Weſt by North 8 leagues from Cape Trio, and may be known by a remarkable hill, in the form of a ſugar-loaf, at the weſt point of the bay; but as all the coaſt is very high, and riſes in many peaks, the entrance of this harbour may be more certainly diſtinguiſhed by the iſlands that lie before it; one of which, called Rodonda, is high and round like a hay-ſtack, and lies at the diſtance of two leagues and an half from the entrance of the bay, in the direction of S. by W.; but the firſt iſlands which are met with, coming from the eaſt, or Cape Trio, are two that have a rocky appearance, lying near to each other, and at the diſtance of about four miles from the ſhore: there are alſo at the diſtance of three leagues to the weſtward of theſe, two other iſlands which lie near to each other, a little without the bay on the eaſt ſide, and very near the ſhore. This harbour is certainly a good one; the entrance indeed is not wide, but the ſea breeze, which blows every day from ten or twelve o'clock till ſunſet, makes it eaſy for any ſhip to go in before the wind; and it grows wider as the town is approached, ſo that abreaſt of it there is room for the largeſt fleet, in five or ſix fathom water, with an oozy bottom. At the narrow part, the entrance is defended by two forts. The principal is Santa Cruz, which ſtands on the eaſt point of the bay, and has been mentioned before; that on the weſt ſide is called fort Lozia, and is built upon a rock that lies cloſe to the main; the diſtance between them is about ¾ of a mile, but the channel is not quite ſo broad, becauſe there are ſunken rocks which lie off each fort, and in this part alone there is danger: the narrowneſs of the channel cauſes the tides, both flood and ebb, to run with conſiderable ſtrength, ſo that they cannot be ſtemmed without a freſh breeze. The rockyneſs of the bottom makes it alſo unſafe to anchor here; but all danger may be avoided by keeping in the middle of the channel. Within the entrance, the courſe up the bay is firſt N. by W. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

W. end of the city.</p>

The river, and indeed the whole coaſt, abounds with a greater variety of fiſh than we had ever ſeen; a day ſeldom paſſed in which one or more of a new ſpecies were not brought to Mr. Banks: the bay alſo is as well adapted for catching theſe fiſh as can be conceived; for it is full of ſmall iſlands, between which there is ſhallow water, and proper beaches for drawing the ſeine. The ſea, without the bay, abounds with dolphins, and large mackrel of different kinds, which readily bite at a hook, and the inhabitants always tow one after their boats for that purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>Though the climate is hot, the ſituation of this place is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly wholeſome; while we ſtayed here the thermometer never roſe higher than 83, though we had frequent rains, and once a very hard gale of wind.</p>
                        <p>Ships water here at the fountain in the great ſquare, though, as I have obſerved, the water is not good; they land their caſks upon a ſmooth ſandy beach, which is not more than a hundred yards diſtant from the fountain, and upon application to the Viceroy, a centinel will be appointed to look after them, and clear the way to the fountain where they are to be filled.</p>
                        <p>Upon the whole, Rio de Janeiro is a very good place for ſhips to put in at, that want refreſhment: the harbour is ſafe and commodious; and proviſions, except wheaten bread and flour, may be eaſily procured: as a ſuccedaneum for bread, there are ya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The people here jerk their beef by taking out the bones, cutting it into large but thin ſlices, then curing it with ſalt, and drying it in the ſhade: it eats very well, and, if kept dry, will remain good a long time at ſea. Mutton is ſcarcely to be procured, and hogs and poultry are dear; of garden-ſtuff and fruit there is abundance, of which, however, none can be preſerved at ſea but the pumpkin; rum, ſugar, and molaſſes, all excellent in their kind, may be had at a reaſonable price; tobacco alſo is cheap, but it is not good. Here is a yard for building ſhipping, and a ſmall hulk to heave down by; for, as the tide never riſes above ſix or ſeven foot, there is no other way of coming at a ſhip's bottom.</p>
                        <p>When the boat which had been ſent on ſhore returned, we hoiſted her on board, and ſtood out to ſea.</p>

                        <p>ON the 9th of December, we obſerved the ſea to be covered with broad ſtreaks of a yellowiſh colour, ſeveral of them a mile long, and three or four hundred yards wide: ſome of the water thus coloured was taken up, and found to be full of

innumerable atoms pointed at the end, of a yellowiſh colour, and none more than a quarter of a line, or the fortieth part of an inch long: in the microſcope they appeared to be <hi>

The ſame appearance had been obſerved before, when we firſt diſcovered the continent of South America.</p>
                        <p>On the 11th we hooked a ſhark, and while we were playing it under the cabbin window, it threw out, and drew in again ſeveral times what appeared to be its ſtomach: it proved to be a female, and upon being opened ſix young ones were taken out of it; five of them were alive and ſwam briſkly in a tub of water, but the ſixth appeared to have been dead ſometime.</p>
                        <p>Nothing remarkable happened till the 30th, except that we prepared for the bad weather, which we were ſhortly to expect, by bending a new ſuit of ſails; but on this day we ran a courſe of one hundred and ſixty miles by the log, through innumerable land inſects of various kinds, ſome upon the wing, and more upon the water, many of which were alive; they appeared to be exactly the ſame with the <hi>Cara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We judged ourſelves to be now nearly oppoſite to <hi>Baye ſans fond,</hi> where Mr. Dalrymple ſuppoſes there is a paſſage quite through the continent of America; and we thought from the inſects that there might be at leaſt a very large river, and that it had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed its banks.</p>
                        <p>On the 3d of January, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>The people now beginning to complain of cold, each of them received what is called a Magellanic jacket, and a pair of trowſers. The jacket is made of a thick woollen-ſtuff, called <hi>Fearnought,</hi> which is provided by the government. We ſaw, from time to time, a great number of penguins, albatroſſes, and ſheer waters, ſeals, whales, and porpoiſes: and on the 11th, having paſſed Falkland's iſlands, we diſcovered the coaſt of Terra del Fuego, at the diſtance of about four leagues, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from the W. to S. E. by S. We had here five and thirty fathom, the ground ſoft, ſmall ſtate ſtones. As we ranged along the ſhore to the S. E. at the diſtance of two or three leagues, we perceived ſmoke in ſeveral places, which was made

by the natives, probably as a ſignal, for they did not continue it after we had paſſed by. This day we diſcovered that the ſhip had got near a degree of longitude to the weſtward of the log, which, in this latitude, is 35 minutes of a degree on the equator: probably there is a ſmall current ſetting to the weſtward, which may be cauſed by the weſterly current coming rou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Having continued to range the coaſt, on the 14th we entered the Streight of Le Maire; but the tide turning againſt us, drove us out with great violence, and raiſed ſuch a ſea off Cape St. Diego, that the waves had exactly the ſame appearance as they would have had if they had broke over a ledge of rocks; and when the ſhip was in this torrent, ſhe frequently pitched, ſo that the bowſprit was under water. About noon, we got under the land between Cape St. Diego and Cape St. Vincent, where I intended to have anchored; but finding the ground every where hard and rocky, and ſhallowing from thirty to twelve fathoms, I ſent the Maſter to examine a little cove which lay at a ſmall diſtance to the eaſtward of Cape St. Vincent. When he returned, he reported, that there was anchorage in four fathom, and a good bottom, cloſe to the eaſtward of the firſt bluff point, on the eaſt of Cape St. Vincent, at the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the cove, to which I gave the name of VINCENT's Bay: before this anchoring ground, however, lay ſeveral rocky ledges, that were covered with ſea-weed; but I was told that there was not leſs than eight and nine fathom over all of them. It will probably be thought ſtrange, that where weeds, which grow at the bottom, appear above the ſurface, there ſhould be this depth of water; but the weeds which grow upon rocky ground in theſe countries, and which always diſtinguiſh it from ſand and ooze, are of an enormous ſize. The leaves are four foot long, and ſome of the ſtalks, though not thicker than a man's thumb, above one hundred and twenty: Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander examined ſome of them, over which we ſounded and had fourteen fathom, which is eighty-four feet; and, as they made a very acute angle with the bottom, they were thought to be at leaſt one half longer: the foot ſtalks were ſwelled into an air veſſel, and Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander called this plant <hi>Fucus giganteus.</hi> Upon the report of the Maſter, I ſtood in with the ſhip; but not truſting implicity to his intelligence, I continued to ſound, and found but four
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013324_0054_0F90F10025A05300"/>
fathom upon the firſt ledge that I went over; concluding, therefore, that I could not anchor here without riſk, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſeek ſome port in the Streight, where I might get on board ſuch wood and water as we wanted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, however, being very deſirous to go on ſhore, I ſent a boat with them and their people, while I kept plying as near as poſſible with the ſhip.</p>
                        <p>Having been on ſhore four hours, they returned about nine in the evening, with above an hundred different plants and flowers, all of them wholly unknown to the botaniſts of Europe. They found the country about the bay to be in general flat, the bottom of it in particular was a plain, covered with graſs, which might eaſily have been made into a large quantity of hay; they found alſo abundance of good wood and water, and fowl in great plenty. Among other things, of which Nature has been liberal in this place, is Winter's bark, <hi>Winteranea aromatica;</hi> which may eaſily be known by its broad leaf, ſhaped like the laurel, of a light green colour without, and inclining to blue within: the bark is eaſily ſtripped with a bone or a ſtick, and its virtues are well known: it may be uſed for culinary purpoſes an a ſpice, and is not leſs pleaſant than wholeſome: here is alſo plenty of wild celery and ſcurvy-graſs. The trees are chiefly of one kind, a ſpecies of the birch, called <hi>Betula antarctica;</hi> the ſtem is from thirty to forty feet long, and from two to three feet in diameter, ſo that in a caſe of neceſſity they might poſſibly ſupply a ſhip with top-maſts: they are a light white wood, bear a ſmall leaf, and cleave very ſtraight. Cranberries were alſo found here in great plenty, both white and red.</p>
                        <p>The perſons who landed ſaw none of the inhabitants, but fell in with two of their deſerted huts, one in a thick wood, and the other cloſe by the beach.</p>
                        <p>Having taken the boat on board, I made ſail into the Streight, and at three in the morning of the 15th, I anchored in twelve fathom an a half, upon coral rocks, before a ſmall cove, which we took for Port Maurice, at the diſtance of about half a mile from the ſhore. Two of the natives came down to the beach, expecting us to land; but this ſpot afforded ſo little ſhelter, that I at length determined not to examine it: I therefore got under ſail again about ten o'clock, and the ſavages retired into the woods.</p>
                        <p>At two o'clock, we anchored in the bay of Good Succeſs; and after dinner I went on ſhore, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, to look for a watering-place, and ſpeak to the Indians, ſeveral of whom had come in ſight. We landed on the ſtarboard ſide of the bay near ſome rocks, which made ſmooth water and good landing; thirty or forty of the Indians ſoon made their appearance at the end of a ſandy beach on the other ſide of the bay, but ſeeing our number, which was ten or
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013324_0055_0F90F100C89B00C0"/>
twelve, they retreated. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced about one hundred yards before us, upon which two of the Indians returned, and, having advanced ſome paces towards them, far down; as ſoon as they came up, the Indians roſe, and each of them having a ſmall ſtick in his hand threw it away, in a direction both from themſelves and the ſtrangers, which was conſidered as the renunciation of weapons in token of peace: they then walked briſkly towards their companions, who had halted at about fifty yards behind them, and beckoned the Gentlemen to follow, which they did. They were received with many uncouth ſigns of friendſhip; and, in return, they diſtributed among them ſome beads and ribbons, which had been brought on ſhore for that purpoſe, and with which they were greatly delighted. A mutual confidence and good-will being thus produced, our parties joined; the converſation, ſuch as it was, became general; and three of them accompanied us back to the ſhip. When they came on board, one of them, whom we took to be a prieſt, performed much the ſame cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which M. Bougainville deſcribes, and ſuppoſes to be an exorciſm. When he was introduced into a new part of the ſhip, or when any thing that he had not ſeen before caught his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſhouted with all his force for ſome minutes, without directing his voice either to as or his companions.</p>
                        <p>They eat ſome bread and ſome beef, but not apparently with much pleaſure, though ſuch part of what was given them as they did not eat they took away with them; but they would not ſwallow a drop either of wine or ſpirits: they put the glaſs to their lips, but, having taſted the liquor, they returned it, with ſtrong expreſſions of diſguſt. Curioſity ſeems to be one of the few paſſions which diſtinguiſh men from brutes; and of this our gueſts appeared to have very little. They went from one part of the ſhip to another, and looked at the vaſt variety of new objects that every moment preſented themſelves, without any expreſſion either of wonder or pleaſure, for the vociferation of our exorciſt ſeemed to be neither.</p>
                        <p>After having been on board about two hours, they expreſſed a deſire to go aſhore. A boat was immediately ordered, and Mr. Banks thought fit to accompany them: he landed them in ſafety, and conducted them to their companions, among whom he remarked the ſame vacant indifference, as in thoſe who had been on board: for as on one ſide there appeared no eagerneſs to relate, ſo on the other there ſeemed to be no curioſity to hear, how they had been received, or what they had ſeen. In about half an hour, Mr. Banks returned to the ſhip, and the Indians retired from the ſhore.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. IV. An Account what happened in aſcending a Mountain to ſearch for Plants.</head>
                        <p>ON the 16th, early in the morning, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with their attendants and ſervants, and two ſeamen to aſſiſt in carrying the baggage, accompanied by Mr. Monkhouſe the Surgeon, and Mr. Green the Aſtronomer, ſet out from the ſhip, with a view to penetrate as far as they could into the country, and return at night. The hills, when viewed at a diſtance, ſeemed to be partly a wood, partly a plain, and above them a bare rock. Mr. Banks hoped to get through the wood, and made no doubt, but that, beyond it, he ſhould, in a country which no botaniſt had ever yet viſited, find alpine plants which would abundantly compenſate his labour. They entered the wood at a ſmall ſandy beach, a little to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the watering-place, and continued to aſcend the hill, through the pathleſs wilderneſs, till three o'clock, before they got a near view of the places which they intended to viſit. Soon after they reached what they had taken for a plain; but, to their great diſappointment, found it a ſwamp, covered with low buſhes of birch, about three feet high, interwoven with each other, and ſo ſtubborn that they could not be bent out of the way; it was therefore neceſſary to lift the leg over them, which at every ſtep was buried, ancle deep, in the ſoil. To aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the pain and difficulty of ſuch travelling, the weather, which hitherto had been very fine, much like one of our bright days in May, became gloomy and cold; with ſudden blaſts of a moſt piercing wind, accompanied with ſnow. They puſhed forward, however, in good ſpirits, notwithſtanding their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, hoping the worſt of the way was paſt, and that the bare rock which they had ſeen from the tops of the lower hills was not more than a mile before them; but when they had got about two thirds over this woody ſwamp, Mr. Buchan, one of Mr. Banks's draughtmen, was unhappily ſeized with a fit. This made it neceſſary for the whole company to halt, and as it was impoſſible that he ſhould go any farther, a fire was kindled, and thoſe who were moſt fatigued were left behind to take care of him. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Mr. Green, and Mr. Monkhouſe went on, and in a ſhort time reached the ſummit. As botaniſts, their expectations were here abundantly gratified: for they found a great variety of plants, which, with reſpect to the alpine plants in Europe, are exactly what thoſe plants are with reſpect to ſuch as grow in the plain.</p>
                        <p>The cold was now become more ſevere, and the ſnow-blaſts more frequent; the day alſo was ſo far ſpent, that it was found impoſſible to get back to the ſhip before the next morning: to paſs the night upon ſuch a mountain, in ſuch a climate, was not only comfortleſs, but dreadful; it was impoſſible however to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013324_0057_0F90F10233F748A0"/>
be avoided, and they were to provide for it as well as they could.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, while they were improving an opportunity which they had, with ſo much danger and difficulty, procured, by gathering the plants which they found upon the mountain, ſent Mr. Green and Mr. Monkhouſe back to Mr. Buchan and the people that were with him, with directions to bring them to a hill, which they thought lay in a better rout for returning to the wood, and which was therefore appointed as a general rendezvous. It was propoſed, that from this hill they ſhould puſh through the ſwamp, which ſeemed by the new root not to be more than half a mile over, into the ſhelter of the wood, and there build their wigwam, and make a fire: this, as their way was all down hill, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> ſeemed eaſy to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh. Their whole company aſſembled at the rendezvous, and, though pinched with the cold, were in health and ſpirits, Mr. Buchan himſelf having recovered his ſtrength in a much greater degree than could have been expected. It was now near eight o'clock in the evening, but ſtill good day-light, and they ſet forward for the neareſt valley, Mr. Banks himſelf undertaking to bring up the rear, and ſee that no ſtraggler was left behind: this may perhaps be thought a ſuperfluous caution, but it will ſoon appear to be otherwiſe. Dr. Solander, who had more than once croſſed the mountains which divide Sweden from Norway, well knew that extreme cold, eſpecially when joined with fatigue, produces a torpor and ſleepineſs that are almoſt irreſiſtible: he therefore conjured the company to keep moving, whatever pain it might coſt them, and whatever relief they might be promiſed by an inclination to reſt: Whoever ſits down, ſays he, will ſleep; and however ſleeps, will wake no more. Thus, at once admoniſhed and alarmed, they ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but while they were ſtill upon the naked rock, and before they had got among the buſhes, the cold became ſuddenly ſo intenſe, as to produce the effects that had been moſt dreaded. Dr. Solander himſelf was the firſt who found the inclination, againſt which he had warned others, irreſiſtible; and inſiſted upon being ſuffered to lie down. Mr. Banks intreated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in vain, down he lay upon the ground, though it was covered with ſnow; and it was with great difficulty that his friend kept him from ſleeping. Richmond alſo, one of the black ſervants, began to linger, having ſuffered from the cold in the ſame manner as the Doctor. Mr. Banks, therefore, ſent five of the company, among whom was Mr. Buchan, forward to get a fire ready at the firſt convenient place they could find; and himſelf, with four others, remained with the Doctor and Richmond, whom partly by perſuaſion and entreaty, and partly by force, they brought on; but when they had got through the greateſt part of the birch and ſwamp, they both declared they could go no farther. Mr. Banks had recourſe again to entreaty
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013324_0058_0F90F10306709328"/>
and expoſtulation, but they produced no effect: when Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond was told, that if he did not go on he would in a ſhort time be frozen to death; he anſwered, That he deſired nothing but to lie down and die: the Doctor did not ſo explicitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his life; he ſaid he was willing to go on, but that he muſt firſt take ſome ſleep, though he had before told the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that to ſleep was to periſh. Mr. Banks and the reſt found it impoſſible to carry them, and there being no remedy, they were both ſuffered to ſit down, being partly ſupported by the buſhes, and in a few minutes they fell into a profound ſleep: ſoon after, ſome of the people who had been ſent forward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, with the welcome news that a fire was kindled about a quarter of a mile farther on the way. Mr. Banks then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to wake Dr. Solander and happily ſucceeded: but, though he had not ſlept five minutes, he had almoſt loſt the uſe of his limbs, and the muſcles were ſo ſhrunk that his ſhoes fell from his feet; he conſented to go forward with ſuch aſſiſtance as could be given him, but no attempts to relieve poor Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond were ſucceſsful. It being found impoſſible to make him ſtir, after ſome time had been loſt in the attempt, Mr. Banks left his other black ſervant and a ſeaman, who ſeemed to have ſuffered leaſt by the cold, to look after him; promiſing, that as ſoon as two others ſhould be ſufficiently warmed, they ſhould be relieved. Mr. Banks, with much difficulty, at length got the Doctor to the fire; and ſoon after ſent two of the people who had been refreſhed, in hopes that with the aſſiſtance of thoſe who had been left behind, they would be able to bring Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, even though it ſhould be ſtill found impoſſible to wake him. In about half an hour, however, they had the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to ſee theſe two men return alone; they ſaid, that they had been all round the place to which they had been directed, but could neither find Richmond nor thoſe who had been left with him; and that though they had ſhouted many times, no voice had replied. This was a matter of equal ſurpriſe and concern, particularly to Mr. Banks, who, while he was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how it could happen, miſſed a bottle of rum, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's whole ſtock, which they now concluded to be in the knapſack of one of the abſentees. It was conjectured, that with this Richmond had been rouzed by the two perſons who had been left with him, and that, having perhaps drank too freely of it themſelves, they had all rambled from the place where they had been left, in ſearch of the fire, inſtead of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for thoſe who ſhould have been their aſſiſtants and guides. Another fall of ſnow now came on, and continued inceſſantly for two hours, ſo that all hope of ſeeing them again, at leaſt alive, were given up; but about twelve o'clock, to the great joy of thoſe at the fire, a ſhouting, was heard at ſome diſtance. Mr. Banks, with four more, immediately went out, and found
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013324_0059_0F904D8385933730"/>
the ſeaman with juſt ſtrength enough left to ſtagger along, and call out for aſſiſtance: Mr. Banks ſent him immediately to the fire, and, by his direction, proceeded in ſearch of the other two, whom he ſoon after found. Richmond was upon his legs, but not able to put one before the other; his companion was lying upon the ground, as inſenſible as a ſtone. All hands were now called from the fire, and an attempt was made to carry them to it; but, this, notwithſtanding the united efforts of the whole company, was found to be impoſſible. The night was extremely dark, the ſnow was now very deep, and, under theſe additional diſadvantages, they found it very difficult to make way through the buſhes and the bog for themſelves, all of them getting many falls in the attempt. The only alternative was to make a fire upon the ſpot; but the ſnow which had fallen, and was ſtill falling, beſides what was every moment ſhaken in flakes from the trees, rendered it equally impracticable, to kindle one there, and to bring any part of that which had been kindled in the wood thither: they were, therefore, reduced to the ſad neceſſity of leaving the unhappy wretches to their fate; having firſt made them a bed of boughs from the trees, and ſpread a covering of the ſame kind over them to a conſiderable height.</p>
                        <p>Having now been expoſed to the cold and the ſnow near an hour and an half, ſome of the reſt began to loſe their ſenſibility; and one Briſcoe, another of Mr. Banks's ſervants, was ſo ill, that it was thought he muſt die before he could be got to the fire.</p>
                        <p>At the fire, however, at length they arrived; and paſſed the night in a ſituation, which, however dreadful in itſelf, was rendered more afflicting by the remembrance of what was paſt, and the uncertainty of what was to come. Of twelve, the number that ſet out together in health and ſpirits, two were ſuppoſed to be already dead; a third was ſo ill, that it was very doubtful whether he would be able to go forward in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and a fourth, Mr. Buchan, was in danger of a return of his fits, by freſh fatigue after ſo uncomfortable a night: they were diſtant from the ſhip a long day's journey, through path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs woods, in which it was too probable they might be bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered till they were overtaken by the next night; and, not having prepared for a journey of more than eight or ten hours, they were wholly deſtitute of proviſions, except a vulture, which they happened to ſhoot while they were out, and which, if equally divided, would not afford each of them half a meal; and they knew not how much more they might ſuffer from the cold, as the ſnow ſtill continued to fall. A dreadful teſtimony of the ſeverity of the climate, as it was now the midſt of ſummer in this part of the world, the twenty-firſt of December being here the longeſt day; and every thing might juſtly be dreaded from a phaenomenon which in the correſponding ſeaſon, is unknown even in Norway and Lapland.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="33" facs="unknown:013324_0060_0F90F103C378A430"/>
When the morning dawned, they ſaw nothing round them, as far as the eve could reach, but ſnow, which ſeemed to lie as think upon the trees as upon the ground; and the blaſts returned ſo frequently, and with ſuch violence, that they found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to ſet out: how long this might laſt they knew not, and they had but too much reaſon to apprehend that it would confine them in that deſolate foreſt till they periſhed with hunger and cold.</p>
                        <p>After having ſuffered the miſery and terror of this ſituation till ſix o'clock in the morning, they conceived ſome hope of deliverance by diſcovering the place of the ſun through the clouds, which were become thinner, and began to break away. Their firſt care was to ſee whether the poor wretches whom they had been obliged to leave among the buſhes were yet alive; three of the company were diſpatched for that purpoſe, and very ſoon afterwards returned with the melancholy news, that they were dead.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding the flattering appearance of the ſky, the ſnow ſtill continued to fall ſo thick that they could not venture out upon their journey to the ſhip; but about 8 o'clock a ſmall regular breeze ſprung up, which, with the prevailing influence of the ſun, at length cleared the air; and they ſoon after, with great joy, ſaw the ſnow fall in large flakes from the trees, a certain ſign of an approaching thaw: they now examined more critically the ſtate of their invalids; Briſcoe was ſtill very ill, but ſaid, that he thought himſelf able to walk; and Mr. Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan was much better than either he or his friends had any reaſon to expect. They were now, however, preſſed by the calls of hunger, to which, after long faſting, every conſideration of future good or evil immediately gives way. Before they ſet forward, therefore, it was unanimouſly agreed, that they ſhould eat their vulture; the bird was accordingly ſkinned, and, it being thought beſt to divide it before it was fit to be eaten, it was cut into ten portions, and every man cooked his own as he thought fit. After this repaſt, which furniſhed each of them with about three mouthfuls, they prepared to ſet out; but it was ten o'clock before the ſnow was ſufficiently gone off to render a march practicable. After a walk of about three hours, they were very agreeably ſurpriſed to find themſelves upon the beach, and much nearer to the ſhip tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Upon reviewing their track from the veſſel, they perceived, that, inſtead of aſcending the hill in a line, ſo as to penetrate into the country, they had made almoſt a circle round it.—When they came on board, they congratulated each other upon their ſafety, with a joy that no man can feel who has not been expoſed to equal danger; and as I had ſuffered great anxiety at their not returning in the evening of the day on which they ſet out, I was not wholly without my ſhare.</p>

                        <p>ON the 18th and 19th, we were delayed in getting on board our wood and water by a ſwell: but on the 20th, the weather being more moderate, we again ſent the boat on ſhore, and Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went in it. They landed in the bottom of the bay, and while my people were employed in cutting brooms, they purſued their great object, the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of natural knowledge, with ſucceſs, collecting many ſhells and plants which hitherto have been altogether unknown: they came on board to dinner, and afterwards went again on ſhore to viſit an Indian town, which ſome of the people had reported to lie about two miles up the country. They found the diſtance not more than by the account, and they approached it by what appeared to be the common road, yet they were above an hour in getting thither, for they were frequently up to their knees in mud; when they got within a ſmall diſtance, two of the people came out to meet them, with ſuch ſtate as they could aſſume; when they joined them, they began to hollow as they had done on board the ſhip, without addreſſing themſelves either to the ſtrangers or their companions; and having continued this ſtrange vociferation ſome time, they conducted them to the town. It was ſituated on a dry knoll, or ſmall hill, covered with wood, none of which ſeemed to have been cleared away, and conſiſted of about twelve or fourteen hovels, of the moſt rude and inartifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſtructure that can be imagined. They were nothing more than a few poles ſet up ſo as to incline towards each other, and meet at the top, forming a kind of a cone, like ſome of our bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hives: on the weather ſide they were covered with a few boughs, and a little graſs; and on the lee ſide about one eighth of the circle was left open, both for a door and a fire place; and of this kind were the huts that had been ſeen in St. Vincent's bay, in one of which the embers of a fire were ſtill remaining. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture they had none; a little graſs, which lay round the inſide of the hovel, ſerved both for chairs and beds; and of all the utenſils which neceſſity and ingenuity have concurred to produce among other ſavage nations, they ſaw only a baſket to carry in the hand, a ſatchel to hang at the back, and the bladder of ſome beaſt to hold water, which the natives drink through a hole that is made near the top for that purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>The inhabitants of this town were a ſmall tribe, not more than fifty in number, of both ſexes and of every age. Their colour reſembles that of the ruſt of iron mixed with oil, and they have long black hair: the men are large, but clumſily built; their ſtature is from five feet eight, to five feet ten; the women are much leſs, few of them being more than five feet
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013324_0062_0F90F105345C4048"/>
high. Their whole apparel conſiſts of the ſkin of a guanicoe or ſeal, which is thrown over their ſhoulders, exactly in the ſtate in which it came from the animal's back; a piece of the ſame ſkin, which is drawn over their feet, and gathered about the ancles like a purſe, and a ſmall ſlap, which is worn by the women as a ſuccedaneum for a figleaf. The men wear their cloak open, the women tie it about their waiſt with a thong. But although they are content to be naked, they are very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to be fine. There faces were painted in various forms: the region of the eye was in general white, and the reſt of the face adorned with horizontal ſtreaks of red and black; yet ſcarcely any two were exactly alike. This decoration ſeems to be more profuſe and elaborate upon particular occaſions, for the two Gentlemen who introduced Mr. Banks and the Doctor into the town, were almoſt covered with ſtreaks of black in all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, ſo as to make a very ſtriking appearance. Both men and women wore bracelets of ſuch beads as they could make themſelves of ſmall ſhells or bones; the women both upon their wriſts and ancles, the men upon their wriſts only; but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for the want of bracelets on their legs, they wore a kind of fillet of brown worſted round their heads. They ſeemed to ſet a particular value upon any thing that was red, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred beads even to a knife or a hatchet.</p>
                        <p>Their language in general is guttural, and they expreſs ſome of their words by a ſound exactly like that which we make to clear the throat when any thing happens to obſtruct it; yet they have words which would be deemed ſoft in the better languages of Europe. Mr. Banks learnt what he ſuppoſes to be their name for beads and water. When they wanted beads, inſtead of ribbons or other trifles, they ſaid <hi>hallĕcă;</hi> and when they were taken on ſhore from the ſhip, and by ſigns aſked where water might be found, they made the ſign of drinking, and pointing as well to the caſks as the watering place, cried <hi>Oodâ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We ſaw no appearance of their having any food but ſhell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh; for though ſeals were frequently ſeen near the ſhore, they ſeemed to have no implements for taking them. The ſhell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh is collected by the women, whoſe buſineſs it ſeems to be to attend at low water, with a baſket in one hand, a ſtick, pointed and barbed, in the other, and a ſatchel at heir backs: they looſen the limpets, and other fiſh that adhere to the rocks, with the ſtick, and put them into the baſket; which, when full, they empty into the ſatchel.</p>

Theſe people might probably have ſome of the very glaſs which Bougainville left behind him, either from other natives, or perhaps from himſelf; for they appeared rather to be a travelling hord, than to have any fixed habitation. Their houſes are built to ſtand but for a ſhort time, they have no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>It is alſo probable that the place where we found them was only a temporary reſidence, from their having here nothing like a boat a can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We conjectured that there might be a ſtreight or inlet, running from the ſea through great part of this iſland, from the Streight of Magellan, whence theſe people might come, leaving their canoes where ſuch inlet terminated.</p>
                        <p>They did not appear to have among them any government or ſubordination: none was more reſpected than another; yet they ſeemed to live together in the utmoſt harmony and good fellowſhip. Neither did we diſcover any appearance of religion among them, except the noiſes which have been mentioned,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013324_0064_0F904D846AE268A8"/>
and which we ſuppoſed to be a ſuperſtitious ceremony, merely becauſe we could refer them to nothing elſe: they were uſed only by one of thoſe who came on board the ſhip, and the two who conducted Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander to the town, whom we therefore conjectured to be prieſts. Upon the whole, theſe people appeared to be the moſt deſtitute and forlorn, as well as the moſt ſtupid of all human beings; the outcaſts of Nature, who ſpent their lives in wandering about the dreary waſtes, where two of our people periſhed with cold in the midſt of ſummer; with no dwelling but a wretched hovel of ſticks and graſs, which would not only admit the wind, but the ſnow and the rain; almoſt naked; and deſtitute of every convenience that is furniſhed by the rudeſt art, having no implement even to dreſs their food: yet they were content. They ſeemed to have no wiſh for any thing more than they poſſeſſed, nor did any thing that we offered them appear acceptable but beads, as an ornamental ſuperſtuity of life. What bodily pain they might ſuffer from the ſeverities of their winter we could not know; but it is certain, that they ſuffered nothing from the want of the innumerable articles which we conſider, not as luxuries and conveniencies only, but the neceſſaries of life: as their deſires are few, they probably enjoy them all; and how much they may be gainers by an exemption from the care, labour and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude, which ariſe from a perpetual and unſucceſsful effort to gratify that infinite variety of deſires which the refinements of artificial life have produced among us, is not very eaſy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine: poſſibly this may counterbalance all the real diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of their ſituation in compariſon with ours, and make the ſcales by which good and evil are diſtributed to man, hang even between us.</p>
                        <p>In this place we ſaw no quadruped except ſeals, ſea-lions, and dogs; of the dogs it is remarkable that they bark, which thoſe that are originally bred in America do not. And this is a further proof, that the people we ſaw here had, either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately or remotely, communicated with the inhabitants of Europe. There are, however, other quadrupeds in this part of the country; for when Mr. Banks was at the top of the higheſt hill that he aſcended in his expedition through the woods, he ſaw the footſteps of a large beaſt imprinted upon the ſurface of a bog, though he could not with any probability gueſs of what kind it might be.</p>
                        <p>Of land-birds there are but few; Mr. Banks ſaw none larger than an Engliſh blackbird, except ſome hawks and a vulture; but of water-fowl there is great plenty, particularly ducks. Of fiſh we ſaw ſcarce any, and with our hooks could catch none that was fit to eat; but ſhell-fiſh, limpets, clams, and muſcles were to be found in abundance.</p>
                        <p>Among the inſects, which were not numerous, there was

neither gnat nor muſquito, nor any other ſpecies that was either hurtful or troubleſome, which perhaps is more than can be ſaid of any other uncleared country. During the ſnow-blaſts, which happened every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ants, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander found a vaſt variety; the far greater part wholly different from any that have been hitherto deſcribed. Beſides the birch, and winter's bark, which have been mentioned already, there is the beach, <hi>Fagus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarcticus,</hi> which as well as the birch, may be uſed for timber. The plants cannot be enumerated here; but as the ſcurvy-graſs, <hi>Cardamine antiſcorbutica,</hi> and the wild celery, <hi>Apium antarcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> probably contain antiſcorbutic qualities, which may be of great benefit to the crews of ſuch ſhips as ſhall hereafter touch at this place, the following ſhort deſcription is inſerted:</p>
                        <p>The ſcurvy-graſs will be found in plenty in damp places near ſprings of water, and in general in all places that lie near the beach, eſpecially at the watering-place in the Bay of Good Succeſs: when it is young, the ſtate of its greateſt perfection, it lies flat upon the ground, having many leaves of a bright green, ſtanding in pairs oppoſite to each other, with a ſingle one at the end, which generally makes the fifth upon a foot ſtalk: the plant, paſſing from this ſtate, ſhoots up in ſtalks that are ſometimes two feet high, at the top of which are ſmall white bloſſoms, and theſe are ſucceeded by long pods: the whole plant greatly reſembles that which in England is called Lady's ſmock, or Cuckow-flower. The wild celery is very like the celery in our gardens, the flowers are white, and ſtand in the ſame manner, in ſmall tufts at the top of the branches, but the leaves are of a deeper green. It grows in great abundance near the beach, and generally upon the ſoil that lies next above the ſpring tides. It may indeed eaſily be known by the taſte, which is between that of celery and parſley. We uſed the celery in large quantities, particularly in our ſoup, which, thus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, produced the ſame good effects which ſeamen generally derive from a vegetable diet, after having been long confined to ſalt proviſions.</p>
                        <p>On Sunday, the 22d of January, about two o'clock in the morning, having got our wood and water on board, we ſailed out of the Bay, and continued our courſe through the Streight.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. VI. A general Deſcription of the S. E. part of Terra del Fuego, and the Streight of Le Maire; with ſome Remarks on Lord Anſon's Account of them, and Directions for the Paſſage Weſtward, round this Part of America, into the South Seas.</head>
                        <p>ALMOST all writers who have mentioned the iſland of Terra del Fuego, deſcribe it as deſtitute of wood, and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013324_0066_0F904D85F28F8AE0"/>
covered with ſnow. In the winter it may poſſibly be covered with ſnow, and thoſe who ſaw it at that ſeaſon might perhaps be eaſily deceived, by its appearance, into an opinion that it was deſtitute of wood. Lord Anſon was there in the beginning of March, which anſwers to our September; and we were there the beginning of January, which anſwers to our July, which may account for the difference of his deſcription of it from ours. We fell in with it about twenty-one leagues to the weſtward of the Streight of Le Maire, and from the time that we firſt ſaw it, trees were plainly to be diſtinguiſhed with our glaſſes; and as we came nearer, though here and there we diſcovered patches of ſnow, the ſides of the hills and the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt appeared to be covered with a beautiful verdure. The hills are lofty, but not mountainous, though the ſummits of them are quite naked. The ſoil in the valleys is rich, and of a conſiderable depth; and at the foot of almoſt every hill there is a brook, the water of which has a reddiſh hue, like that which runs through our turf bogs in England, but it is by no means ill taſted, and upon the whole proved to be the beſt that we took in during our voyage. We ranged the coaſt to the Streight, and had ſoundings all the way from 40 to 20 fathom, upon a gravelly and ſandy bottom. The moſt remarkable land on Terra del Fuego is a hill, in the form of a ſugar-loaf, which ſtands on the weſt ſide not far from the ſea; and the three hills, called the three brothers, about nine miles to the weſtward of Cape St. Diego, the low point that forms the north entrance of the Streight of Le Maire.</p>
                        <p>It is ſaid in the account of Lord Anſon's voyage, that it is difficult to determine exactly where the Streight lies, though the appearance of Terra del Fuego be well known, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo the appearance of Staten Land; and that ſome navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators have been deceived by three hills on Staten Land, which have been miſtaken for the three brothers on Terra del Fuego, and ſo over-ſhot the Streight. But no ſhip can poſſibly miſs the Streight that coaſts Terra del Fuego within ſight of land, for it will then, of itſelf, be ſufficiently conſpicuous; and Staten Land, which forms the eaſt ſide, will be ſtill more manifeſtly diſtinguiſhed, for there is no land on Terra del Fuego like it. The Streight of Le Maire can be miſſed only by ſtanding too far to the eaſtward, without keeping the land of Terra del Fuego in ſight: if this is done, it may be miſſed, however ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately the appearance of the coaſt of Staten Land may have been exhibited; and if this is not done, it cannot be miſſed, though the appearance of that coaſt be not known. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Streight ſhould not be attempted but with a fair wind and moderate weather, and upon the very beginning of the tide of flood, which happens here, at the full and change of the moon, about one or two o'clock; it is alſo beſt to keep as near to the Terra del Fuego ſhore as the winds will admit.
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013324_0067_0F90F10616D3AC78"/>
By attending to theſe particulars, a ſhip may be got quite through the Streight in one tide; or, at leaſt, to the ſouthward of Succeſs Bay, into which it will be more prudent to put, if the wind ſhould be ſoutherly, than to attempt the weathering of Staten Land with a lee wind and a current, which may endanger her being driven on that iſland.</p>
                        <p>The Streight itſelf, which is bounded on the weſt by Terra del Fuego, and on the caſt by the weſt end of Staten Land, is about five leagues long, and as many broad. The Bay of Good Succeſs lies about the middle of it, on the Terra del Fuego ſide, and is diſcovered immediately upon entering the Streight from the northward; and the ſouth head of it may be diſtinguiſhed by a mark on the land, that has the appearance of a broad road, leading up from the ſea into the country: at the entrance it is half a league wide, and runs in weſtward about two miles and an half. There is good anchorage in every part of it, in from ten to ſeven fathom, clear ground; and it affords plenty of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good wood and water. The tides flow in the Bay, at the full and change of the moon, about four or five o'clock, and riſe about five or ſix feet perpendicular. But the flood runs two or three hours longer in the Streight than in the Bay; and the ebb, or northerly current, runs with near double the ſtrength of the flood.</p>
                        <p>In the appearance of Staten Land, we did not diſcover the wildneſs and horror that is aſcribed to it in the account of Lord Anſon's voyage. On the north ſide are the appearances of bays or harbours; and the land, when we ſaw it, was neither deſtitute of wood nor verdure, nor covered with ſnow. The iſland ſeems to be about twelve leagues in length, and five broad.</p>
                        <p>On the weſt ſide of the Cape of Good Succeſs, which forms the S. W. entrance of the Streight, lies Valentine's Bay, of which we only ſaw the entrance; from this bay the land trends away to the W. S. W. for twenty or thirty leagues; it appears to be high and mountainous, and forms ſeveral bays and inlets.</p>
                        <p>At the diſtance of fourteen leagues from the bay of Good Succeſs, in the direction of S.

At the diſtance of three leagues from Barnevelt's iſlands, in the direction of S. W. by S. lies the S. E. point of Hermit's iſlands: theſe iſlands lie S. E. and N. W. and are pretty high: from moſt points of view they will be taken for one iſland, or a part of the main.</p>

                        <p>The appearance of this Cape and Hermit's iſlands is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the chart of this coaſt, from our firſt making land to the Cape, which includes the Streight of Le Maire, and part of Staten Land. In this chart I have laid down no land, nor traced out any ſhore but what I ſaw myſelf, and thus far it may be depended upon: the bays and inlets, of which we ſaw only the openings, are not traced; it can, however, ſcarcely be doubted, but that moſt, if not all of them, afford anchorage, wood and water. The Dutch ſquadron, commanded by Hermit, certainly put into ſome of them in the year 1624; and it was Chapenham, the Vice Admiral of this ſquadron, who firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that the land of Cape Horn conſiſted of a number of iſlands. The account, however, which thoſe who ſailed in Hermit's fleet have given of theſe parts is extremely defective; and thoſe of Schouton and Le Maire are ſtill worſe: it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder that the charts hitherto publiſhed ſhould be erroneus, not only in laying down the land, but in the latitude and longitude of the places they contain. I will, however, venture to aſſert, that the longitude of few parts of the world is better aſcertained than that of the Streight of Le Maire, and Cape Horn, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The variation of the compaſs on this coaſt I found to be from 23° to 25° E. except near Barnevelt's iſlands and Cape Horn, where we found it leſs, and unſettled; probably it is diſturbed here by the land, as Hermit's ſquadron, in this very place found all their compaſſes differ from each other. The declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the dipping-needle, when ſet up on ſhore in Succeſs Bay, was 68° 15 below the horizon.</p>
                        <p>Between Streight Le Maire and Cape Horn, we found a current ſetting, generally very ſtrong, to the N. E. when we were in with the ſhore; but loſt it when we were at the diſtance of fifteen or twenty leagues.</p>
                        <p>On the 26th of January, we took our departure from Cape Horn, which lies in latitude 55° 53:S. longitude 68° 13:W. The fartheſt ſouthern latitude that we made was 60° 10:, our longitude was then 74° 30:W.; and we found the variation of the compaſs, by the mean of eighteen azimuths, to be 27° 9:E. As the weather was frequently calm, Mr. Banks went out in a ſmall boat to ſhoot birds, among which were ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batroſſes and ſheerwaters. The albatroſſes were obſerved to be larger than thoſe which had been taken northward of the Streight; one of them meaſured ten feet two inches from the tip of one wing to that of the other, when they were extended: the ſheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, on the contrary, is leſs, and darker coloured on the

                        <p>From a variety of obſervations which were made with great care, it appeared probable in the higheſt degree, that, from the time of our leaving the land to the 13th of February, when we were in latitude 49° 32:, and longitude <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>At this time we had advanced about 12° to the weſtward, and 3 and ½ to the northward of the Streight of Magellan: having been juſt three and thirty days in coming round the land of Torra del Fuego, or Cape Horn, from the eaſt entrance of the Streight to this ſituation. And though the doubling of Cape Horn is ſo much dreaded, that, in the general opinion, it is more eligible to paſs through the Streight of Magellan, we were not once brought under our cloſe reef'd topſails after we left the Streight of Le Maire. The Dolphin in her laſt voyage, which ſhe performed at the ſame ſeaſon of the year with ours, was three months in getting through the Streight of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellan, excluſive of the time that ſhe lay in Port Famine; and I am perſuaded, from the winds we had, that if we had come by that paſſage, we ſhould not at this time have been in theſe ſeas; that our people would have been fatigued, and our anchors, cables, ſails and rigging much damaged; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

But ſuppoſing it more eligible to go around the Cape, than through the Streight of Magellan; it may ſtill be queſtioned, whether it is better to go through the Streight of Le Maire, or ſtand to the eaſtward, and go round Staten Land. The advice given in the Account of Lord Anſon's voyage is, <q>That all ſhips bound to the South Seas, inſtead of paſſing through the Streight of Le Maire, ſhould conſtantly paſs to the eaſtward of Staten Land, and ſhould be invariably bent on running to the ſouthward as far as the latitude of 61 or 62 degrees, before they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſtand to the weſtward.</q> But, in my opinion, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent circumſtances may at one time render it eligible to paſs through the Streight, and to keep to the eaſtward of Staten Land at another. If the land is fallen in with to the weſtward of the Streight, and the wind is favourable for going through, I think it would be very injudicious to loſe time by going ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Sequel of the Paſſage from Cape Horn to the newly diſcovered Iſlands in the South Seas, with a Deſcription of their Figure and appearance; ſome Account of the Inhabitants, and ſeveral Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that happened during the Courſe, and at the Ship's Arrival among them.</head>
                        <p>ON the 1ſt of March, we were in latitude 38° 44 S. and longitude 110° 33 W. both by obſervation and by the log. This agreement, after a run of 660 leagues, was thought to be very extraordinary; and is a demonſtration, that after we left the land of Cape Horn we had no current that affected the ſhip. It renders it alſo highly probable, that we had been near no land of any conſiderable extent; for currents are always found when land is not remote, and ſometimes, particularly on the eaſt ſide of the continent in the North Sea, when land has been diſtant 100 leagues.</p>
                        <p>Many birds, as uſual, were conſtantly about the ſhip, ſo that Mr. Banks killed no leſs than 62 in one day; and what is more remarkable, be caught two foreſt flies, both of them of the ſame ſpecies, but different from any that have hitherto been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; theſe probably belonged to the birds, and came with them from the land, which we judged to be at a great diſtance. Mr. Banks alſo, about this time, found a large cuttle-fiſh, which had juſt been killed by the birds, floating in a mangled condition upon the water; it was very different from the cuttle-fiſhes that are found in the European ſeas; for its arms, inſtead of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>, were furniſhed with a double row of very ſharp
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013324_0071_0F90F108F9754A20"/>
talons, which reſembled thoſe of a cat, and, like them, were retractable into a ſheath of ſkin, from which they might be thruſt at pleaſure. Of this cuttle-fiſh we made one of the beſt ſoups we had ever taſted.</p>
                        <p>The albatroſſes now began to leave us, and after the 8th there was not one to be ſeen. We continued our courſe without any memorable event till the 24th, when ſome of the people who were upon the watch in the night, reported that they ſaw a log of wood paſs by the ſhip; and that the ſea, which was rather rough, became ſuddenly as ſmooth as a mill-pond. It was a general opinion, that there was land to windward; but I did not think myſelf at liberty to ſearch for what I was not ſure to find; though I judged we were not far from the iſlands that were diſcovered by Quiros in 1606. Our latitude was 22° 11. S. and longitude 127° 55 W.</p>
                        <p>On the 25th, about noon, one of the marines, a young fellow about twenty, was placed as centry at the cabbin door; while he was upon this duty, one of my ſervants was at the ſame place preparing to cut a piece of ſeal-ſkin into tobacco-pouches: he had promiſed one to ſeveral of the men, but had refuſed one to this young fellow, though he had aſked him ſeveral times; upon which he jocularly threatened to ſteal one, if it ſhould be in his power. It happened that the ſervant being called haſtily away, gave the ſkin in charge to the centinel, without regarding what had paſſed between them. The centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel immediately ſecured a piece of the ſkin, which the other miſſing at his return, grew angry; but ſome altercation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf with taking it away, declaring, that, for ſo trifling an affair, he would not complain of him to the officers. But it happened that one of his fellow ſoldiers, over-hearing the diſpute, came to the knowledge of what had happened, and told it to the reſt; who, taking it into their heads to ſtand up for the honour of their corps, reproached the offender with great bitterneſs, and reviled him in the moſt opprobrious terms; they exaggerated his offence into a crime of the deepeſt die; they ſaid it was a theft by a centry when he was upon duty, and of a thing that had been committed to his truſt; they declared it a diſgrace to aſſociate with him; and the Serjeant, in particular, ſaid that, if the perſon from whom the ſkin had been ſtolen would not complain, he would complain himſelf; for that his honour would ſuffer if the offender was not puniſhed. From the ſcoff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> and reproaches of theſe men of honour, the poor young fellow retired to his hammock in an agony of confuſion and ſhame. The Serjeant ſoon after went to him, and ordered him to follow him to the deck: he obeyed without reply; but it being in the duſk of the evening, he ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from the Serjeant and went forward: he was ſeen by ſome of the people, who thought he was gone to the head; but a ſearch being made for him afterwards, it was found that he
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013324_0072_0F90F109BB134698"/>
had thrown himſelf overboard; and I was then firſt made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the theft and its circumſtances.</p>
                        <p>The loſs of this man was the more regretted as he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably quiet and induſtrious, and as the very action that put an end to his life was a proof of an ingenuous mind; for to ſuch only diſgrace is inſupportable.</p>
                        <p>On Tueſday the 4th of April, about ten o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Mr. Banks's ſervant, Peter Briſcoe, diſcovered land, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouth, at the diſtance of about three or four leagues. I immediately hauled up for it, and found it to be an iſland of an oval form, with a lagoon in the middle, which occupied much the larger part of it; the border of land which circumſcribes the lagoon is in many places very low and narrow, particularly on the ſouth ſide, where it conſiſts principally of a beach or reef of rocks: it has the ſame appearance alſo in three places on the north ſide; ſo that, the firm land being disjoined, the whole looks like many iſlands covered with wood. On the weſt end of the iſland is a large tree, or clump of trees, that in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance reſembles a tower; and about the middle are two cocoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut trees, which riſe above all the reſt, and, as we came near to the iſland, appeared like a flag. We approached it on the north ſide, and though we came within a mile, we found no bottom with 130 fathom of line, nor did there appear to be any anchorage about it. The whole is covered with trees of different verdure, but we could diſtinguiſh none, even with our glaſſes, except cocoa-nuts and palm-nuts. We ſaw ſeveral of the natives upon the ſhore, and counted four and twenty. They appeared to be tall, and to have heads remarkably large; perhaps they had ſomething wound round them which we could not diſtinguiſh; they were of a copper colour, and had long black hair. Eleven of them walked along the beach abreaſt of the ſhip, with poles or pikes in their hands which reached twice as high as themſelves: while they walked on the beach they ſeemed to be naked; but ſoon after they retired, which they did as ſoon as the ſhip had paſſed the iſland, they covered themſelves with ſomething that made them appear of a light colour. Their habitations were under ſome clumps of palm-nut trees, which at a diſtance appeared like high ground; and to us, who for a long time had ſeen nothing but water and ſky, except the dreary hills of Terra del Fuego, theſe groves ſeemed a terreſtrial para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. To this ſpot, which lies in latitude 18° 47 S. and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude 139° 28 W. we gave the name of LAGOON ISLAND. The variation of the needle here is 2° 54 E.</p>
                        <p>About one o'clock we made ſail to the weſtward, and about half an hour after three we ſaw land again to the N. W. We got up with it at ſunſet, and it proved to be a low woody iſland, of a circular form, and not much above a mile in compaſs. We diſcovered no inhabitants, nor could we diſtinguiſh any
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013324_0073_0F90F10A97727CB8"/>
cocoa-nut trees, though we were within half a mile of the ſhore. The land, however, was covered with verdure of many hues. It lies in latitude 18° 35 S. and longitude 139° 48 W. and is diſtant from Lagoon Iſland, in the direction of N. 62 W. about ſeven leagues. We called it THRUMB-CAP. I diſcovered, by the appearance of the ſhore, that at this place it was low-water; and I had obſerved at Lagoon Iſland, that it was either high-water, or that the ſea neither ebbed nor flowed: I infer, therefore, that a S. by E. or S. moon makes high-water.</p>
                        <p>We went on with a fine trade-wind and pleaſant weather, and on the 5th, about three in the afternoon, we diſcovered land to the weſtward. It proved to be a low iſland, of much greater extent than either of thoſe that we had ſeen before, being about ten or twelve leagues in compaſs. Several of us remained at the maſt-head the whole evening, admiring its extraordinary figure: it was ſhaped exactly like a bow, the arch and cord of which were land, and the ſpace between them water; the cord was a flat beach, without any ſigns of vegetation, having nothing upon it but heaps of ſea weed, which lay in different ridges, as higher or low tides had left them. It appeared to be about three or four leagues long, and not more than two hundred yards wide; but as a horizontal plain is always ſeen in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective, and greatly fore-ſhortened, it is certainly much wider than it appeared: the horns, or extremities of the bow, were two large tufts of cocoa-nut trees; and much the greater part of the arch was covered with trees of different height, figure and hue; in ſome parts, however, it was naked and low like the cord: ſome of us thought they diſcovered openings through the cord, into the pool, or lake, that was included between that and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e bow; but whether there were or were not ſuch openings is uncertain. We ſailed abreaſt of the low beach, or bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, within leſs than a league of the ſhore, till ſunſet, and we then judged ourſelves to be about half way between the two horns: here we brought to, and ſounded, but found no bottom with one hundred and thirty fathom; and, as it is dark almoſt inſtantly after ſunſet in theſe latitudes, we ſuddenly loſt ſight of the land, and making ſail again, before the line was well hauled in, we ſteered by the ſound of the breakers, which were diſtinctly heard till we got clear of the coaſt.</p>
                        <p>We knew this iſland to be inhabited, by ſmoke which we ſaw in different parts of it, and we gave it the name of Bow ISLAND. Mr. Gore, my Second Lieutenant, ſaid, after we had ſailed by the iſland, that he had ſeen ſeveral of the natives, under the firſt clump of trees, from the deck; that he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed their houſes, and ſeen ſeveral canoes hauled up under the ſhade; but in this he was more fortunate than any other perſon on board. The eaſt end of this iſland, which from its figure we called the Bow, lies in latitude 18° 23 S. and longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013324_0074_0F90F10B33E825A0"/>
141° 12 W. we obſerved the variation of the compaſs to be 5° 38 E.</p>
                        <p>On the next day, Thurſday the 6th, about noon, we ſaw land again to the weſtward, and came up with it about three. It appeared to be two iſlands, or rather groups of iſlands, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from N. W. by N. to S. E. by S. about nine leagues. Of theſe, the two largeſt were ſeparated from each other by a channel of about half a mile broad, and were ſeverally ſurrounded by ſmaller iſlands, to which they were joined by reefs that lay under water.</p>
                        <p>Theſe iſlands were long narrow ſtrips of land, ranging in all directions, ſome of them ten miles or upwards in length, but none more than a quarter of a mile broad, and upon all of them there were trees of various kinds, particularly the cocoa-nut. The ſouth-eaſtermoſt of them lies in the latitude of 18° 12 S. and longitude 142° 42 W, and at the diſtance of twenty-five leagues, in the direction of W. ½ N. from the weſt end of Bow Iſland. We ranged along the S. W. ſide of this iſland, and hauled into a bay which lies to the N. W. of the ſouthermoſt point of the Group, where there was a ſmooth ſea, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of anchorage, without much ſurf on the ſhore. We ſounded, but we found no bottom with one hundred fathom, at the diſtance of no more than three quarters of a mile from the beach, and I did not think it prudent to go nearer.</p>
                        <p>While this was doing, ſeveral of the inhabitants aſſembled upon the ſhore, and ſome came out in their canoes as far as the reefs, but would not paſs them: when we ſaw this, we ranged, with an eaſy ſail, along the ſhore; but juſt as we were paſſing the end of the iſland, ſix men, who had for ſome time kept abreaſt of the ſhip, ſuddenly launched two canoes with great quickneſs and dexterity, and three of them getting into each, they put off, as we imagined with a deſign to come on board us; the ſhip therefore brought to, but they, like their fellows, ſtopped at the reef; we did not however immediately make ſail, as we obſerved two meſſengers diſpatched to them from the other canoes, which were of a much larger ſize: we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that theſe meſſengers made great expedition, wading and ſwimming along the reef; at length they met, and the men on board the canoes making no diſpoſitions to paſs the reef, after having received the meſſage, we judged that they had reſolved to come no farther: after waiting, therefore, ſome little time longer, we ſtood off; but when we were got about two or three miles from the ſhore, we perceived ſome of the natives follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in a canoe with a ſail; we did not, however, think it worth while to wait for her, and though ſhe had paſſed the reef, ſhe ſoon after gave over the chace.</p>
                        <p>According to the beſt judgment that we could form of the people when we were neareſt the ſhore, they were about our ſize,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013324_0075_0F90F10C1FB26528"/>
and well-made. They were of a brown complexion, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be naked; their hair, which was black, was confined by a fillet that went round the head, and ſtuck out behind like a buſh. The greater part of them carried in their hands two weapons; one of them was a ſlender pole, from ten to fourteen feet long, on one end of which was a ſmall knob, not unlike the point of a ſpear; the other was about four feet long, and ſhaped like a paddle, and poſſibly might be ſo, for ſome of their canoes were very ſmall: thoſe which we ſaw them launch ſeemed not intended to carry more than three men that got into them: we ſaw others that had on board ſix or ſeven men, and one of them hoiſted a ſail which did not ſeem to reach more than ſix feet above the gunwale of the boat, and which, upon the falling of a ſlight ſhower, was taken down and converted into an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or tilt. The canoe which followed us to ſea hoiſted a ſail not unlike an Engliſh lug-ſail, and almoſt as lofty as an Engliſh boat of the ſame ſize would have carried.</p>
                        <p>The people, who kept abreaſt of the ſhip on the beach, made many ſignals; but whether they were intended to frighten us away, or invite us on ſhore, it is not eaſy to determine: we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned them by waving our hats and ſhouting, and they replied by ſhouting again. We did not put their diſpoſition to the teſt, by attempting to land; becauſe, as the iſland was inconſiderable, and as we wanted nothing that it could afford, we thought it imprudent as well as cruel to riſk a conteſt, in which the natives muſt have ſuffered by our ſuperiority, merely to gratify an idle curioſity; eſpecially as we expected ſoon to fall in with the iſland where we had been directed to make our aſtronomical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, the inhabitants of which would probably admit us without oppoſition, as they were already acquainted with our ſtrength, and might alſo procure us a ready and peaceable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception among the neighbouring people, if we ſhould deſire it.</p>
                        <p>To theſe iſlands we gave the name of THE GROUPS.</p>
                        <p>On the 7th, about half an hour after ſix in the morning, being juſt at day-break, we diſcovered another iſland to the northward, which we judged to be about four miles in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. The land lay very low, and there was a piece of water in the middle of it; there ſeemed to be ſome wood upon it, and it looked green and pleaſant; but we ſaw neither cocoa trees nor inhabitants: it abounded however with birds, and we therefore gave it the name of BIRD-ISLAND.</p>
                        <p>It lies in latitude 17° 48 S. and longitude 143° 35 W. at the diſtance of ten leagues, in the direction W. ½ N. from the weſt end of the Groups. The variation here was 6° 32 E.</p>
                        <p>On the 8th, about two o'clock in the afternoon, we ſaw land to the northward, and about ſunſet came abreaſt of it, at about the diſtance of two leagues. It appeared to be a double range of low woody iſlands joined together by reefs, ſo as to form one
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013324_0076_0F904D8757908820"/>
iſland, in the form of an ellipſis or oval, with a lake in the middle of it. The ſmall iſlands and reefs that circumſcribe the lake have the appearance of a chain, and we therefore gave it the name of CHAIN ISLAND. Its length ſeemed to be about five leagues, in the direction of N. W. and S. E. and its breadth about five miles. The trees upon it appeared to be large, and we ſaw ſmoke riſing in different parts of it from among them, a certain ſign that it was inhabited. The middle of it lies in latitude 17° 23 S. and longitude 145° 54 W. and is diſtant from Bird Iſland forty-five leagues in the direction of W. by N. The variation here was, by ſeveral azimuths, found to be 4° 54 E.</p>
                        <p>On the 10th, having had a tempeſtuous night, with thunder and rain, the weather was hazy till about nine o'clock in the morning, when it cleared up, and we ſaw the iſland to which Captain Wallis, who firſt diſcovered it, gave the name of Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naburgh Iſland, called by the natives <hi>Maitea,</hi> bearing N. W. by W. diſtant about five leagues. It is a high round iſland, not above a league in circuit; in ſome parts it is covered with trees, and in others a naked rock. In this direction it looked like a high crown'd hat; but when it bears North, the top of it has more the appearance of the roof of a houſe. We made its latitude to be 17° 48 S. its longitude 148° 10 W. and its diſtance from Chain Iſland 44 leagues, in the direction of W. by S.</p>

Rules eſtabliſhed for Traffic with the Natives, and an Account of ſeveral Incidents which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in a Viſit to Tootahah and Toubourai Tamaida, two Chiefs.</head>
                        <p>ABOUT one o'clock, on Monday the 10th of April, ſome of the people who were looking out for the iſland to which we were bound, ſaid they ſaw land ahead, in that part of the horizon where it was expected to appear; but it was ſo faint that, whether there was land in ſight or not, remained a matter of diſpute till ſunſet. The next morning, however, at ſix o'clock, we were convinced that thoſe who ſaid they had diſcovered land, were not miſtaken; it appeared to be very high and mountainous, extending from W. by S. ½ S. to W. by N. ½ N. and we knew it to be the ſame that Captain Wallis had called King George the III.'s Iſland. We were delayed in our approach to it by light airs and calms, ſo that in the morning of the 12th we were but little nearer than we had been the night before; but about ſeven a breeze ſprung up, and before eleven ſeveral canoes were ſeen making towards the ſhip;
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:013324_0077_0F90F10CB2727978"/>
there were but few of them, however, that would come near; and the people in thoſe that did, could not be perſuaded to come on board. In every canoe there were young plantains, and branches of a tree which the Indians call <hi>E'Midho;</hi> theſe, as we afterwards learnt, were brought as tokens of peace and amity, and the people in one of the canoes handed them up the ſhip's ſide, making ſignals at the ſame time with great earneſtneſs, which we did not immediately underſtand; at length we gueſſed that they wiſhed theſe ſymbols ſhould be placed in ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous part of the ſhip; we, therefore, immediately ſtuck them among the rigging, at which they expreſſed the greateſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. We then purchaſed their cargoes, conſiſting of cocoa-nuts, and various kinds of fruit, which after our long voyage were very acceptable.</p>
                        <p>We ſtood on with an eaſy ſail all night, with ſoundings from 22 fathom to 12, and about ſeven o'clock in the morning we came to an anchor in 13 fathom, in Port-royal bay, called by the natives <hi>Matavai.</hi> We were immediately ſurrounded by the native in their canoes, who gave us cocoa-nuts, fruit reſembl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apples, bread-fruit, and ſome ſmall fiſhes, in exchange for beads and other trifles. They had with them a pig, which they would not part with for any thing but a hatchet, and therefore we refuſed to purchaſe it; becauſe, if we gave them a hatchet for a pig now, we knew they would never afterwards ſell one for leſs, and we could not afford to buy as many as it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable we ſhould want at that price. The bread-fruit grows on a tree that is about the ſize of a middling oak: its leaves are frequently a foot and an half long, of an oblong ſhape, deeply ſinuated like thoſe of the fig-tree, which they reſemble in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence and colour, and in the exuding of a white milky juice upon being broken. The fruit is about the ſize and ſhape of a child's head, and the ſurface is reticulated not much unlike a truffle: it is covered with a thin ſkin, and has a core about as big as the handle of a ſmall knife: the eatable part lies between the ſkin and the core; it is as white as ſnow, and ſomewhat of the conſiſtence of new bread: it muſt be roaſted before it is eaten, being firſt divided into three or four parts: its taſte is inſipid, with a ſlight ſweetneſs ſomewhat reſembling that of the crumb of wheaten-bread mixed with a Jeruſalem artichoke.</p>
                        <p>Among others who came off to the ſhip was an elderly man, whoſe name, as we learnt afterwards, was OWHAW, and who was immediately known to Mr. Gore, and ſeveral others who had been here with Captain Wallis; as I was informed that he had been very uſeful to them, I took him on board the ſhip with ſome others, and was particularly attentive to gratify him, as I hoped he might alſo be uſeful to us.</p>
                        <p>As our ſtay here was not likely to be very ſhort, and as it was neceſſary that the merchandiſe which we had brought for traffic
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:013324_0078_0F90F10E25CEA660"/>
with the natives ſhould not diminiſh in its value, which it would certainly have done, if every perſon had been left at liberty to give what he pleaſed for ſuch things as he ſhould purchaſe; at the ſame time that confuſion and quarrels muſt neceſſarily have ariſen from there being no ſtandard at market: I drew up the following rules, and ordered that they ſhould be punctually obſerved.</p>

                                    <p>I. To endeavour, by every fair means, to cultivate a friendſhip with the natives; and to treat them will all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable humanity.</p>

                        <p>As ſoon as the ſhip was properly ſecured, I went on ſhore with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, a party of men under arms, and our friend Owhaw. We were received from the boat by ſome hundreds of the inhabitants, whoſe looks at leaſt gave us welcome, though they were ſtruck with ſuch awe, that the firſt who approached us crouched ſo low that he almoſt crept upon his hands and knees. It is remarkable that he, like the people in the canoes, preſented to us the ſame ſymbol of peace that is known to have been in uſe among the ancient and mighty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the northern hemiſphere, the green branch of a tree. We received it with looks and geſtures of kindneſs and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and obſerving that each of them held one in his hand, we immediately gathered every one a bough, and carried it in our hands in the ſame manner.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="52" facs="unknown:013324_0079_0F90F10E4A411388"/>
They marched with us about half a mile towards the place where the Dolphin had watered, conducted by Owhaw; they then made a full ſtop, and having laid the ground bare, by clearing away all the plants that grew upon it, the principal perſons among them threw their green branches upon the naked ſpot, and made ſigns that we ſhould do the ſame: we immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſhowed our readineſs to comply, and to give a greater ſolemnity to the rite, the marines were drawn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, and when we came to the watering-place it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> to us by ſigns, that we might occupy that ground, but it happened not to be fit for our purpoſe. During our walk they had ſhaken off their firſt timid ſenſe of our ſuperiority, and were become familiar: they went with us from the watering-place and took a circuit through the woods: as we went along, we diſtributed beads and other ſmall preſents among them, and had the ſatisfaction to ſee that they were much gratified. Our circuit was not leſs than four or five miles, through groves of trees, which were loaded with cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit, and afforded the moſt grateful ſhade. Under theſe trees were the habitations of the people, moſt of them being only a roof without walls, and the whole ſcene realized the poetical fables of Arcadia. We remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed however, not without ſome regret, that in all our walk we had ſeen only two hogs, and not a ſingle fowl. Thoſe of our company who had been here with the Dolphin told us, that none of the people whom we had yet ſeen were of the firſt claſs; they ſuſpected that the chiefs had removed, and upon carrying us to the place where what they called the Queen's palace had ſtood, we found that no traces of it were left. We determined therefore to return in the morning, and endeavour to find out the <hi>Nobleſſe</hi> in their retreats.</p>
                        <p>In the morning, however, before we could leave the ſhip, ſeveral canoes came about us, moſt of them from the weſtward, and two of them were filled with people, who by their dreſs and deportment appeared to be of a ſuperior rank: two of theſe came on board, and each ſingled out his friend; one of them, whoſe name we found to be MATAHAH, fixed upon Mr. Banks, and the other upon me: this ceremony conſiſted in taking off great part of their clothes and putting them upon us. In return for this, we preſented each of them with a hatchet and ſome beads. Soon after they made ſigns for us to go with them to the places where they lived, pointing to the S. W.; and as I was deſirous of finding a more commodious harbour, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther trial of the diſpoſition of the people, I conſented.</p>
                        <p>I ordered out two boats, and with Mr. Banks and Dr. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander, the other Gentlemen, and our two Indian friends, we embarked for our expedition. After rowing about a league,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:013324_0080_0F904D8775B173F0"/>
they made ſigns that we ſhould go on ſhore, and gave us to underſtand that this was the place of their reſidence. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly landed, among ſeveral hundreds of the natives, who conducted us into a houſe of much greater length than any we had ſeen. When we entered, we ſaw a middle-aged man, whoſe name we afterwards diſcovered to be TOOTAHAH; mats were immediately ſpread, and we were deſired to ſit down over againſt him. Soon after we were ſeated, he ordered a cock and hen to be brought out, which he preſented to Mr. Banks and me; we accepted the preſent, and in a ſhort time each of us received a piece of cloth, perfumed after their manner, by no means diſagreeably, which they took great pains to make us remark. The piece preſented to Mr. Banks was eleven yards long and two wide; in return for which, he gave a laced ſilk neckcloth, which he happened to have on, and a linen pocket handkerchief: Tootahah immediately dreſſed himſelf in this new finery, with an air of perfect complacency and ſatisfaction. But it is now time that I ſhould take ſome notice of the ladies.</p>
                        <p>Soon after the interchanging of our preſents with Tootahah, they attended us to ſeveral large houſes, in which we walked about with great freedom; they ſhewed us all the civility of which, in our ſituation, we could accept; and, on their part, ſeemed to have no ſcruple that would have prevented its being carried farther. The houſes, which as I have obſerved before, are all open, except a roof, afforded no place of retirement; but the ladies, by frequently pointing to the mats upon the ground, and ſometimes ſeating themſelves and drawing us down upon them, left us no room to doubt of their being much leſs jealous of obſervation than we were.</p>
                        <p>We now took leave of our friendly Chief, and directed our courſe along the ſhore; when we had walked about a mile, we met, at the head of a great number of people, another Chief, whoſe name was TUBOURAI TAMAIDE, with whom we were alſo to ratify a treaty of peace, with the ceremony of which we were now become better acquainted. Having received the branch which he preſented to us, and given another in return, we laid down our hands upon our left breaſts, and pronounced the word <hi>Taio,</hi> which we ſuppoſed to ſignify friend; the Chief then gave us to underſtand, that if we choſe to eat, he had victuals ready for us. We accepted his offer, and dined very heartily upon fiſh, bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts and plantains, dreſſed after their manner; they eat ſome of their fiſh raw, and raw fiſh was offered to us, but we declined that part of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
                        <p>During this viſit a wife of our noble hoſt, whoſe name was TOMIO, did Mr. Banks the honour to place herſelf upon the ſame mat, cloſe by him. Tomio was not in the firſt bloom of her youth, nor did ſhe appear to have been ever remarkable for
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:013324_0081_0F904D88DCC259B8"/>
her beauty: he did not therefore, I believe, pay her the moſt flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering attention: it happened too, as a farther mortification to this lady, that ſeeing a very pretty girl among the crowd, he, not adverting to the dignity of his companion, beckoned her to come to him: the girl, after ſome entreaty, complied and ſat down on the other ſide of him; he loaded her with beads, and every ſhowy trifle that would pleaſe her: his Princeſs, though ſhe was ſomewhat mortified at the preference that was given to her rival, did not diſcontinue her civilities, but ſtill aſſiduouſly ſupplied him with the milk of the cocoa-nut, and ſuch other dainties as were in her reach. This ſcene might poſſibly have become more curious and intereſting, if it had not been ſuddenly interrupted by an interlude of a more ſerious kind. Juſt at this time, Dr. Solander and Mr. Monkhouſe complained that their pockets had been picked. Dr. Solander had loſt an opera glaſs in a ſhagreen caſe, and Mr. Monkhouſe his ſnuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box. This incident unfortunately put an end to the good-humour of the company. Complaint of the injury was made to the Chief; and, to give it weight, Mr. Banks ſtarted up, and haſtily ſtruck the but end of his firelock upon the ground: this action, and the noiſe that accompanied it, ſtruck the whole aſſembly with a panic, and every one of the natives ran out of the houſe with the utmoſt precipitation, except the Chief, three women, and two or three others, who appeared by their dreſs to be of a ſuperior rank.</p>
                        <p>The Chief, with a mixture of confuſion and concern, took Mr. Banks by the hand, and led him to a large quantity of cloth, which lay at the other end of the houſe: this he offered to him piece by piece, intimating by ſigns, that if that would atone for the wrong which had been done, he might take any part of it, or, if he pleaſed, the whole. Mr. Banks put it by, and gave him to underſtand, that he wanted nothing but what had been diſhoneſtly taken away. Toubourai Tamaide then went haſtily out, leaving Mr. Banks with his wife Tomio, who during the whole ſcene of terror and confuſion had kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly at his ſide, and intimating his deſire that he ſhould wait there till his return. Mr. Banks accordingly ſat down, and converſed with her, as well as he could be ſigns, about half an hour. The chief then came back with the ſnuff-box and the caſe of the opera glaſs in his hand, and, with a joy in his countenance that was painted with a ſtrength of expreſſion which diſtinguiſhes theſe people from all others, delivered them to the owners. The caſe of the opera glaſs, however, upon being opened, was found to be empty; upon this diſcovery his countenance changed in a moment; and catching Mr. Banks again by the hand, he ruſhed out of the houſe, without uttering any ſound, and led him along the ſhore, walking with great rapidity: when they had got about a mile from the houſe, a woman met him and gave him a piece of cloth, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

haſtily took from her, and continued to preſs forward with it in his hand. Dr. Solander and Mr. Monkhouſe had followed them, and they came at length to a houſe where they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by a woman, to whom he gave the cloth, and intimated to the gentlemen that they ſhould give her ſome beads. They immediately complied; and the beads and cloth being depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited upon the floor, the woman went out, and in about half an hour returned with the opera glaſs, expreſſing the ſame joy upon the occaſion that had before been expreſſed by the Chief. The beads were now returned, with an inflexible reſolution not to accept them; and the cloth was, with the ſame pertinacity, forced upon Dr. Solander, as a recompence for the injury that had been done him. He could not avoid accepting the cloth, but inſiſted in his turn upon giving a new preſent of beads to the woman. It will not perhaps be eaſy to account for all the ſteps that were taken in the recovery of this glaſs and ſnuff-box; but this cannot be thought ſtrange, conſidering that the ſcene of action was among a people whoſe language, policy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections are even now but imperfectly known; upon the whole, however, they ſhow an intelligence and influence which would do honour to any ſyſtem of government, however regular and improved. In the evening, about ſix o'clock, we returned to the ſhip.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. IX. A Place fixed upon for an Obſervatory and Fort: an Excurſion into the Woods, and its Conſequences. The Fort erected: a Viſit from ſeveral Chiefs on board and at the Fort, with ſome Account of the Muſic of the Natives, and the Manner in which they diſpoſe of their Dead.</head>
                        <p>ON the next morning, Saturday the 15th, ſeveral of the Chiefs whom we had ſeen the day before, came on board, and brought with them, hogs, bread-fruit, and other refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for which we gave them hatchets and linen, and ſuch things as ſeemed to be moſt acceptable.</p>
                        <p>As in my excurſion to the weſtward, I had not found any more convenient harbour than that in which we lay, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to go on ſhore and fix upon ſome ſpot, commanded by the ſhip's guns, where I might throw up a ſmall fort for our defence, and prepare for making our aſtronomical obſervation.</p>
                        <p>I therefore took a party of men, and landed without delay, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and the aſtronomer, Mr. Green. We ſoon fixed upon a part of the ſandy beach, on the N. E. point of the bay, which was in every reſpect conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for our purpoſe, and not near any habitation of the natives. Having marked out the ground that we intended to occupy, a
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:013324_0083_0F90F10F31338138"/>
ſmall tent belonging to Mr. Banks was ſet up, which had been brought on ſhore for that purpoſe: by this time a great number of the people had gathered about us; but, as it appeared, only to look on, there not being a ſingle weapon of any kind among them. I intimated, however, that none of them were to come within the line I had drawn, except one who appeared to be a chief, and Owhaw. To theſe two perſons I addreſſed myſelf by ſigns, and endeavoured to make them underſtand, that we wanted the ground which we had marked out to ſleep upon for a certain number of nights, and that then we ſhould go away. Whether I was underſtood I cannot certainly determine; but the people behaved with a deference and reſpect that at once pleaſed and ſurpriſed us: they ſat down peaceably without the circle, and looked on, without giving us any interruption, till we had done, which was upwards of two hours. As we had ſeen no poultry, and but two hogs, in our walk when we were laſt on ſhore at this place, we ſuſpected that, upon our arrival, they had been driven farther up the country; and the rather, as Owhaw was very importunate with us, by ſigns, not to go into the woods, which, however, and partly for theſe reaſons, we were determined to do. Having therefore appointed the thirteen marines and a petty officer to guard the tent, we ſet out, and a great number of the natives joined our party. As we were croſſing a little river that lay in our way we ſaw ſome ducks, and Mr. Banks, as ſoon as he had got over, fired at them, and happened to kill three at one ſhot: this ſtruck them with the utmoſt terror, ſo that moſt of them fell ſuddenly to the ground, as if they alſo had been ſhot at the ſame diſcharge: it was not long, however, before they recovered from their fright, and we continued our rout; but we had not gone far before we were alarmed by the report of two pieces, which were fired by the guard at the tent. We had then ſtraggled a little diſtance from each other, but Owhaw immediately called us together, and by waving his hand, ſent away every Indian who followed us except three, each of whom, as a pledge of peace on their part, and an entreaty that there might be peace on ours, haſtily broke a branch from the trees, and came to us with it in their hands. As we had too much reaſon to fear that ſome miſchief had happened, we haſted back to the tent, which was not diſtant above half a mile, and when we came up, we found it entirely deſerted, except by our own people.</p>
                        <p>It appeared, that one of the Indians who remained about the tent after we left it, had watched his opportunity, and, taking the century unawares, had ſnatched away his muſquet. Upon this, the petty officer, a midſhipman, who commanded the party, perhaps from a ſudden fear of farther violence, perhaps from the natural petulance of power newly acquired, and perhaps from a brutality in his nature, ordered the marines to
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:013324_0084_0F90F10FDA1BB740"/>
fire: the men, with as little conſideration or humanity as the officer, immediately diſcharged their pieces among the thickeſt of the flying crowd, conſiſting of more than a hundred; and obſerving that the thief did not fall, purſued him, and ſhot him dead. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> afterwards learnt, that none of the others were either killed or wounded.</p>
                        <p>Owhaw, who had never left us, obſerving that we were now totally deſerted, got together a few of thoſe who had fled, though not without ſome difficulty, and ranged them about us: we endeavoured to juſtify our people as well as we could, and to convince the Indians that if they did no wrong to us, we ſhould do no wrong to them: they went away without any appearance of diſtruſt or reſentment: and having ſtruck our tent, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the ſhip, but by no means ſatisfied with the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the day.</p>
                        <p>Upon queſtioning our people more particularly, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct they ſoon perceived we could not approve, they alledged that the centinel whoſe muſquet was taken away, was violently aſſaulted and thrown down, and that a puſh was afterwards made at him by the man who took the muſquet, before any command was given to fire. It was alſo ſuggeſted, that Owhaw had ſuſpicions, atleaſt, if not certain knowledge, that ſomething would be attempted againſt our people at the tent, which made him ſo very earneſt in his endeavours to prevent our leaving it; others imputed his importunity to his deſire that we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine ourſelves to the beach: and it was remarked that neither Owhaw, nor the Chiefs who remained with us after he had ſent the reſt of the people away, would have inferred the breach of peace from the firing at the tent, if they had no reaſon to ſuſpect that ſome injury had been offered by their countrymen; eſpecially as Mr. Banks had juſt fired at the ducks: and yet that they did infer a breach of peace from that incident, as was manifeſt from their waving their hands for the people to diſperſe, and inſtantly pulling green branches from the trees. But what were the real circumſtances of this unhappy affair, and whether either and which of theſe conjectures were true, can never cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be known.</p>
                        <p>The next morning but few of the natives were ſeen upon the beach, and not one of them came off to the ſhip. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced us that our endeavours to quiet their apprehenſions had not been effectual; and we remarked with particular regret, that we were deſerted even by Owhaw, who had hitherto been ſo conſtant in his attachment, and ſo active in renewing the peace that had been broken.</p>
                        <p>Appearances being thus unfavourable, I warped the ſhip nearer to the ſhore, and moored her in ſuch a manner as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all the N. E. part of the bay, particularly the place which I had marked out for the building a fort. In the evening,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:013324_0085_0F904D89B0046F48"/>
however, I went on ſhore with only a boat's crew, and ſome of the Gentlemen: the natives gathered about us, but not in the ſame number as before; there were I believe between thirty and forty, and they trafficked with us for cocoa-nuts and other fruit, to all appearance as friendly as ever.</p>
                        <p>On the 17th, early in the morning, we had the misfortune to loſe Mr. Buchan, the perſon whom Mr. Banks had brought out as a painter of landſcapes and figures. He was a ſober, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and ingenious young man, and greatly regretted by Mr. Banks; who hoped, by his means, to have gratified his friends in England with repreſentations of this country and its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, which no other perſon on board could delineate with the ſame accuracy and elegance. He had always been ſubject to epileptic fits, one of which ſeized him on the mountains of Terra del Fuego, and this diſorder being aggravated by a bilious complaint which he contracted on board the ſhip, at length put an end to his life. It was at firſt propoſed to bury him on ſhore, but Mr. Banks thinking that it might perhaps give offence to the natives, with whoſe cuſtoms we were then wholly unacquainted, we committed his body to the ſea, with as much decency and ſolemnity as our circumſtances and ſituation would admit.</p>
                        <p>In the forenoon of this day we received a viſit from Tubourai Tamaide and Tootahah, our Chiefs, from the Weſt: they brought with them, as emblems of peace, not branches of plantain, but two young trees, and would not venture on board till theſe had been received, having probably been alarmed by the miſchief which had been done at the tent. Each of them alſo brought, as propitiatory gifts, ſome bread fruit, and a hog ready dreſſed: this was a moſt acceptable preſent, as we perceived that hogs were not always to be got; and in return we gave to each of our noble benefactors a hatchet and a nail. In the evening we went on ſhore and ſet up a tent, in which Mr. Green and myſelf ſpent the night, in order to obſerve an eclipſe of the firſt ſatellite of Jupiter; but the weather becoming cloudy, we were diſappointed.</p>
                        <p>On the 18th, at day-break, I went on ſhore, with as many people as could poſſibly be ſpared from the ſhip, and began to erect our fort. While ſome where employed in throwing up intrenchments, others were buſy in cutting pickets and faſcines, which the natives, who ſoon gathered round us as they had been uſed to do, were ſo far from hindering, that many of them voluntarily aſſiſted us, bringing the pickets and faſcines from the wood where they had been cut, with great alacrity: we had indeed been ſo ſcrupulous of invading their property, that we purchaſed every ſtake which was uſed upon this occaſion, and cut down no tree till we had firſt obtained their conſent. The ſoil where we conſtructed our fort was ſandy, and this
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:013324_0086_0F904D8A7A178948"/>
made it neceſſary to ſtrengthen the intrenchments with wood; three ſides were to be fortified in this manner; the fourth was bounded by a river, upon the banks of which I propoſed to place a proper number of water-caſks. This day we ſerved pork to the ſhip's company for the firſt time, and the Indians brought down ſo much bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts, that we found it neceſſary to ſend away part of them unbought, and to acquaint them, by ſigns, that we ſhould want no more for two days to come. Every thing was purchaſed this day with beads: a ſingle bead, as big as a pea, being the purchaſe of five or ſix cocoa-nuts, and as many of the bread-fruit. Mr. Banks's tent was got up before night within the works, and he ſlept on ſhore for the firſt time. Proper centries were placed round it, but no Indian attempted to approach it the whole night.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, our friend Tubourai Tamaide made Mr. Banks a viſit at the tent, and brought with him not only his wife and family, but the roof of a houſe, and ſeveral materials for ſetting it up, with furniture and implements of various kinds, intending, as we underſtood him, to take up his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our neighbourhood: this inſtance of confidence and good-will gave us great pleaſure, and we determined to ſtrengthen his attachment to us by every means in our power. Soon after his arrival, he took Mr. Banks by the hand, and leading him out of the line, ſignified that he ſhould accompany him into the woods. Mr. Banks readily conſented, and having walked with him about a quarter of a mile, they arrived at a kind of awning which he had already ſet up, and which ſeemed to be his occaſional habitation. Here he unfolded a bundle of his country cloth, and taking out two garments, one of red cloth, and the other of very neat matting, he clothed Mr. Banks in them, and without any other ceremony, immediately conducted him back to the tent. His attendants ſoon after brought him ſome pork and bread-fruit, which he eat, dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his meat into ſalt water inſtead of ſauce: after his meal he retired to Mr. Banks's bed, and ſlept about an hour. In the afternoon, his wife Tomio brought to the tent a young man about two and twenty years of age, of a very comely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, whom they both ſeemed to acknowledge as their ſon, though we afterwards diſcovered that he was not ſo. In the evening, this young man and another Chief, who had alſo paid us a viſit, went away to the weſtward, but Tubourai Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide and his wife returned to the awning in the ſkirts of the wood.</p>
                        <p>Our Surgeon, Mr. Monkhouſe, having walked out this evening, reported, that he had ſeen the body of the man who had been ſhot at the tents, which he ſaid was wrapped in cloth, and placed on a kind of bier, ſupported by ſtakes, under a roof
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:013324_0087_0F90F110842D9098"/>
that ſeemed to have been ſet up for the purpoſe: that near it were depoſited ſome inſtruments of war, and other things, which he would particularly have examined but for the ſtench of the body, which was intolerable. He ſaid, that he ſaw alſo two more ſheds of the ſame kind, in one of which were the bones of a human body that had lain till they were quite dry. We diſcovered afterwards, that this was the way in which they uſually diſpoſed of their dead.</p>
                        <p>A kind of market now began to be kept juſt without the lines, and was plentifully ſupplied with every thing but pork. Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourai Tamaide was our conſtant gueſt, imitating our manners, even to the uſing of a k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ife and fork, which he did very handily.</p>
                        <p>As my curioſity was excited by Mr. Monkhouſe's account of the ſituation of the man who had been ſhot, I took an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to go with ſome others to ſee it. I found the ſhed under which his body lay, cloſe by the houſe in which he reſided when he was alive, ſome others being not more than ten yards diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; it was about 15 feet long, and 11 broad, and of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable height: one end was wholly open, and the other end, and the two ſides, were partly encloſed with a kind of wicker work. The bier on which the corps was depoſited, was a frame of wood like that in which the ſea beds, called cots, are placed, with a matted bottom, and ſupported by four poſts, at the height of about five feet from the ground. The body was covered firſt with a mat, and then with white cloth; by the ſide of it lay a wooden mace, one of their weapons of war, and near the head of it, which lay next to the cloſe end of the ſhed, lay two cocoa nut-ſhells, ſuch as are ſometimes uſed to carry water in; at the other end a bunch of green leaves, with ſome dried twigs, all tied together, were ſtuck in the ground, by which lay a ſtone about as big as a cocoa-nut: near theſe lay one of the young plantain trees, which are uſed for emblems of peace, and cloſe by it a ſtone ax. At the open end of the ſhed alſo hung, in ſeveral ſtrings, a great number of palm-nuts, and without the ſhed, was ſtuck upright in the ground, the ſtem of a plantain tree about five feet high, upon the top of which was placed a cocoa nut-ſhell full of freſh water: againſt the ſide of one of the poſts hung a ſmall bag, containing a few pieces of bread-fruit ready roaſted, which were not all put in at the ſame time, for ſome of them were freſh, and others ſtale. I took notice that ſeveral of the natives obſerved us with a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſolicitude and jealouſy in their countenances, and by their geſtures expreſſed uneaſineſs when we went near the body, ſtanding themſelves at a little diſtance while we were making our examination, and appearing to be pleaſed when we came away.</p>
                        <p>Our reſidence on ſhore would by no means have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable if we had not been inceſſantly tormented by the flies,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:013324_0088_0F90F1113AFC2C88"/>
which, among other miſchief, made it almoſt impoſſible for Mr. Parkinſon, Mr. Banks's natural hiſtory painter, to work; for they not only covered his ſubject ſo as that no part of its ſurface could be ſeen, but even eat the colour off the paper as faſt as he could lay it on. We had recourſe to mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>quito nets and fly-traps, which, though they made the inconvenience tolerable, were very far from removing it.</p>
                        <p>On the 22d, Tootahah gave us a ſpecimen of the muſic of this country; four perſons performed upon flutes which had only two ſtops, and therefore could not ſound more than four notes, by half tones: they were ſounded like our German flutes, except that the performer, inſtead of applying it to his mouth, blew into it with one noſtril, while he ſtopped the other with his thumb: to theſe inſtruments four other perſons ſung, and kept very good time; but only one tune was played during the whole concert.</p>
                        <p>Several of the natives brought us axes, which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from on board the Dolphin, to grind and repair; but among others, there was one which became the ſubject of much ſpeculation, as it appeared to be French: after much enquiry, we learnt that a ſhip had been here between our arrival and the departure of the Dolphin, which we then conjectured to have been a Spaniard, but now know to have been the Boudeuſe, commanded by M. Bougainville.</p>

                        <p>ON the 24th, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander examined the country for ſeveral miles along the ſhore to the eaſtward: for about two miles it was flat and fertile; after that the hills ſtretched quite to the water's edge, and a little farther ran out into the ſea ſo that they were obliged to climb over them. Theſe hills, which were barren, continued for about three miles more, and then terminated in a large plain, which was full of good houſes, and people who appeared to live in great affluence. In this place there was a river, much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable than that at our fort, which iſſued from a deep and beautiful valley, and, where our travellers croſſed it, though at ſome diſtance from the ſea, was near one hundred yards wide. About a mile beyond this river the country became again barren, the rocks every where projecting into the ſea, for which
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:013324_0089_0F90F112001B8EB0"/>
ſeaſon they reſolved to return. Juſt as they had formed this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, one of the natives offered them refreſhment, which they accepted. They found this man to be of a kind that has been deſcribed by various authors, as mixed with many nations, but diſtinct from them all. His ſkin was of a dead white, without the leaſt appearance of what is called complexion, though ſome parts of his body were in a ſmall degree leſs white than others: his hair, eye-brows, and beard as white as his ſkin; his eyes appeared as if they were bloodſhot, and he ſeemed to be very ſhort-ſighted.</p>
                        <p>At their return they were met by Tubourai Tamaide, and his women, who, at ſeeing them, felt a joy which not being able to expreſs, they burſt into tears, and wept ſome time before their paſſion could be reſtrained.</p>
                        <p>This evening Dr. Solander lent his knife to one of theſe women, who neglected to return it, and the next morning Mr. Banks's alſo was miſſing; upon this occaſion I muſt bear my teſtimony, that the people of this country, of all ranks, men and women, are the erranteſt thieves upon the face of the earth: the very day after we arrived here, when they came on board us, the chiefs were employed in ſtealing what they could in the cabbin, and their dependants were no leſs induſtrious in other parts of the ſhip; they ſnatched up every thing that it was poſſible for them to ſecrete till they got on ſhore, even to the glaſs ports, two of which they carried off undetected. Tubourai Tamaide was the only one except Tootahah who had not been found guilty, and the preſumption, ariſing from this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that he was exempt from a vice, of which the whole nation beſides were guilty, cannot be ſuppoſed to outweigh ſtrong appearances to the contrary, Mr. Banks therefore, though not without ſome reluctance, accuſed him of having ſtolen his knife: he ſolemnly and ſteadily denied that he knew any thing of it; upon which Mr. Banks made him underſtand, that whoever had taken it, he was determined to have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned: upon this reſolute declaration, one of the natives who was preſent, produced a rag in which three knives were very carefully tied up. One was that which Dr. Solander had lent to the woman, another was a table knife belonging to me, and the owner of the third was not known. With theſe the chief immediately ſet out, in order to make reſtitution of them to their owners at the tents. Mr. Banks remained with the women, who expreſſed great apprehenſions that ſome miſchief was deſigned againſt their lord. When he came to the tents he reſtored one of the knives to Dr. Solander and another to me, the third not being owned, and then began to ſearch for Mr. Banks's in all the places where he had ever ſeen it. After ſome time, one of Mr. Banks's ſervants, underſtanding what he was about immediately fetched his maſter's knife, which
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:013324_0090_0F90F112C2734220"/>
it ſeems he had laid by the day before, and till now knew nothing of its having been miſſed. Tubourai Tamaide, upon this demonſtration of his innocence, expreſſed the ſtrongeſt emotions of mind, both in his looks and geſtures; the tears ſtarted from his eyes, and he made ſigns, with the knife, that, if he was ever guilty of ſuch an action as had been imputed to him, he would ſubmit to have his throat cut. He then ruſhed out of the lines, and returned haſtily to Mr. Banks, with a countenance that ſeverely reproached him with his ſuſpicions. Mr. Banks ſoon underſtood that the knife had been received from his ſervant, and was ſcarcely leſs affected at what had happened than the Chief; he felt himſelf to be the guilty perſon and was very deſirous to atone for his fault. The poor Indian, however violent his paſſions, was a ſtranger to ſullen reſentment; and upon Mr. Banks's ſpending a little time familiary with him, and making him a few trifling preſents, he forgot the wrong that had been done him, and was perfectly reconciled.</p>
                        <p>Upon this occaſion it may be obſerved, that theſe people have a knowledge of right and wrong from the mere dictates of natural conſcience; and involuntarily condemn themſelves when they do that to others, which they would condemn others for doing to them. That Tubourai Tamaide felt the force of moral obligation, is certain; for the imputation of an action which he conſidered as indifferent, would not, when it appeared to be groundleſs, have moved him with ſuch exceſs of paſſion. We muſt indeed eſtimate the virtue of theſe people, by the only ſtandard of morality, the conformity of their conduct to what in their opinion is right; but we muſt not haſtily conclude that theft is a teſtimony of the ſame depravity in them that it is in us, in the inſtances in which our people were ſufferers by their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty; for their temptation was ſuch, as to ſurmount would be conſidered as a proof of uncommon integrity among thoſe who have more knowledge, better principles, and ſtronger mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to reſiſt the temptations of illicit advantage: an Indian among penny knives, and beads, or even nails and broken glaſs, is in the ſame ſtate of trial with the meaneſt ſervant in Europe among unlocked coffers of jewels and gold.</p>
                        <p>On the 26th, I mounted ſix ſwivel guns upon the fort, which I was ſorry to ſee ſtruck the natives with dread: ſome fiſhermen who lived upon the point removed farther off, and Owhaw told us, by ſigns, that in four days we ſhould ſire great guns.</p>
                        <p>On the 27th, Tubourai Tamaide, with a friend, who eat with a voracity that I never ſaw before, and the three women that uſually attended him, whoſe names were TERAPO, TIRAO, and OMIE, dined at the fort: in the evening they took their leave, and ſet out for the houſe which Tubourai Tamaide had ſet up in the ſkirts of the wood; but in leſs than a quarter of an hour he returned in great emotion, and haſtily ſeizing Mr.
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:013324_0091_0F90F11507DF5D98"/>
Banks's arm, made ſigns that he ſhould follow him. Mr. Banks immediately complied, and they ſoon came up to a place where they found the ſhip's butcher, with a reaping-hook in his hand: here the Chief ſtopped, and, in a tranſport of rage which rendered his ſigns ſcarcely intelligible, intimated that the butcher had threatened, or attempted, to cut his wife's throat with the reaping-hook. Mr. Banks then ſignified to him, that if he could fully explain the offence, the man ſhould be puniſhed. Upon this he became more calm, and made Mr. Banks underſtand that the offender, having taken a fancy to a ſtone hatchet which lay in his houſe, had offered to purchaſe it of his wife for a nail: that ſhe having refuſed to part with it upon any terms, he had catched it up, and throwing down the nail, threatened to cut her throat if ſhe made any reſiſtance: to prove this charge the hatchet and the nail were produced, and the butcher had ſo little to ſay in his defence that there was not the leaſt reaſon to doubt of its truth.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Banks having reported this matter to me, I took an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, when the Chief and his women, with other Indians, were on board the ſhip, to call up the butcher, and after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulation of the charge and the proof, I gave orders that he ſhould be puniſhed, as well to prevent other offences of the ſame kind, as to acquit Mr. Banks of his promiſe; the Indians ſaw him ſtripped and tied up to the rigging with a fixed attention, waiting in ſilent ſuſpence for the event; but as ſoon as the firſt ſtroke was given, they interfered with great agitation, earneſtly intreating that the reſt of the puniſhment might be remitted: to this, however, for many reaſons, I could not conſent, and when they found that they could not prevail by their interceſſion, they gave vent to their pity by tears.</p>
                        <p>Their tears indeed, like thoſe of children, were always ready to expreſs any paſſion that was ſtrongly excited, and like thoſe of children they alſo appeared to be forgotten as ſoon as ſhed; of which the following among many others, is a remarkable inſtance. Very early in the morning of the 28th, even before it was day, a great number of them came down to the fort, and Terapo being obſerved among the women on the outſide of the gate, Mr. Banks went out and brought her in; he ſaw that the tears then ſtood in her eyes, and as ſoon as ſhe entered they began to flow in great abundance: he enquired earneſtly the cauſe, but inſtead of anſwering ſhe took from under her garment a ſhark's tooth, and ſtruck it ſix or ſeven times into her head with great force; a profuſion of blood followed, and ſhe talked loud, but in a moſt melancholly tone, for ſome minutes, without at all regarding his enquiries, which he repeated with ſtill more impatience and concern, while the other Indians, to his great ſurprize, talked and laughed, without taking the leaſt notice of her diſtreſs. But her own behaviour was ſtill more
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:013324_0092_0F90F11678E34F08"/>
extraordinary. As ſoon as the bleeding was over, ſhe looked up with a ſmile, and began to collect ſome ſmall pieces of cloth, which during her bleeding ſhe had thrown down to catch the blood; as ſoon as ſhe had picked them all up, ſhe carried them out of the tent, and threw them into the ſea, carefully diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them abroad, as if ſhe wiſhed to prevent the ſight of them from reviving the remembrance of what ſhe had done. She then plunged into the river, and after having waſhed her whole body, returned to the tents with the ſame gaiety and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as if nothing had happened.</p>
                        <p>It is not indeed ſtrange that the ſorrows of theſe artleſs people ſhould be tranſient, any more than that their paſſions ſhould be ſuddenly and ſtrongly expreſſed: what they feel they have never been taught either to diſguiſe or ſuppreſs, and having no habits of thinking which perpetually recal the paſt, and anticipate the future, they are affected by all the changes of the paſſing hour, and reflect the colour of the time, however frequently it may vary: they have no project which is to be purſued from day to day, the ſubject of unremitted anxiety and ſolicitude, that firſt ruſhes into the mind when they awake in the morning, and is laſt diſmiſſed when they ſleep at night. Yet if we admit that they are upon the whole happier than we, we muſt admit that the child is happier than the man, and that we are loſers by the perfection of our nature, the increaſe of our knowledge, and the enlargement of our views.</p>
                        <p>Canoes were continually coming in during all this forenoon, and the tents at the ſort were crowded with people of both ſexes from different parts of the iſland. I was myſelf buſy on board the ſhip, but Mr. Mollineux, our maſter, who was one of thoſe that made the laſt voyage in the Dolphin, went on ſhore. As ſoon as he entered Mr. Banks's tent he fixed his eyes upon one of the women, who was ſitting there with great compoſure among the reſt, and immediately declared her to be the perſon who at that time was ſuppoſed to be Queen of the iſland; ſhe alſo, at the ſame time, acknowledging him to be one of the ſtrangers whom ſhe had ſeen before. The attention of all preſent was now diverted from every other object, and wholly engaged in conſidering a perſon who had made ſo diſtinguiſhed a figure in the accounts that had been given of this iſland by its firſt diſcoverers; and we ſoon learnt that her name was OBEREA. She ſeemed to be about forty years of age, and was not only tall, but of a large make; her ſkin was white, and there was an uncommon intelligence and ſenſibility in her eyes: ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have been handſome when ſhe was young, but at this time little more than memorials of her beauty were left.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as her quality was known, an offer was made to conduct her to the ſhip. Of this ſhe readily accepted, and came on board with two men and ſeveral women, who ſeemed
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:013324_0093_0F8FF51B0220C4F0"/>
to be all of her family; I received her with ſuch marks of diſtinction as I thought would gratify her moſt, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

After ſome time ſpent on board, I attended her back to the ſhore; and as ſoon as we landed, ſhe preſented me with a hog, and ſeveral bunches of plantains, which ſhe cauſed to be carried from her canoes up to the fort in a kind of proceſſion, of which ſhe and myſelf brought up the rear. In our way to the fort we met Tootahah, who, though not King, appeared to be at this time inveſted with the ſovereign authority; he ſeemed not to be well pleaſed with the diſtinction that was ſhewed to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

At this time he thought fit to prefer a doll to a hatchet; but this preference aroſe only from a childiſh jealouſy, which could not be ſoothed but by a gift of exactly the ſame kind with that which had been preſented to Oberea; for dolls in a very ſhort time were univerſally conſidered as trifles of no value.</p>
                        <p>The men who had viſited us from time to time had, without ſcruple, eaten of our proviſions; but the women had never yet been prevailed upon to taſte a morſel. To-day, however, though they refuſed the moſt preſſing ſolicitations to dine with the Gentlemen, they afterwards retired to the ſervants apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and eat of plantains very heartily; a myſtery of female oeconomy here, which none of us could explain.</p>
                        <p>On the 29th, not very early in the forenoon, Mr. Banks went to pay his court to Oberea, and was told that ſhe was ſtill aſleep under the awning of her canoe: thither therefore he went, intending to call her up, a liberty which he thought he might take, without any danger of giving offence: but, upon looking into her chamber, to his great aſtoniſhment, he found her in bed with a handſome young fellow about five and twenty, whoſe name was OBADEE: he retreated with ſome haſte and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but was ſoon made to underſtand, that ſuch amours gave no occaſion to ſcandal, and that Obadee was univerſally known to have been ſelected by her as the object of her private favours. The lady being too polite to ſuffer Mr. Banks to wait long in her antichamber, dreſſed herſelf with more than uſual expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as a token of ſpecial grace, clothed him in a ſuit of fine cloth and proceeded with him to the tents. In the evening, Mr. Banks paid a viſit to Tubourai Tamaide, as he had often done before, by candle light, and was equally grieved and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to find him and his family in a melancholly mood, and moſt of them in tears: he endeavoured in vain to diſcover the cauſe, and therefore his ſtay among them was but ſhort. When he reported this circumſtance to the officers at the fort, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected that Owhaw had foretold, that in four days we ſhould

The ſentries therefore were doubled at the fort, and the Gentlemen ſlept under arms; at two in the morning, Mr. Banks himſelf went round the point, but found every thing ſo quiet, that he gave up all ſuſpicions of miſchief intended by the natives as groundleſs. We had however another ſource of ſecurity; our little fortification was now complete. The north and ſouth ſides conſiſted of a bank of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Our garriſon conſiſted of about five and forty men with ſmall arms, including the officers, and the gentlemen who reſided on ſhore; and our ſentries were as well relieved as in the beſt regulated frontier in Europe.</p>
                        <p>We continued our vigilance the next day, though we had no particular reaſon to think it neceſſary; but about ten o'clock in the morning, Tomio came running to the tents, with a mixture of grief and fear in her countenance, and taking Mr. Banks, to whom they applied in every emergency and diſtreſs, by the arm, intimated that Tubourai Tamaide was dying, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſomething which our people had given him to eat, and that he muſt inſtantly go with her to his houſe. Mr. Banks ſet out without delay, and found his Indian friend leaning his head againſt a poſt, in an attitude of the utmoſt languor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency; the people about him intimated that he had been vomiting, and brought out a leaf folded up with great care, which they ſaid contained ſome of the poiſon, by the deleterious effects of which he was now dying. Mr. Banks haſtily opened the leaf, and upon examining its contents found them to be no other than a chew of tobacco, which the chief had begged of ſome of our people, and which they had indiſcreetly given him: he had obſerved that they kept it long in the mouth, and being deſirous of doing the ſame, he had chewed it to powder, and ſwallowed the ſpittle. During the examination of the leaf and its co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Banks, however, being now maſter of his diſeaſe, directed him to drink plentifully of cocoa-nut milk, which in a ſhort time put an end to his ſickneſs and apprehenſions, and he ſpent the day at the fort with that uncommon flow of cheerfulneſs and good-humour, which is always produced by a ſudden and unexpected relief from pain either of body or mind.</p>

Captain Wallis having brought home one of the adzes which theſe people, having no metal of any kind, make of ſtone, Mr. Stevens, the Secretary to the Admiralty, procured one to be made of iron in imitation of it, which I brought out with me, to ſhew how much we excelled in making tools after their own faſhion: this I had not yet produced, as it never happened to come into my mind. But on the firſt of May, Tootahah coming on board about ten o'clock in the forenoon, expreſſed a great curioſity to ſee the contents of every cheſt and drawer that was in my cabbin; as I always made a point of gratifying him, I opened them immediately, and having taken a fancy to many things that he ſaw, and collected them together, he at laſt happened to caſt his eye upon this adze; he inſtantly ſnatched it up with the greateſt eagerneſs, and putting away every thing which he had before ſelected, he aſked me whether I would let him have that: I readily conſented; and, as if he was afraid I ſhould repent, he carried it off immediately in a tranſport of joy, without making any other requeſt, which whatever had been our liberality was ſeldom the caſe.</p>
                        <p>About noon, a Chief, who had dined with me a few days before, accompanied by ſome of his women, came on board alone: I had obſerved that he was fed by his women, but I made no doubt, that upon occaſion he would condeſcend to feed himſelf: in this, however, I found myſelf miſtaken. When my noble gueſt was ſeated, and the dinner upon the table, I helped him to ſome victuals: as I obſerved that he did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately begin his meal, I preſſed him to eat: but he ſtill continued to ſit motionleſs like a ſtatue, without attempting to put a ſingle morſel into his mouth, and would certainly have gone without his dinner, if one of the ſervants had not fed him.</p>

                        <p>IN the afternoon, of Monday the 1ſt of May, we ſet up the obſervatory, and took the aſtronomical quadrant, with ſome other inſtruments on ſhore, for the firſt time.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, about nine o'clock, I went on ſhore with Mr. Green to fix the quadrant in a ſituation for uſe, when to our inexpreſſible ſurprize and concern it was not to be found. It had been depoſited in the tent which was reſerved for my uſe, where, as I paſſed the night on board, nobody ſlept: it
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:013324_0096_0F904D23B54ABB10"/>
had never been taken out of the packing-caſe, which was eighteen inches ſquare, and the whole was of conſiderable weight; a ſentinel had been poſted the whole night within five yards of the tent door, and none of the other inſtruments were miſſing. We at firſt ſuſpected that it might have been ſtolen by ſome of our own people, who ſeeing a deal box, and not knowing the contents, might think it contained nails, or ſome other ſubjects of traffic with the natives. A large reward was therefore offered to any one who could find it, as, without this, we could not perform the ſervice for which our voyage was principally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. Our ſearch in the mean time was not confined to the fort and the places adjacent, but as the caſe might poſſibly have been carried back to the ſhip, if any of our own people had been the thieves, the moſt diligent ſearch was made for it on board; all the parties however returned without any news of the quadrant. Mr. Banks, therefore, who upon ſuch occaſions declined neither labour nor riſk, and who had more influence over the Indians than any of us, determined to go in ſearch of it into the woods; he hoped, that if it had been ſtolen by the natives, he ſhould find it wherever they had opened the box, as they would immediately diſcover that to them it would be wholly uſeleſs: or, if in this expectation he ſhould be diſappointed, that he might recover it by the aſcendancy he had acquired over the Chiefs. He ſet out, accompanied by a midſhipman and Mr. Green, and as he was croſſing the river he was met by Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourai Tamaide, who immediately made the figure of a triangle with three bits of ſtraw upon his hand. By this Mr. Banks knew that the Indians were the thieves; and that, although they had opened the caſe, they were not diſpoſed to part with the contents. No time was therefore to be loſt, and Mr. Banks made Tubourai Tamaide underſtand, that he muſt inſtantly go with him to the place whither the quadrant had been carried; he conſented, and they ſet out together to the eaſtward, the Chief inquiring at every houſe which they paſſed after the thief by name: the people readily told him which way he was gone, and how long it was ſince he had been there: the hope which this gave them that they ſhould overtake him, ſupported them under their fatigue, and they preſſed forward, ſometimes walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſometimes running, though the weather was intolerably hot; when they had climbed a hill at the diſtance of about four miles, their conductor ſhewed them a point full three miles far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and gave them to underſtand that they were not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the inſtrument till they had got thither. Here they pauſed; they had no arms, except a pair of piſtols, which Mr. Banks always carried in his pocket; they were going to a place that was at leaſt ſeven miles diſtant from the fort, where the Indians might be leſs ſubmiſſive than at home, and to take from them what they had ventured their lives to get; and what, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:013324_0097_0F8FF51BC16D4F88"/>
our conjectures, they appeared deſirous to keep: theſe were diſcouraging circumſtances, and their ſituation would become more critical at every ſtep. They determined, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not to relinquiſh their enterprize, nor to purſue it without taking the beſt meaſures for their ſecurity that were in their power. It was therefore determined, that Mr. Banks and Mr. Green ſhould go on, and that the Midſhipman ſhould return to me, and deſire that I would ſend a party of men after them, acquainting me at the ſame time, that it was impoſſible they ſhould return till it was dark. Upon receiving this meſſage I ſet out, with ſuch a party as I thought ſufficient for the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; leaving orders, both at the ſhip and at the fort, that no canoe ſhould be ſuffered to go out of the bay, but that none of the natives ſhould be ſeized or detained.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, Mr. Banks and Mr. Green purſued their journey, under the auſpices of Tubourai Tamaide, and in the very ſpot which he had ſpecified, they met one of his own people, with part of the quadrant in his hand. At this moſt welcome ſight they ſtopped; and a great number of Indians immediately came up, ſome of whom preſſing rather rudely upon them, Mr. Banks thought it neceſſary to ſhew one of his piſtols, the ſight of which reduced them inſtantly to order: as the crowd that gathered round them was every moment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, he marked out a circle in the graſs, and they ranged themſelves on the outſide of it to the number of ſeveral hundreds with great quietneſs and decorum. Into the middle of this circle, the box, which was now arrived, was ordered to be brought, with ſeveral reading glaſſes, and other ſmall matters, which in their hurry they had put into a piſtol-caſe, that Mr. Banks knew to be his property, it having been ſome time before ſtolen from the tents, with a horſe piſtol in it, which he immediately demanded, and which was alſo reſtored.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Green was impatient to ſee whether all that had been taken away was returned, and upon examining the box found the ſtand, and a few ſmall things of leſs conſequence, waiting; ſeveral perſons were ſent in ſearch of theſe, and moſt of the ſmall things were returned: but it was ſignified that the thief had not brought the ſtand ſo far, and that it would be delivered to our friends as they went back; this being confirmed by Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourai Tamaide, they prepared to return, as nothing would then be wanting but what might eaſily be ſupplied; and after they had advanced about two miles, I met them with my party, to our mutual ſatisfaction, congratulating each other upon the recovery of the quadrant, with a pleaſure proportioned to the importance of the event.</p>
                        <p>About eight o'clock, Mr. Banks with Tubourai Tamaide got back to the fort; when, to his great ſurprize, he found Too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tahah in cuſtody, and many of the natives in the utmoſt terror
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:013324_0098_0F90F0AA811E1A30"/>
and diſtreſs, crowding about the gate. He went haſtily in, ſome of the Indians were ſuffered to follow him, and the ſcene was extremely affecting. Tubourai Tamaide preſſing forward, ran up to Tootahah, and catching him in his arms, they both burſt into tears, and wept over each other, without being able to ſpeak: the other Indians were alſo in tears for their Chief, both he and they being ſtrongly poſſeſſed with the notion that he was to be put to death. In this ſituation they continued till I entered the fort, which was about a quarter of an hour afterwards. I was equally ſurprized and concerned at what had happened, the confining Tootahah being contrary to my orders, and therefore inſtantly ſet him at liberty. Upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the affair, I was told, that my going into the woods with a party of men under arms, at a time when a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery had been committed, which it was ſuppoſed I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in proportion to our apparent injury by the loſs, had ſo alarmed the natives, that in the evening they began to leave the neighbourhood of the fort with their effects: that a double canoe having been ſeen to put off from the bottom of the bay by Mr. Gore, the Second Lieutenant, who was left in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on board the ſhip, and who had received orders not to ſuffer any canoe to go out, he ſent the Boatſwain with a boat after her to bring her back: that as ſoon as the boat came up, the Indians, being alarmed, leaped into the ſea; and that Tootahah, being unfortunately one of the number, the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain took him up, and brought him to the ſhip, ſuffering the reſt of the people to ſwim on ſhore: that Mr. Gore, not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently attending to the order that none of the people ſhould be confined, had ſent him to the fort, and Mr. Hicks, the Firſt Lieutenant, who commanded there, receiving him in charge from Gore, did not think himſelf at liberty to diſmiſs him.</p>
                        <p>The notion that we intended to put him to death had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed him ſo ſtrongly, that he could not be perſuaded to the contrary till by my orders he was led out of the fort. The people received him as they would have done a father in the ſame circumſtances, and every one preſſed forward to embrace him. Sudden joy is commonly liberal, without a ſcrupulous regard to merit; and Tootahah, in the firſt expanſion of his heart, upon being unexpectedly reſtored to liberty and life, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon our receiving a preſent of two hogs; though, being conſcious that upon this occaſion we had no claim to favours, we refuſed them many times.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander attended the next morning in their uſual capacity of market-men, but very few Indians ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and thoſe who came brought no proviſions. Toota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hah, however, ſent ſome of his people for the canoe that had been detained, which they took away. A canoe having alſo been detained that belonged to Oberea, TUPIA, the perſon
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:013324_0099_0F8FF51CEAF5E4F0"/>
who managed her affairs when the Dolphin was here, was ſent to examine whether any thing on board had been take away: and he was ſo well ſatisfied of the contrary, that he left the canoe where he found it, and joined us at the fort, where he ſpent the day, and ſlept on board the canoe at night. About noon, ſome thing boats came abreaſt of the tents, but would part with very little of what they had on board; and we felt the want of cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit very ſeverely. In the courſe of the day, Mr. Banks walked out into the woods, that by converſing with the people he might recover their confidence and good-will: he found them civil, but they all complained of the ill-treatment of their Chief; who, they ſaid, had been beaten and pulled by the hair. Mr. Banks endeavoured to convince them, that he had ſuffered no perſonal violence, which to the beſt of our knowledge was true; yet, perhaps the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain had behaved with a brutality which he was afraid or aſhamed to acknowledge. The Chief himſelf being, probably, upon recollection, of opinion that we had ill-deſerved the hogs, which he had left with us as a preſent, ſent a meſſenger in the afternoon to demand an ax, and a ſhirt in return; but as I was told that he did not intend to come down to the fort for ten days, I excuſed myſelf from giving them till I ſhould ſee him, hoping that his impatience might induce him to fetch them, and knowing that abſence would probably continue the coolneſs between us, to which the firſt interview might put an end.</p>
                        <p>The next day we were ſtill more ſenſible of the inconvenience we had incurred by giving offence to the people in the perſon of their Chief, for the market was ſo ill ſupplied that we were in want of neceſſaries. Mr. Banks there ore went into the woods to Tubourai Tamaide, and with ſome difficulty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him to let us have five baſkets of bread-fruit; a very ſeaſonable ſupply, as they contained above one hundred and twenty. In the afternoon another meſſenger arrived from Too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tahah for the ax and ſhirt; as it was now become abſolutely neceſſary to recover he friendſhip of this man, without which it would be ſcarcely poſſible to procure proviſions, I ſent word that Mr. Banks and myſelf would viſit him on the morrow, and bring what he wanted with us.</p>
                        <p>Early the next morning he ſent again to remind me of my promiſe, and his people ſeemed to wait till we ſhould ſet out with great impatience: I therefore ordered the pinnace, in which I embarked with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander about ten o'clock: we took one of Tootahah's people in the boat with us, and in about an hour we arrived at his place of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is called EPARRE, and is about four miles to the weſtward of the tents.</p>
                        <p>We found the people waiting for us in great numbers upon the ſhore, ſo that it would have been impoſſible for us to have

proceeded, if way had not been made for us by a tall well-looking man, who had ſomething like a turban about his head, and a long white ſtick in his hand, with which he laid about him at an unmerciful rate. This man conducted us to the Chief, while the people ſhouted round us, <hi>Taio Tootahah,</hi> "Tootahah is your friend." We found him, like an ancient Patriarch, ſitting under a tree, with a number of venerable old men ſtanding round him; he made a ſign to us to ſit down, and immediately aſked for his ax: this I preſented to him, with an upper garment of broadcloth, made after the country faſhion, and trimmed with tape, to which I alſo added a ſhirt: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them with great ſatisfaction, and immediately put on the garment; but the ſhirt he gave to the perſon who had cleared the way for us upon our landing, who was now ſeated by us, and of whom he ſeemed deſirous that we ſhould take particular notice. In a ſhort time, Oberea, and ſeveral other women whom we knew, came and ſat down among us: Toota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hah left us ſeveral times, but after a ſhort abſence returned; we thought it had been to ſhow himſelf in his new finery to the people, but we wronged him, for it was to give directions for our refreſhment and entertainment. While we were waiting for his return the laſt time he left us, very impatient to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, as we were almoſt ſuffocated in the croud, word was brought us, that he expected us elſewhere: we found him ſitting under the awning of our own boat, and making ſigns that we ſhould come to him: as many of us therefore went on board as the boat would hold, and he then ordered bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts to be brought, of both which we taſted, rather to gratify him than becauſe we had a deſire to eat. A meſſage was ſoon after brought him, upon which he went out of the boat, and we were in a ſhort time deſired to follow. We were conducted to a large area or court-yard, which was railed round with bamboos about three feet high, on one ſide of his houſe, where an entertainment was provided for us, entirely new this was a wreſtling match. At the upper end of the area ſat the Chief, and ſeveral of his principal men were ranged on each ſide of him, ſo as to form a ſemicircle; theſe were the judges, by whom the victor was to be applauded; ſeats were alſo left for us at each end of the line, but we choſe rather to be at liberty among the reſt of the ſpectators.</p>
                        <p>When all was ready, ten or twelve perſons, whom we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be the combatants, and who were naked, except a cloth that was faſtened about the waiſt, entered the area, and walked ſlowly round it, in a ſtooping poſture, with their left hands on their right breaſts, and their right hands open, with which they frequently ſtruck the left fore-arm ſo as to produce a quick ſmart ſound: this was a general challenge to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants whom they were to engage, or any other perſon
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:013324_0101_0F8FF51D404029C8"/>
preſent: after theſe followed others in the ſame manner, and then a particular challenge was given, by which each man ſingled out his antagoniſt: this was done by joining the finger ends of both hands, and bringing them to the breaſt, at the ſame time moving the elbows up and down with a quick motion: if the perſon to whom this was addreſſed accepted the challenge, he repeated the ſigns, and immediately each put himſelf into an attitude to engage: the next minute they cloſed, but, except in firſt ſeizing each other, it was a mere conteſt of ſtrength: each endeavoured to lay hold of the other, firſt by the thigh, and if that failed by the hand, the hair, the cloth, or elſewhere as he could: when this was done they grappled, without the leaſt dexterity or ſkill, till one of them, by having a more advantageous hold, or greater muſcular force, threw the other on his back. When the conteſt was over, the old men gave their plaudit to the victor in a few words, which they repeated together in a kind of tune: his conqueſt was alſo generally celebrated by three huzzas. The entertainment was then ſuſpended for a few minutes, after which another couple of wreſtlers came forward and engaged in the ſame manner: if it happened that neither was thrown, after the conteſt had continued about a minute, they parted, either by conſent or the intervention of their friends, and in this caſe each ſlapped his arm, as a challenge to a new engagement, either with the ſame antagoniſt or ſome other. While the wreſtlers were engaged, another party of men performed a dance which laſted alſo about a minute; but neither of theſe parties took the leaſt notice of each other, their attention being wholly fixed on what they were doing. We obſerved with pleaſure, that the conqueror never exulted over the vanquiſhed, and that the vanquiſhed never repined at the ſucceſs of the conqueror; the whole conteſt was carried on with perfect good-will and good-humour, though in the preſence of at leaſt five hundred ſpectat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, of whom ſome were women. The number of women indeed was comparatively ſmall, none but thoſe of rank were preſent, and we had reaſon to believe that they would not have been ſpectators of this exerciſe but in compliment to us.</p>
                        <p>This laſted about two hours; during all which time the man who had made way for us when we landed, kept the people at a proper diſtance, by ſtriking thoſe who preſſed forward very ſeverely with his ſtick: upon enquiry we learnt, that he was an officer belonging to Tootahah, acting as a maſter of the ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>It is ſcarcely poſſible for thoſe who are acquainted with the athletic ſports of very remote antiquity, not to remark a rude reſemblance of them in this wreſtling-match among the natives of a little iſland in the midſt of the Pacific Ocean: and even our female readers may recollect the account given of them by
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:013324_0102_0F90F0A845E5FAB0"/>
Fenelon in his Telemachus, where, though the events are fictitious, the manners of the age are faithfully tranſcribed from authors by whom they are ſuppoſed to have been truly related.</p>
                        <p>When the wreſtling was over, we were given to underſtand that two hogs, and a large quantity of bread-fruit were prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our dinner, which, as our appetites were now keen, was very agreeable intelligence. Our hoſt, however, ſeemed to repent of his liberality; for, inſtead of ſetting his two hogs before us, he ordered one of them to be carried into our boat; at firſt we were not ſorry for his new diſpoſition of matters, thinking that we ſhould dine more comfortably in the boat than on ſhore, as the croud would more eaſily be kept at a diſtance: but when we came on board, he ordered us to proceed with his hog to the ſhip; this was mortifying, as we were now to row four miles while our dinner was growing cold; however, we thought fit to comply, and were at laſt gratified with the cheer that he had provided, of which he and Tubourai Tamaide had a liberal ſhare.</p>
                        <p>Our reconciliation with this man operated upon the people like a charm; for he was no ſooner known to be on board, than bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and other proviſions were brought to the fort in great plenty.</p>
                        <p>Affairs now went on in the uſual channel; but pork being ſtill a ſcarce commodity, our Maſter, Mr. Molineux, and Mr. Green went in the pinnace to the eaſtward, on the 8th, early in the morning, to ſee whether they could procure any hogs or poultry in that part of the country: they proceeded in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection twenty miles; but though they ſaw many hogs, and one turtle, they could not purchaſe either at any price: the people every where told them, that they all belonged to Toota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hah, and that they could ſell none of them without his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. We now began to think that this man was indeed a great Prince; for an influence ſo extenſive and abſolute could be acquired by no other. And we afterwards found that he adminiſtered the government of this part of the iſland, as ſovereign, for a minor whom we never ſaw all the time that we were upon it. When Mr. Green returned from this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he ſaid he had ſeen a tree of a ſize which he was afraid to relate, it being no leſs than fifty yards in circumference; but Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander ſoon explained to him, that it was a ſpecies of the fig, the branches of which, bending down, take freſh root in the earth, and thus form a congeries of trunks, which being very cloſe to each other, and all joined by a common vegetation, might eaſily be miſtaken for one.</p>
                        <p>Though the market at the fort was now tolerably ſupplied, proviſions were brought more ſlowly: a ſufficient quantity uſed to be purchaſed between ſun-riſe and eight o'clock, but it was now become neceſſary to attend the greateſt part of the day.
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:013324_0103_0F90F0AB3B8FCD80"/>
Mr. Banks, therefore, fixed his little boat up before the door of the fort, which was of great uſe as a place to trade in: hitherto we had purchaſed cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit for beads; but the market becoming rather ſlack in theſe articles, we were now, for the firſt time, forced to bring out our nails: one of our ſmalleſt ſize, which was about four inches long, procured us twenty cocoa-nuts, and bread-fruit in proportion, ſo that in a ſhort time our firſt plenty was reſtored.</p>
                        <p>On the 9th, ſoon after breakfaſt, we received a viſit from Oberea, being the firſt that ſhe had made us after the loſs of our quadrant, and the unfortunate confinement of Tootahah; with her came her preſent favourite, Obadee, and Tupia: they brought us a hog and ſome bread-fruit, in return for which we gave her a hatchet. We had now afforded our Indian friends a new and intereſting object of curioſity, our forge, which having been ſet up ſome time, was almoſt conſtantly at work. It was now common for them to bring pieces of iron, which we ſuppoſed they muſt have got from the Dolphin, to be made into tools of various kinds; and as I was very deſirous to gratify them, they were indulged, except when the ſmith's time was too precious to be ſpared. Oberea having received her hatchet, produced as much old iron as would have made another, with a requeſt that another might be made of it: in this, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I could not gratify her, upon which ſhe brought out a broken ax, and deſired it might be mended; I was glad of an opportunity to compromiſe the difference between us: her ax was mended, and ſhe appeared to be content. They went away at night, and took with them the canoe, which had been a conſiderable time at the point, but promiſed to return in three days.</p>
                        <p>On the 10th, I put ſome ſeeds of melons and other plants into a ſpot of ground which had been turned up for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; they had all been ſealed up by the perſon of whom they were bought, in ſmall bottles with roſin; but none of them came up except muſtard; even the cucumbers and melons failed, and Mr. Banks is of opinion that they were ſpoiled by the total excluſion of freſh air.</p>
                        <p>This day we learnt the Indian name of the iſland, which is OTAHEITE, and by that name I ſhall hereafter diſtinguiſh it: but after great pains taken we found it utterly impoſſible to teach the Indians to pronounce our names; we had, therefore, new names, conſiſting of ſuch ſounds as they produced in the attempt. They called me <hi>Too<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        <head>CHAP. XII. Some Ladies viſit the Fort with very uncommon Ceremonies: The Indians attend Divine Service, and in the Evening exhibit a moſt extraordinary Spectacle: Tubourai Tamaide falls into Temptation.</head>
                        <p>FRIDAY, the 12th of May, was diſtinguiſhed by a viſit from ſome ladies whom we had never ſeen before, and who introduced themſelves with ſome very ſingular ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Mr. Banks was trading in his boat at the gate of the fort as uſual, in company with Tootahah, who had that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paid him a viſit, and ſome other of the natives; between nine and ten o'clock, a double canoe came to the landing-place, under the awning of which ſat a man and two women: the Indians that were about Mr. Banks, made ſigns that he ſhould go out to meet them, which he haſted to do; but by the time he could get out of the boat, they had advanced within ten yards of him: they then ſtopped, and made ſigns that he ſhould do ſo too, laying down about a dozen young plantain trees, and ſome other ſmall plants: he complied, and the people having made a lane between them, the man, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be a ſervant, brought them to Mr. Banks by one of each at a time, paſſing and repaſſing ſix times, and always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing a ſhort ſentence when he delivered them. Tupia, who ſtood by Mr. Banks, acted as his maſter of the ceremonies, and receiving the branches as they were brought, laid them down in the boat. When this was done, another man brought a large bundle of cloth, which having opened, he ſpread piece by piece upon the ground, in the ſpace between Mr. Banks and his viſitors; there were nine pieces, and having laid three pieces one upon another, the foremoſt of the women, who ſeemed to be the principal, and who was called OORATTOOA, ſtepped upon them, and taking up her garments all round her to the waiſt, turned about, with great compoſure and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with an air of perfect innocence and ſimplicity, three
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:013324_0105_0F90F0A0AFBDD8F8"/>
times; when this was done, ſhe dropped the veil, and ſtepping off the cloth, three more pieces were laid on, and ſhe repeated the ceremony, then ſtepping off as before; the laſt three were laid on, and the ceremony was repeated in the ſame manner the third time. Immediately after this the cloth was rolled up, and given to Mr. Banks, as a preſent from the lady, who, with her friend, came up and ſaluted him. He made ſuch preſents to them both as he thought would be moſt acceptable, and after having ſtaid about an hour they went away. In the evening, the Gentlemen at the fort had a viſit from Oberea, and her favourite female attendant, whoſe name was OTHEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THEA, an agreeable girl, whom they were the more pleaſed to ſee, becauſe, having been ſome days abſent, it had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that ſhe was either ſick or dead.</p>
                        <p>On the 13th, the market being over about ten o'clock, Mr. Banks walked into the woods with his gun, as he generally did, for the benefit of the ſhade in the heat of the day: as he was returning back, he met Tubourai Tamaide, near his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional dwelling, and ſtopping to ſpend a little time with him, he ſuddenly took the gun out of Mr. Banks's hand, cocked it, and, holding it up in the air, drew the trigger: fortunately for him, it flaſhed in the pan: Mr. Banks immediately took it from him, not a little ſurpriſed how he had acquired ſufficient knowledge of a gun to diſcharge it, and reproved him with great ſeverity for what he had done. As it was of infinite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to keep the Indians totally ignorant of the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire-arms, he had taken every opportunity of intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they could never offend him ſo highly as by even touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his piece; it was now proper to enforce this prohibition, and he therefore added threats to his reproof: the Indian bore all patiently; but the moment Mr. Banks croſſed the river, he ſet off with all his family and furniture for his houſe at Eparre. This being quickly known from the Indians at the fort, and great inconvenience being apprehended from the diſpleaſure of this man, who upon all occaſions had been particularly uſeful, Mr. Banks determined to follow him without delay, and ſolicit his return: he ſet out the ſame evening, accompanied by Mr. Mollineux, and found him ſitting in the middle of a large circle of people, to whom he had probably related what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and his fears of the conſequences; he was himſelf the very picture of grief and dejection, and the ſame paſſions were ſtrongly marked in the countenances of all the people that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him. When Mr. Banks and Mr. Mollineux went into the circle, one of the women expreſſed her trouble, as Terapo had done upon another occaſion, and ſtruck a ſhark's tooth into her head ſeveral times, till it was covered with blood. Mr. Banſts loſt no time in putting an end to this univerſal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; he aſſured the Chief, that every thing which had paſſed
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:013324_0106_0F904D24DD83CD28"/>
ſhould be forgotten, that there was not the leaſt animoſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining on one ſide, nor any thing to be feared on the other. The Chief was ſoon ſoothed into confidence and complacency, a double canoe was ordered to be got ready, they all returned together to the fort before ſupper, and as a pledge of perfect reconciliation, both he and his wife ſlept all night in Mr. Banks's tent: their preſence, however, was no palladium; for, between eleven and twelve o'clock, one of the natives attempted to get into the fort by ſcaling the walls, with a deſign, no doubt, to ſteal whatever he ſhould happen to find; he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the centinel, who happily did not fire, and he ran away much faſter than any of our people could follow him. The iron, and iron-tools, which were in continual uſe at the armourer's forge, that was ſet up within the works, were temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to theft which none of theſe people could withſtand.</p>
                        <p>On the 14th, which was Sunday, I directed that Divine Service ſhould be performed at the fort: we were deſirous that ſome of the principal Indians ſhould be preſent, but when the hour came, moſt of them were returned home. Mr. Banks, however, croſſed the river, and brought back Tubourai Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide and his wife Tomio, hoping that it would give occaſion to ſome enquiries on their part, and ſome inſtruction on ours: having ſeated them, he placed himſelf between them, and during the whole ſervice, they very attentively obſerved his behaviour, and very exactly imitated it; ſtanding, ſitting, or kneeling, as they ſaw him do: they were conſcious that we were employed about ſomewhat ſerious and important, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by their calling to the Indians without the fort to be ſilent; yet when the ſervice was over, neither of them aſked any queſtions, nor would they attend to any attempt that was made to explain what had been done.</p>
                        <p>Such were our Matins; our Indians thought fit to perform Veſpers of a very different kind. A young man, near ſix feet high, performed the rites of Venus with a little-girl about eleven or twelve years of age, before ſeveral of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r people, and a great number of the natives, without the leaſt ſenſe of its being indecent or improper, but, as appeared, in perfect conformity to the cuſtom of the pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ce. Among the ſpectators were ſeveral women of ſuperior rank, particularly Oberea, who may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid to have aſſiſted at the ceremony; for they gave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to the girl how to perform her part, which, young as ſhe was, ſhe did not ſeem much to ſtand in need of.</p>
                        <p>This incident is not mentioned as an object of idle curioſity, but as it deſerves conſideration in determining a queſtion which has been long debated in philoſophy; Whether the ſhame at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending certain actions, which are allowed on all ſides to be in themſelves innocent, is implanted in Nature, or ſuperinduced by cuſtom? If it has its origin in cuſtom, it will, perhaps, be
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:013324_0107_0F90F0A16FD8A070"/>
found difficult to trace that cuſtom, however general, to its ſource; if in inſtinct, it will be equally difficult to diſcover from what cauſe it is ſubdued or at leaſt over-ruled among theſe people, in whoſe manners not the leaſt trace of it is to be found.</p>
                        <p>On the 14th and 15th, we had another opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the general knowledge which theſe people had of any deſign that was formed among them. In the night between the 13th and 14th, one of the water-caſks was ſtolen from the outſide of the fort: in the morning, there was not an Indian to be ſeen who did not know that it was gone; yet they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not to have been truſted, or not to have been worthy of truſt; for they ſeemed all of them diſpoſed to give intellig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence where it might be found. Mr. Banks traced it to a part of the bay where he was told it had been put into a canoe, but as it was not of great conſequence he did not complete the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. When he returned, he was told by Tubourai Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maide, that another caſk would be ſtolen before the morning: how he came by his knowledge it is not eaſy to imagine; that he was not a party in the deſign is certain, for he came with his wife and his family to the place where the water caſks ſtood, and placing their beds near them, he ſaid he would himſelf be a pledge for their ſafety, in deſpight of the thief: of this, however, we would not admit; and making him underſtand that a ſentry would be placed to watch the caſks till the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he removed the beds into Mr. Banks's tent, where he and his family ſpent the night, making ſigns to the ſentry when he retired, that he ſhould keep his eyes open. In the night this intelligence appeared to be true; about twelve o'clock the thief came, but diſcovering that a watch had been ſet, he went away without his booty.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Banks's confidence in Tubourai Tamaide had greatly increaſed ſince the affair of the knife, in conſequence of which he was at length expoſed to temptations which neither his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity nor his honour was able to reſiſt. They had withſtood many allurements, but were at length enſnared by the faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating charms of a baſket of nails; theſe nails were much larger than any that had yet been brought into trade, and had, with perhaps ſome degree of criminal negligence, been left in a corner of Mr. Banks's tent, to which the Chief had always free acceſs. One of theſe nails Mr. Banks's ſervant happened to ſee in his poſſeſſion, upon his having inadvertently thrown back that part of his garment under which it was concealed. Mr. Banks being told of this, and knowing that no ſuch thing had been given him, either as a preſent or in barter, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately examined the baſket, and diſcovered, that out of ſeven nails five were miſſing. He then, though not without great reluctance, charged him with the fact, which he immediately
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:013324_0108_0F904D2780D98780"/>
confeſſed, and however, he might ſuffer, was probably not more hurt than his accuſer. A demand was immediately made of reſtitution; but this he declined, ſaying, that the nails were at Eparre: however, Mr. Banks appearing to be much in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and uſing ſome threatening ſigns, he thought fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one of them. He was then taken to the fort, to receive ſuch judgment as ſhould be given againſt him by the general voice.</p>
                        <p>After ſome deliberation, that we might not appear to think too lightly of his offence, he was told, that if he would bring the other four nails to the fort, it ſhould be forgotten. To this condition he agreed; but I am ſorry to ſay he did not fulfil it. Inſtead of fetching the nails, he removed with his family before night, and took all his furniture with him.</p>
                        <p>As our long-boat had appeared to be leaky, I thought it neceſſary to examine her bottom, and, to my great ſurprize, found it ſo much eaten by the worms, that it was nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Having received repeated meſſages from Tootahah, that if we would pay him a viſit he would acknowledge the favour by a preſent of four hogs, I ſent Mr. Hicks, my Firſt Lieutenant, to try <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> he could not procure the hogs upon eaſier terms, with orders to ſhow him every civility in his power. Mr. Hicks found that he was removed from Eparre to a place called TET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAHAH, five miles farther to the weſtward. He was received with great cordiality; one hog was immediately produced, and he was told that the other three, which were at ſome diſtance, ſhould be brought in the morning. Mr. Hicks readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to ſtay; but the morning came without the hogs, and it not being convenient to ſtay longer, he returned in the evening, with the one that he had got.</p>
                        <p>On the 25th, Tubourai Tamaide and his wife Tomio made their appearance at the tent, for the firſt time ſince he had been detected in ſtealing the nails; he ſeemed to be under ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and apprehenſion, yet he did not think fit to purchaſe our countenance and good-will by reſtoring the four which he
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:013324_0109_0F90F0A90E99DAA0"/>
had ſent away. As Mr. Banks and the other Gentlemen treated him with a coolneſs and reſerve which did not at all tend to reſtore his peace or good-humour, his ſtay was ſhort, and his departure abrupt. Mr. Monkhouſe, the Surgeon, went the next morning in order to effect a reconciliation, by perſuading him to bring down the nails, but he could not ſucceed.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XIII. Another Viſit to Tootahah, with various Adventures: Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Amuſement of the Indians, with Remarks upon it: Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to obſerve the Tranſit of Venus, and what happened in the mean time at the Fort.</head>
                        <p>ON the 27th, it was determined that we ſhould pay our viſit to Tootahah, though we were not very confident that we ſhould receive the hogs for our pains. I therefore ſet out early in the morning, with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and three others, in the pinnace. He was now removed from Tettahah, where Mr. Hicks had ſeen him, to a place called ATAHOUROU, about ſix miles farther, and as we could not go above half way thither in the boat, it was almoſt evening before we arrived: we found him in his uſual ſtate, ſitting under a tree, with a great crowd about him. We made our preſents in due form, conſiſting of a yellow ſtuff petticoat, and ſome other trifling articles, which were graciouſly received; a hog was immediately ordered to be killed and dreſſed for ſupper, with a promiſe of more in the morning: however, as we were leſs deſirous of feaſting upon our journey than of carrying back with us proviſions, which would be more welcome at the fort, we procured a reprieve for the hog, and ſupped upon the fruits of the country. As night now came on, and the place was crowded with many more than the houſes and canoes would contain; there being Oberea with her attendants, and many other travellers whom we knew, we began to look out for lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Our party conſiſted of ſix: Mr. Banks thought himſelf fortunate in being offered a place by Oberea in her canoe, and wiſhing his friends a good night, took his leave. He went to reſt early, according to the cuſtom of the country, and taking off his clothes, as was his conſtant practice, the nights being hot, Oberea kindly inſiſted upon taking them into her own cuſtody, for otherwiſe ſhe ſaid they would certainly be ſtolen. Mr. Banks having ſuch a ſafeguard, reſigned himſelf to ſleep with all imaginable tranquillity: but awaking about eleven o'clock, and wanting to get up, he ſearched for his clothes where he had ſeen them depoſited by Oberea when he lay down
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:013324_0110_0F90F0A2319279B8"/>
to ſleep, and ſoon perceived that they were miſſing. He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately awakened Oberea, who ſtarting up, and hearing his complaint, ordered lights, and prepared in great haſte to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what he had loſt: Tootahah himſelf ſlept in the next canoe, and being ſoon alarmed, he came to them and ſet out with Oberea in ſearch of he thief: Mr. Banks was not in a condition to go with them, for of his apparel ſcarce any thing was left him but his breeches; his coat, and his waiſtcoat, with his piſtols, powder-horn, and many other things that were in the pockets, were gone. In about half an hour his two noble friends returned, but without having obtained any intelligence of his clothes or of the thief. At firſt he began to be alarmed, his muſquet had not indeed been taken away, but he had neglected to load it; where I and Dr. Solander had diſpoſed of ourſelves he did not know; and therefore, whatever might happen, he could not have recourſe to us for aſſiſtance. He thought it beſt, however, to expreſs neither fear nor ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of thoſe about him, and giving his muſquet to Tupia, who had been waked in the confuſion and ſtood by him, with a charge not to ſuffer it to be ſtolen, he betook himſelf again to reſt, declaring himſelf perfectly ſatisfied with the pains that Tootahah and Oberea had taken to recover his things, though they had not been ſucceſsful. As it cannot be ſuppoſed that in ſuch a ſituation his ſleep was very ſound, he ſoon after heard muſic, and ſaw lights at a little diſtance on ſhore: this was a concert or aſſembly, which they call a a HEIVA, a common name for every public exhibition; and as it would neceſſarily bring many people together, and there was a chance of my being among them with his other friends, he roſe, and made the beſt of his way towards it: he was ſoon led by the lights and the ſound to the hut where I lay, with three other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of our party; and eaſily diſtinguiſhing us from the reſt, he made up to us more than half naked, and told us his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſtory. We gave him ſuch comfort as the unfortunate generally give to each other, by telling him that we were fellow-ſufferers; I ſhowed him that I was myſelf without ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they having been ſtolen from under my head, though I was ſure I had never been aſleep, and each of my aſſociates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him, by his appearance, that he had loſt a jacket. We determined, however, to hear out the concert, however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient we might appear in our dreſs; it conſiſted of three drums, four flutes, and ſeveral voices: when this entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which laſted about an hour, was over, we retired again to our ſleeping-places; having agreed, that nothing could be done toward the recovery of our things till the morning.</p>
                        <p>We roſe at day-break, according to the cuſtom of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; the firſt man that Mr. Banks ſaw was Tupia, faithfully attending with his muſquet; and ſoon after, Oberea brought
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:013324_0111_0F90F0A6B8B3CEE0"/>
him ſome of her country clothes, as a ſuccedaneum for his own, ſo that when he came to us he made a moſt motley appearance, half Indian and half Engliſh. Our party ſoon got together, except Dr. Solander, whoſe quarters we did not know, and who had not aſſiſted at the concert: in a ſhort time Tootahah made his appearance, and we preſſed him to recover our clothes; but neither he nor Oberea could be perſuaded to take any meaſure for that purpoſe, ſo that we began to ſuſpect that they had been parties in the theft. About eight o'clock, we were joined by Dr. Solander, who had fallen into honeſter hands, at a houſe about a mile diſtant, and had loſt nothing.</p>
                        <p>Having given up all hope of recovering our clothes, which indeed were never afterwards heard of, we ſpent all the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſoliciting the hogs which we had been promiſed; but in this we had no better ſucceſs: we therefore, in no very good humour, ſet out for the boat about twelve o'clock, with only that which we had redeemed from the butcher and the cook the night before.</p>
                        <p>As we were returning to the boat, however, we were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with a ſight that in ſome meaſure compenſated for our fatigue and diſappointment. In our way we came to one of the few places where acceſs to the iſland is not guarded by a reef, and, conſequently, a high ſurf breaks upon the ſhore; a more dreadful one indeed I had ſeldom ſeen; it was impoſſible for any European boat to have lived in it; and if the beſt ſwimmer in Europe had, by any accident, been expoſed to its fury, I am confident that he would not have been able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve himſelf from drowning, eſpecially as the ſhore was covered with pebbles and large ſtones; yet, in the midſt of theſe breakers, were ten or twelve Indians ſwimming for their amuſement: whenever a ſurf broke near them, they dived under it, and, to all appearance with infinite facility, roſe again on the other ſide. This diverſion was greatly improved by the ſtern of an old canoe, which they happened to find upon the ſpot; they took this before them, and ſwam out with it as far as the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt breach, then two or three of them getting into it, and turning the ſquare end to the breaking wave, were driven in towards the ſhore with incredible rapidity, ſometimes almoſt to the beach; but generally the wave broke over them before they got half way, in which caſe they dived, and roſe on the other ſide with the canoe in their hands: they then ſwam out with it again, and were again driven back, juſt as our holiday youth climb the hill in Greenwich park for the pleaſure of rolling down it. At this wonderful ſcene we ſtood gazing for more than half an hour, during which time none of the ſwimmers attempted to come on ſhore, but ſeemed to enjoy their ſport in the higheſt degree; we then proceeded in our journey, and late in the evening got back to the fort.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="85" facs="unknown:013324_0112_0F90EC7B6C641320"/>
Upon this occaſion it may be obſerved, that human nature is endued with powers which are only accidentally exerted to the utmoſt; and that all men are capable of what no man attains, except he is ſtimulated to the effort by ſome uncommon cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances or ſituation. Theſe Indians effected what to us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be ſupernatural, merely by the application of ſuch powers as they poſſeſſed in common with us, and all other men who have no particular infirmity or defect. The truth of the obſervation is alſo manifeſt from more familiar inſtances. The rope-dancer and balance-maſter owe their art, not to any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar liberality of Nature, but to an accidental improvement of her common gifts; and though equal diligence and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not always produce equal excellence in theſe, any more than in other arts; yet there is no doubt but that a certain degree of proficiency in them might be univerſally attained. Another proof of the exiſtence of abilities in mankind, that are almoſt univerſally dormant, is furniſhed by the attainments of blind men. It cannot be ſuppoſed that the loſs of one ſenſe, like the amputation of a branch from a tree, gives new vigour to thoſe that remain. Every man's hearing and touch, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are capable of the nice diſtinctions which aſtoniſh us in thoſe that have loſt their ſight, and if they do not give the ſame intelligence to the mind, it is merely becauſe the ſame intelligence is not required of them: he that can ſee may do from choice what the blind do by neceſſity, and by the ſame diligent attention to the other ſenſes, may receive the ſame notices from them; let it therefore be remembered as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to perſevering diligence, and a principle of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral uſe to mankind, that he who does all he can, will ever effect much more than is generally thought to be poſſible.</p>
                        <p>Among other Indians that had viſited us, there were ſome from a neighbouring iſland which they called EIMEO or IMAO, the ſame to which Captain Wallis had given the name of the Duke of York's iſland, and they gave us an account of no leſs than two and twenty iſlands that lay in the neighbourhood of Otaheite.</p>
                        <p>As the day of obſervation now approached, I determined in conſequence of ſome hints which had been given me by Lord Morton, to ſend out two parties to obſerve the tranſit from other ſituations; hoping, that if we ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ail at Otaheite, they might have better ſucceſs. We were, therefore, now buſily employed in preparing our inſtruments, and inſtructing ſuch Gentlemen in the uſe of them as I intended to ſend out.</p>
                        <p>On Thurſday the 1ſt of June, the Saturday following being the day of the Tranſit, I diſpatched Mr. Gore in the long-boat to Imao, with Mr. Monkhouſe and Mr. Sporing, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man belonging to Mr. Banks, Mr. Green having furniſhed them with proper inſtruments. Mr. Banks himſelf thought fit
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:013324_0113_0F90F0ABFAC63BF0"/>
to go upon this expedition, and ſeveral natives, particularly Tubourai Tamaide and Tomio, were alſo of the party. Very early on the Friday morning, I ſent Mr. Hicks, with Mr. Clerk and Mr. Peterſgill, the Maſter's Mates, and Mr. Saunders, one of the Midſhipmen, in the pinnace to the eaſtward, with orders to fix on ſome convenient ſpot, at a diſtance from our principal obſervatory, where they alſo might employ the inſtruments with which they had been furniſhed for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>The long-boat not having been got ready till Thurſday in the afternoon, though all poſſible expedition was uſed to fit her out; the people on board, after having rowed moſt part of the night, brought her to a grappling juſt under the land of Imao. Soon after day-break, they ſaw an Indian canoe, which they hailed, and the people on board ſhewed them an inlet through the reef into which they pulled, and ſoon fixed upon a coral rock, which roſe out of the water about one hundred and fifty yards from the ſhore, as a proper ſituation for their obſervatory: it was about eighty yards long and twenty broad, and in the middle of it was a bed of white ſand, large enough for the tents to ſtand upon. Mr. Gore and his aſſiſtants im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately began to ſet them up, and make other neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for the important buſineſs of the next day. While this was doing, Mr. Banks, with the Indians of Otaheite, and the people whom they had met in the canoe, went aſhore upon the main iſland, to buy proviſions; of which he procured a ſufficient ſupply before night. When he returned to the rock he found the obſervatory in order, and the teleſcopes all fixed and tried. The evening was very fine, yet their ſolicitude did not permit them to take much reſt in the night: one or other of them was up every half hour, who ſatisfied the impatience of the reſt by reporting the changes of the ſky; now encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hope by telling them that it was clear, and now alarming their fears by an account that it was hazey.</p>
                        <p>At day-break they got up, and had the ſatisfaction to ſee the ſun riſe, without a cloud. Mr. Banks then, wiſhing the obſervers, Mr. Gore and Mr. Monkhouſe, ſucceſs, repaired again to the iſland, that he might examine its produce, and get a freſh ſupply of proviſions: he began by trading with the natives, for which purpoſe he took his ſtation under a tree; and to keep them from preſſing upon him in a crowd, he drew a circle round him, which he ſuffered none of them to enter.</p>
                        <p>About eight o'clock, he ſaw two canoes coming towards the place, and was given to underſtand by the people about him, that they belonged to TARRAO, the King of the iſland, who was coming to make him a viſit. As ſoon as the canoes came near the ſhore, the people made a lane from the beach to the trading-place, and his Majeſty landed, with his ſiſter, whoſe name was NUNA; as they advanced towards the tree where Mr.
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:013324_0114_0F90F0ACC4A4FED0"/>
Banks ſtood, he went out to meet them, and, with great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, introduced them into the circle from which the other natives had been excluded. As it is the cuſtom of theſe people to ſit during all their conferences, Mr. Banks unwrapped a kind of Turban of Indian cloth, which he wore upon his head inſtead of a hat, and ſpreading it upon the ground, they all ſat down upon it together. The royal preſent was then brought, which conſiſted of a hog and a dog, ſome bread-fruit, cocoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, and other articles of the like kind. Mr. Banks then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a canoe to the obſervatory for his preſent, and the meſſengers ſoon returned with an adze, a ſhirt, and ſome beads, which were preſented to his Majeſty, and received with great ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>By this time, Tubourai Tamaide and Tomio joined them, from the obſervatory. Tomio ſaid, that ſhe was related to Tarrao, and brought him a preſent of a long nail, at the ſame time complimenting Nuna with a ſhirt.</p>
                        <p>The firſt internal contact of the planet with the ſun being over, Mr. Banks returned to the obſervatory, taking Tarrao, Nuna, and ſome of their principal attendants, among whom were three very handſome young women, with him: he ſhewed them the planet upon the ſun, and endeavoured to make them underſtand that he and his companions had come from their own country on purpoſe to ſee it. Soon after, Mr. Banks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with them to the iſland, where he ſpent the reſt of the day in examining its produce, which he found to be much the ſame with that of Otaheite. The people whom he ſaw there alſo exactly reſembled the inhabitants of that iſland, and many of them were perſons whom he had ſeen upon it; ſo that all thoſe whom he had dealt with, knew of what his trading ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles conſiſted, and the value they bore.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, having ſtruck the tents, they ſet out on their return, and arrived at the ſort before night.</p>
                        <p>The obſervation was made with equal ſucceſs by the perſons whom I had ſent to the eaſtward, and at the fort, there not being a cloud in the ſky from the riſing to the ſetting of the ſun, the whole paſſage of the planet Venus over the ſun's diſk was obſerved with great advantage by Mr. Green, Dr. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander, and myſelf; Mr. Green's teleſcope and mine were of the ſame magnifying power, but that of Dr. Solander was greater. We all ſaw an atmoſphere or duſky cloud round the body of the planet, which very much diſturbed the times of contact, eſpecially of the internal ones; and we differed from each other in our accounts of the times of the contacts much more than might have been expected. According to Mr. Green.

The latitude of the obſervatory was found to be 17° 29′ 15"; and the longitude 149° 32′ 30" W. of Greenwich. A more particular account will appear by the tables, for which the reader is referred to the Tranſactions of the Royal Society, vol. lxi. part 2. page 397 &amp; ſeq. where they are illuſtrated by a cut.</p>
                        <p>But if we had reaſon to congratulate ourſelves upon the ſucceſs of our obſervation, we had ſcarce leſs cauſe to regret the diligence with which that time had been improved by ſome of our people to another purpoſe. While the attention of the officers was engroſſed by the Tranſit of Venus, ſome of the ſhip's company broke into one of the ſtore-rooms, and ſtole a quantity of ſpike nails, amounting to no leſs than one hundred weight: this was a matter of public and ſerious concern; for theſe nails, if circulated by the people among the Indians, would do us irreparable injury, by reducing the value of iron, our ſtaple commodity. One of the thieves was detected, but only ſeven nails were found in his cuſtody. He was puniſhed with two dozen laſhes, but would impeach none of his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices.</p>

                        <p>ON the 5th, we kept his Majeſty's birth-day; for though it is the 4th, we were unwilling to celebrate it during the abſence of the two parties who had been ſent out to obſerve the Tranſit. We had ſeveral of the Indian Chiefs at our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, who drank his Majeſty's health by the name of Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiargo, which was the neareſt imitation they could produce of King George.</p>
                        <p>About this time died an old woman of ſome rank, who was related to Tomio, which gave us an opportunity to ſee how they diſpoſed of the body, and confirmed us in our opinion that theſe people, contrary to the preſent cuſtom of all other nations now known, never bury their dead. In the middle of a ſmall ſquare, neatly railed in with bamboo, the awning of a canoe was raiſed upon two poſts, and under this the body was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited upon ſuch a frame as has before been deſcribed; it was
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:013324_0116_0F90EC7C2C3E81F0"/>
covered with fine cloth, and near it was placed bread-fruit, fiſh, and other proviſions: we ſuppoſed that the food was placed there for the ſpirit of the deceaſed, and conſequently, that theſe Indians had ſome confuſed notion of a ſeparate ſtate; but upon our applying for further information to Tubourai Tamaide, he told us, that the food was placed there as an offering to their gods. They do not, however, ſuppoſe, that the gods eat, any more than the Jews ſuppoſed that Jehovah could dwell in a houſe: the offering is made here upon the ſame principle as the Temple was built at Jeruſalem, as an expreſſion of reverence and gratitude, and a ſolicitation of the more immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Deity. In the front of the area was a kind of ſtile, where the relations of the deceaſed ſtood to pay the tribute of their ſorrow; and under the awning were innumerable ſmall pieces of cloth, on which the tears and blood of the mourners had been ſhed; for in their paroxyſms of grief it is a univerſal cuſtom to wound themſelves with the ſhark's tooth. Within a few yards two occaſional houſes were ſet up, in one of which ſome relations of the deceaſed conſtantly reſided, and in the other the chief mourner, who is always a man, and who keeps there a very ſingular dreſs in which a ceremony is performed that will be deſcribed in its turn. Near the place where the dead are thus ſet up to rot, the bones are afterwards buried.</p>
                        <p>What can have introduced among theſe people the cuſtom of expoſing their dead above ground, till the fleſh is conſumed by putrefaction, and then burying the bones, it is perhaps im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to gueſs; but it is remarkable, that AElian and Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius Rhodius impute a ſimilar practice to the ancient inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Colchis, a country near Pontus in Aſia, now called Mingrelia; except that among them this manner of diſpoſing of the dead did extend to both ſexes: the women they buried; but the men they wrapped in a hide, and hung up in the air by a chain. This practice among the Colchians is referred to a religious cauſe. The principal objects of their worſhip were the earth and the air; and it is ſuppoſed that, in conſequence of ſome ſuperſtitious notion, they devoted their dead to both. Whether the natives of Otaheite had any notion of the ſame kind, we were never able certainly to determine; but we ſoon diſcovered, that the repoſitories of their dead were alſo places of worſhip. Upon this occaſion it may be obſerved, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more abſurd than the notion that the happineſs or miſery of a future life depends, in any degree, upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the body when the ſtate of probation is paſt; yet that nothing is more general than a ſolicitude about it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cheap we may hold any funeral rites which cuſtom has not familiariſed, or ſuperſtition rendered ſacred, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

of ſenſation; and purchaſe a place for it in holy ground, when they believe the lot of its future exiſtence to be irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly determined. So ſtrong is the aſſociation of pleaſing or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ideas with certain opinions and actions which affect us while we live, that we involuntarily act as if it was equally certain that they would affect us in the ſame manner when we are dead, though this is an opinion that nobody will maintain. Thus it happens, that the deſire of preſerving from reproach even the name that we leave behind us, or of procuring it honour, is one of the moſt powerful principles of action, among the inhabitants of the moſt ſpeculative and enlightened nations. Poſthumous reputation, upon every principle, muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>o influence upon the dead; yet the deſire of obtaining and ſecuring it, no force of reaſon, no habits of thinking can ſubdue, except in thoſe whom habitual baſeneſs and guilt have rendered indifferent to honour and ſhame while they lived. This indeed ſeems to be among the happy imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of our nature, upon which the general good of ſociety in a certain meaſure depends; for as ſome crimes are ſuppoſed to be prevented by hanging the body of the criminal in chains after he is dead, ſo in conſequence of the ſame aſſociation of ideas, much good is produced to ſociety, and much evil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, by a deſire of preventing diſgrace or procuring honour to a name, when nothing but a name remains.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps no better uſe can be made of reading an account of manners altogether new, by which the follies and abſurdities of mankind are taken out of that particular connection in which habit has reconciled them to us, than to conſider in how many inſtances they are eſſentially the ſame. When an honeſt devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the church of Rome reads, that there are Indians on the banks of the Ganges, who believe that they ſhall ſecure the happineſs of a future ſtate by dying with a cow's tail in their hands, he laughs at their folly and ſuperſtition; and if theſe people were to be told, that there are people upon the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of Europe, who imagine that they ſhall derive the ſame advantage from dying with a ſlipper of a St. Francis upon their foot, they would laugh in their turn. But if when the Indian heard the account of the Catholic, and the Catholic that of the Indian, each was to reflect, that there was no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the abſurdity of the ſlipper and of the tail; but that the veil of prejudice and cuſtom, which covered it in their own caſe, was withdrawn in the other, they would turn their knowledge to a profitable purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>Having obſerved that bread-fruit had for ſome days been brought in leſs quantities than uſual, we enquired the reaſon; and were told, that there being a great ſhow of fruit upon the trees, they had been thinned all at once, in order to make a kind of four paſte, which the natives call <hi>Mahie,</hi> and which
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:013324_0118_0F90F0AF091804A8"/>
in conſequence of having undergone a fermentation, will keep a conſiderable time, and ſupply them with food when no ripe fruit is to be had.</p>
                        <p>On the 10th, the ceremony was to be performed, in honour of the old woman whoſe ſepulchral tabernacle has juſt been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, by the chief mourner; and Mr. Banks had ſo great a curioſity to ſee all the myſteries of the ſolemnity, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to take a part in it, being told, that he could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent upon no other condition. In the evening, therefore, he repaired to the place where the body lay, and was received by the daughter of the deceaſed, and ſeveral other perſons, among whom was a boy about fourteen years old, who were to aſſiſt in the ceremony. Tubourai Tamaide was to be the principal mourner; and his dreſs, was extremely fantaſtical, though not unbecoming. Mr. Banks was ſtripped of his European clothes, and a ſmall piece of cloth being tied round his middle, his body was ſmeared with charcoal and water, as low as the ſhoulders, till it was as black as that of a negroe: the ſame operation was performed upon ſeveral others, among whom were ſome women, who were reduced to a ſtate as near to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs as himſelf; the boy was blacked all over, and then the proceſſion ſet forward. Tubourai Tamaide uttered ſomething, which was ſuppoſed to be a prayer, near the body; and did the ſame when he came up to his own houſe: when this was done, the proceſſion was continued towards the fort, permiſſion having been obtained to approach it upon this occaſion. It is the cuſtom of the Indians to fly from theſe proceſſions with the utmoſt precipitation, ſo that as ſoon as thoſe who were about the fort, ſaw it at a diſtance, they hid themſelves in the woods. It proceeded from the fort along the ſhore, and put to flight another body of Indians, conſiſting of more than an hundred, every one hiding himſelf under the firſt ſhelter he could find; it then croſſed the river, and entered the woods, paſſing ſeveral houſes, all which were deſerted, and not a ſingle Indian could be ſeen during the reſt of the proceſſion, which continued more than half an hour. The office that Mr. Banks performed, was called that of the <hi>Nineveh,</hi> of which there were two beſides himſelf; and the natives having all diſappeared, they came to the chief mourner, and ſaid <hi>imitata,</hi> there are no people, after which the company was diſmiſſed to waſh themſelves in the river, and put on their cuſtomary apparel.</p>
                        <p>On the 12th, complaint being made to me, by ſome of the natives, that two of the ſeamen had taken from them ſeveral bows and arrows, and ſome ſtrings of plaited hair, I examined the matter, and finding the charge well ſupported, I puniſhed each of the criminals with two dozen laſhes.</p>
                        <p>Their bows and arrows have not been mentioned before,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:013324_0119_0F8FF51F78F67560"/>
nor were they often brought down to the fort: This day, however, Tubourai Tamaide brought down his, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a challenge which he had received from Mr. Gore. The chief ſuppoſed it was to try who could ſend the arrow far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt; Mr. Gore, who beſt could hit the mark: and as Mr. Gore did not value himſelf upon ſhooting to a great diſtance, nor the chief upon hitting a mark, there was no trial of ſkill between them. Tubourai Tamaide, however, to ſhew us what he could do, drew his bow, and ſent an arrow, none of which are feathered, two hundred and ſeventy-four yards, which is ſomething more than a ſeventh, and ſomething leſs than a ſixth part of a mile. Their manner of ſhooting is ſomewhat ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; they kneel down, and the moment the arrow is diſcharged, drop the bow.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Banks, in his morning walk this day, met a number of the natives whom, upon enquiry, he found to be travelling muſicians; and having learnt where they were to be at night, we all repaired to the place. The band conſiſted of two flutes and three drums, and we found a great number of people aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled upon the occaſion. The drummers accompanied the muſic with their voices, and to our great ſurprize, we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that we were generally the ſubject of the ſong. We did not expect to have found among the uncivilized inhabitants of this ſequeſtered ſpot, a character, which has been the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſuch praiſe and veneration where genius and knowledge have been moſt conſpicuous; yet theſe were the bards or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels of Otaheite. Their ſong was unpremiditated, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with muſic; they were, continually going about from place to place, and they were rewarded by the maſter of the houſe, and the audience, with ſuch things as one wanted and the other could ſpare.</p>
                        <p>On the 14th, we were brought into new difficulties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience by another robbery at the fort. In the middle of the night, one of the natives contrived to ſteal an iron coal-rake, that was made uſe of for the oven. It happened to be ſet up againſt the inſide of the wall, ſo that the top of the handle was viſible from without; and we were informed that the thief, who had been ſeen lurking there in the evening, came ſecretly about three o'clock in the morning, and, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his opportunity when the centinel's back was turned, very dexterouſly laid hold of it with a long crooked ſtick, and drew it over the wall. I thought it of ſome conſequence, if poſſible, to put an end to theſe practices at once, by doing ſomething that ſhould make it the common intereſt of the natives them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to prevent them. I had given ſtrict orders that they ſhould not be fired upon, even when detected in theſe attempts, for which I had many reaſons: the common centinels were by no means fit to be entruſted with the power of life and death,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:013324_0120_0F904D287A757828"/>
to be exerted whenever they ſhould think fit, and I had already experienced that they were ready to take away the lives that were in their power, upon the ſlighteſt occaſion; neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did I think that the thefts which theſe people committed againſt us, were, in them, crimes worthy of death: that thieves are hanged in England, I thought no reaſon why they ſhould be ſhot at Otaheite; becauſe, with reſpect to the natives, it would have been an execution by a law <hi>ex poſt facto:</hi> they had no ſuch law among themſelves, and it did not appear to me that we had any right to make ſuch a law for them. That they ſhould abſtain from theft, or be puniſhed with death, was not one of the conditions under which they claimed the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of civil ſociety, as it is among us; and as I was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to expoſe them to fire arms, loaded with ſhot, neither could I perfectly approve of firing only with powder: at firſt indeed, the noiſe and the ſmoak would alarm them, but when they found that no miſchief followed, they would be led to deſpiſe the weapons themſelves, and proceed to inſults, which would make it neceſſary to put them to the teſt, and from which they would be deterred by the very ſight of a gun, if it was never uſed but with effect. At this time, an accident fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed me with what I thought a happy expedient. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that above twenty of their failing canoes were juſt come in with a ſupply of fiſh: upon theſe I immediately ſeized, and bringing them into the river behind the fort, gave public no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that except the rake, and all the reſt of the things which from time to time had been ſtolen, were returned, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> ſhould be burnt. This menace I ventured to publiſh, though I had no deſign to put it into execution, making no doubt but that it was well known in whoſe poſſeſſion the ſtolen goods were, and that as reſtitution was thus made a common cauſe, they would all of them in a ſhort time be brought back. A liſt of the things was made out, conſiſting principally of the rake, the muſquet which had been taken from the marine when the Indian was ſhot; the piſtols which Mr. Banks loſt with his clothes at Atahourou; a ſword belonging to one of the petty-officers, and the water-caſk. About noon, the rake was reſtored, and great ſolicitation was made for the releaſe of the canoes; but I ſtill inſiſted upon my original condition. The next day came, and nothing farther was reſtored, at which I was much ſurprized, for the people were in the utmoſt diſtreſs for the fiſh, which in a ſhort time would be ſpoiled; I was, therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a diſagreeable ſituation, either of releaſing the canoes, contrary to what I had ſolemnly and publickly declared, or to detain them to the great injury of thoſe who were innocent, without anſwering any good purpoſe to ourſelves: as a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary expedient, I permitted them to take the fiſh; but ſtill detained the canoes. This very licence, however, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:013324_0121_0F8FF51F89672A60"/>
of new confuſion and injury; for, it not being eaſy at once to diſtinguiſh to what particular perſons the ſeveral lots of fiſh belonged, the canoes were plundered, under favour of this circumſtance, by thoſe who had no right to any part of their cargo. Moſt preſſing inſtances were ſtill made that the canoes might be reſtored, and I having now the greateſt reaſon to believe, either that the things for which I detained them were not in the iſland, or that thoſe who ſuffered by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention had not ſufficient influence over the thieves to prevail upon them to relinquiſh their booty, determined at length to give them up, not a little mortified at the bad ſucceſs of my project.</p>
                        <p>Another accident alſo about this time was, notwithſtanding all our caution, very near embroiling us with the Indians. I ſent the boat on ſhore with an officer to get ballaſt for the ſhip, and not immediately finding ſtones convenient for the purpoſe, he began to pull down ſome part of an incloſure where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited the bones of their dead: this the Indians violently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and a meſſenger came down to the tents to acquaint the officers that they would not ſuffer it. Mr. Banks immediately repaired to the place, and an amicable end was ſoon put to the diſpute, by ſending the boat's crew to the river, where ſtones enough were to be gathered without a poſſibility of giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. It is very remarkable, that theſe Indians appeared to be much more jealous of what was done to the dead than the living. This was the only meaſure in which they ventured to oppoſe us, and the only inſult that was offered to any indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual among us was upon a ſimilar occaſion. Mr. Monkhouſe happening one day to pull a flower from a tree which grew in one of their ſepulchral incloſures, an Indian, whoſe jealouſy had probably been upon the watch, came ſuddenly behind him, and ſtruck him: Mr. Monkhouſe laid hold of him, but he was inſtantly reſcued by two more, who took hold of Mr. Monk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe's hair, and forced him to quit his hold of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and then run away without offering him any farther violence.</p>
                        <p>In the evening of the 19th, while the canoes were ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, we received a viſit from Oberea, which ſurprized us not a little, as ſhe brought with her none of the things that had been ſtolen, and knew that ſhe was ſuſpected of having ſome of them in her cuſtody. She ſaid indeed, that her favourite Obadee, whom ſhe had beaten and diſmiſſed, had taken them away; but ſhe ſeemed conſcious, that ſhe had no right to be believed: ſhe diſcovered the ſtrongeſt ſigns of fear, yet ſhe ſurmounted it with aſtoniſhing reſolution; and was very preſſing to ſleep with her attendants in Mr. Banks's tent. In this, however, ſhe was not gratified; the affair of the jackets was too recent, and the tent was beſides filled with other people. No body elſe ſeemed
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:013324_0122_0F904D2A3747B008"/>
willing to entertain her, and ſhe therefore, with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of mortification and diſappointment, ſpent the night in her canoe.</p>
                        <p>The next morning early, ſhe returned to the fort, with her canoe and every thing that it contained, putting herſelf wholly into our power, with ſomething like greatneſs of mind, which excited our wonder and admiration. As the moſt effectual means to bring about a reconciliation, ſhe preſented us with a hog, and ſeveral other things, among which was a dog. We had lately learnt, that theſe animals were eſteemed by the Indians as more delicate food than their pork; and upon this occaſion we determined to try the experiment: the dog, which was very fat, we conſigned over to Tupia, who undertook to perform the double office of butcher and cook. He killed him by holding his hands cloſe over his mouth and noſe, an opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which continued above a quarter of an hour. While this was doing, a hole was made in the ground about a foot deep, in which a fire was kindled, and ſome ſmall ſtones placed in layers alternately with the wood to heat; the dog was then ſinged by holding him over the fire, and by ſcraping him with a ſhell, the hair taken off as clean as if he had been ſcalded in hot water: he was then cut up with the ſame inſtrument, and his entrails being taken out, were ſent to the ſea, where being carefully waſhed, they were put into cocoa-nut ſhells, with what blood had come from the body: when the whole was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently heated, the fire was taken out, and ſome of the ſtones, which were not ſo hot as to diſcolour any thing that they touched, being placed at the bottom, were covered with green leaves; the dog, with the entrails, was then placed upon the leaves, and other leaves being laid upon them, the whole was covered with the reſt of the hot ſtones, and the mouth of the hole cloſe ſtopped with mould: in ſomewhat leſs than four hours it was again opened, and the dog taken out excellently baked, and we all agreed that he made a very good diſh. The dogs which are here bred to be eaten, taſte no animal food, but are kept wholly upon bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, yams, and other vegetables of the like kind; all the fleſh and fiſh eaten by the inhabitants is dreſſed in the ſame way.</p>
                        <p>On the 21ſt, we were viſited at the fort by a chief, called Oamo, whom we had never ſeen before, and who was treated by the natives with uncommon reſpect; he brought with him a boy about ſeven years old, and a young woman about ſixteen: the boy was carried upon a man's back, which we conſidered as a piece of ſtate, for he was as well able to walk as any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. As ſoon as they were in ſight, Oberea, and ſeveral other natives who were in the fort, went out to meet them, having firſt uncovered their heads and bodies as low as the waiſt; as they came on, the ſame ceremony was performed by all the
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:013324_0123_0F8FF5203B709938"/>
natives who were without the fort. Uncovering the body, therefore, is in this country probably a mark of reſpect; and as all parts are here expoſed with equal indifference, the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of uncovering it from the waiſt downwards, which was performed by Oorattooa, might be nothing more than a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent mode of compliment, adapted to perſons of a different rank. The chief came into the tent, but no entreaty could prevail upon the young woman to follow him, though ſhe ſeemed to refuſe contrary to her inclination: the natives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out were indeed all very ſolicitous to prevent her; ſometimes when her reſolution ſeemed to fail, almoſt uſing force; the boy alſo they reſtrained in the ſame manner; but Dr. Solander happening to meet him at the gate, took him by the hand, and led him in before the people were aware of it: as ſoon, however, as thoſe that were within ſaw him, they took care to have him ſent out.</p>
                        <p>Theſe circumſtances having ſtrongly excited our curioſity, we enquired who they were, and were informed, that Oamo was the huſband of Oberea, though they had been a long time ſeparated by mutual conſent; and that the young woman and the boy were their children. We learnt alſo, that the boy, whoſe name was Terridiri, was heir apparent to the ſovereignty of the iſland, and that his ſiſter was intended for his wife, the marriage being deferred only till he ſhould arrive at a proper age. The ſovereign at this time was a ſon of Whappai, whoſe name was Outou, and who, as before has been obſerved, was a minor. Whappai, Oamo, and Tootahah, were brothers: Whappai was the eldeſt, and Oama the ſecond; ſo that, Whappai, having no child but Outou, Terridiri, the ſon of his next brother Oamo, was heir to the ſovereignty. It will perhaps, ſeem ſtrange that a boy ſhould be ſovereign during the life of his father; but according to the cuſtom of the country, a child ſucceeds to a father's title and authority as ſoon as it is born: a regent is then elected, and the father of the new ſovereign is generally continued in his authority, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that title, till his child is of age; but, at this time, the choice had fallen upon Tootahah, the uncle, in conſequence of his having diſtinguiſhed himſelf in a war. Oamo aſked many queſtions concerning England and its inhabitants, by which he appeared to have great ſhrewdneſs and underſtanding.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XV. An Account of the Circumnavigation of the Iſland, and various Incidents that happened during the Expedition; with a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Burying-place, and Place of Worſhip, called a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rai.</head>
                        <p>ON Monday the 26th, about three o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſet out in the pinnace, accompanied by Mr. Banks, to make the circuit of the iſland, with a view to ſketch out the coaſt and harbours. We took our route to the eaſtward, and about eight in the forenoon we went on ſhore, in a diſtrict called OAHOUNUE, which is governed by AHIO, a young Chief, whom we had often ſeen at the tents, and who favoured us with his company to breakfaſt. Here alſo we found two other natives of our old acquaintance, TITU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOALO and HOONA, who carried us to their houſes, near which we ſaw the body of the old woman, at whoſe funeral rites Mr. Banks had aſſiſted, and which had been removed hither from the ſpot where it was firſt depoſited, this place having deſcended from her by inheritance to Hoona, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary on that account that it ſhould lie here. We then proceeded on foot, the boat attending within call, to the harbour in which Mr. Bougainville lay, called OHIDEA, where the natives ſhewed us the ground upon which his people pitched their tent, and the brook at which they watered, though no trace of them remained, except the holes where the poles of the tent had been fixed, and a ſmall piece of potſheard, which Mr. Banks found in looking narrowly about the ſpot. We met, however, with ORETTE a Chief who was their principal friend, and whoſe brother OUTORROU went away with them.</p>
                        <p>This harbour lies on the weſt ſide of a great bay, under ſhelter of a ſmall iſland called BOOUROU, near which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other called TAAWIRRII; the breach in the reefs is here very large, but the ſhelter for the ſhips is not the beſt.</p>
                        <p>Soon after we had examined this place, we took boat, and aſked Tituboalo to go with us to the other ſide of the bay; but he refuſed, and adviſed as not to go, for he ſaid the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try there was inhabited by people who were not ſubject to Tootahah, and who would kill both him and us. Upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this intelligence, we did not, as may be imagined, relinquiſh our enterprize; but we immediately loaded our pieces with ball: this was ſo well underſtood by Tituboalo as a precaution which rendered us formidable, that he now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to be of our party.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="98" facs="unknown:013324_0125_0F90F0B1DE3D97A8"/>
Having rowed till it was dark, we reached a low neck of land, or iſthmus, at the bottom of the bay, that divides the iſland into two peninſulas, each of which is a diſtrict or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment wholly independent of the other. From Port-Royal, where the ſhip was at anchor, the coaſt trends E. by S. and E. S. E. ten miles, then S. by E. and S. eleven miles to the iſthmus. In the firſt direction, the ſhore is in general open to the ſea; but in the laſt it is covered by reefs of rocks, which form ſeveral good harbours, with ſafe anchorage, in 16, 18, 20, and 24 fathom of water, with other conveniences. As we had not yet got into our enemy's country, we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſleep on ſhore: we landed, and though we found but few houſes, we ſaw ſeveral double canoes whoſe owners were well known to us, and who provided us with ſupper and lodging; of which Mr. Banks was indebted for his ſhare to Ooratooa, the lady who had paid him her compliments in ſo ſingular a manner at the fort.</p>
                        <p>In the morning, we looked about the country, and found it to be a marſhy flat, about two miles over, acroſs which the natives haul their canoes, to the correſponding bay on the other ſide. We then prepared to continue our rout for what Tituboalo called the other kingdom; he ſaid that the name of it was TIARRABOU, or OTAHEITE ETE; and that of the Chief who governed it, WAHEATUA: upon this occaſion alſo, we learnt that the name of the peninſula where we had taken our ſtation was OPOUREONU, or OTAHEITE NUE. Our new aſſociate ſeemed to be now in better ſpirits than he had been the day before; the people in Tiarrabou would not kill us, he ſaid, but he aſſured us that we ſhould be able to procure no victuals among them; and indeed we had ſeen no bread-fruit ſince we ſet out.</p>
                        <p>After rowing a few miles, we landed in a diſtrict, which was the dominion of a Chief called MARAITATA, the bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place of men; whoſe father's name was PAHAIREDO, the ſtealer of boats. Though theſe names ſeemed to favour the account that had been given by Tituboalo, we ſoon found that it was not true. Both the father and the ſon received us with the greateſt civility, gave us proviſions, and, after ſome delay, ſold us a very large hog for a hatchet. A crowd ſoon gathered round us, but we ſaw only two people that we knew; neither did we obſerve a ſingle bead or ornament among them that had come from our ſhip, tho' we ſaw ſeveral things which had been brought from Europe. In one of the houſes lay two twelve-pound ſhot, one of which was marked with the broad arrow of England, though the people ſaid they had them from the ſhips that lay in Bougainville's har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                        <p>We proceeded on foot till we came to the diſtrict which
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:013324_0126_0F90F0B2053688A0"/>
was immediately under the government of the principal Chief, or King of the peninſula, Waheatua. Waheatua had a ſon, but whether, according to the cuſtom of Opoureonu, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered the government as regent, or in his own right is uncertain. This diſtrict conſiſts of a large and fertile plain, watered by a river ſo wide, that we were obliged to ferry over it in a canoe; our Indian train, however, choſe to ſwim, and took to the water with the ſame facility as a pack of hounds. In this place we ſaw no houſe that appeared to be inhabited, but the ruins of many, that had been very large. We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded along the ſhore, which forms a bay, called OAITI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PEHA, and at laſt we found the Chief ſitting near ſome pretty canoe awnings, under which, we ſuppoſed, he and his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants ſlept. He was a thin old man, with a very white head and beard, and had with him a comely woman, about five and twenty years old, whoſe name was TOUDIDDE. We had often heard the name of this woman, and, from report and obſervation, we had reaſon to think that ſhe was the OBE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REA of this peninſula. From this place, between which and the iſthmus there are other harbours, formed by the reefs that lie along the ſhore, where ſhipping may lie in perfect ſecurity, and from whence the land trends S. S. E. and S. to the S. E, part of the iſland, we were accompanied by TEAREE, the ſon of Waheatua, of whom we had purchaſed a hog, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try we paſſed through appeared to be more cultivated than any we had ſeen in other parts of the iſland: the brooks were every where banked into narrow channels with ſtone, and the ſhore had alſo a facing of ſtone, where it was waſhed by the ſea. The houſes were neither large nor numerous, but the canoes, that were hauled up along the ſhore were almoſt innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, and ſuperior to any that we had ſeen before, both in ſize and make; they were longer, the ſterns were higher, and the awnings were ſupported by pillars. At almoſt every point there was a ſepulchral building, and there were many of them alſo in land. They were of the ſame figure as thoſe in Opou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reonu, but they were cleaner and better kept, and decorated with many carved boards, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ch were ſet upright, and on the top of which were various figures of birds and men: on one in particular there was a repreſentation of a cock, which was painted red and yellow, to imitate the feathers of that animal, and rude images of men were, in ſome of them placed one upon the head of another. But in this part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, however fertile and cultivated, we did not ſee a ſingle bread-fruit; the trees were entirely bare, and the inhabitants ſeemed to ſubſiſt principally upon nuts, which are not unlike a cheſnut, and which they call <hi>Ahee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When we had walked till we were weary, we called up the boat, but both our Indians, Tetuboalo and Tuahow, were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:013324_0127_0F90F0A3B32B8878"/>
they had, it ſeems, ſtayed behind at Waheatua's, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting us to return thither, in conſequence of a promiſe which had been extorted from us, and which we had it not in our power to fulfil.</p>
                        <p>Tearee, however, and another, embarked with us, and we proceeded till we came a-breaſt of a ſmall iſland called OTOO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AREITE; it being then dark, we determined to land, and our Indians conducted us to a place where they ſaid we might ſleep: it was a deſerted houſe, and near it was a little cove, in which the boat might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>e with great ſafety and convenience. We were, however, in want of proviſions, having been very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly ſupplied ſince we ſet out; and Mr. Banks immediately went into the woods to ſee whether any could be procured. As it was dark, he met with no people, and could find but one houſe that was inhabited: a bread-fruit and a half, a few Ahees, and ſome fire, were all that it afforded; upon which, with a duck or two, and a few curlieus, we made our ſupper, which, if not ſcanty, was diſagreeable by the want of bread, with which we had neglected to furniſh ourſelves, as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon meeting with bread-fruit, and took up our lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the awning of a canoe, belonging to Tearee, which followed us.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, after having ſpent ſome time in another fruitleſs attempt to procure a ſupply of proviſions, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded round the ſouth-eaſt point, part of which is not covered by any reef, but lies open to the ſea; and here the hill riſes directly from the ſhore. At the ſouthermoſt part of the iſland, the ſhore is again covered by a reef, which forms a good har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and the land about it is very fertile. We made this rout partly on foot, and partly in the boat: when we had walked about three miles, we arrived at a place where we ſaw ſeveral large canoes, and a number of people with them, whom we were agreeably ſurpriſed to find were of our intimate acquaintance. Here, with much difficulty, we procured ſome cocoa-nuts, and then embarked, taking with us Tuahow, one of the Indians who had waited for us at Waheatua's, and had returned the night before, long after it was dark.</p>
                        <p>When we came a-breaſt of the ſouth-eaſt end of the iſland, we went aſhore, by the advice of our Indian guide, who told us that the country was rich and good. The Chief, whoſe name was MATHIABO, ſoon came down to us, but ſeemed to be a total ſtranger both to us and to our trade: his ſubjects, however, brought us plenty of cocoa-nuts, and about twenty bread fruit. The bread-fruit we bought at a very dear rate, but his Excellency ſold us a pig for a glaſs bottle, which he preferred to every thing elſe that we could give him. We found in his poſſeſſion a gooſe and a turkey-cock, which, we were informed, had been left upon the iſland by the Dolphin:
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:013324_0128_0F904D2A70B8DEB0"/>
they were both enormouſly fat, and ſo tame that they followed the Indians, who were fond of them to exceſs, wherever they went.</p>
                        <p>In a long houſe in this neighbourhood, we ſaw what was altogether new to us. At one end of it, faſtened to a ſemicir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular board, hung fifteen human jaw-bones; they appeared to be freſh, and there was not one of them that wanted a ſingle tooth. A ſight ſo extraordinary ſtrongly excited our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, and we made many enquiries about it; but at this time could get no information, for the people either could not, or would not underſtand us.</p>
                        <p>When we left this place, the Chief, Mathiabo, deſired leave to accompany us, which was readily granted. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with us the remainder of the day, and proved very uſeful, by piloting us over the ſhoals. In the evening, we opened the bay on the north weſt ſide of the iſland, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to that on the ſouth eaſt, ſo as at the iſthmus, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying place, almoſt to interſect the iſland, as I have obſerved before; and when we had coaſted about two thirds of it, we determined to go on ſhore for the night. We ſaw a large houſe at ſome diſtance, which, Mathiabo informed us, belonged to one of his friends; and ſoon after ſeveral canoes came off to meet us, having on board ſome very handſome women, who, by their behaviour, ſeemed to have been ſeen to entice us on ſhore. As we had before reſolved to take up our reſidence here for the night, little invitation was neceſſary. We found that the houſe belonged to the Chief of the diſtrict, whoſe name was WIVEROU: He received us in a very friendly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ordered his people to aſſiſt us in dreſſing our provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of which we had now got a tolerable ſtock. When our ſupper was ready, we were conducted into that part of the houſe where Wiverou was ſitting, in order to eat it; Mathia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo ſupped with us, and Wiverou calling for his ſupper at the ſame time, we eat our meal very ſociably, and with great good humour. When it was over, we began to enquire where we were to ſleep, and a part of the houſe was ſhewn us, of which we were told we might take poſſeſſion for that purpoſe. We then ſent for our cloaks, and Mr. Banks began to undreſs, as his cuſtom was, and, with a precaution which he had been taught by the loſs of his jackets at Atahourou, ſent his clothes aboard the boat, propoſing to cover himſelf with a piece of Indian cloth. When Mathiabo perceived what was doing, he alſo pretended to want a cloak; and, as he had behaved very well, and done us ſome ſervice, a cloak was ordered for him. We lay down, and obſerved that Mathiabo was not with us; but we ſuppoſed that he was gone to bathe, as the Indians al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do before they ſleep. We had not waited long, however, when an Indian, who was a ſtranger to us, came and told Mr.
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:013324_0129_0F90F0A470DDDF58"/>
Banks that the cloak and Mathiabo had diſappeared together. This man had ſo far gained our confidence, that we did not at firſt believe the report; but it being ſoon after confirmed by Tuahow, our own Indian, we knew no time was to be loſt. As it was impoſſible for us to purſue the thief, with any hope of ſucceſs, without the aſſiſtance of the people about us, Mr. Banks ſtarted up, and telling our caſe, required them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the cloak; and to enforce his requiſition, ſhewed one of his pocket piſtols, which he always kept about him. Upon the ſight of the piſtol, the whole company took the alarm, and, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſtead of aſſiſting to catch the thief, or recover what had been ſtolen, began with great precipitation to leave the place; one of them, however, was ſeized, upon which he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately offered to direct the chace: I ſet out therefore with Mr. Banks, and though we ran all the way, the alarm had got before us, for in about ten minutes we met a man bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back the cloak, which the thief had relinquiſhed in great terror; and as we did not then think fit to continue the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, he made his eſcape. When we returned we found the houſe, in which there had been between two and three hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red people, entirely deſerted. It being, however, ſoon known that we had no reſentment againſt any body but Mathiabo, the Chief Wiverou, our hoſt, with his wife and many others, returned, and took up their lodging with us for the night. In this place, however, we were deſtined to more confuſion and trouble, for about five o'clock in the morning our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try alarmed us, with an account that the boat was miſſing: he had ſeen her, he ſaid, about half an hour before, at her grappling, which was not above fifty yards from the ſhore; but upon hearing the ſound of oars, he had looked out again, and could ſee nothing of her. At this account we ſtarted up greatly alarmed, and ran to the water ſide: the morning was clear and ſtar light, ſo that we could ſee to a conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but there was no appearance of the boat. Our ſituation was now ſuch as might juſtify the moſt terrifying apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; as it was a dead calm, and we could not therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her to have broken from her grapling, we had great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear that the Indians had attacked her, and finding the people aſleep, had ſucceeded in their enterprize: we were but four, with only one muſquet, and two pocket piſtols, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſpare ball or charge of powder for either. In this ſtate of anxiety and diſtreſs we remained a conſiderable time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Indians every moment to improve their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, when, to our unſpeakable ſatisfaction, we ſaw the boat return, which had been driven from her grappling by the tide; a circumſtance to which, in our confuſion and ſurpriſe, we did not advert.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as the boat returned, we got our breakfaſt, and
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:013324_0130_0F90F0B2B29E6F60"/>
were impatient to leave the place, leſt ſome other vexatious accident ſhould befall us. It is ſituated on the north ſide of Tiarrabou, the ſouth eaſt peninſula, or diviſion, of the iſland, and at the diſtance of about five miles ſouth eaſt from the iſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, having a large and commodious harbour, inferior to none in the iſland, about which the land is very rich in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. Notwithſtanding we had had little communication with this diviſion, the inhabitants every where received us in a friendly manner; we found the whole of it fertile and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and to all appearance, in a more flouriſhing ſtate than Opoureonu, though it is not above one fourth part as large.</p>
                        <p>The next diſtrict in which we landed, was the laſt in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrabou, and governed by a chief, whoſe name we underſtood to be OMOE. Omoe was building a houſe, and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very deſirous of procuring a hatchet, he would have been glad to have purchaſed one with any thing that he had in his poſſeſſion; it happened, however, rather unfortunately for him and us, that we had not one hatchet, left in the boat. We offered to trade with nails, but he would not part with any thing in exchange for them; we therefore reimbarked, and put off our boat, but the chief being unwilling to relinquiſh all hope of obtaining ſomething from us that would be of uſe to him, embarked in a canoe, with his wife WHANNO-OUDA, and followed us. After ſome time, we took them into the boat, and when we had rowed about a league, they deſired we would put aſhore: we immediately complied with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and found ſome of his people who had brought down a very large hog, we were as unwilling to loſe the hog, as the chief was to part with us, and it was indeed worth the beſt ax we had in the ſhip; we therefore hit upon an expedient, and told him, that if he would bring his hog to the fort at MAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AVAI, the Indian name for Port Royal Bay, he ſhould have a large axe, and a nail into the bargain, for his trouble. To this propoſal, after having conſulted with his wife, he agreed, and gave us a large piece of his country cloth as a pledge that he would perform his agreement, which, however, he never did.</p>
                        <p>At this place we ſaw a very ſingular curioſity: it was the figure of a man, conſtructed of baſket work, rudely made, but not ill deſigned; it was ſomething more than ſeven feet high, and rather too bulky in proportion to its height. The wicker ſkeleton was completely covered with feathers, which were white where the ſkin was to appear, and black in the parts which it is their cuſtom to paint or ſtain, and upon the head, where there was to be a repreſentation of hair: upon the head alſo were four protuberances, three in front and one behind, which we ſhould have called horns, but which the Indians dignified with the name of TATE ETE, little men. The image was called MANIOE, and was ſaid to be the only
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:013324_0131_0F90EC7CECE83740"/>
one of the kind in Otaheite. They attempted to give us an explanation of its uſe and deſign, but we had not then acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enough of their language to underſtand them. We learnt, however, afterwards, that it was a repreſentation of Mauwe, one of their Eatuas, or gods of the ſecond claſs.</p>
                        <p>After having ſettled our affairs with Omoe, we proceeded on our return, and ſoon reached Opoureonu, the north-weſt peninſula. After rowing a few miles, we went on ſhore again, but the only thing we ſaw worth notice, was a repoſitory for the dead, uncommonly decorated: the pavement was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely neat, and upon it was raiſed a pyramid, about five feet high, which was entirely covered with the fruits of two plants, peculiar to the country. Near the pyramid was a ſmall image of ſtone, of very rude workmanſhip, and the firſt inſtance of carving in ſtone that we had ſeen among theſe people. They appeared to ſet a high value upon it, for it was covered from the weather by a ſhed, that had been erected on purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>We proceeded in the boat; and paſſed through the only harbour, on the ſouth ſide of Opoureonu, that is fit for ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. It is ſituated about five miles to the weſtward of the iſthmus, between two ſmall iſlands that lie near the ſhore, and about a mile diſtant from each other, and affords good anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in eleven and twelve fathom water. We were now not far from the diſtrict called PAPARRA, which belonged to our friends Oamo and Oberea, where we propoſed to ſleep. We went on ſhore about an hour before night, and found that they were both abſent, having left their habitations to pay us a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit at Matavai: this, however, did not alter our purpoſe, we took up our quarters at the houſe of Oberea, which, though ſmall, was very neat, and at this time had no inhabitant but her father, who received us with looks that bid us welcome. Having taken poſſeſſion, we were willing to improve the little day-light that was left us, and therefore walked out to a point, upon which we had ſeen, at a diſtance, trees that are here called <hi>Etoa,</hi> which generally diſtinguiſh the places where theſe people bury the bones of their dead: their name for ſuch bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying-grounds, which are alſo places of worſhip, is MORAI, we were ſoon ſtruck with the ſight of an enormous pile, which we were told was the Morai of Oamo and Oberea, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal piece of Indian architecture in the iſland. It was a pile of ſtone work, raiſed pyramidically, upon an oblong baſe, or ſquare, 276 feet long, and eighty-ſeven wide. It was built like the ſmall pyramidal mounts upon which we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fix the pillar of a ſun-dial, where each ſide is a flight of ſteps; the ſteps, however, at the ſides, were broader than thoſe at the ends, ſo that it terminated not in a ſquare of the ſame figure with the baſe, but in a ridge, like the roof of a houſe: there were eleven of theſe ſteps, each of which was
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:013324_0132_0F90F0B372E53490"/>
4 feet high, ſo that the height of the pile was 44 feet, each ſtep was formed of one courſe of white coral ſtone, which was neatly ſquared and poliſhed, the reſt of the maſs, for there was no hollow within, conſiſted of round pebles, which, from the regularity of their figure, ſeemed to have been wrought. Some of the coral ſtones were very large; we meaſured one of them, and found it three feet and an half, by two feet and an half. The foundation was of rock ſtones, which were alſo ſquared; and one of them meaſured four feet ſeven inches by two feet four. Such a ſtructure, raiſed without the aſſiſtance of iron tools to ſhape the ſtones, or mortar to join them, ſtruck us with aſtoniſhment: it ſeemed to be as compact and firm as it could have been made by any workman in Europe, except that the ſteps, which range along its greateſt length, are not perfectly ſtrait, but ſink in a kind of hollow in the middle, ſo that the whole ſurface, from end to end, is not a right line, but a curve. The quarry ſtones, as we ſaw no quarry in the neighbourhood, muſt have been brought from a conſiderable diſtance; and there is no method of conveyance here but by hand: the coral muſt alſo have been fiſhed from under the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where, though it may be found in plenty, it lies at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable depth, never leſs than three feet. Both the rock ſtone and the coral could be ſquared only by tools made of the ſame ſubſtance, which muſt have been a work of incredible la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but the poliſhing was more eaſily effected by means of the ſharp coral ſand, which is found every where upon the ſea ſhore in great abundance. In the middle of the top ſtood the image of a bird, carved in wood; and near is lay the broken one of a fiſh, carved in ſtone. The whole of this pyramid made part of one ſide of a ſpacious area or ſquare, nearly of equal ſides, being three hundred and ſixty feet by three hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fifty-four, which was walled in with ſtone, and paved with flat ſtones in its whole extent; though there were growing in it, notwithſtanding the pavement, ſeveral of the trees which they call <hi>Etoa,</hi> and plantains. About an hundred yards to the weſt of this building, was another paved area or court, in which were ſeveral ſmall ſtages raiſed on wooden pillars, about ſeven feet high, which are called by the Indians Ewattas, and ſeem to be a kind of altars, as upon theſe are placed proviſions of all kinds, as offerings to their gods; we have ſince ſeen whole hogs placed upon them, and we found here the ſkulls of above fifty, beſides the ſkulls of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of dogs.</p>
                        <p>The principal object of ambition among theſe people is to have a magnificent Morai, and this was a ſtriking memorial of the rank and power of Oberea. It has been remarked that we did not find her inveſted with the ſame authority that ſhe exerciſed when the Dolphin was at this place, and
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:013324_0133_0F90F0B43409B378"/>
we now learnt the reaſon of it. Our way from her houſe to the Morai lay along the ſea ſide, and we obſerved every where under our feet a great number of human bones, chiefly ribs and vertebrae. Upon enquiring into the cauſe of ſo ſingular an appearance, we were told, that in the then laſt month of <hi>Owarahew,</hi> which anſwered to our December, 1768, about four or five months before our arrival, the people of Tiarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bou, the S. E. peninſula, which we had juſt viſited, made a deſcent at this place, and killed a great number of people, whoſe bones were thoſe that we ſaw upon the ſhore: that, upon this occaſion, Oberea, and Oamo, who then adminiſtered the government for his ſon, had fled to the mountains; and that the conquerors burnt all the houſes, which were very large, and carried away the hogs and what other animals they found. We learnt alſo, that the turkey and gooſe, which we had ſeen when we were with Mathiabo, the ſtealer of cloaks, were among the ſpoils; this accounted for their being found among people with whom the Dolphin had little or no communication; and upon mentioning the jaw-bones, which we had ſeen hanging from a board in a long houſe, we were told, that they alſo had been carried away as trophies; the people here carrying away the jaw-bones of their enemies, as the Indians of North Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica do the ſcalps.</p>
                        <p>After having thus gratified our curioſity, we returned to our quarters, where we paſſed the night in perfect ſecurity and quiet. By the next evening we arrived at Atahourou, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of our friend Tootahah, where, the laſt time we paſſed the night under his protection, we had been obliged to leave the beſt part of our clothes behind us. This adventure, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſeemed now to be forgotten on both ſides. Our friends received us with great pleaſure, and gave us a good ſupper and a good lodging, where we ſuffered neither loſs or diſturbance.</p>
                        <p>The next day, Saturday, July the 1ſt, we got back to our fort at Matavai, having found the circuit of the iſland, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding both peninſulas, to be about thirty leagues. Upon our complaining of the want of bread-fruit, we were told, that the produce of the laſt ſeaſon was nearly exhauſted; and that what was ſeen ſprouting upon the trees, would not be fit to uſe in leſs than three months; this accounted for our hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been able to procure ſo little of it in our route.</p>
                        <p>While the bread-fruit is ripening upon the flats, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are ſupplied in ſome meaſure from the trees which they have planted upon the hills to preſerve a ſucceſſion; but the quantity is not ſufficient to prevent ſcarcity: they live there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon the four paſte which they call <hi>Mahie,</hi> upon wild plantains, and ahee-nuts, which at this time are in perfection. How it happened that the Dolphin, which was here at this ſeaſon, found ſuch plenty of bread-fruit upon the trees, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:013324_0134_0F904D2B3A91C640"/>
tell, except the ſeaſon in which they ripen varies.</p>
                        <p>At our return our Indian friends crouded about us, and none of them came empty-handed. Though I had determined to reſtore the canoes which had been detained to their owners, it had not yet been done; but I now releaſed them as they were applied for. Upon this occaſion I could not but remark with concern, that theſe people were capable of practiſing petty frauds againſt each other, with a deliberate diſhoneſty, which gave me a much worſe opinion of them than I had ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained from the robberies they committed under the ſtrong temptation to which a ſudden opportunity of enriching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the ineſtimable metal and manufactures of Europe expoſed them.</p>
                        <p>Among others who appied to me for the releaſe of a canoe, was one POTATTOW, a man of ſome conſequence, well known to us all. I conſented, ſuppoſing the veſſel to be his own, or that he applied on behalf of a friend: he went immediately to the beach, and took poſſeſſion of one of the boats, which, with the aſſiſtance of his people, he began to carry off. Upon this, however, it was eagerly claimed by the right owners, who, ſupported by the other Indians, clamorouſly reproached him for invading their property, and prepared to take the canoe from him by force. Upon this, he deſired to be heard, and told them, that the canoe did, indeed, once belong to thoſe who claimed it; but that I, having ſeized it as a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, had ſold it to him for a pig. This ſilenced the clamour, the owners, knowing that from my power there is no appeal, acquieſced; and Potattow would have carried off his prize, if the diſpute had not fortunately been overheard by ſome of our people, who reported it to me. I gave orders immediately that the Indians ſhould be undeceived; upon which the right owners took poſſeſſion of their canoe, and Potattow was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of his guilt, that neither he nor his wife, who was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to his knavery, could look us in the face for ſome time afterwards.</p>

                        <p>ON the third Mr. Banks ſet out early in the morning, with ſome Indian guides, to trace our river up the valley from which it iſſues, and examine how far its banks were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited. For about ſix miles they met with houſes, not far

They ſeemed, indeed, not much to be acquainted with the valley beyond this place, their buſineſs bring chiefly upon the declivity of the rocks on each ſide, and the plains which extended on their ſummits, where they found plenty of a wild plantain, which they called <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

One of theſe ropes was nearly thirty feet in length, and their guides offered to aſſiſt them in mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this paſs, but recommended another at a little diſtance lower down, as leſs difficult and dangerous. They took a view of this "better way," but found it ſo bad that they did not chuſe to attempt it, as there was nothing at the top to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their full and hazard but a ſtore of the wild plantain of Vae tree, which they had often ſeen before.</p>
                        <p>During this excurſion, Mr. Banks had an excellent opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to examine the rocks, which were almoſt every where naked, for minerals; but he found not the leaſt appearance of any.

It may alſo be remarked upon this occaſion, that the moſt probable cauſe of earthquakes ſeems to be the ſudden ruſhing in of water upon ſome vaſt maſs of ſubterraneous fire, by the inſtantaneous rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of which into vapour, the mine is ſprung, and various ſubſtances in all ſtages of vitrification, with ſhells and other marine productions, that are now found foſſil, and the ſtrata that covered the furnace, are thrown up, while thoſe parts of the land which were ſupported upon the broken ſhell give way, and flak into the gulph. With this theory the phaenomena of all earthquakes form to agree; pools of water are frequently left where land has ſubſided, and various ſubſtances which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appear to have ſuffered by the action of fire, are thrown up. It is indeed true, that fire cannot ſubſiſt without air; but this cannot be urged againſt there being fire below that part of the earth which forms the bed of the ſea; becauſe there may be innumerable fiſſures by which a communication between thoſe parts and the external air may be kept up, even upon the higheſt mountains, and at the greateſt diſtance from the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore.</p>
                        <p>On the 4th, Mr. Banks employed himſelf in planting a great quantity of the ſeeds of water-melons, oranges, lemons, limes, and other plants and trees which he had collected at Rio de Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neiro.

He alſo gave liberally of theſe ſeeds to the Indians, and planted many of them in the woods; ſome of the melon ſeeds having been planted ſoon after our arrival, the natives ſhewed him ſeveral of the plants which appeared to be in the moſt flouriſhing condition, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="110" facs="unknown:013324_0137_0F90F0B5B78A9508"/>
their ſon and daughter; the Indians expreſſing their reſpect by uncovering the upper parts of their body as they had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The daughter, whoſe name we underſtood to be Toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata, was very deſirous to ſee the fort, but her father would by no means ſuffer her to come in. Tearee, the ſon of Waheatua, the ſovereign of Tiarrabou, the ſouth eaſt peninſula, was alſo with us at this time; and we received intelligence of the landing of another gueſt, whoſe company was neither expected nor deſired: this was no other than the ingenious gentleman who contrived to ſteal our quadrant. We were told, that he intended to try his fortune again in the night; but the Indians all offered very zealouſly to aſſiſt us againſt him, deſiring that, for this purpoſe, they might be permitted to lie in the fort. This had ſo good an effect, that the thief relinquiſhed his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize in deſpair.</p>
                        <p>On the 7th, the carpenters were employed in taking down the gates and palliſadoes of our little fortification, for firewood on board the ſhip; and one of the Indians had dexterity enough to ſteal the ſtaple and hook upon which the gate turned: he was immediately purſued, and after a chace of ſix miles, he appeared to have been paſſed, having concealed himſelf among ſome ruſhes in the brook; the ruſhes were ſearched, and tho' the thief had eſcaped, a ſcraper was found which had been ſtolen from the ſhip ſometime before; and ſoon after our old friend Tubourai Tamaide brought us the ſtaple.</p>
                        <p>On the 8th and 9th, we continued to diſmantle our fort, and our friends ſtill flocked about us; ſome, I believe, ſorry at the approach of our departure, and others deſirous to make as much as they could of us while we ſtaid.</p>
                        <p>We were in hopes that we ſhould now leave the iſland, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving or receiving any other offence; but it unfortunately happened otherwiſe. Two foreign ſeamen having been out with my permiſſion, one of them was robbed of his knife, and endeavouring to recover it, probably with circumſtances of great provocation, the Indians attacked him and dangerouſly wounded him with a ſtone; they wounded his companion alſo ſlightly in the head, and then fled into the mountains. As I ſhould have been ſorry to take any farther notice of the affair, I was not diſpleaſed that the offenders had eſcaped; but I was immediately involved in a quarrel which I very much regretted, and which yet it was not poſſible to avoid.</p>
                        <p>In the middle of the night between the 8th and 9th, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Webb and Samuel Gibſon, two of the marines, both young men, went privately from the fort, and in the morning were not to be found. As public notice had been given, that all hands were to go on board on the next day, and that the ſhip would ſail on the morrow of that day or the day following, I began to fear that the abſentees intended to ſtay behind. I knew
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:013324_0138_0F90F0B67297C070"/>
that I could take no effectual ſteps to recover them, without endangering the harmony and good will which at preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted among us; and therefore, determined to wait a day for the chance of their return.</p>
                        <p>On Monday morning the 10th, the marines, to my great concern, not being returned, an enquiry was made after them of the Indians, who frankly told us that they did not intend to return, and had taken refuge in the mountains, where it was impoſſible for our people to find them. They were then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to aſſiſt in the ſearch, and after ſome deliberation, two of them undertook to conduct ſuch perſons as I ſhould think proper to ſend after them to the place of their retreat. As they were known to be without arms, I thought two would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and accordingly diſpatched a petty officer, and the corporal of the marines, with the Indian guides, to fetch them back. As the recovery of theſe men was a matter of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as I had no time to loſe, and as the Indians ſpoke doubtfully of their return, telling us, that they had each of them taken a wife, and were become inhabitants of the country, it was intimated to ſeveral of the chiefs who were in the fort with their women, among whom were Tubourai Tamaide, Tomio, and Oberea, that they would not be permitted to leave it till our deſerters were brought back. This precaution I thought the more neceſſary, as by concealing them a few days, they might compel me to go without them; and I had the pleaſure to obſerve, that they received the intimation with very little ſigns either of fear or diſcontent; aſſuring me that my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be ſecured and ſent back as ſoon as poſſible. While this was doing at the fort. I ſent Mr. Hicks in the pinnace to fetch Tootahah on board the ſhip, which he did, without alarming either him or his people. If the Indian guides proved faithful and in earneſt, I had reaſon to expect the return of my people with the deſerters before evening. Being diſappointed, my ſuſpicions increaſed; and night coming on, I thought it was not ſafe to let the people whom I had detained as hoſtages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue at the fort, and I therefore ordered Tubourai Tamaide, Oberea, and ſome others, to be taken on board the ſhip. This ſpread a general alarm, and ſeveral of them, eſpecially the women, expreſſed their apprehenſions with great emotion and many tears when they were put into the boat. I went on board with them, and Mr. Banks remained on ſhore, with ſome others whom I thought it of leſs conſequence to ſecure.</p>
                        <p>About nine o'clock, Webb was brought back by ſome of the natives, who declared, that Gibſon, and the petty officer and corporal, would be detained till Tootahah ſhould be ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. The tables were now turned upon me; but I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded too far to retreat. I immediately diſpatched Mr. Hicks in the long boat, with a ſtrong party of men, to reſcue the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:013324_0139_0F8FF5214314D180"/>
and told Tootahah that it behoved him to ſend ſome of his people with them, with orders to afford them effectual aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and to demand the releaſe of my men in his name, for that I ſhould expect him to anſwer for the contrary. He readily complied; this party recovered my men without the leaſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and about ſeven o'clock in the morning, returned with them to the ſhip, though they had not been able to recover the arms which had been taken from them when they were ſeized; theſe however, were brought on board in leſs than half an hour, and the chiefs were immediately ſet at liberty.</p>
                        <p>When I queſtioned the petty officer concerning what had happened on ſhore, he told me, that neither the natives who went with him, nor thoſe whom they met in their way, would give them any intelligence of the deſerters; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, became very troubleſome: that, as he was returning for further orders to the ſhip, he and his comrade were ſuddenly ſeized, by a number of armed men, who having learnt that Tootahah was confined, had concealed themſelves in a wood for that purpoſe, and who having taken them at a diſadvantage, forced their weapons out of their hands, and declared, that they would detain them till their chief ſhould be ſet at liberty. He ſaid, however, that the Indians were not unanimous in this meaſure; that ſome were for ſetting them at liberty, and others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 line">

Thus it appears that whatever were the diſadvantages of ſeizing the chiefs, I ſhould never have recovered my men by any other method. When the chiefs were ſet on ſhore from the ſhip, thoſe at the fort were alſo ſet at liberty, and, after ſtaying with Mr. Banks about an hour, they all went away. Upon this occaſion, as they had done upon another of the ſame kind, they expreſſed their joy by an undeſerved liberality, ſtrongly urging us to accept of four hogs. Theſe we abſolutely refuſed as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and they as abſolutely refuſing to be paid for them, the hogs did not change maſters. Upon examining the deſerters, we found that the account which the Indians had given of them was true: they had ſtrongly attached themſelves to two girls, and it was their intention to conceal themſelves till the ſhip had ſailed, and take up their reſidence upon the iſland. This night every thing was got off from the ſhore, and every body ſlept on board.</p>
                        <p>Among the natives who were almoſt conſtantly with us,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:013324_0140_0F90F0B73926F370"/>
was Tupia, whoſe name has been often mentioned in this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative. He had been, as I have before obſerved, the firſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Oberea, when ſhe was in the height of her power: he was alſo the chief Tahowa or prieſt of the iſland, conſequently well acquainted with the religion of the country, as well with reſpect to its ceremonies as principles. He had alſo great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and knowledge in navigation, and was particularly acquainted with the number and ſituation of the neigbouring iſlands. This man had often expreſſed a deſire to go with us, and on the 12th in the morning, having with the other natives left us the day before, he came on board, with a boy about thirteen years of age, his ſervant, and urged us to let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with us on our voyage. To have ſuch a perſon on board was certainly deſirable for many reaſons; by learning his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and teaching him ours, we ſhould be able to acquire a much better knowledge of the cuſtoms, policy, and religion of the people, than our ſhort ſtay among them could give us, I therefore gladly agreed to receive them on board. As we were prevented from ſailing to day, by having found it neceſſary to make new ſtocks to our ſmall and beſt bower anchors, the old ones having been totally deſtroyed by the worms, Tupia ſaid, he would go once more on ſhore, and make a ſignal for the boat to fetch him off in the evening. He went accordingly, and took with him a miniature picture of Mr. Banks's, to ſhew his friends, and ſeveral little things to give them as parting preſents.</p>
                        <p>After dinner, Mr. Banks being deſirous to procure a drawing of the Morai belonging to Tootahah at Eparre, I attended him thither, accompanied by Dr. Solander, in the pinnace. As ſoon as we landed, many of our friends came to meet us, though ſome abſented themſelves in reſentment of what had happened the day before. We immediately proceeded to Too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tahah's houſe, where we were joined by Oberea, with ſeveral others who had not come out to meet us, and a perfect recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation was ſoon brought about; in conſequence of which they promiſed to viſit us early the next day, to take a laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of us, as we told them we ſhould certainly ſet ſail in the afternoon. At this place alſo we found Tupia, who returned with us, and ſlept this night on board the ſhip for the firſt time.</p>
                        <p>On the next morning, Thurſday the 13th of July, the ſhip was very early crouded with our friends, and ſurrounded by a multitude of canoes, which were filled with the natives of an inferior claſs. Between eleven and twelve we weighed anchor, and as ſoon as the ſhip was under ſail, the Indians on board took their leaves, and wept, with a decent and ſilent ſorrow, in which there was ſomething very ſtriking and tender: the people in the canoes, on the contrary, ſeemed to vie with each
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:013324_0141_0F90F0B7F4DD3FB8"/>
other in the loudneſs of their lamentations, which we conſidered rather as affectation than grief. Tupia ſuſtained himſelf in this ſcene with a firmneſs and reſolution truly admirable; he wept indeed, but the effort that he made to conceal his tears, concurred with them, to do him honour. He ſent his laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, a ſhirt, by Otheothea, to Potomai, Tootaha's favourite miſtreſs, and then went with Mr. Banks to the maſt-head, waving to the canoes as long as they continued in ſight.</p>
                        <p>Thus we took leave of Otaheite, and its inhabitants, after a ſtay of juſt three months; for much the greater part of the time we lived together in the moſt cordial friendſhip, and a perpetual reciprocation of good offices. The accidental dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences which now and then happened, could not be more ſincerely regretted on their part than they were on ours; the principal cauſes were ſuch as neceſſarily reſulted from our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and circumſtances, in conjunction with the infirmities of human nature, from our not being able perfectly to underſtand each other, and from the diſpoſition of the inhabitants to theft, which we could not at all times bear with or prevent. They had not, however, except in one inſtance, been attended with any fatal conſequence; and to that accident were owing the meaſures that I took to prevent others of the ſame kind, I hoped, indeed, to have availed myſelf of the impreſſion which had been made upon them by the lives that had been ſacrificed in their conteſt with the Dolphin, ſo as that the intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us ſhould have been carried on wholly without blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; and by this hope all my meaſures were directed during the whole of my continuance at the iſland, and I ſincerely wiſh, that whoever ſhall next viſit it, may be ſtill more fortunate. Our traffick here was carried on with as much order as in the beſt regulated market in Europe. It was managed principally by Mr. Banks, who was indefatigable in procuring proviſion and refreſhments while they were to be had; but during the latter part of our time they became ſcarce, partly by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed conſumption at the fort and ſhip, and partly by the coming on of the ſeaſon in which cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit fail All kind of fruit, we purchaſed for beads and nails, but no nails leſs than fortypenny were current: after a very ſhort time we could never get a pig of more than ten or twelve pounds, for leſs than a hatchet; becauſe, though theſe people ſet a high value upon ſpike nails, vet theſe being an article with which many of the people in the ſhip were provided, the women found a much more eaſy way of procuring them than by bringing down proviſions.</p>
                        <p>The beſt articles for traffick here are axes, hatchets, ſpikes, large nails, looking-glaſſes, knives, and beads, for ſome of which, every thing that the natives have may be procured. They are indeed fond of fine linen cloth, both white and
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:013324_0142_0F90F0B8B6F75D88"/>
printed; but an ax worth half a crown, will fetch more than a piece of cloth worth twenty ſhillings.</p>

                        <p>WE found the longitude of Port-Royal bay, in this iſland, as ſettled by Captain Wallis, who diſcovered it on the 9th of June 1767, to be within half a degree of the truth. We found Point Venus, the northern extremity of the iſland, and the eaſtern point of the bay, to lie in the longitude of 149° 30′ this being the mean reſult of a great number of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made upon the ſpot. The iſland is ſurrounded by a reef of coral rock, which forms ſeveral excellent bays and harbours, ſome of which have been particularly deſcribed, where there is room and depth of water for any number of the largeſt ſhips. Port-Royal bay, called by the natives Matavai, which is not inferior to any in Otaheite, may eaſily be known by a very high mountain in the middle of the iſland, which bears due South from Point Venus. To ſail into it, either keep the weſt point of the reef that lies before Point Venus, cloſe on board, or give it a birth of near half a mile, in order to avoid a ſmall ſhoal of coral rocks on which there is but two fathom and an half of water. The beſt anchoring is on the eaſtern ſide of the bay, where there is ſixteen and fourteen fathom upon an ouſey bottom. The ſhore of the bay is a fine ſandy beach, behind which runs a river of freſh water, ſo that any number of ſhips may water here without incommoding each other; but the only wood for firing, upon the whole iſland, is that of fruit trees, which muſt be purchaſed of the natives, or all hopes of living upon good terms with them given up. There are ſome harbours to the weſtward of this bay which have not been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but as they are contiguous to it, a deſcription of them is neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>The face of the country, except that part of it which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon the ſea, is very uneven; it riſes in ridges that run up into the middle of the iſland, and there form mountains, which may be ſeen at the diſtance of ſixty miles: between the foot of theſe ridges and the ſea, is a border of low land, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding the whole iſland, except in a few places, where the ridges riſe directly from the ſea; the border of low land is in different parts of different breadths, but no where more than a mile and a half. The ſoil, except upon the very tops of the
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:013324_0143_0F8FF52207FC5790"/>
ridges, is extremely rich and fertile, watered by a great number of rivulets of excellent water, and covered with fruit trees of various kinds, ſome of which are of a ſtately growth and thick foliage, ſo as to form one continued wood; and even the tops of the ridges, though in general they are bare, and burnt up by the ſun, are, in ſome parts, not without their produce.</p>
                        <p>The low land that lies between the foot of the ridges and the ſea, and ſome of the vallies, are the only parts of the iſland that are inhabited, and here it is populous; the houſes do not form villages or towns, but are ranged along the whole border at the diſtance of about fifty yards from each other, with little plantations of plantains, the tree which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes them with cloth. The whole iſland, according to Tupia's account, who certainly knew, could furniſh ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſeven hundred and eighty fighting men, from which the number of inhabitants may eaſily be computed.</p>
                        <p>The produce of this iſland is bread fruit, cocoa-nuts, bana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, of thirteen ſorts, the beſt we had ever eaten; plantains; a fruit not unlike an apple, which, when ripe, is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; ſweet potatoes, yams, cocoas, a kind of <hi>arum;</hi> a fruit known by the name of <hi>jambu,</hi> and reckoned moſt delicious; ſugar cane, which the inhabitants eat raw; a root of the ſalop kind, called by the inhabitants <hi>pea;</hi> a plant called <hi>ethee,</hi> of which the root only is eaten; a fruit that grows in a pod, like that of a large kidney bean, which, when it is roaſted, eats very much like a cheſnut, by the natives called <hi>ahee;</hi> a tree called <hi>wharra,</hi> called in the Eaſt-Indies <hi>pandares,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces fruit, ſomething like the pine-apple; a ſhrub called <hi>nono;</hi> the <hi>marinda,</hi> which alſo produces fruit; a ſpecies of fern, of which the root is eaten, and ſometimes the leaves; and a a plant called <hi>theve,</hi> of which the root alſo is eaten: but the fruits of the <hi>nono,</hi> the fern and the <hi>theve,</hi> are eaten only by the inferior people, and in times of ſcarcity. All theſe, which ſerve the inhabitants for food, the earth produces ſpontaneouſly, or with ſo little culture, that they ſeem to be exempted from the firſt general curſe, that "man ſhould eat his bread in the ſweat of his brow." They have alſo the Chineſe paper mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry, <hi>morus papyrifera,</hi> which they call <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They have no European fruit, garden ſtuff, pulſe, or legu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, nor grain of any kind.</p>
                        <p>Of tame animals they have only hogs, dogs, and poultry; neither is there a wild animal in the iſland, except ducks, pigeons, paroquets, with a few other birds, and rats, there being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>As to the people they are of the largeſt ſize of Europeans. The men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The talleſt that we ſaw was a man upon a neighbouring iſland, called Huaheine, who meaſured ſix feet three inches and an half. The women of the ſuperior rank are alſo in general above our middle ſtature, but thoſe of the inferior claſs are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther below it, and ſome of them are very ſmall. This defect in ſize probably proceeds from their early commerce with men, the only thing in which they differ from their ſuperiors, that could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>Their natural complexion is that kind of clear olive, or brunette, which many people in Europe prefer to the fineſt white and red.

The ſhape of the face is comely, the cheek bones are not high, neither are the eyes hollow, nor the brow prominent: the only feature that does not correſpond with our ideas of beauty is the noſe, which, in general, is ſomewhat flat; but their eyes, eſpecially thoſe of the women, are full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, ſometimes ſparkling with fire, and ſometimes melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſoftneſs; their teeth alſo are, almoſt without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, moſt beautifully even and white, and their breath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly without taint.</p>
                        <p>The hair is almoſt univerſally black, and rather coarſe; the men have beards which they wear in many faſhions, always, however, plucking out great part of them, and keeping the reſt perfectly clean and neat. Both ſexes alſo eradicate every hair from under their arms, and accuſed us of great uncleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for not doing the ſame. In their motions there is at once vigour and eaſe; their walk is graceful, their deportment li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral, and their behaviour to ſtrangers and to each other affable and courteous. In their diſpoſitions alſo, they ſeemed to be brave, open, and candid, without either ſuſpicion or treachery, cruelty or revenge; ſo that we placed the ſame confidence in them as in our beſt friends, many of us, particularly Mr. Banks, ſleeping frequently in their houſes in the woods, without a companion, and conſequently wholly in their power. They
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:013324_0145_0F90F0B976613808"/>
were however all thieves; and when that is allowed, they need not much fear a competition with the people of any other nation upon earth. During our ſtay in this iſland we ſaw about five or ſix perſons, like one that was met by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander on the 24th of April, in their walk to the eaſtward, whoſe ſkins were of a dead white, like the noſe of a white horſe; with white hair, beard, brows and eye-laſhes, red, tender eyes; a ſhort ſight, and ſcurfy ſkins, covered with a kind of white down; but we found that no two of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the ſame family, and therefore concluded, that they were not a ſpecies, but unhappy individuals, rendered anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous by diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>It is a cuſtom in moſt countries where the inhabitants have long hair, for the men to cut it ſhort and the women to pride themſelves in its length. Here, however, the contrary cuſtom prevails; the women always cut it ſhort round their ears, and the men, except the fiſhers, who are almoſt continually in the water, ſuffer it to ſlow in large waves over their ſhoulders, or tie it up in a bunch on the top of their heads.</p>
                        <p>They have a cuſtom alſo of anointing their heads, with what they call <hi>monoe,</hi> an oil expreſſed from the cocoa-nut, in which ſome ſweet herbs or flowers have been infuſed: as the oil is generally rancid, the ſmell is at firſt very diſagreeable to a European; and as they live in a hot country, and have no ſuch thing as a comb, they are not able to keep their heads free from lice, which the children and common people ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pick out and eat: a hateful cuſtom: wholly different from their manners in every other particular; for they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and cleanly almoſt without example, and thoſe to whom we diſtributed combs, ſoon delivered themſelves from vermin, with a diligence which ſhewed that they were not m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>re odious to us than to them.</p>
                        <p>They have a cuſtom of ſtaining their bodies, nearly in the ſame manner as is practiſed in many other parts of the world, which they call <hi>tattowing.</hi> They prick the ſkin, ſo as juſt not to fetch blood, with a ſmall inſtrument, ſomething in the form of a hoe; that part which anſwers to the blade is made of bone or ſhell, ſcraped very thin, and is from a quarter of an inch to an inch and a half wide; the edge is cut into ſharp teeth or points, from the number of three to twenty, according to its ſize: when this is to be uſed, they dip the teeth into a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a kind of lamp-black, formed of the ſmoke that riſes from an oily nut which they burn inſtead of candles, and water; the teeth, thus prepared, are placed upon the ſkin, and the handle to which they are faſtened being ſtruck, by quick ſmart blows, with a ſtick fitted to the purpoſe, they pierce it, and at the ſame time carry into the puncture the black compoſition, which leaves an indelible ſtain. The operation is painful,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:013324_0146_0F90F0BA32F1F248"/>
it is ſome days before the wounds are healed. It is performed upon the youth of both ſexes when they are about twelve or fourteen years of age, on ſeveral parts of the body, and in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious figures, according to the fancy of the parent, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> perhaps the rank of the party. The women are generally marked with this ſtain, in the form of a Z, on every joint of their fingers and toes, and frequently round the outſide of their feet; the men are alſo marked with the ſame figure, and both men and women have ſquares, circles, creſcents, and ill-deſigned repreſentations of men, birds, or dogs, and various other deviſes impreſſed upon their leg and arms, ſome of which we were told had ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications, though we could never learn what they were. But the part on which theſe ornaments are laviſhed with the greateſt profuſion, is the breech: this, in both ſexes, is covered with a deep black; above which, arches are drawn one over another as high as the ſhort ribs. They are often a quarter of an inch broad, and the edges are not ſtrait lines, but indented. Theſe arches are their pride, and are ſhewn both by men and women with a mixture of oſtentation and pleaſure; whether as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, or a proof of their fortitude and reſolution in bearing pain, we could not determine. The face in general is left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked; for we ſaw but one inſtance to the contrary. Some old men had the greateſt part of their bodies covered with large patches of black, deeply indented at the edges, like a rude imitation of flame; but we were told, that they came from a low iſland called Noouoora, and were not natives of Otaheite.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Banks ſaw the operation of <hi>tattowing</hi> performed upon the backſide of a girl about thirteen years old. The inſtrument uſed upon this occaſion had thirty teeth, and every ſtroke, of which at leaſt an hundred were made in a minute, drew an ichor or ſerum a little tinged with blood. The girl bore it with moſt ſtoical reſolution for about a quarter of an hour; but the pain of ſo many hundred punctures as ſhe had received in that time became intollerable: ſhe firſt complained in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs, then wept, and at laſt burſt into loud lamentations, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly imploring the operator to deſiſt. He was, however, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable; and when ſhe began to ſtruggle, ſhe was held down by two women, who ſometimes ſoothed and ſometimes chid her, and now and then, when ſhe was moſt unruly, gave her a ſmart blow. Mr. Banks ſtaid in a neighbouring houſe an hour, and the operation was not over when he went away; yet it was performed but on one ſide, the other having been done ſometime before; and the arches upon the loins, in which they moſt pride themſelves, and which give more pain than all the reſt, were ſtill to be done.</p>
                        <p>It is ſtrange that theſe people ſhould value themſelves upon what is no diſtinction; for I never ſaw a native of this iſland,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:013324_0147_0F90F0BB1BA6EB20"/>
man or woman, in a ſtate of maturity, in whom theſe marks were wanting: poſſibly they may have their riſe in ſuperſtition, eſpecially as they produce no viſible advantage, and are not made without great pain; but though we enquired of many hundreds, we could never get an account of the matter.</p>
                        <p>Their clothing conſiſts of cloth or matting of different kinds, which will be deſcribed among their other manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The cloth, which will not bear wetting, they wear in dry weather, and the matting when it rains; they are put on in different ways, juſt as their fancy leads them; for in their garments nothing is cut into ſhape, nor are any two pieces ſewed together. The dreſs of the better ſort of women conſiſts of three or four pieces; one piece, about two yards wide and eleven yards long, they wrap ſeveral times round their waiſt, ſo as to hang down like a petticoat as low as the middle of the leg, and this they call <hi>parou;</hi> two or three other pieces, about two yards and an half long and one wide, each having a hole cut in the middle, they place one upon another, and then putting the head through the holes, they bring the long ends down before and behind; the others remain open at the ſides, and give liberty to the arms; this, which they call the <hi>tebuta,</hi> is gathered round the waiſt, and confined with a girdle of ſaſh of thinner cloth, which is long enough to go many times round them, and exactly reſembles the garment worn by the inhabitants of Peru and Chili, which the Spaniards call <hi>poncho.</hi> The dreſs of the men is the ſame, except that inſtead of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the cloth that is wound about the hips to hang down like a petticoat, they bring it between their legs ſo as to have ſome reſemblance to breeches, and it is then called <hi>maro.</hi> This is the dreſs of all ranks of people, and being univerſally the ſame as to form, the gentlemen and ladies diſtinguiſh themſelves from the lower people by the quantity; ſome of them will wrap round them ſeveral pieces of cloth, eight or ten yards long, and two or three broad; and ſome throw a large piece looſely over their ſhoulders in the manner of a cloak, or perhaps two pieces, if they are very great perſonages, and are deſirous to appear in ſtate. The inferior ſort, who have only a ſmall allowance of cloth from the tribes or families to which they belong, are obliged to be more thinly clad. In the heat of the day they appear almoſt naked, the women having only a ſcanty petticoat, and the men nothing but the ſaſh that is paſſed between their legs and faſtened round the waiſt. As finery is always troubleſome, and particularly in a hot country, where it conſiſts in putting one covering upon another, the women of rank always uncover themſelves as low as the waiſt in the evening, throwing off all that they wear on the upper part of the body, with the ſame negligence and eaſe as our lay by a cardinal or double handkerchief. And the chiefs,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:013324_0148_0F8FF5233B37CE28"/>
even when they viſited us, though they had as much cloth round their middle as would clothe a dozen people, had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the reſt of the body quite naked.</p>
                        <p>Upon their legs and feet they wear no covering; but they ſhade their faces from the ſun with little bonnets, either of matting or cocoa-nut leaves, which they make occaſionally in a few minutes. This, however, is not all their head dreſs; the women ſometimes wear little turbans, and ſometimes a dreſs which they value much mere, and which, indeed, is much more becoming, called <hi>Tomou;</hi> the <hi>Tomou</hi> conſiſts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hair, plaited in threads, ſcarcely thicker than ſewing ſilk. Mr. Banks has pieces of it above a mile in length, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a knot. Theſe they wind round the head in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as produces a very pretty effect, and in a very great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; for I have ſeen five or ſix ſuch pieces wound about the head of one woman: among theſe threads they ſtick flowers of various kinds, particularly the cape-jeſſamine, of which they have great plenty, as it is always planted near their houſes. The men ſometimes ſtick the tail feather of the Tropic-bird upright i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> their hair, which, as I have obſerved before, is often tied in a bunch upon the top of their heads: ſometimes they wear a kind of whimſical garland, made of flowers of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds, ſtuck into a piece of the rind of a plantain; or of ſcarlet peas, ſtuck with gum upon a piece of wood: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they wear a kind of wig, made of the hair of men or dogs, or perhaps of cocoa-nut ſtrings, woven upon one thread, which is tied under their hair, ſo that theſe artificial honours of their head may hang down behind. Their perſonal orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, beſides flowers, are few; both ſexes wear ear-rings, but they are placed only on one ſide: when we came they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of ſmall pieces of ſhell, ſtone, berries, red peas, or ſome ſmall pearls, three in a ſtring; but our beads very ſoon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted them all.</p>
                        <p>The children go quite naked; the girls till they are three or four years old, and the boys till they are ſix or ſeven.</p>
                        <p>The houſes, or rather dwellings of theſe people have been occaſionally mentioned before: they are all built in the wood, between the ſea and the mountains, and no more ground is cleared for each houſe, than juſt ſufficient to prevent the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the branches from rotting the thatch with which they are covered; from the houſe, therefore, the inhabitant ſteps immediately under the ſhade, which is the moſt delightful that can be imagined. It conſiſts of groves of bread-fruit and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coa-nuts, without underwood, which are interſected, in all directions, by the paths that lead from one houſe to the other. Nothing can be more grateful than this ſhade in ſo warm a climate, nor any thing more beautiful than theſe walks. As there is no underwood, the ſhade cools without impeding the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:013324_0149_0F8FF524009C5388"/>
air; and the houſes, having no walls, receive the gale from whatever point it blows. I ſhall now give a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a houſe of a middling ſize, from which, as the ſtructure is univerſally the ſame, a perfect idea may be formed both of thoſe that are bigger, and thoſe that are leſs.</p>
                        <p>The ground which it covers is an oblong ſquare, four and twenty feet long, and eleven wide; over this a roof is raiſed, upon three rows of pillars or poſts, parallel to each other, one on each ſide, and the other in the middle. This roof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of two flats ſides, inclining to each other, and terminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ridge, exactly like the roofs of our thatched houſes in England. The utmoſt height within is about nine feet, and the eves on each ſide reach to within about three feet and an half of the ground: below this, and through the whole height at each end, it is open, no part of it being incloſed with a wall. The roof is thatched with palm-leaves, and the floor is covered, ſome inches deep with ſoft hay; over this are laid mats, ſo that the whole is one cuſhion, upon which they ſit in the day, and ſleep in the night. In ſome houſes, however, there is one ſtool, which is wholly appropriated to the maſter of the family; beſides this, they have no furniture, except a few little blocks of wood, the upper ſide of which is hollowed into a curve, and which ſerves them for pillows.</p>
                        <p>Ths houſe is indeed principally uſed as a dormitory; for, except it rains, they eat in the open air, under the ſhade of the next tree. The clothes that they wear in the day, ſerve them for covering in the night: the floor is the common bed of the whole houſehold, and is not divided by any partition. The maſter of the houſe and his wife ſleep in the middle, next to them the married people, next to them the unmarried wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and next to them at a little diſtance, the unmarried men; the ſervants, or <hi>Toutous,</hi> as they are called, ſleep in the open air, except it rains, and in that caſe they come juſt within the ſhed.</p>
                        <p>There are, however houſes of another kind, belonging to the Chiefs, in which there is ſome degree of privacy. Theſe are much ſmaller, and ſo conſtructed as to be carried about in their canoes from place to place, and ſet up occaſionally, like a tent; they are incloſed on the ſides with cocoa-nut leaves, but not ſo cloſe as to exclude the air, and the Chief and his wife ſleep in them alone.</p>
                        <p>There are houſes alſo of a much larger ſize, not built either for the accommodation of a ſingle Chief, or a ſingle family; but as common receptacles for all the people of a diſtrict. Some of them are two hundred feet long, thirty broad, and, under the ridge, twenty feet high; theſe are built and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at the common expence of the diſtrict, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:013324_0150_0F904D2C59B859C0"/>
of which they are intended; and have on one ſide of them a large area, incloſed with low palliſadoes.</p>
                        <p>Theſe houſes, like thoſe of ſeparate families, have no walls. Privacy indeed is little wanted among people who have not even the idea of indecency, and who gratify every appetite and paſſion before witneſſes, with no more ſenſe of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety than we feel when we ſatisfy our hunger at a ſocial board with our family or friends. Thoſe who have no idea of indecency with reſpect to actions, can have none with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to words; it is, therefore, ſcarcely neceſſary to obſerve, that, in the converſation of theſe people, that which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſource of their pleaſure, is always the principal topic; and that every thing is mentioned without any reſtraint or emotion, and in the moſt direct terms, by both ſexes.</p>
                        <p>Of the food eaten here the greater part is vegetable. Here are no tame animals except hogs, dogs, and poultry, as I have obſerved before, and theſe are by no means plenty. When a Chief kills a hog, it is almoſt equally divided among his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants; and as they are very numerous, the ſhare of each individual at theſe feaſts, which are not frequent muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be ſmall. Dogs and fowls fall ſomewhat more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſhare of the common people. I cannot much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the flavour of their fowls; but we all agreed, that a South Sea dog was little inferior to an Engliſh lamb; their excellence is probably owing to their being kept up, and fed wholly upon vegetables. The ſea affords them a great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of fiſh. The ſmaller fiſh, when they catch any, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally eaten raw, as we eat oyſters; and nothing that the ſea produces comes amiſs to them: they are fond of lobſters, crabs, and other ſhell-fiſh, which are found upon the coaſt; and they will eat not only ſea-inſects, but what ſeamen call <hi>Blubbers,</hi> though ſome of them are ſo tough, that they are obliged to ſuffer them to become putrid before they can be chewed. Of the many vegetables that have been mentioned already as ſerving them for food, the principal is the bread-fruit, to procure which coſts them no trouble or labour, bus climbing a tree: the tree which produces it, does not indeed ſhoot up ſpontaneouſly; but if a man plants ten of them in his life-time, which he may do in about an hour, he will as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly fulfill his duty to his own and future generations, as the native of our leſs temperate climate can do by ploughing in the cold winter, and reaping in the ſummer's heat, as often as theſe ſeaſons return; even if, after he has procured bread for his preſent houſhold, he ſhould convert a ſurplus into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and lay it up for his children.</p>
                        <p>It is true, indeed, that the bread-fruit is not always in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:013324_0151_0F8FF525289F2B80"/>
but cocoa-nuts, bananas, plantains, and a great variety of other fruits, ſupply the deficiency.</p>
                        <p>It may well be ſuppoſed, that cookery is but little ſtudied by theſe people as an art; and, indeed, they have but two ways of applying fire to dreſs their food, broiling and bak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the operation of broiling is ſo ſimple that it requires no deſcription, and their baking has been deſcribed already, in the the account of an entertainment prepared for us by Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia. Hogs, and lage fiſh, are extremely well dreſſed in the ſame manner; and, in our opinion, were more juicy, and more equally done, than by any art of cookery now practiſed in Europe. Bread-fruit is alſo cooked in an oven of the ſame kind, which renders it ſoft, and ſomething like a boiled po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoe; not quite ſo farinaceous as a good one, but more ſo than thoſe of the middling ſort.</p>
                        <p>Of the bread-fruit they alſo make three diſhes, by putting either water or the milk of the cocoa-nut to it, then beating it to a paſte with a ſtone peſtle, and afterwards mixing it with ripe plantains, bananas, or the four paſte which they call <hi>Mahie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The mahie, which has been mentioned as a ſuccedaneum for ripe bread-fruit, before the ſeaſon for gathering a freſh crop comes on, is thus made:</p>
                        <p>The fruit is gathered juſt before it is perfectly ripe, and being laid in heaps, is cloſely covered with leaves; in this ſtate it undergoes a fermentation, and becomes diſagreeably ſweet: the core is then taken out entire, which is done by gently pulling the ſtalk, and the reſt of the fruit is thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a hole, which is dug for that purpoſe, generally in the houſes, and neatly lined in the bottom and ſides with graſs; the whole is then covered with leaves, and heavy ſtones laid upon them: in this ſtate it undergoes a ſecond fermentation, and becomes four, after which it will ſuffer no change for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny months: it is taken out of the hole as it is wanted for uſe, and being made into balls, it is wrapped up in leaves and baked; after it is dreſſed, it will keep five or ſix weeks. It is eaten both cold and hot, and the natives ſeldom make a meal without it, though to us the taſte was as diſagreeable as that of a pickled olive generally is the firſt time it is eaten.</p>
                        <p>As the making of this mahie depends, like brewing, upon fermentation, ſo, like brewing, it ſometimes fails, without their being able to aſcertain the cauſe; it is very natural, therefore, that the making it ſhould be connected with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious notions and ceremonies. It generally falls to the lot of the old women, who will ſuffer no creature to touch any thing belonging to it, but thoſe whom they employ as aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, nor even to go into that part of the houſe where the operation is carrying on. Mr. Banks happened to ſpoil a
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:013324_0152_0F8FF5258B223840"/>
large quantity of it only by inadvertently touching a leaf which lay upon it. The old woman, who then preſided over theſe myſteries, told him, that the proceſs would fail; and immediately uncovered the hole in a fit of vexation and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. Mr. Banks regretted the miſchief he had done, but was ſomewhat conſoled by the opportunity which it gave him of examining the preparation, which perhaps, but for ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ch an accident, would never have offered.</p>
                        <p>Such is their food, to which ſalt-water is the univerſal ſauce, no meal being eaten without it: thoſe who live near the ſea have it fetched as it is wanted; thoſe who live at ſome diſtance keep it in large bamboos, which are ſet up in their houſes, for uſe. Salt-water, however, is not their only ſauce; they make another of the kernels of cocoa-nuts, which being fermented till they diſſolve into a paſte, ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling butter, are beaten up with ſalt-water. The flavour of this is very ſtrong, and was, when we firſt taſted it, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly nauſeous; a little uſe, however, reconciled ſome of us to it ſo much, that they preferred it to our own ſauces, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with fiſh. The natives ſeemed to conſider it as a dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and do not uſe it at their common meals; poſſibly becauſe they think it ill management to uſe cocoa-nuts ſo laviſhly, or perhaps, when we were at the iſland, they were ſcarcely ripe enough for the purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>For drink, they have in general nothing but water, or the juice of the cocoa-nut; the art of producing liquors that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate, by fermentation, being happily unknown among them; neither have they any narcotic which they chew, as the natives of ſome other countries do opium, beetle-root, and tobacco. Some of them drank freely of our liquors, and in a few inſtances became very drunk; but the perſons to whom this happened were ſo far from deſiring to repeat the debauch, that they would never touch any of our liquors afterwards. We were however informed, that they became drunk by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a juice that is expreſſed from the leaves of a plant which they call <hi>Ava Ava.</hi> This plant was not in ſeaſon when we were there, ſo that we ſaw no inſtances of its effects; and as they conſidered drunkenneſs as a diſgrace, they probably would have concealed from us any inſtances which might have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened during our ſtay. This vice is almoſt peculiar to the Chiefs, and conſiderable perſons, who vie with each other in drinking the greateſt number of draughts, each draught being about a pint. They keep this intoxicating juice with great care from their women.</p>
                        <p>Table they have none; but their apparatus for eating is ſet out with great neatneſs, though the articles are too ſimple and too few to allow any thing for ſhow; and they commonly eat alone; but when a ſtranger happens to viſit them, he
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:013324_0153_0F8FF5269ECFD910"/>
ſometimes makes a ſecond in their meſs. Of the meal of one of their principal people I ſhall give a particular deſcription.</p>
                        <p>He ſits down under the ſhade of the next tree, or on the ſhady ſide of his houſe, and a large quantity of leaves, either of the bread-fruit or banana, are neatly ſpread before him upon the ground as a table-cloth; a baſket is then ſet by him that contains his proviſion, which, if fiſh or fleſh, is ready dreſſed, and wrapped up in leaves, and two cocoa-nut ſhells, one full of ſalt water, and the other of freſh: his attendants, which are not few, ſeat themſelves round him, and when all is ready, he begins by waſhing his hands and his mouth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly with the freſh-water, and this he repeats almoſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally throughout the whole meal; he then takes part of his proviſion out of the baſket, which generally conſiſts of a ſmall fiſh or two, two or three bread-fruits, fourteen or fifteen ripe bananas, or ſix or ſeven apples: he firſt takes half a bread-fruit, peels off the rind, and takes out the core with his nails; of this he puts as much into his mouth as it can hold, and while he chews it, takes the fiſh out of the leaves, and breaks one of them into the ſalt water, placing the other, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the bread-fruit, upon the leaves that had been ſpread before him. When this is done, he takes up a ſmall piece of the fiſh that has been broken into the ſalt-water, with all the fingers of one hand, and ſucks it into his mouth, ſo as to get with it as much of the ſalt-water as poſſible: in the ſame manner he takes the reſt by different morſels, and between each, atleaſt very frequently, takes a ſmall ſup of the ſalt-water, either out of the cocoa-nut ſhell, or the palm of his hand: in the mean time one of his attendants has prepared a young co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coa-nut, by peeling off the outer rind with his teeth, an ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which to an European appears very ſurpriſing; but it depends ſo much upon ſlight, that many of us were able to do it before we left the iſland, and ſome that could ſcarcely crack a filbert: the maſter, when he chuſes to drink, takes the cocoa-nut thus prepared, and boring a hole through the ſhell with his finger, or breaking it with a ſtone, he ſucks out the liquor. When he has eaten his bread-fruit and fiſh, he begins with his plantains, one of which makes but a mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, though it be as big as a black-pudding; if inſtead of plantains he has apples, he never taſtes them till they have been pared; to do this a ſhell is picked up from the ground, where they are always in plenty, and toſſed to him by an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant: he immediately begins to cut or ſcrape off the rind, but ſo awkwardly that great part of the fruit is waſted. If, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of fiſh, he has fleſh, he muſt have ſome ſuccedaneum for a knife to divide it; and for this purpoſe a piece of bamboo is toſſed to him, of which he makes the neceſſary implement by ſpitting it tranſverſely with his nail. While all this has been
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:013324_0154_0F8FF52702268598"/>
doing, ſome of his attendants have been employed in beating bread-fruit with a ſtone peſtle upon a block of wood; by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten in this manner, and ſprinkled from time to time with water, it is reduced to the conſiſtence of a ſoft paſte, and is then put into a veſſel ſomewhat like a butcher's tray, and either made up alone, or mixed with banana or mahie, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the taſte of the maſter, by pouring water upon it by degrees, and ſqueezing it often through the hand: under this operation it acquires the conſiſtence of a thick cuſtard, and a large cocoa-nut ſhell full of it being ſet before him, he ſips it as we ſhould do a jelly if we had no ſpoon to take it from the glaſs: the meal is then finiſhed by again waſhing his hands and his mouth. After which the cocoa-nut ſhells are cleaned, and every thing that is left is replaced in the baſket.</p>
                        <p>The quantity of food which theſe people eat at a meal is prodigious: I have ſeen one man devour two or three fiſhes as big as a perch; three bread-fruits, each bigger than two fiſts; foureen or fifteen plantains or bananas, each of them ſix or ſeven inches long, and four or five round; and near a quart of the pounded bread-fruit, which is as ſubſtantial as the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt unbaked cuſtard. This is ſo extraordinary that I ſcarcely expect to be believed; and I would not have related it upon my own ſingle teſtimony, but Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and moſt of the other Gentlemen, have had ocular demonſtration of its truth, and know that I mention them upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                        <p>It is very wonderful, that theſe people, who are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably fond of ſociety, and particularly that of their women, ſhould exclude its pleaſures from the table, where among all other nations, whether civil or ſavage, they have been prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally enjoyed. How a meal, which every where elſe brings families and friends together, came to ſeparate them here, we often enquired, but could never learn. They eat alone, they ſaid, becauſe it was right; but why it was right to eat alone, they never attempted to tell us: ſuch, however, was the force of habit, that they expreſſed the ſtrongeſt diſlike, and even diſguſt, at our eating in ſociety, eſpecially with our women, and of the ſame victuals. At firſt, we thought this ſtrange ſingularity aroſe from ſome ſuperſtitious opinion; but they conſtantly affirmed the contrary. We obſerved alſo ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prices in the cuſtom, for which we could as little account as for the cuſtom itſelf. We could never prevail with any of the women to partake of the victuals at our table when we were dining in company; yet they would go five or ſix together, into the ſervants apartments, and there eat very heartily of whatever they could find, of which I have before given a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance; nor were they in the leaſt diſconcerted if we came in while they were doing it. When any of us have been
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:013324_0155_0F8FF527EC57F978"/>
alone with a women, ſhe has ſometimes eaten in our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but then ſhe has expreſſed the greateſt unwillingneſs that it ſhould be known, and always extorted the ſtrongeſt promiſes of ſecrecy.</p>
                        <p>Among themſelves, even two brothers and two ſiſters have each their ſeparate baſkets, with proviſion and the apparatus of their meal. When they firſt viſited us at our tents, each brought his baſket with him; and when we ſat down to table, they would go out, ſit down upon the ground, at two or three yards diſtance from each other, and turning their faces diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ways, take their repaſt without interchanging a ſingle word.</p>
                        <p>The women not only abſtain from eating with the men, and of the ſame victuals, but even have their victuals ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately prepared by boys kept for that purpoſe, who depoſit it in a ſeparate ſhed, and attend them with it at their meals.</p>
                        <p>But though they would not eat with us, or with each other, they have often aſked us to eat with them, when we have viſited thoſe with whom we were particularly acquainted at their houſes; and we have often upon ſuch occaſions eaten out of the ſame baſket, and drunk out of the ſame cup. The elder women, however, always appeared to be offended at this liberty; and if we happened to touch their victuals, or even the baſket that contained it, would throw it away.</p>
                        <p>After meals, and in the heat of the day, the middle-aged people of the better ſort generally ſleep; they are indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely indolent, and ſleeping and eating is almoſt all that they do. Thoſe that are older are leſs drowzy, and the boys and girls are kept awake by the natural activity and ſprightli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their age.</p>
                        <p>Their amuſements have occaſionally been mentioned in my account of the incidents that happened during our reſidence in this iſland, particularly muſic, dancing, wreſtling, and ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the bow; they alſo ſometimes vie with each other in throwing a lance. As ſhooting is not at a mark, but for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; throwing the lance is not for diſtance, but at a mark: the weapon is about nine feet long, the mark is the bole of a plantain, and the diſtance about twenty yards.</p>
                        <p>Their only muſical inſtruments are flutes and drums; the flutes are made of a hollow bamboo about a foot long, and, as has been obſerved before, have only two ſtops, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently but four notes, out of which they ſeem hitherto to have formed but one tune; to theſe ſtops they apply the fore-finger of the left hand, and the middle finger of the right.</p>
                        <p>The drum is made of a hollow block of wood, of a cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical form, ſolid at one end, and covered at the other with ſhark's ſkin: theſe they beat not with ſticks, but their hands; and they know how to tune two drums of different notes into concord. They have alſo an expedient to bring the flutes

that play together into uniſon, which is to roll up a leaf ſo as to ſlip over the end of the ſhorteſt, like our ſliding tubes for teleſcopes, which they move up or down till the purpoſe is anſwered, of which they ſeem to judge by their ear with great nicety.</p>
                        <p>To theſe inſtruments they ſing; and, as I have obſerved before, their ſongs are often extempore: they call every two verſes or couplet a ſong, <hi>Pehay:</hi> they are generally, though not always in rhime; and when pronounced by the natives, we could diſcover that they were metre. Mr. Banks took great pains to write down ſome of them which were made upon our arrival, as nearly as he could expreſs their ſounds by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations of our letters; but when we read them, not having their accent, we could ſcarcely make them either metre or rhime. The reader will eaſily perceive that they are of very different ſtructure.</p>

                        <p>Of theſe verſes our knowledge of the language is too imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to attempt a tranſlation. They frequently amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſinging ſuch couplets as theſe when they are alone, or with their families, eſpecially after it is dark; for though they need no fires, they are not without the comfort of artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial light between ſunſet and bed-time. Their candles are made of the kernels of a kind of oily nut, which they ſtick one over another upon a ſkewer that is thruſt thro' the middle of them; the upper one being lighted, burns down to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, at the ſame time conſuming that part of the ſkewer which goes through it; the ſecond taking fire burns in the ſame manner down to the third, and ſo of the reſt: ſome of theſe candles will burn a conſiderable time, and they give a very tolerable light. They do not often ſit up above an hour after it is dark; but when they have ſtrangers who ſleep in the houſe, they generally keep a light burning all night, poſſibly as a check upon ſuch of the women as they wiſh not to honour them with their favours.</p>
                        <p>Of their itenerary concerts I need add nothing to what has been ſaid already; eſpecially as I ſhall have occaſion, more particularly to mention them when I relate our adventures upon another iſland.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="130" facs="unknown:013324_0157_0F90F0BC74F4F220"/>
In other countries, the girls and unmarried women are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be wholly ignorant of what others upon ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions may appear to know; and their conduct and converſation are conſequently reſtrained within narrower bounds, and kept at a more remote diſtance from whatever relates to a connection with the other ſex: but here it is juſt contrary. Among other diverſions, there is a dance, called <hi>Timorodee,</hi> which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by young girls, whenever eight or ten of them can be collected together, conſiſting of motions and geſtures beyond imagination wanton, in the practice of which they are brought up from their earlieſt childhood, accompanied by words, which, if it were poſſible, would more explicitly convey the ſame ideas. In theſe dances they keep time with an exactneſs which is ſcarcely excelled by the beſt performers upon the ſtages of Europe. But the practice which is allowed to the virgin, is prohibited to the woman from the moment that ſhe has put theſe hopeful leſſons in practice, and realized the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols of the dance.</p>
                        <p>It cannot be ſuppoſed that, among theſe people, chaſtity is held in much eſtimation. It might be expected that ſiſters and daughters would be offered to ſtrangers, either as a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy, or for reward; and that breaches of conjugal fidelity, even in the wife, ſhould not be otherwiſe puniſhed than by a few hard words, or perhaps a ſlight beating, as indeed is the caſe; but there is a ſcale in diſſolute ſenſuality, which theſe people have aſcended, wholly unknown to every other nation whoſe manners have been recorded from the beginning of the world to the preſent hour, and which no imagination could poſſibly conceive.</p>
                        <p>A very conſiderable number of the principal people of Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heite, of both ſexes, have formed themſelves into a ſociety, in which every woman is common to every man; thus ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perpetual variety as often as their inclination prompts them to ſeek it, which is ſo frequent, that the ſame man and woman ſeldom cohabit together more than two or three days.</p>
                        <p>Theſe ſocieties are diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Arreoy;</hi> and the members have meetings, at which no other is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, where the men amuſe themſelves by wreſtling, and the women, notwithſtanding their occaſional connection with different men, dance the Timorodee in all its latitude, as an incitement to deſires, which, it is ſaid, are frequently grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied upon the ſpot. This however is comparatively nothing, if any of the women happen to be with child, which in this manner of life happens leſs frequently than if they were to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit only with one man, the poor infant is ſmothered the moment it is born, that it may be no incumberance to the father, nor interrupt the mother in the pleaſures of her dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical proſtitution. It ſometimes indeed happens, that the
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:013324_0158_0F8FF5287AC2F030"/>
paſſion which prompts a woman to enter into this ſociety, is ſurmounted when ſhe becomes a mother, by that inſtinctive affection which nature has given to all creatures for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their offspring; but even in this caſe ſhe is not permitted to ſpare the life of her infant, except ſhe can find a man who will patroniſe it as his child: if this can be done, the murder is prevented; but both the man and the woman, being deemed by this act to have appropriated each other, are ejected from the community, and forfeit all claim to the privileges and pleaſures of Arreoy for the future; the woman from that time being diſtinguiſhed by the term <hi>Whannownow,</hi> "bearer of children," which is here a term of reproach; though none can be more honourable in the eſtimation of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and humanity, of right reaſon, and every paſſion that diſtinguiſhes the man from the brute.</p>
                        <p>It is not fit that a practice ſo horrid and ſo ſtrange ſhould be imputed to human beings upon ſlight evidence, but I have ſuch as abundantly juſtifies me in the account I have given. The people themſelves are ſo far from concealing their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with ſuch a ſociety as a diſgrace, that they boaſt of it as a privilege; and both myſelf and Mr. Banks, when par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons have been pointed out to us as members of the Arreoy, have queſtioned them about it, and received the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that has been here given from their own lips. They have acknowledged, that they had long been of this accurſed ſociety, that they belonged to it at that time, and that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of their children had been put to death.</p>
                        <p>But I muſt not conclude my account of the domeſtic life of theſe people without mentioning their perſonal cleanlineſs. If that which leſſens the good of life and increaſes the evil is vice, ſurely cleanlineſs is a virtue: the want of it tends to deſtroy both beauty and health, and mingles diſguſt with our beſt pleaſures. The natives of Otaheite, both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, conſtantly waſh their whole bodies in running water three times every day; once as ſoon as they riſe in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, once at noon, and again before they ſleep at night, whether the ſea or river is near them or at a diſtance. I have already obſerved, that they waſh not only the mouth, but the hands at their meals, almoſt between every morſel; and their clothes, as well as their perſons, are kept without ſpot or ſtain; ſo that in a large company of theſe people, nothing is ſuffered but heat, which, perhaps, is more than can be ſaid of the politeſt aſſembly in Europe.</p>

                        <p>IF neceſſity is the mother of invention, it cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been much exerted where the liberality of
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:013324_0159_0F8FF52AD0EDBD80"/>
nature has rendered the diligence of art almoſt ſuperfluous; yet there are many inſtances both of ingenuity and labour among theſe people, which, conſidering the want of metal for tools, do honour to both.</p>
                        <p>Their principal manufacture is their cloth, in the making and dying of which I think there are ſome particulars which may inſtruct even the artificers of Great-Britain, and for that reaſon my deſcription will be more minute.</p>
                        <p>Their cloth is of three kinds; and it is made of the bark of three different trees, the Chineſe paper mulberry, the bread-fruit tree, and the tree which reſembles the wild fig-tree of the Weſt Indies.</p>
                        <p>The fineſt and whiteſt is made of the paper mulberry, <hi>Aouta;</hi> this is worn chiefly by the principal people, and when it is dyed red takes a better colour. A ſecond ſort, inferior in whiteneſs and ſoftneſs, is made of the bread-fruit tree, <hi>Ooroo,</hi> and worn chiefly by the inferior peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and a third of the tree that reſembles the fig, which is coarſe and harſh, and of the colour of the darkeſt brown pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: this, though it is leſs pleaſing both to the eye and the touch, is the moſt valuable, becauſe it reſiſts water, which the other two ſorts will not. Of this, which is the moſt rare as well as the moſt uſeful, the greater part is perfumed, and worn by the Chiefs as a morning dreſs.</p>
                        <p>All theſe trees are propagated with great care, particularly the mulberry, which covers the largeſt part of the cultivated land, and is not fit for uſe after two or three year's growth, when it is about ſix or eight feet high, and ſomewhat thicker than a man's thumb; its excellence is to be thin, ſtrait, tall, and without branches: the lower leaves, therefore, are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully plucked off, with the germs, as often as there is any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of their producing a branch.</p>
                        <p>But though the cloth made of theſe three trees is different, it is all manufactured in the ſame manner; I ſhall, therefore, deſcribe the proceſs only in the fine ſort, that is made of the mulberry. When the trees are of a proper ſize, they are drawn up, and ſtripped of their branches, after which the roots and tops are cut off; the bark of theſe rods being then ſlit up longitudinally, is eaſily drawn off, and, when a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per quantity has been procured, it is carried down to ſome running water, in which it is depoſited to ſoak, and ſecured from floating away by heavy ſtones: when it is ſuppoſed to be ſufficiently ſoftened, the women ſervants go down to the brook, and ſtripping themſelves, ſit down in the water, to ſeparate the inner bark from the green part on the outſide; to do this they place the under ſide upon a flat ſmooth board, and with the ſhell which our dealers call Tyger's tongue, <hi>Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina gargadia,</hi> ſcrape it very carefully, dipping it continually
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:013324_0160_0F90F0BD34629178"/>
in the water till nothing remains but the fine fibres of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner coat. Being thus prepared in the afternoon, they are ſpread out upon plantain leaves in the evening; and in this part of the work there appears to be ſome difficulty, as the miſtreſs of the family always ſuperintends the doing of it; they are placed in lengths of about eleven or twelve yards, one by the ſide of another, till they are about a foot broad, and two or three layers are alſo laid one upon the other: care is taken that the cloth ſhall be in all parts of an equal thickneſs, ſo that if the bark happens to be thinner in any particular part of one layer than the reſt, a piece that is ſomewhat thicker is picked out to be laid over it in the next. In this ſtate it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains till the morning, when great part of the water which it contained when it was laid out, is either drained off or evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and the ſeveral fibres adhere together, ſo as that the whole may be raiſed from the ground in one piece.</p>
                        <p>It is then taken away, and laid upon the ſmooth ſide of a long piece of wood, prepared for the purpoſe, and beaten by the women ſervants, with inſtruments about a foot long, and three inches thick, made of a hard wood which they call <hi>Etoa.</hi> The ſhape of this inſtrument is not unlike a ſquare razor ſtrop, only that the handle is longer, and each of its four ſides or faces is marked lengthways, with ſmall grooves, or furrows, of different degrees of fineneſs; thoſe on one ſide being of a width and depth ſufficient to receive a ſmall packthread, and the others finer in a regular gradation, ſo that the laſt are not more than equal to ſewing ſilk.</p>
                        <p>They beat it firſt with the coarſeſt ſide of this mallet, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time like our ſmiths; it ſpreads very faſt under the ſtrokes, chiefly however in the breadth, and the grooves in the mallet mark it with the appearance of threads; it is ſucceſſively beaten with the other ſides, laſt with the fineſt, and is then fit for uſe. Sometimes however it is made ſtill thinner, by beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the fineſt ſide of the mallet, after it has been ſeveral times doubled: it is then called <hi>Hoboo,</hi> and is almoſt as thin as a muſlin; it becomes very white by being bleached in the air, but is made ſtill whiter and ſofter by being waſhed and beaten again after it has been worn.</p>
                        <p>Of this cloth there are ſeveral ſorts, of different degrees of fineneſs, in proportion as it is more or leſs beaten, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doubled, the other cloth alſo differs in proportion as it is beaten; but they differ from each other in conſequence of the different materials of which they are made. The bark of the bread-fruit is not taken till the trees are conſiderably longer and thicker than thoſe of the fig: the proceſs afterwards is the ſame.</p>
                        <p>When cloth is to be waſhed after it has been worn, it it taken down to the brook, and left to ſoak, being kept faſt to the bottom, as at firſt, by a ſtone; it is then gently wrung or ſqueezed; and ſometimes ſeveral pieces of it are laid one upon
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:013324_0161_0F8FF52BAA17C5A8"/>
another, and beaten together with the coarſeſt ſide of the mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and they are then equal in thickneſs to broadcloth, and much more ſoft and agreeable to the touch, after they have been a little while in uſe, though, when they come imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the mallet, they feel as if they had been ſtarched. This cloth ſometimes breaks in the beating, but is eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by paſting on a patch with a gluten that is prepared from the root of the <hi>Pea,</hi> which is done ſo nicely that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſcovered. The women alſo employ themſelves in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving blemiſhes of every kind, as our ladies do in needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work or knotting; ſometimes when their work is intended to be very fine, they will paſte an entire covering of hoboo over the whole. The principal excellencies of this cloth are its coolneſs and ſoftneſs; and its imperfections, its being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to water like paper, and almoſt as eaſily torn.</p>
                        <p>The colours with which they die this cloth are principally red and yellow. The red is exceedingly beautiful, and I may venture to ſay, a brighter and more delicate colour than any we have in Europe; that which approaches neareſt is our full ſcarlet, and the beſt imitation which Mr. Banks's natural hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory painter could produce, was by a mixture of vermillion and carm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ne. The yellow is alſo a bright colour, but we have many as good.</p>
                        <p>The red colour is produced by the mixture of the juices of two vegetables, neither of which ſeparately has the leaſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to that hue. One is a ſpecies of fig, called here <hi>Matte,</hi> and the other the <hi>Cordia Sebeſtina,</hi> or <hi>Etou;</hi> of the fig the fruit is uſed, and of the <hi>Cordia</hi> the leaves.</p>
                        <p>The fruit of the fig is about as big as a rounceval pea, or very ſmall gooſeberry; and each of them, upon breaking off the ſtalk very cloſe, produces one drop of a milky liquor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the juice of our figs, of which the tree indeed is a ſpecies. This liquor the women collect into a ſmall quantity of cocoa-nut water: to prepare a gill of cocoa-nut water will require between three and four quarts of theſe little figs. When a ſufficient quantity is prepared, the leaves of the Etou are well wetted in it, and then laid upon a plantain leaf, where they are turned about till they become more and more flaccid, and then they are gently ſqueezed, gradually increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſſure, but ſo as not to break them; as the flaccidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty increaſes, and they become ſpungy, they are ſupplied with more of the liquor; in about five minutes the colour begins to appear upon the veins of the leaves, and in about ten or a little more, they are perfectly ſaturated with it: they are then ſqueezed, with as much force as can be applied, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor ſtrained at the ſame time that it is expreſſed.</p>
                        <p>For this purpoſe the boys prepare a large quantity of the Moo, by drawing it between their teeth, or two little ſticks,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:013324_0162_0F8FF52D060C04F8"/>
till it is freed from the green bark, and the branny ſubſtance that lies under it, and a thin web of the fibres only remains; in this the leaves of the Etou are inveloped, and through theſe the juice which they contain is ſtrained as it is forced out. As the leaves are not ſucculent, little more juice is preſſed out of them than they have imbibed: when they have been once emptied, they are filled again, and again preſſed till the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which tinctures the liquor, as it paſſes through them is exhauſted, they are then thrown away; but the Moo, being deeply ſtained with the colour, is preſerved, as a bruſh to lay the dye upon the cloth.</p>
                        <p>The expreſſed liquor is always received into ſmall cups, made of the plantain leaf, whether from a notion that it has any quality favourable to the colour, or from the facility with which it is procured, and the convenience of ſmall veſſels to diſtribute it among the artificers, I do not know.</p>
                        <p>Of the thin cloth they ſeldom dye more than the edges, but the thick cloth is coloured through the whole ſurface; the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is indeed uſed rather as a pigment than a dye, for a coat of it is laid upon one ſide only, with the fibres of the Moo; and though I have ſeen of the thin cloth that has appeared to have been ſoaked in the liquor, the colour has not had the ſame richneſs and luſtre, as when it has been applied in the other manner.</p>
                        <p>Though the leaf of the Etou is generally uſed in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and probably produces the fineſt colour; yet the juice of the figs will produce a red by a mixture with the ſpecies of Turnefortia, which they call <hi>Taheinoo,</hi> the <hi>Eurhe</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volvulus Braſilienſis,</hi> and a ſpecies of Solanum called <hi>Ebooa;</hi> from the uſe theſe different plants, or from different propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the materials, many varieties are obſervable in the colours of their cloth, ſome of which are conſpicuouſly ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to others.</p>
                        <p>The beauty, however, of the beſt is not permanent; but it is probable that ſome method might be found to fix it, if proper experiments were made, and perhaps to ſearch for latent qualities, which may be brought out by the mixture of one vegetable juice with another, would not be an unprofitable employment: our preſent moſt valuable dyes afford ſufficient encouragement to the attempt: for by the meer inſpection of indigo, woad, dyer's weed, and moſt of the leaves which are uſed for the like purpoſes the colours which they yield could never be diſcovered. Of this Indian red I ſhall only add, that the women who have been employed in preparing or uſing it, carefully preſerve the colour upon their fingers and nails, where it appears in its utmoſt beauty, as a great ornament.</p>
                        <p>The yellow is made of the bark of the root of the <hi>Morinda citrifolia,</hi> called <hi>Nono,</hi> by ſcraping and infuſing it into water;
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:013324_0163_0F90F0BDF3D5FD30"/>
after ſtanding ſome time, the water is ſtrained and uſed as a dye, the cloth being dipped into it. The Morinda, of which this is a ſpecies, ſeems to be a good ſubject for examination with a view to dying. Brown, in his hiſtory of Jamaica, mentions three ſpecies of it, which, he ſays, are uſed to dye brown; and Rumphius ſays of the <hi>Bancuda Auguſtifolia,</hi> which is nearly allied to our Nono, that it is uſed by the inhabitants of the Eaſt-Indian iſlands, as a fixing drug for red colours, with which it particularly agrees.</p>
                        <p>The inhabitants of this iſland alſo dye yellow with the fruit of the Tamanu; but how the colour is extracted, we had no opportunity to diſcover. They have alſo a preparation with which they die brown and black; but theſe colours are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, that the method of preparing them did not excite our curioſity.</p>
                        <p>Another conſiderable mannfacture is matting of various kinds; ſome of which is finer, and better in every reſpect, than any we have in Europe: the coarſer ſort ſerves them to ſleep upon, and the ſiner to wear in wet weather. With the fine, of which there are alſo two ſorts, much pains is taken, eſpecially with that made of the bark of the Poerou, the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſcus tiliaceus</hi> of Linaeus, ſome of which is as fine as a coarſe cloth: the other ſort, which is ſtill more beautiful, they call <hi>Vanne;</hi> it is white, gloſſy, and ſhining, and is made of the leaves of their <hi>Wharrou,</hi> a ſpecies of the <hi>Pandanus,</hi> of which we had no opportunity to ſee either the flowers or fruit: they have other matts, or as they call them <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>They are alſo very dexterous in making baſket and wicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work; their baſkets are of a thouſand different patterns, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them exceedingly neat; and the making them is an art that every one practiſes, both men and women: they make occaſional baſkets and panniers of the cocoa-nut leaf in a few minutes, and the women who viſited us early in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed to ſend, as ſoon as the ſun was high, for a few of the leaves, of which they made little bonnets to ſhade their faces, at ſo ſmall an expence of time and trouble, that, when the ſun was low again in the evening, they uſed to throw them away. Theſe bonnets, however, did not cover the head, but conſiſted only of a band that went round it, and a ſhade that projected from the forehead.</p>
                        <p>Of the bark of the Poerou they make ropes and lines, from the thickneſs of an inch, to the ſize of a ſmall packthread: with theſe they make nets for fiſhing: of the fibres of the cocoa-nut they make thread, for faſtening together the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of their canoes, and belts, either round or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

twiſted or plaited; and of the bark of the <hi>Erowa,</hi> a kind of nettle which grows in the mountains, and is therefore rather ſcarce, they make the beſt fiſhing lines in the world: with theſe they hold the ſtrongeſt and moſt active fiſh, ſuch as Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netas and Albicores, which would ſnap our ſtrongeſt ſilk lines in a minute, though they are twice as thick.</p>
                        <p>They make alſo a kind of ſeine, of a coarſe broad graſs, the blades of which are like flags: theſe they twiſt and tie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a looſe manner, till the net, which is about as wide as a large ſack, is from ſixty to eighty fathom long; this they haul in ſhoal ſmooth water, and its own weight keeps it ſo cloſe to the ground that ſcarcely a ſingle fiſh can eſcape.</p>
                        <p>In every expedient, indeed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>or taking fiſh, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ingenious; they make harpoons of cane, and point them with hard wood, which in their hands ſtrike fiſh more effectually, than thoſe that are headed with iron can do in ours, ſetting aſide the advantage of ours being faſtened to a line, ſo that the fiſh is ſecured if the hook takes place, though it does not mortally wound him.</p>
                        <p>Of fiſh-hooks they have two ſorts, admirably adapted in their conſtruction, as well to the purpoſe they are to anſwer, as to the materials of which they are made. One of theſe, which they call <hi>Wittee Wittee,</hi> is uſed for towing. The ſhank is made of mother of pearl, the moſt gloſſy that can be got: the inſide, which is naturally the brighteſt, is put behind. To theſe hooks a tuft of white dog's or hog's hair is fixed, ſo as ſomewhat to reſemble the tail of a fiſh; theſe implements, therefore, are both hook and bait, and are uſed with a rod of bamboo, and line of <hi>Erowa.</hi> The fiſher, to ſecure his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, watches the flight of the birds which conſtantly attend the Bonetas when they ſwim in ſhoals, by which he directs his canoe, and when he has the advantage of theſe guides, he ſeldom returns without a prize.</p>
                        <p>The other kind of hook is alſo made of mother of pearl, or ſome other hard ſhell: they cannot make them bearded like our hooks; but to effect the ſame purpoſe, they make the point turn inwards. Theſe are made of all ſizes, and uſed to catch various kinds of fiſh, with great ſucceſs. The manner of making them is very ſimple, and every fiſherman is his own artificer: the ſhell is firſt cut into ſquare pieces, by the edge of another ſhell, and wrought into a form corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding with the outline of the hook by pieces of coral, which are ſufficiently rough to perform the office of a file; a hole is then bored in the middle, the drill being no other than the firſt ſtone they pick up that has a ſharp corner: this they fix into the end of a piece of bamboo, and turn it between the hands like a chocolate mill; when the ſhell is perforated, and the hole ſufficiently wide, a ſmall file of coral is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:013324_0165_0F90F0BEB4AE05E0"/>
by the application of which the hook is in a ſhort time compleated, few coſting the artificer more time than a quarter of an hour.</p>
                        <p>Of their maſonry, carving, and architecture, the reader has already formed ſome idea from the account that has been given of the Morais, or repoſitories of the dead: the other moſt important article of building and carving is their boats; and perhaps, to fabricate one of their principal veſſels with their tools, is as great a work, as to build a Britiſh man of war with ours.</p>
                        <p>They have an adze of ſtone; a chiſſel, or gouge, of bone, generally that of a man's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>This is a complete catalogue of their tools, and with theſe they build houſes, conſtruct canoes, hew ſtone, and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The ſtone which makes the blade of their adzes is a kind of Baſaltes, of a blackiſh or grey colour, not very hard, but of conſiderable toughneſs: they are formed of different ſizes; ſome, that are intended for felling, weigh from ſix to eight pounds; others, that are uſed for carving, not more than ſo many ounces; but it is neceſſary to ſharpen both almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minute; for which purpoſe, a ſtone and a cocoa-nut ſhell full of water are always at hand.</p>
                        <p>Their greateſt exploit, to which theſe tools are leſs equal than to any other, is felling a tree: this requires many hands, and the conſtant labour of ſeveral days. When it is down, they ſplit it, with the grain, into planks from three to four inches thick, the whole length and breadth of the tree, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of which are eight feet in girt, and forty to the branches, and nearly of the ſame thickneſs throughout. The tree ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſed in their language called <hi>Avi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They ſmooth the plank very expeditiouſly and dexterouſly with their adzes, and can take off a thin coat from a whole plank without miſſing a ſtroke. As they have not the art of warping a plank, every part of the canoe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hollow or flat, is ſhaped by hand.</p>
                        <p>The canoes, or boats, which are uſed by the inhabitants of this and the neighbouring iſlands, may be divided into two general claſſes; one of which they call <hi>Ivahahs,</hi> the other <hi>Pahies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Ivahah is uſed for ſhort excurſions to ſea, and is wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided and flat-bottomed; the Pahie for longer voyages, and is bow-ſided and ſharp-bottomed. The Ivahas are all of the ſame figure, but of different fixes, and uſed for different pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes;
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:013324_0166_0F8FF52E82C61D10"/>
their length is from ſeventy-two feet to ten, but the breadth is by no means in proportion; for thoſe of ten feet are about a foot wide, and thoſe of more than ſeventy are ſcarcely two. There is the fighting Ivahah, the fiſhing Ivahah, and the travelling Ivahah; for ſome of theſe go from one iſland to another. The fighting Ivahah is by far the longeſt, and the head and ſtern are conſiderably raiſed above the body, in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircular form; particularly the ſtern, which is ſometimes ſeventeen or eighteen feet high, though the boat itſelf is ſcarcely three. Theſe never go to ſea ſingle; but are faſtened together, ſide by ſide, at the diſtance of about three feet, by ſtrong poles of wood, which are laid acroſs them and laſhed to the gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wales. Upon theſe, in the forepart, a ſtage or platform is raiſed, about ten or twelve feet long, and ſomewhat wider than the boats, which is ſupported by pillars about ſix feet high: upon this ſtage ſtand the fighting men, whoſe miſſile weapons are ſlings and ſpears; for, among other ſingularities in the manners of theſe people, their bows and arrows are uſed only for diverſion, as we throw quoits: below theſe ſtages fit the rowers, who receive from them thoſe that are wounded, and furniſh freſh men to aſcend in their room. Some of theſe have a platform of bamboos or other light wood, through their whole length, and conſiderably broader, by means of which they will carry a great number of men; but we ſaw only one fitted in this manner.</p>
                        <p>The fiſhing Ivahahs vary in length from about forty feet to the ſmalleſt ſize, which is about ten; all that are of the length of twenty-five feet and upwards, of whatever ſort, occaſionally carry ſail. The travelling Ivahah is always double, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a ſmall neat houſe about five or ſix feet broad, and ſix or ſeven feet long, which is faſtened upon the forepart for the convenience of the principal people, who ſit in them by day, and ſleep in them by night. The fiſhing Ivahahs are ſometimes joined together, and have a houſe on board; but this is not common.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe which are ſhorter than five and twenty feet, ſeldom or never carry ſail; and, though the ſtern riſes about four or five feet, have a flat head, and a board that projects forward about four feet.</p>
                        <p>The Pahie is alſo of different ſizes, from ſixty to thirty feet long; but, like the Ivahah, is very narrow. One that I meaſured was fifty-one feet long, and only one foot and a half wide at the top. In the wideſt part, it was about three feet; and this is the general proportion. It does not, however, widen by a gradual ſwell; but the ſides being ſtrait, and paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel, for a little way below the gunwale, it ſwells abruptly, and draws to a ridge at the bottom; ſo that a tranſverſe ſection of it has ſomewhat the appearance of the mark upon cards
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:013324_0167_0F8FF52F415E43F8"/>
called a ſpade, the whole being much wider in proportion to its length. Theſe, like the largeſt Ivahahs, are uſed for fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but principally for long voyages. The fighting Pahie, which is the largeſt, is fitted with the ſtage or platform, which is proportionably larger than thoſe of the Ivahah, as their form enables them to ſuſtain a much greater weight. Thoſe that are uſed for ſailing are generally double; and the middle ſize are ſaid to be the beſt ſea-boats. They are ſometimes out a month together, going from iſland to iſland; and ſometimes, as we were credibly informed, they are a fortnight or twenty days at ſea, and could keep it longer if they had more ſtowage for proviſions, and conveniencies to hold freſh water.</p>
                        <p>When any of theſe boats carry ſail ſingle, they make uſe of a log of wood which is faſtened to the end of two poles that lie acroſs the veſſel, and project from ſix to ten feet, according to the ſize of the veſſel, beyond its ſide, ſomewhat like what is uſed by the flying Proa of the Ladrone iſlands, and called in the account of Lord Anſon's voyage, an out-rigger. To this out-rigger the ſhrouds are faſtened, and it is eſſentially neceſſary in trimming the boat when it blows freſh.</p>
                        <p>Some of them have one maſt, and ſome two; they are made of a ſingle ſtick, and when the length of the canoe is thirty feet, that of the maſt is ſomewhat leſs than five and twenty; it is fixed to a frame that is above the canoe, and receives a ſail of matting about one third longer than itſelf; the ſail is pointed at the top, ſquare at the bottom, and curved at the ſide; ſomewhat reſembling what we call a ſhoulder of mutton ſail, and uſed for boats belonging to men of war: it is placed in a frame of wood, which ſurrounds it on every ſide, and has no contrivance either for reefing or furling; ſo that, if either ſhould become neceſſary, it muſt be cut away, which, however, in theſe equal climates can ſeldom happen. At the top of the maſt are faſtened ornaments of feathers, which are placed inclining obliquely forwards.</p>
                        <p>The oars or paddles that are uſed with theſe boats, have a long handle and a flat blade, not unlike a baker's peel. Of theſe every perſon in the boat has one, except thoſe that ſit under the awning; and they puſh her forward with them at a good rate. Theſe boats, however, admit ſo much water at the ſeams, that one perſon at leaſt is continually employed in throwing it out. The only thing in which they excel is land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and putting off from the ſhore in a ſurf: by their great length and high ſterns they land dry, when our boats could ſcarcely land at all; and have the ſame advantages in putting off by the height of their head. The Ivahas are the only boats that are uſed by the inhabitants of Otaheite; but we ſaw ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pahies that came from other iſlands.

They ſay that the milky-way is always curved laterally; but ſometimes in one direction, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in another: and that this curvature is the effect of its being already acted upon by the wind, and its hollow part therefore towards it; ſo that if the ſame curvature continues a night, a correſponding wind certainly blows the next day. Of their rules, I ſhall not pretend to judge; but I know, that
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:013324_0169_0F90F0BF7B3885C0"/>
by whatever means, they can predict the weather, at leaſt the wind, with much greater certainty than we can.</p>
                        <p>In their longer voyages, they ſteer by the ſun in the day, and in the night by the ſtars; all of which they diſtinguiſh ſeparately by names, and know in what part of the heavens they will appear in any of the months during which they are viſible in their horizon; they alſo know the time of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual appearing and diſappearing with more preciſion than will eaſily be believed by an European aſtronomer.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XIX. Of the Diviſion of Time in Otaheite; Numeration, Computation of Diſtance, Language, Diſeaſes, Diſpoſal of the Dead, Religion, War, Weapons, and Government; with ſome general Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Uſe of future Navigators.</head>
                        <p>WE were not able to acquire a perfect idea of their method of dividing time; but obſerved, that in ſpeaking of it, either paſt or to come, they never uſed any term but <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> which ſignifies moon. Of theſe moons they count thirteen, and then begin again; which is a demonſtration that they have a notion of the ſolar year: but how they compute their months ſo that thirteen of them ſhall be commenſurate with the year, we could not diſcover; for they ſay that each month has twenty-nine days, including one in which the moon is not viſible. They have names for them ſeparately, and have frequently told us the fruits that would be in ſeaſon, and the weather that would prevail, in each of them; and they have indeed a name for them collectively, though they uſe it only when they ſpeak of the myſteries of their religion.</p>
                        <p>Every day is ſubdivided into 12 parts, each of 2 hours, of which 6 belong to the day, and 6 to the night. At theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions they gueſs pretty nearly by the height of the ſun while he is above the horizon; but there are few of them that can gueſs at them, when he is below it, by the ſtars.</p>
                        <p>In numeration they proceed from one to ten, the number of fingers on both hands; and though they have for each number a different name, they generally take hold of their fingers one by one, ſhifting from one hand to the other till they come to the number they want to expreſs. And in other inſtances, we obſerved that, when they were converſing with each other, they joined ſigns to their words, which were ſo expreſſive that a ſtranger might eaſily apprehend their meaning.</p>
                        <p>In counting from ten they repeat the name of that number, and add the word <hi>more;</hi> ten, and one more, is eleven; ten, and
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:013324_0170_0F904D2E59258000"/>
two more twelve; and ſo of the reſt, as we ſay one and twenty, two and twenty. When they come to ten and ten more, they have a new denomination, as we ſay a ſcore; and by theſe ſcores they count till they get ten of them, when they have a denomination for two hundred; and we never could diſcover that they had any denomination to expreſs a greater number neither, indeed, do they ſeem to want any; for ten of theſe amount to 2000, a greater number than they can ever apply.</p>
                        <p>In meaſuring diſtance they are much more deficient than in computing numbers, having but one term which anſwers to fathom; when they ſpeak of diſtances from place to place, they expreſs it, like the Aſiaticks, by the time that is required to paſs it.</p>
                        <p>Their language is ſoft and melodious; it abounds with vowels, and we eaſily lear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>t to pronounce it; but found it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly difficult to teach them to pronounce a ſingle word of ours; probably not only from its abounding in conſonants, but from ſome peculiarity in its ſtructure; for Spaniſh and Italian words, if ending in a vowel, they pronounced with great facility.</p>
                        <p>Whether it is copious, we were not ſufficiently acquainted with it to know; but it is certainly very imperfect, for it is almoſt totally without inflexion, both of nouns and verbs. Few of the nouns have more than one caſe, and few of the verbs more than one tenſe; yet we find no great difficulty in making ourſelves mutually underſtood, however ſtrange it may appear in ſpeculation.</p>
                        <p>They have, however, certain <hi>affixa,</hi> which, though but few in number, are very uſeful to them, and puzzled us extremely. One aſks another, <hi>Harre hea?</hi> "Where are you going?" the other anſwers <hi>Ivahinera,</hi> "To my wives;" upon which the firſt repeating interrogatively, "To your wives?" is anſwered, <hi>Ivahinereira:</hi> "Yes, I am going to my wives." Here the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixa <hi>era</hi> and <hi>eira</hi> ſave ſeveral words to both parties.</p>
                        <p>I have inſerted a few of their words, from which perhaps ſome idea may be formed of the language.</p>

                        <p>Among people whoſe food is ſo ſimple, and who in general are ſeldom drunk, it is ſcarcely neceſſary to ſay, that there are but few diſeaſes; we ſaw no critical diſeaſe during our ſtay upon the iſland, and but few inſtances of ſickneſs, which were accidental fits of the colic. The natives, however, are afflicted with the eryſipelas, and cutaneous eruptions of the ſcaly kind, very nearly approaching to a leproſy. Thoſe in whom this diſtemper was far advanced, lived in a ſtate of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from all ſociety, each in a ſmall houſe built upon ſome unfrequented ſpot, where they were ſupplied with proviſions: but whether they had any hope of relief, or languiſhed out the remainder of their lives in ſolitude and deſpair, we could not learn. We obſerved alſo a few who had ulcers upon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of their bodies, ſome of which had a very virulent
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:013324_0172_0F90F0C0A73389A8"/>
appearance; yet they ſeemed not much to be regarded by thoſe who were afflicted with them, for they were left intirely without application, even to keep off the flies.</p>
                        <p>Where intemperance produces no diſeaſes, there will be no phyſicians by profeſſion; yet where there is ſufferance, there will always be attempts to relieve; and where the cauſe of the miſchief and the remedy are alike unknown, theſe will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be directed by ſuperſtition: thus it happens, that in this country, and in all others which are not further injured by luxury, or improved by knowledge, the management of the ſick falls to the lot of the prieſt. The method of cure that is practiſed by the prieſts of Otaheite, conſiſts chiefly of prayers and ceremonies. When he viſits his patient he repeats certain ſentences, which appear to be ſet forms contrived for the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and at the ſame time plaits the leaves of the cocoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut into different figures very neatly; ſome of theſe he faſtens to the fingers and toes of the ſick, and often leaves behind him a few branches of the <hi>the ſpecia populnea,</hi> which they call <hi>E'mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>o:</hi> theſe ceremonies are repeated till the patient recovers or dies. If he recovers, they ſay the remedies cured him, if he dies, they ſay the diſeaſe was incurable, in which, perhaps, they do not much differ from the cuſtom of other countries.</p>
                        <p>If we had judged of their ſkill in ſurgery from the dreadful ſcars which we ſometimes ſaw, we ſhould have ſuppoſed it to be much ſuperior to the art not only of their phyſicians, but of ours. We ſaw one man whoſe face was almoſt intirely deſtroyed, his noſe, including the bone, was perfectly flat, and one cheek and one eye were ſo beaten in, that the hollow would almoſt receive a man's fiſt, yet no ulcer remained; and our companion, Tupia, had been pierced quite through his body by a ſpear, headed with the bone of a ſting-ray, the weapon having entered his back, and come out juſt under his breaſt; but except in reducing diſlocations and fractures, the beſt ſurgeon can contribute very little to the cure of a wound; the blood itſelf is the beſt vulnerary balſam, and when the juices of the body are pure, and the patient is temperate, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more is neceſſary, as an aid to nature, in the cure of the worſt wound, than the keeping it clean.</p>
                        <p>Their commerce with the inhabitants of Europe has, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, already entailed upon them that dreadful curſe which avenged the inhumanities committed by the Spaniards in America, the venereal diſeaſe. As it is certain that no Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean veſſel beſides our own, except the Dolphin, and the two that were under the command of Monſ. Bougainville, ever viſited this iſland, it muſt have been brought either by one of them or by us. That it was not brought by the Dolphin, Captain Wallis has demonſtrated in the account of her voyage, and nothing is more certain than that
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:013324_0173_0F90F0C2600DE6F0"/>
when we arrived it had made moſt dreadful ravages in the iſland. One of our people contracted it within five days after we went on ſhore, and by the enquiries among the natives, which this occaſioned, we learnt, when we came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a little of their language, that it had been brought by the veſſels which had been there about fifteen months before us, and had lain on the eaſt-ſide of the iſland. They diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed it by a name of the ſame import with <hi>rottenneſs,</hi> but of a more extenſive ſignification, and deſcribed in the moſt pathetic terms, the ſufferings of the firſt victims to its rage, and told us that it cauſed the hair and the nails to fall off, and the fleſh to rot from the bones: that it ſpread a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal terror and conſternation among them, ſo that the ſick were abandoned by their neareſt relations, leſt the calamity ſhould ſpread by contagion, and left to periſh alone in ſuch miſery as till then had never been known among them. We had ſome reaſon, however, to hope that they had found out a ſpecific to cure it: during our ſtay upon the iſland we ſaw none in whom it had made a great progreſs, and one who went from us infected, returned after a ſhort time in perfect health; and by this it appeared either that the diſeaſe had cured itſelf, or that they were not unacquainted with the virtues of ſimples, nor implicit dupes to the ſuperſtitious follies of their prieſts. We endeavoured to learn the medical qualities which they imputed to their plants, but our knowledge of their language was too imperfect for us to ſucceed. If we could have learnt their ſpecific for the venereal diſeaſe, if ſuch they have, it would have been of great advantage to us, for when we left the iſland it had been contracted by more than half the people on board the ſhip.</p>
                        <p>It is impoſſible but that, in relating incidents, many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars with reſpect to the cuſtoms, opinions, and works of theſe people ſhould be anticipated; to avoid repetition, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall only ſupply deficiencies. Of the manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of their dead, much has been ſaid already. I muſt more explicitly obſerve that there are two places in which the dead are depoſited; one a kind of ſhed, where the fleſh is ſuffered to putrefy; the other an encloſure, with erections of ſtone, where the bones are afterwards buried. The ſheds are called TUPAPOW, and the encloſures Morai. The Morais are alſo places of worſhip.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as a native of Otaheite is known to be dead, the houſe is filled with relations, who deplore their loſs, ſome by loud lamentations, and ſome by leſs clamorous, but more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine expreſſions of grief. Thoſe who are in the neareſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of kindred, and are really affected by the event, are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; the reſt are one moment uttering paſſionate exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a chorus, and the next laughing and talking without
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:013324_0174_0F8FF5310CEC9030"/>
the leaſt appearance of concern. In this manner the remainder of the day on which they aſſemble is ſpent, and all the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding night. On the next morning the body is ſhrouded in their cloth, and conveyed to the ſea ſide upon a bier, which the bearers ſupport upon their ſhoulders, attended by the prieſt, who, having prayed over the body, repeats his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences during the proceſſion: when it arrives at the water's edge, it is ſet down upon the beach; the prieſt renews his prayers, and taking up ſome of the water in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>is hands, ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les it towards the body, but not upon it. It is then carried back forty or fifty yards, and ſoon after brought again to the beach, where the prayers and ſprinkling are repeated: it is thus removed backwards and forwards ſeveral times, and while theſe ceremonies have been performing a houſe has been built, and a ſmall ſpace of ground railed in. In the center of this houſe, or Tupapow, poſts are ſet up to ſupport the bier, which is at length conveyed thither, and placed upon it, and here the body remains to putrify, till the fleſh is wholly waſted from the bones.</p>
                        <p>Theſe houſes of corruption are of a ſize proportioned to the rank of the perſon whoſe body they are to contain; thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to the lower claſs are juſt ſufficient to cover the bier, and have no railing round them. The largeſt we ever ſaw was eleven yards long, and ſuch as theſe are ornamented according to the abilities and inclination of the ſurviving kindred, who never fail to lay a profuſion of good cloth about the body, and ſometimes almoſt cover the outſide of the houſe. Garlands of the fruit of the palm-nut or <hi>pandanus,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d cocoa leaves, twiſted by the prieſts in myſterious knots, with a plant called by them <hi>Ethee no Morai,</hi> which is particularly conſecrated to funeral ſolemnities, are depoſited about the place; proviſion and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are alſo left at a little diſtance, of which, and of other decorations, a more particular deſcription has been given al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as the body is depoſited in the Tupapow, the mourning is renewed. The women aſſemble, and are led to the door by the neareſt relation, who ſtrikes a ſhark's tooth ſeveral times in the crown of her head: the blood copiouſly follows, and is carefully received upon pieces of linen, which are thrown under the bier. The reſt of the women follow this example, and the ceremony is repeated at the interval of two or three days, as long as the zeal and ſorrow of the parties hold out. The tears alſo which are ſhed upon theſe occaſions, are received upon pieces of cloth, and offered as oblations to the dead: ſome of the younger people cut off their hair, and that is thrown under the bier with the other offerings. This cuſtom is founded upon a notion that the ſoul of the deceaſed, which they believe to exiſt in a ſeparate ſtate, is hovering
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:013324_0175_0F8FF531800C0238"/>
the place where the body is depoſited: that it obſerves the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſurvivors, and is gratified by ſuch teſtimonies of their affection and grief.</p>
                        <p>Two or three days after theſe ceremonies have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced by the women, during which the men ſeem to be wholly inſenſible of their loſs, they alſo begin to perform their part. The neareſt relations take it in turn to aſſume the dreſs, and perform the office which have already been particularly deſcribed in the account of Tubourai Tamaide's having acted as chief mourner to an old women, his relation, who died while we were in the iſland. One part of the ceremony, however, which accounts for the running away of the people as ſoon as this proceſſion is in ſight, has not been mentioned. The chief mourner carries in his hand a long flat ſtick, the edge of which is ſet with ſhark's teeth, and in a phrenzy, which his grief is ſuppoſed to have inſpired, he runs at all he ſees, and if any of them happen to be overtaken, he ſtrikes them moſt unmercifully with this intended cudgel, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to wound them in a dangerous manner.</p>
                        <p>Theſe proceſſions continue at certain intervals for five moons, but are leſs and leſs frequent, by a gradual diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the end of that time approaches. When it is expired, what remains of the body is taken down from the bier, and the bones having been ſcraped and waſhed very clean, are buried, according to the rank of the perſon, either within or without a Morai: if the deceaſed was a Earee, or Chief, his ſkull is not buried with the reſt of the bones, but is wrapped up in fine cloth, and put in a kind of box made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which is alſo placed in the Morai. This coffer is called <hi>Ewharre no te Orometua,</hi> the houſe of a teacher or maſter. After this the mourning ceaſes, except ſome of the women continue to be really afflicted for the loſs, and in that caſe they will ſometimes ſuddenly wound themſelves with the ſhark's tooth wherever they happen to be: this perhaps will account for the paſſion of grief in which Terapo wounded her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the fort; ſome accidental circumſtance might forcibly revive the remembrance of a friend or relation whom ſhe had loſt, with a pungency of regret and tenderneſs, which forced a vent by tears, and prompted her to a repetition of the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rite.</p>
                        <p>The ceremonies, however, do not ceaſe with the mourning: prayers are ſtill ſaid by the prieſt, who is well paid by the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving relations, and offerings made at the Morai. Some of the things, which from time to time are depoſited there, are emblematical: a young plantain repreſents the deceaſed, and the bunch of feathers the deity who is invoked. The prieſt places himſelf over-againſt the ſymbol of the God, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by ſome of the relations, who are furniſhed with a ſmall
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:013324_0176_0F8FF5323B87F998"/>
offering, and repeats his oraiſon in a ſet form, conſiſting of ſeparate ſentences; at the ſame time weaving the leaves of the cocoa-nut into different forms, which he afterwards depoſits upon the ground where the bones have been interred; the dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is then addreſſed by a ſhrill ſcreech, which is uſed only upon that occaſion. When the prieſt retires, the tuft of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is removed, and the proviſions left to putrify, or be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the rats.</p>
                        <p>Of the religion of theſe people, we were not able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any clear and conſiſtent knowledge: we found it like the religion of moſt other countries, involved in myſtery, and perplexed with apparent inconſiſtencies. The religious lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is alſo here, as it is in China, different from that which is uſed in common; ſo that Tupia, who took great pains to inſtruct us, having no words to expreſs his meaning which we underſtood, gave us lectures to very little purpoſe: what we learnt, however, I will relate with as much perſpicuity as I can.</p>
                        <p>Nothing is more obvious to a rational being, however ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant or ſtupid, than that the univerſe and its various parts, as far as they fall under his notice, were produced by ſome agent inconceivably more powerful than himſelf; and nothing is more difficult to be conceived, even by the moſt ſagacious and knowing, than the production of them from nothing, which among us is expreſſed by the word <hi>Creation.</hi> It is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural therefore, as no Being apparently capable of producing the univerſe is to be ſeen, that he ſhould be ſuppoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in ſome diſtant part of it, or to be in his nature inviſible, and that he ſhould have originally produced all that now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts in a manner ſimilar to that in which nature is renovated by the ſucceſſion of one generation to another; but the idea of procreation includes in it that of two perſons, and from the conjunction of two perſons theſe people imagine every thing in the univerſe either originally or derivatively to proceed.</p>
                        <p>The Supreme Deity, one of theſe two firſt beings, they call TAROATAIHETOOMOO, and the other, whom they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to have been a rock, TEPAPA. A daughter of theſe was TETTOWMATATAYO, the year, or thirteen months collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, which they never name but upon this occaſion, and ſhe, by the common father, produced the months, and the months, by conjunction with each other, the days: the ſtars they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe partly to be the immediate offspring of the firſt pair, and partly to have increaſed among themſelves; and they have the ſame notion with reſpect to the different ſpecies of plants. Among other progeny of Taroataihetoomoo and Tepapa, they ſuppoſe an inferior race of deities whom they call EATUAS. Two of theſe Eatuas, they ſay, at ſome remote period of time, inhabited the earth, and were the parents of the firſt man.
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:013324_0177_0F8FF53480E3CC68"/>
When this man, their common anceſtor, was born, they ſay that he was round like a ball, but that his mother, with great care, drew out his limbs, and having at length moulded him into his preſent form, ſhe called him EOTHE, which ſignifies <hi>finiſhed.</hi> That being prompted by the univerſal inſtinct to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate his kind, and being able to find no female but his mother, he begot upon her a daughter, and upon the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other daughters for ſeveral generations, before there was a ſon; a ſon, however, being at length born, he, by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his ſiſters, peopled the world.</p>
                        <p>Beſides their daughter Tettowmatatayo, the firſt progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of nature had a ſon whom they called TANE. Taroatai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hetoomoo, the Supreme Deity, they emphatically ſtile the cauſer of earthquakes; but their prayers are more generally addreſſed to Tane, whom they ſuppoſe to take a greater part in the affairs of mankind.</p>
                        <p>Their ſubordinate deities or Eatuas, which are numerous, are of both ſexes: the male are worſhipped by the men, and the female by the women; and each have Morais to which the other ſex is not admitted, though they have alſo Morais common to both. Men perform the office of prieſt to both ſexes, but each ſex has its prieſts, for thoſe who officiate for one ſex, do not officiate for the other.</p>
                        <p>They believe the immortality of the ſoul, at leaſt its exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in a ſeparate ſtate, and that there are two ſituations of different degrees of happineſs, ſomewhat analogous to our heaven and hell: the ſuperior ſituation they call <hi>Tavirua l'e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rai,</hi> the other <hi>Tiahoboo.</hi> They do not, however, conſider them as places of reward and puniſhment, but as receptacles for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent claſſes; the firſt, for their Chiefs and principal people, the other for thoſe of inferior rank, for they do not ſuppoſe that their actions here in the leaſt influence their future ſtate, or indeed that they come under the cognizance of their deities at all. Their religion, therefore, if it has no influence upon their morals, is at leaſt diſintereſted; and their expreſſions of adoration and reverence, whether by words or actions, ariſe only from a humble ſenſe of their own inferiority, and the ineffable excellence of divine perfection.</p>
                        <p>The character of the prieſt of Tahowa, is hereditary: the claſs is numerous, and conſiſts of all ranks of people; the chief, however, is generally the younger brother of a good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and is reſpected in a degree next to their kings. Of the little knowledge that is poſſeſſed in this country, the prieſts have the greateſt ſhare; but it conſiſts principally in an acquaintance with the names and ranks of the different Eatuas, or ſubordinate divinities, and the opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the origin of things, which have been traditionally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved among the order in detached ſentences, of which ſome
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:013324_0178_0F8FFA00B966CB30"/>
will repeat an incredible number, though but very few of the words that are uſed in their common dialect occur in them.</p>
                        <p>The prieſts, however, are ſuperior to the reſt of the people in the knowledge of navigation and aſtronomy, and indeed the name Tahowa ſignifies nothing more than a man of knowlege. As there are prieſts of every claſs, they officiate only among that claſs to which they belong: the prieſt of the inferior claſs is never called upon by thoſe of ſuperior rank, nor will the prieſt of the ſuperior rank officiate for any of the inferior claſs.</p>
                        <p>Marriage in this iſland, as appeared to us, is nothing more than an agreement between the man and woman, with which the prieſt has no concern. Where it is contracted it appears to be pretty well kept, though ſometimes the parties ſeparate by mutual conſent, and in that caſe a divorce takes place with as little trouble as the marriage.</p>
                        <p>But though the prieſthood has laid the people under no tax for a nuptial benediction, there are two operations which it has appropriated, and from which it derives conſiderable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. One is <hi>tattowing,</hi> and the other circumciſion, though neither of them have any connexion with religion. The tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towing has been deſcribed already. Circumciſion has been adopted merely from motives of cleanlineſs; it cannot indeed properly be called circumciſion, becauſe the <hi>prepuce</hi> is not mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated by a circular wound, but only ſlit through the upper part to prevent its contracting over the <hi>glans.</hi> As neither of theſe can be performed by any but a prieſt, and as to be without either is the greateſt diſgrace, they may be conſidered as a claim to ſurplice fees like our marriages and chriſtenings, which are cheerfully and liberally paid, not according to any ſettled ſtipend, but the rank and abilities of the parties or their friends.</p>
                        <p>The Morai, as has already been obſerved, is at once a burying ground and a place of worſhip, and in this particular our churches too much reſemble it. The Indian, however, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches his Morai with a reverence and humility that diſgraces the chriſtian, not becauſe he holds any thing ſacred that is there, but becauſe he there worſhips an inviſible divinity, for whom, though he neither hopes for reward, nor fears puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at his hand, he always expreſſes the profoundeſt homage, and moſt humble adoration. I have already given a very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deſcription both of the Morais and the altars that are placed near them. When an Indian is about to worſhip at the Morai, or brings his offering to the altar, he always uncovers his body to the waſte, and his looks and attitude are ſuch as ſufficiently expreſs a correſponding diſpoſition of mind.</p>
                        <p>It did not appear to us that theſe people are, in any inſtance guilty of idolatry; at leaſt they do not worſhip any thing that is the work of their hands, nor any viſible part of the creation.
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:013324_0179_0F8FFA0113A3DCD0"/>
This iſland indeed, and the reſt that lie near it, have a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular bird, ſome a heron, and others a king's fiſher, to which they pay a peculiar regard, and concerning which they have ſome ſuperſtitious notions with reſpect to good and bad fortune, as we have of the ſwallow and robin-red-breaſt, given them the name of EATUA, and by no means killing or moleſting them; or approach them with any act of adoration.</p>
                        <p>Though I dare not aſſert that theſe people, to whom the art of writing, and conſequently the recording of laws, are utterly unknown, live under a regular form of government; yet a ſubordination is eſtabliſhed among them, that greatly reſembles the early ſtate of every nation in Europe under the feudal ſyſtem, which ſecured liberty in the moſt licentious exceſs to a few, and entailed the moſt abject ſlavery upon the reſt.</p>
                        <p>Their orders are, <hi>Earee rahie,</hi> which anſwers to king; <hi>Ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>,</hi> villain. The Earee rahie, of which there are two in this iſland, one being the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign of each of the peninſulas of which it conſiſts, is treated with great reſpect by all ranks, but did not appear to us to be inveſted with ſo much power as was exerciſed by the Earees in their own diſtricts; nor indeed did we, as I have before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, once ſee the ſovereign of Obereonoo, while we were in the iſland. The Earees are lords of one or more of the diſtricts into which each of the peninſulas is divided, of which there may be about one hundred in the whole iſland; and they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel out their territories to the Manohounies, who cultivate each his part which he holds under the baron. The loweſt claſs, called Toutous, ſeem to be nearly under the ſame circumſtances as the villains in feudal governments; theſe do all the laborious work, they cultivate the land under the Manahounies, who are only nominal cultivators for the lord, they fetch wood and water, and under the direction of the miſtreſs of the family, dreſs the victuals, they alſo catch the fiſh.</p>
                        <p>Each of the Earees keeps a kind of court, and has a great number of attendants, chiefly the younger brothers of their own tribe; and among theſe ſome hold particular offices, but of what nature exactly we could not tell. One was called the <hi>Eowa no l'Earee,</hi> and another the <hi>Whanno no l'Earee,</hi> and theſe were frequently diſpatched to us with meſſages. Of all the courts of theſe Earees, that of Tootahah was the moſt ſplendid, as indeed might reaſonably be expected, becauſe he admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered the government for Outou, his nephew, who, was Earee rahie of Obereonoo, and lived upon his eſtate. The child of the baron or Earee, as well as of the ſovereign or Earee rahie, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the title and honours of the father as ſoon as it is born: ſo that a baron, who was yeſterday called Earee, and was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with the ceremony of lowering the garments, ſo as to uncover the upper part of the body, is to-day, if his wife was
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:013324_0180_0F90F0C2865BEE00"/>
laſt night delivered of a child, reduced to the rank of a private man, all marks of reſpect being transferred to the child, if it is ſuffered to live, though the father ſtill continues poſſeſſor and adminiſtrator of his eſtate: probably this cuſtom has its ſhare, among other inducements, in forming the ſocieties called Arreoy.</p>
                        <p>If a general attack happens to be made upon the iſland, every diſtrict under the command of an Earee, is obliged to furniſh its proportion of ſoldiers for the common defence. The number furniſhed by the principal diſtricts, which Tupia recollected, when added together, amounted, as I have obſerved before, to ſix thouſand ſix hundred and eighty.</p>
                        <p>Upon ſuch occaſions, the united force of the whole iſland is commanded in chief by the Earee rahie. Private differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Earees, are decided by their own people, without at all diſturbing the general tranquility.</p>
                        <p>Their weapons are ſlings, which they uſe with great dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, pikes headed with the ſtings of ſting-rays, and clubs, of about ſix or ſeven feet long, made of a very hard heavy wood. Thus armed, they are ſaid to fight with great obſtinacy, which is the more likely to be true, as it is certain that they give no quarter either to man, woman, or child, who is ſo unfortunate as to fall into their hands during the battle, or for ſome hours afterwards, till their paſſion, which is always violent, though not laſting, has ſubſided.</p>
                        <p>The Earee rahie of Obereonoo, while we were here, was in perfect amity with the Earee rahie of Tiarreboo, the other penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula, though he took himſelf the title of king of the whole iſland; this, however, produced no more jealouſy in the other ſovereign, than the title of king of France, aſſumed by our ſovereign, does in his moſt Chriſtian majeſty.</p>
                        <p>In a government ſo rude, it cannot be expected that diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juſtice ſhould be regularly adminiſtered, and indeed where there is ſo little oppoſition of intereſt, in conſequence of the facility with which every appetite and paſſion is gratified, there can be but few crimes. There is nothing like money, the common medium by which every want and every wiſh is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be gratified by thoſe who do not poſſeſs it; there is no apparently permanent good which either fraud or force can unlawfully obtain; and when all the crimes that are committed by the inhabitants of civilized countries, to get money, are ſet out of the account, not many will remain; add to this, that where the commerce with woman is reſtrained by no law, men will ſeldom be under any temptation to commit adultery, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as one woman is always leſs preferred to another, where they are leſs diſtinguiſhed by perſonal decorations, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious circumſtances which are produced by the varieties of art, and the refinements of ſentiment. That they are thieves
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:013324_0181_0F90F0C7D66EEB80"/>
is true; but as among theſe people no man can be much injured or benefited by theft, it is not neceſſary to reſtrain it by ſuch puniſhments, as in other countries are abſolutely neceſſary to the very exiſtence of civil ſociety. Tupia, however, tells us, that adultery is ſometimes committed as well as theft. In all caſes where an injury has been committed, the puniſhment of the offender lies with the ſufferer: adulery, if the parties are caught in the fact, is ſometimes puniſhed with death in the firſt ardour of reſentment; but without circumſtances of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate provocation, the female ſinner ſeldom ſuffers more than a beating. As puniſhment, however, is enforced by no law, nor taken into the hand of any magiſtrate, it is not often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, except the injured party is the ſtrongeſt; though the chiefs do ſometimes puniſh their immediate dependants, for faults committed againſt each other, and even the dependents of others if they are accuſed of any offence committed in their diſtrict.</p>
                        <p>Having now given the beſt deſcription that I can of the iſland in its preſent ſtate, and of the people, with their cuſtoms and manners, language and arts, I ſhall only add a few gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obſervations, which may be of uſe to future navigators, if any of the ſhips of Great-Britain ſhould receive orders to viſit it. As it produces nothing that appears to be convertible into an article of trade, and can be uſeful only by affording refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſhipping in their paſſage through theſe ſeas, it might be made to anſwer this purpoſe in a much greater degree, by tranſporting thither ſheep, goats, and horned cattle, with European garden ſtuff, and other uſeful vegetables, which there is the greateſt reaſon to ſuppoſe will flouriſh in ſo fine a climate and ſo rich a ſoil.</p>
                        <p>Though this, and the neighbouring iſlands lie within the tropic of Capricorn, yet the heat is not troubleſome, nor did the winds blow conſtantly from the eaſt. We had frequently a freſh gale from the S. W. for two or three days, and ſometimes, though very ſeldom, from the N. W. Tupia reported, that ſouth weſterly winds prevail in October, November, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, and we have no doubt of the fact. When the winds are variable, they are always accompanied by a ſwell from the S. W. or W. S. W. there is alſo a ſwell from the ſame points when it is calm, and the atmoſphere loaded with clouds, which is a ſure indication that the winds are variable, or weſterly out at ſea, for with the ſettled trade wind the weather is clear.</p>
                        <p>The meeting with weſterly winds, within the general limits of the eaſtern trade, has induced ſome navigators to ſuppoſe that they were near ſome large tract of land, of which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I think they are no indication.</p>
                        <p>It has been found, both by us and the Dolphin, that the trade-wind, in theſe parts, does not extend farther to the ſouth
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:013324_0182_0F8FFA01D09D6EE8"/>
than twenty degrees, beyond which, we generally found a gale from the weſtward; and it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that when theſe winds blow ſtrong, they will drive back the eaſterly wind, and conſequently encroach upon the limits within which they conſtantly blow, and thus neceſſarily produce variable winds, as either happens to prevail, and a ſouth weſterly ſwell. This ſuppoſition is the more probable, as it is well known that the trade winds blow but faintly for ſome diſtance within their limits, and therefore may be more eaſily ſtopped or repelled by a wind in the contrary direction; it is alſo well known, that the limits of the trade winds vary not only at different ſeaſons of the year, but ſometimes at the ſame ſeaſon, in different years.</p>
                        <p>There is therefore no reaſon to ſuppoſe that ſouth weſterly winds, within theſe limits, are cauſed by the vicinity of large tracts of land, eſpecially as they are always accompanied with a large ſwell, in the ſame direction in which they blow; and we find a much greater ſurf beating upon the ſhores of the ſouth weſt ſide of the iſlands that are ſituated juſt within the limits of the trade wind, than upon any other part of them.</p>
                        <p>The tides about theſe iſlands, are perhaps as inconſiderable as in any part of the world. A ſouth or S. by W. moon, makes high water in the bay of Matavia at Otaheite; but the water very ſeldom riſes perpendicularly above ten or twelve inches.</p>
                        <p>The variation of the compaſs, I found to be 4° 46′ eaſterly, this being the reſult of a great number of trials made with four of Dr. Knight's needles, adapted to azimuth compaſſes. Theſe compaſſes I thought the beſt that could be procured, yet, when applied to the meridian line, I found them to differ not only from one another, ſometimes a degree and a half, but the ſame needle, half a degree from itſelf in different trials made on the ſame day; and I do not remember that I have ever found two needles which exactly agreed at the ſame time and place, though I have often found the ſame needle agree with itſelf, in ſeveral trials made one after the other. This imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the needle, however, is of no conſequence to navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as the variation can always be found to a degree of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy, more than ſufficient for all nautical purpoſes.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XX. A Deſcription of ſeveral other Iſlands in the Neighbourhood of Otaheite, with various Incidents; a dramatic Entertainment; and many particulars relative to the Cuſtoms and Manners of the Inhabitants.</head>
                        <p>AFTER parting with our friends, we made an eaſy ſail, with gentle breezes and clear weather, and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Tupia, that four of the neighbouring iſlands, which he diſtinguiſhed by the names of HUAHEINE, ULIETEA, OTAHA, and BOLABOLA, lay at the diſtance of between one and two days ſail from Otaheite; and that hogs, fowls and other refreſhments, with which we of late had been but ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly ſupplied, were there to be procured in great plenty; but having diſcovered from the hills of Otaheite, an iſland lying to the northward, which he called TETHUROA, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined firſt to ſtand that way, to take a nearer view of it. It lies N. half W. diſtant eight leagues from the northern extremity of Otaheite, upon which we had obſerved the tranſit, and to which we had, for that reaſon, given the name of POINT VE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUS. We found it to be a ſmall low iſland, and were told by Tupia, that it had no ſettled inhabitants, but was occaſionally viſited by the inhabitants of Otaheite, who ſometimes went thither for a few days to fiſh: we therefore determined to ſpend no more time in a farther examination of it, but to go in ſearch of Huaheine and Ulietea, which he deſcribed to be well peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and as large as Otaheite.</p>
                        <p>At ſix o'clock in the morning of the 14th, the weſtermoſt part of EIMEO, or York iſland, bore S. E. ½ S. and the body of Otaheite E. ½ S. At<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>noon, the body of York iſland bore E. by S. ½ S. and Port Royal bay, at Otaheite, S. 70° 45′ E. diſtant 61 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and an iſland which we took to be Saunders's iſland, called by the natives TAPOAMANAO, bore S. S. W. We alſo ſaw land bearing N. W. ½ W. which Tupia ſaid was Huaheine.</p>
                        <p>On the 15th, it was hazy, with light breezes and calms ſucceeding each other, ſo that we could ſee no land, and made but little way. Our Indian, Tupia, often prayed for a wind to his god Tane, and as often boaſted of his ſucceſs, which indeed he took a very effectual method to ſecure, for he never began his addreſs to Tane, till he ſaw a breeze ſo near that he knew it muſt reach the ſhip before his oraiſon was well over.</p>
                        <p>On the 16th, we had a gentle breeze; and in the morning about eight o'clock, being cloſe in with the north weſt part of
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:013324_0184_0F90F0CF49BB8420"/>
of the iſland Huaheine, we ſounded, but had no bottom with 80 fathom. Some canoes very ſoon came off, but the people, ſeemed afraid, and kept at a diſtance till they diſcovered Tupia, and then they ventured nearer. In one of the canoes that came up to the ſhip's ſide, was the king of the iſland and his wife. Upon aſſurances of friendſhip, frequently and earneſtly repeated, their Majeſties and ſome others came on board. At firſt they were ſtruck with aſtoniſhment, and wondered at every thing that was ſhewn them; yet they made no enquiries, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſatisfied with what was offered to their notice, they made no ſearch after other objects of curioſity, with which it was natural to ſuppoſe a building of ſuch novelty and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as the ſhip muſt abound. After ſome time, they became more familiar. I was given to underſtand, that the name of the king was Oree, and he propoſed, as a mark of amity, that we ſhould exchange names. To this I readily conſented, and he was Cookee, for ſo he pronounced my name, and I was Oree, for the reſt of the time we were together. We found theſe people to be very nearly the ſame with thoſe of Otaheite, in perſon, dreſs, language, and every other circumſtance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, if Tupia might be believed, that they would not ſteal.</p>
                        <p>Soon after dinner, we came to an anchor, in a ſmall but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent harbour on the weſt ſide of the iſland, which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives call Owharre, in eighteen fathom water, clear ground, and ſecure from all winds. I went immediately on ſhore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Mr. Monkhouſe, Tupia, King Cookee, and ſome other of the natives who had been on board ever ſince the morning. The moment we landed Tupia ſtripped himſelf as low as the waiſt, and deſired Mr. Monkhouſe to do the ſame: he then ſat down before a great number of the natives, who were collected together in a large houſe or ſhed; for here, as well as at Otaheite, a heuſe conſiſts only of a roof, ſupported upon poles; the reſt of us, by his deſire, ſtanding behind. He then began a ſpeech or prayer which laſted about a quarter of an hour, the King who ſtood over againſt him every now and then anſwering in what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be ſet reſponſes. In the courſe of this harangue he delivered at different times two handkerchiefs, a black ſilk neckcloth, ſome beads, two ſmall branches of feathers, and ſome plantains, as preſents to their Eatua, or God. In return for theſe, he received for our Eatua, a hog, ſome young plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and two ſmall bunches of feathers, which he ordered to be carried on board the ſhip. After theſe ceremonies, which we ſuppoſed to be the ratification of a treaty between us, every one was diſmiſſed to go whither he pleaſed; and Tupia im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately repaired to offer his oblations at one of the Morais.</p>
                        <p>The next morning we went on ſhore again, and walked up the hills, where the productions were exactly the ſame as thoſe
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:013324_0185_0F8FFA0289EBEAC0"/>
of Otaheite, except that the rocks and clay appeared to be more burnt. The houſes were neat, and the boat houſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably large; one that we meaſured was fifty paces long, ten broad, and twenty-four feet high; the whole formed a pointed arch, like thoſe of our old cathedrals, which was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported on one ſide by twenty-ſix, and on the other by thirty pillars, or rather poſts, about two feet high, and one thick, upon moſt of which were rudely carved the heads of men, and ſeveral fanciful devices, not altogether unlike thoſe which we ſometimes ſee printed from wooden blocks, at the beginning and end of old books. The plains and flat part of the country, abounded in bread fruit, and cocoa-nut trees; in ſome places, however, there were ſalt ſwamps and lagoons, which would produce neither.</p>
                        <p>We went again on ſhore on the 18th, and would have taken the advantage of Tupia's company, in our perambulation; but he was too much engaged with his friends: we took how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his boy, whoſe name was Tayeto, and Mr. Banks went to take a farther view of what had much engaged his attention before; it was a kind of cheſt or ark, the lid of which was nicely ſewed on, and thatched very neatly with palm-nut leaves: it was fixed upon two poles, and ſupported on little arches of wood, very neatly carved; the uſe of the poles ſeemed to be to remove it from place to place, in the manner of our ſedan chairs: in one end of it was a ſquare hole, in the middle of which was a ring touching the ſides, and leaving the angles open, ſo as to form a round hole within a ſquare one. The firſt time Mr. Banks ſaw this coffer, the aperture at the end was ſtopped with a piece of cloth, which, leaſt he ſhould give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, he left untouched; probably there was then ſomething within, but now the cloth was taken away, and upon looking into it, it was found empty. The general reſemblance between this repoſitory and the ark of the Lord among the Jews is remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable; but it is ſtill more remarkable, that upon enquiring of the boy what it was called, he ſaid <hi>Ewharre no Eatua</hi> the <hi>houſe of the God;</hi> he could however give no account of its ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or uſe. We had commenced a kind of trade with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, but it went on ſlowly; for when any thing was offered, not one of them would take it upon his own judgment, but col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the opinions of twenty or thirty people, which could not be done without great loſs of time. We got, however, eleven pigs, and determined to try for more the next day.</p>
                        <p>The next day, therefore, we brought out ſome hatchets, for which we hoped we ſhould have had no occaſion, upon an iſland which no European had ever viſited before. Theſe procured us three very large hogs; and as we propoſed to ſail in the afternoon, King Oree and ſeveral others came on board to take their leave. To the King I gave a ſmall plate of pewter, on
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:013324_0186_0F90F0CF71B9D7D8"/>
which was ſtamped this inſcription, <q>His Britannic Majeſty's ſhip, Endeavour, Lieutenant Cook, commander, 16th July, 1769, Huaheine.</q> I give him alſo ſome medals or counters, reſembling the coin of England, ſtruck in the year 1761, with ſome other preſents; and he promiſed that with none of theſe, particularly the plate, he would ever part. I thought it as laſting a teſtimony of our having firſt diſcovered this iſland, as any we could leave behind; and having diſmiſſed our viſitors well ſatisfied, and in great good humour, we ſet ſail, about half an hour after two in the afternoon.</p>
                        <p>The iſland of Huaheine, or Huahene, is ſituated in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 16° 43′ S. and longitude 150° 52′ W. from Greenwich: it is diſtant from Otaheite about thirty one leagues in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of N. 58 W. and is about ſeven leagues in compaſs. Its ſurface is hilly and uneven, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d it has a ſafe and commodious harbour. The harbour, which is called by the natives Owallee, or Owharre, lies on the weſt ſide, under the northermoſt high land, and within the north end of the reef, which lies along that ſide of the iſland; there are two inlets and openings, by which it may be entered, through the reef, about a mile and a half diſtant from each other; the ſouthermoſt is the wideſt, and on the ſouth ſide of it lies a very ſmall ſandy iſland.</p>
                        <p>Huaheine ſeems to be a month forwarder in its productions than Otaheite, as we found the cocoa-nuts full of kernel, and ſome of the new bread-fruit fit to eat. Of the cocoa-nuts the inhabitants make a food which they call <hi>Poe,</hi> by mixing them with yams; they ſcrape both fine, and having incorporated the powder, they put it into a wooden trough, with a number of hot ſtones, by which an oily kind of haſty pudding is made, that our people reliſhed very well, eſpecially when it was fryed. Mr. Banks found not more than eleven or twelve new plants; but he obſerved ſome inſects, and a ſpecies of ſcorpion which he had not ſeen before.</p>
                        <p>The inhabitants ſeem to be larger made, and more ſtout than thoſe of Otaheite. Mr. Banks meaſured one of the men, and found him to be ſix feet three inches and an half high; yet they are ſo lazy, that he could not perſuade any of them to go up the hills with him: they ſaid, if they were to attempt it, the fatigue would kill them. The women were very fair, more ſo than thoſe of Otaheite; and in general, we thought them more handſome, though none that were equal to ſome individuals. Both ſexes ſeemed to be leſs timid, and leſs curious: it has been obſerved, that they made no enquiries on board the ſhip; and when we fired a gun, they were frighted indeed, but they did not fall down, as our friends at Otaheite conſtantly did when we firſt came among them. For this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, however, we can eaſily account upon other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; the people of Huaheine had not ſeen the Dolphin,
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:013324_0187_0F8FFA04B7E6E9C0"/>
thoſe at Otaheite had. In one, the report of a gun was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the idea of inſtant deſtruction; to the other, there was nothing dreadful in it but the appearance and the ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nd, as they had never experienced its power of diſpenſing death.</p>
                        <p>While we were on ſhore, we found that Tupia had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them beyond their merit, when he ſaid that they would not ſteal; for one of them was detected in the fact. But when he was ſeized by the hair, the reſt inſtead of running away, as the people at Otaheite would have done, gathered round, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what provocation had been given: but this alſo may be accounted for without giving them credit for ſuperior courage; they had no experience of the conſequences of European reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the people at Otaheite had in many inſtances pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with life. It muſt however be acknowledged, to their honour, that when they underſtood what had happened, they ſhewed ſtrong ſigns of diſapprobation, and preſcribed a good beating for the thief, which was immediately adminiſtered.</p>
                        <p>We now made ſail for the iſland of Ulietea, which lies S. W. by W. diſtant ſeven or eight leagues from Huaheine, and at half an hour after ſix in the evening we were within three leagues of the ſhore, on the eaſtern ſide. We ſtood off and on all night, and when the day broke the next morning, we ſtood in for the ſhore: we ſoon after diſcovered an opening in the reef which lies before the iſland, within which Tupia told us there was a good harbour. I did not, however, implicitly take his word; but ſent the maſter out in the pinnace to examine it: he ſoon made the ſignal for the ſhip to follow; we accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſtood in, and anchored in two and twenty fathom, with ſoft ground.</p>
                        <p>The natives ſoon came off to us in two canoes, each of which brought a woman and a pig. The woman we ſuppoſed was a mark of confidence, and the pig was a preſent; we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived both with proper acknowledgments, and complimented each of the ladies with a ſpike nail and ſome beads, much to their ſatisfaction. We were told by Tupia, who had always expreſſed much fear of the men of Bolabola, that they had made a conqueſt of this iſland, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d that if we remained here, they would certainly come down to-morrow, and fight us. We determined, therefore, to go on ſhore without delay, while the day was our own.</p>
                        <p>I landed in company with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and the other gentlemen, Tupia being alſo of the party. He intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced us by repeating t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e ceremonies which he had performed at Huaheine, after which I hoiſted an Engliſh jack, and took poſſeſſion of this and the three neighbouring iſlands, Huaheine, Otaha, and Bolabola, which were all in ſight, in the name of his Britannic majeſty. After this, we took a walk to a great Morai, called Tapod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>boatea. We found it very different from
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:013324_0188_0F90F0D009955A98"/>
thoſe of Otaheite; for it conſiſted only of four walls, about eight feet high, of coral ſtones, ſome of which were of an immenſe ſize, incloſing an area of about five and twenty yards ſquare, which was filled up with ſmaller ſtones: upon the top of it many planks were ſet up an end, which were carved in their whole length: at a little diſtance we found an altar, or Ewhatta, upon which lay the laſt oblation or ſacrifice, a hog of about eighty pounds weight, which had been offered whole, and very nicely roaſted. Here were alſo four or five Ewharre-no-Eatua, or houſes of God, to which carriage poles were fitted, like that which we had ſeen at Huaheine. One of theſe Mr. Banks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by putting his hand into it, and found a parcel about five feet long and one thick, wrapped up in matts: he broke a way through ſeveral of theſe matts with his fingers, but at length came to one which was made of the fibres of the cocoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut, ſo firmly plaited together that he found it impoſſible to tear it, and therefore was forced to deſiſt; eſpecially as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that what he had done already gave great offence to our new friends. From hence we went to a long houſe, not far diſtant, where among rolls of cloth, and ſeveral other things, we ſaw the model af a canoe, about three feet long, to which were tied eight human jaw bones; we had already learnt that theſe, like ſcalps among the Indians of North-America, were trophies of war. Tupia affirmed that they were the jaw-bones of the natives of this iſland; if ſo, they might have been hung up, with the model of a canoe, as a ſymbol of invaſion, by the warriors of Bolabola, as a memorial of their conqueſt.</p>
                        <p>Night now came on apace, but Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander continued their walk along the ſhore, and at a little diſtance ſaw an other Ewharre-no-Eatua, and a tree of the fig kind, the ſame as that which Mr. Green had ſeen at Otaheite, in great perfection, the trunk, or rather congeries of the roots of which was forty-two paces in circumference.</p>
                        <p>On the 21ſt, having diſpatched the maſter in the long boat to examine the coaſt of the ſouth part of the iſland, and one of the mates in the yawl, to found the harbour where the ſhip lay, I went myſelf in the pinnace, to ſurvey that part of the iſland which lies to the north. Mr. Banks and the gentlemen were again on ſhore, trading with the natives, and examining the products and curioſities of the country; they ſaw nothing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, worthy notice, but ſome more jaw-bones, of which they made no doubt but that the account they had heard was true.</p>
                        <p>On the 22d and 23d, having ſtrong gales and hazey wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I did not thick it ſafe to put to ſea; but on the 24th, though the wind was ſtill variable, I got under ſail, and plyed to the northward within the reef, with a view to go out at a wider opening than that by which I had entered; in doing this, however, I was unexpectedly in the moſt imminent
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:013324_0189_0F8FFA04CA88DE70"/>
danger of ſtriking on the rock: the Maſter, whom I had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to keep continually ſounding in the chains, ſuddenly called out, "two fathom." This alarmed me, for though I knew the ſhip drew at leaſt fourteen feet, and that therefore it was impoſſible ſuch a ſhoal ſhould be under her keel; yet the maſter was either miſtaken, or ſhe went along the edge of a coral rock, many of which, in the neighbourhood of theſe iſlands, are as ſteep as a wall.</p>
                        <p>This harbour or bay is called by the natives OOPOA, and taken in its greateſt extent, it is capable of holding any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſhipping. It extends almoſt the whole length of the eaſt ſide of the iſland, and is defended from the ſea by a reef of coral rocks: the ſouthermoſt opening in this reef, or channel into the harbour, by which we entered, is little more than a cable's length wide; it lies off the eaſtermoſt point of the iſland, and may be known by another ſmall woody iſland, which lies a little to the ſouth eaſt of it, called by the people here OATARA. Between three and four miles north weſt from this iſland lie two other iſlets, in the ſame direction as the reef, of which they are a part, called OPURURU and TA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOU; between theſe lies the other channel into the harbour, through which I went out and which is a full quarter of a mile wide. Still farther to the north weſt are ſome other ſmall iſlands, near which I am told there is another ſmall channel into the harbour; but this I know only by report.</p>
                        <p>The principal refreſhments that are to be procured at this part of the iſland are, plantains, cocoa-nuts, yams, hogs, and fowls; the hogs and fowls, however, are ſcarce; and the country, where we ſaw it, is neither ſo populous, nor ſo rich in produce as Otaheite, or even Huaheine. Wood and water may alſo be procured here; but the water cannot conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently be got at.</p>
                        <p>We were now again at ſea, without having received any interruption from the hoſtile inhabitants of Bolabola, whom notwithſtanding the fears of Tupia, we intended to viſit. At four o'clock in the afternoon of the 25th, we were within a league of Otaha, which bore N. 77 W. To the northward of the ſouth end of that iſland, on the eaſt ſide of it, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a mile from the ſhore, lie two ſmall iſlands, called TOAHOUTU and WHENNUAIA; between which, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia ſays, there is a channel into a very good harbour, which lies within the reef, and appearances confirmed his report.</p>
                        <p>As I diſcovered a broad channel between Otaha and Bola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola, I determined rather to go through it, than run to the northward of all; but the wind being right a head, I got no ground.</p>
                        <p>Between five and ſix in the evening of the 26th, as I was ſtanding to the northward, I diſcovered a ſmall low iſland,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:013324_0190_0F8FFA05CC0B9A58"/>
lying N. by W. or N. N. W. diſtant four or five leagues from Bolabola. We were told by Tupia that the name of this iſland is TUBAI; that it produces nothing but cocoa-nuts, and is inhabited only by three families; though it is viſited by the inhabitants of the neighbouring iſlands, who reſort thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to catch fiſh, with which the coaſt abounds.</p>
                        <p>On the 27th, about noon, the peak of Bolabola bore N. 25 W. and the north end of Otaha, N. 80 W. diſtant three leagues. The wind continued contrary all this day and the night following. On the 28th, at ſix in the morning, we were near the entrance of the harbour, on the eaſt ſide of OTAHA, which has been juſt mentioned; and finding that it might be examined without loſing time, I ſent away the maſter in the long boat, with orders to ſound it; and, if the wind did not ſhift in our favour, to land upon the iſland, and traffic with the natives for ſuch refreſhments as were to be had. In this boat went Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who landed upon the iſland, and before night purchaſed three hogs, twenty-one fowls, and as many yams and plantains as the boat would hold. Plantains we thought a more uſeful refreſhment even than pork; for they were boiled and ſerved to the ſhip's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as bread, and were now the more acceptable as our bread was ſo full of vermin, that notwithſtanding all poſſible care, we had ſometimes twenty of them in our mouths at a time, every one of which taſted as hot as muſtard. The iſland ſeemed to be more barren than Ulietea, but the produce was of the ſame kind. The people alſo exactly reſembled thoſe that we had ſeen at the other iſlands; they were not numerous, but they flocked about the boat wherever ſhe went from all quarters, bringing with them whatever they had to ſell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They paid the ſtrangers, of whom they had received an account from Tupia, the ſame compliment which they uſed towards their own kings, uncovering their ſhoulders, and wrapping their garments round their breaſts; and were ſo ſolicitous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its being neglected by any of their people, that a man was ſent with them, who called out to every one they met, telling him what they were, and what he was to do.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, I kept plying off and on, waiting for the boat's return; at half an hour after five, not ſeeing any thing of her, I fired a gun, and after it was dark hoiſted a light; at half an hour after eight, we heard the report of a muſquet, which we anſwered with a gun, and ſoon after the boat came on board. The Maſter reported, that the harbour was ſafe and commodious, with good anchorage from twenty-five to ſixteen fathom water, clear ground.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as the boat was hoiſted in, I made ſail to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and at eight o'cloch in the morning of the 29th, we were cloſe under the peak of Bolabola, which was high, rude,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:013324_0191_0F8FFA064B28EF00"/>
and craggy. As the iſland was altogether inacceſſible in this part, and we found it impoſſible to weather it, we tacked and ſtood off, then tacked again, and after many trips did not weather the ſouth end of it till twelve o'clock at night. At eight o'clock the next morning, we diſcovered an iſland, which bore from us N. 63° W. diſtant about eight leagues; at the ſame time the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> of Bolabola bore N. ½ E. diſtant three or four leagues. This iſland Tupia called MAURUA, and ſaid that it was ſmall, wholly ſurrounded by a reef, and without any harbour for ſhipping; but inhabited, and beari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>g the ſame produce as the neighbouring iſlands; the middle of it riſes in a high round hill, that may be ſeen at the diſtance of ten leagues.</p>
                        <p>When we were off Bolabola, we ſaw but few people on the ſhore, and were told by Tupia that many of the inhabitants were gone to Ulietea. In the afternoon we ſound ourſelves nearly the length of the ſouth end of Ulietea, and to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of ſome harbours that lay on the weſt ſide of this iſland. Into one of theſe harbours, though we had before been aſhore on the other ſide of the iſland, I intended to put, in order to ſtop a leak which we had ſprung in the powder room, and to take in more ballaſt, as I found the ſhip too light to carry ſail upon a wind. As the wind was right againſt us, we plied off one of the harbours, and about three o'clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, on the firſt of Auguſt, we came to an anchor in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the channel leading into it in fourteen fathom wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being prevented from working in, by a tide which ſet very ſtrong out. We then carried out the kedge-anchor, in order to warp into the harbour; but when this was done, we could not trip the bower-anchor with all the purchaſe we could make; we were therefore obliged to lie ſtill all night, and in the morning when the tide turned, the ſhip going over the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, it tripped of itſelf, and we warped the ſhip into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per birth with eaſe, and moored in twenty-eight fathom, with a ſandy bottom. While this was doing many of the natives came off to us with hogs, fowls, and plantains, which they parted with at an eaſy rate.</p>
                        <p>When the ſhip was ſecured, I went on ſhore to look for a proper place to get ballaſt and water, both which I found in a very convenient ſituation.</p>
                        <p>This day Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander ſpent on ſhore very much to their ſatisfaction; every body ſeemed to fear and reſpect them, placing in them at the ſame time the utmoſt confidence, behaving as if conſcious, that they poſſeſſed the power of doing them miſchief, without any propenſity to make uſe of it. Men, women and children crowded round them, and followed them wherever they went; but none of them were guilty of the leaſt incivility: on the contrary,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:013324_0192_0F90F0D0C3ACB838"/>
whenever there happened to be dirt or water in the way, the men vied with each other to carry them over on their backs. They were conducted to, the houſes of the principal people, and were received in a manner altogether new: the people, who followed them while they were in their way, ruſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as ſoon as they came to a houſe, and went in haſtily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, leaving however a lane ſufficiently wide for them to paſs. When they entered, they found thoſe who had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded them ranged on each ſide of a long matt, which was ſpread upon the ground, and at the farther end of which ſat the family: in the firſt houſe they entered they found ſome very young women or children, dreſſed with the utmoſt neatneſs, who kept their ſtation, expecting the ſtrangers to come up to them and to make them preſents, which they did with the greateſt pleaſure; for prettier children, or better dreſſed they had never ſeen. One of them was a girl about ſix years old; her gown, or upper garment, was red; a large quantity of plaited hair was wound round her head, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to which they give of Tamou, and which they value more than any thing they poſſeſs. She fat at the upper end of a matt thirty feet long, upon which none of the ſpectators preſumed to ſet a foot, notwithſtanding the crowd; and ſhe leaned upon the arm of a well-looking woman about thirty, who was probably her nurſe. Our Gentlemen walked up to her, and as ſoon as they approached, ſhe ſtretched out her hand to receive the beads which they offered her, and no princeſs in Europe could have done it with a better grace.</p>
                        <p>The people were ſo much gratified by the preſents which were made to theſe girls, that when Mr. Banks and Dr. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander returned they ſeemed attentive to nothing but how to oblige them; and in one of the houſes they were, by order of the maſter, entertained with a dance, different from any that they had ſeen. It was performed by one man, who put upon his head a large cylindrical piece of wicker-work, or baſket, about four feet long, and eight inches in diameter, which was faced with feathers, placed perpendicularly, with the tops bending forwards, and edged round with ſhark's teeth, and the tail feathers of Tropic birds: when he had put on his head-dreſs, which is called a <hi>Whow,</hi> he began to dance, moving ſlowly, and often turning his head ſo as that the top of his high wicker-cap deſcribed a circle, and ſometimes throwing it ſo near the faces of the ſpectators as to make them ſtart back: this was held among them as a very good joke, and never failed to produce a peal of laughter, eſpecially when it was played off upon one of the ſtrangers.</p>
                        <p>On the 3d, we went along the ſhore to the northward, which was in a direction oppoſite to that of the route Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander had taken the day before, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:013324_0193_0F8FFB954A8A0750"/>
to purchaſe ſtock, which we always found the people more ready to part with, and at a more eaſy price, at their houſes than at the market. In the courſe of our walk we met with a company of dancers, who detained us two hours, and during all that time afforded us great entertainment. The company conſiſted of two women dancers, and fix men, with three drums; we were informed by Tupia, that they were ſome of the moſt conſiderable people of the iſland, and that though they were continually going from place to place, they did not, like the little ſtrolling companies companies of Otaheite, take any gratuity from the ſpectators The women had upon their heads a conſiderable quantity of Tamou, or plaited hair, which was brought ſeveral times round the head, and adorned in many parts with the flowers of the cape-jeſſamine, which were ſtuck in with much taſte, and made a head-dreſs truly elegant. Their necks, ſhoulders, and arms were naked; ſo were the breaſts alſo as low as the parting of the arm; below that, they were covered with black cloth, which ſet cloſe to the body; at the ſide of each breaſt, next the arm, was placed a ſmall plume of black feathers, much in the ſame manner as our ladies now wear their noſegays or bouquets; upon their hips reſted a quantity of cloth plaited very full, which reached up to the breaſt, and fell down below into long petticoats, which quite concealed their feet, and which they managed with as much dexterity as our opera dancers could have done: the plaits above the waiſt were brown and white alternately, the petticoats below were all white.</p>
                        <p>In this dreſs they advanced ſideways in a meaſured ſtep, keeping excellent time to the drums, which beat briſkly and loud; ſoon after they began to ſhake their hips, giving the folds of cloth, that lay upon them, a very quick motion, which was in ſome degree continued through the whole dance, though the body was thrown into various poſtures, ſometimes ſtanding, ſometimes ſitting, and ſometimes reſting on their knees and elbows, the fingers alſo being moved at the ſame time with a quickneſs ſcarce to be imagined. Much of the dexterity of the dancers, however, and the entertainment of the ſpectators, conſiſted in the wantonneſs of their attitudes and geſtures, which was, indeed, ſuch as exceeds all deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>One of theſe girls had in her ear three pearls; one of them was very large, but ſo foul that it was of little value; the other two were as big as a middling pea; theſe were clear, and of a good colour and ſhape, though ſpoiled by the dril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Mr. Banks would fain have purchaſed them, and offered the owner any thing ſhe would aſk for them, but ſhe could not be perſuaded to part with them at any price: he tempted her with the value of four hogs, and whatever elſe ſhe ſhould
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:013324_0194_0F8FFB9609C94790"/>
chuſe, but without ſucceſs; and indeed they ſet a value upon their pearls very nearly equal to what they would fetch among us, except they could be procured before they are drilled.</p>
                        <p>Between the dances of the women, the men performed a kind of dramatic interlude, in which there was dialogue as well as dancing; but we were not ſufficiently acquainted with their language to underſtand the ſubject.</p>
                        <p>On the 4th, ſome of our gentlemen ſaw a much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular entertainment of the dramatic kind, which was divided into four acts.</p>
                        <p>Tupia had often told us that he had large poſſeſſions in this iſland, which had been taken away from him by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Bolabola, and he now pointed them out in the very bay where the ſhip was at anchor. Upon our going on ſhore, this was confirmed by the inhabitants, who ſhewed us ſeveral diſtricts or Whennuas, which they acknowledged to be his right.</p>
                        <p>On the 5th, I received a preſent of three hogs, ſome fowls, ſeveral pieces of cloth, the largeſt we had ſeen, being fifty yards long, which they unfolded and diſplayed ſo as to make the greateſt ſhow poſſible; and a conſiderable quantity of plantains, cocoa-nuts, and other refreſhments, from Opoony, the formidable king, or, in the language of the country, Earee rahie, of Bolabola, with a meſſage that he was at this time upon the iſland, and that the next day he intended to pay me a viſit.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went upon the hills, accompanied by ſeveral of the Indians, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them by excellent paths, to ſuch a height, that they plainly ſaw the other ſide of the iſland, and the paſſage thro' which the ſhip had paſſed the reef between the little iſlands of Opururu and Tamou, when we landed upon it the firſt time. As they were returning, they ſaw the Indians exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing themſelves at what they call <hi>Erowhaw,</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than pitching a kind of light lance, headed with hard wood, at a mark: in this amuſement, though they ſeem very fond of it, they do not excel, for not above one in twelve ſtruck the mark, which was the bole of a plaintain tree, at about twenty yards diſtance.</p>
                        <p>On the 6th, we all ſtaid at home, expecting the viſit of the great king, but we were diſappointed; we had, however, much more agreeable company, for he ſent three very pretty girls to demand ſomething in return for his preſent: perhaps he was unwilling to truſt himſelf on board the ſhip, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he thought his meſſengers would procure a more valuable return for his hogs and poultry than he could himſelf; be that as it may, we did not regret his abſence, nor his meſſengers their viſit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="168" facs="unknown:013324_0195_0F90F2B22FEFBE68"/>
In the afternoon, as the great king would not come to us, we determined to go to the great king. As he was lord of the Bolabola men, the conquerors of this, and the terror of all the other iſlands, we expected to ſee a Chief young and vigorous, with an intelligent countenance, and an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing ſpirit: we found, however, a poor feeble wretch, withered and decrepit, half blind with age, and ſo ſluggiſh and ſtupid that he appeared ſcarcely to have underſtanding enough left to knew that it was probable we ſhould be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied either by hogs or women. He did not receive us ſitting, or with any ſtate o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> formality, as the other Chiefs had done: we made him our preſent, which he accepted, and gave a hog in return. We had learnt that his principal reſidence was at Otaha; and upon our telling him that we intended to go thither in our boats the next morning, and that we ſhould be glad to have him along with us, he promiſed to be of the party.</p>
                        <p>Early in the morning, therefore, I ſet out both with the pinnace and long-boat for Otaha, having ſome of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with me; and in our way we called upon Opoony, who was in his canoe ready to join us. As ſoon as we landed at Otaha, I made him a preſent of an ax, which I thought might induce him to encourage his ſubjects to bring us ſuch proviſion as we wanted; but in this we found ourſelves ſadly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, for after ſtaying with him till noon, we left him without being able to procure a ſingle article. I then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the north point of the iſland, in the pinnace, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent the long-boat another way. As I went along I picked up half a dozen hogs, as many fowls, and ſome plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and yams. Having viewed and ſketched the harbour on this ſide of the iſland, I made the beſt of my way back, with the long-boat, which joined me ſoon after it was dark; and about ten o'clock at night we got on board the ſhip.</p>
                        <p>In this excurſion Mr. Banks was not with us; he ſpent the morning on board the ſhip, trading with the natives, who came off in their canoes, for proviſions and curioſities; and in the afternoon he went on ſhore with his draught man, to ſketch the dreſſes of the dancers, which he had ſeen a day or two before. He found the company exactly the ſame, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that another woman had been added to it: the dancing alſo of the women was the ſame, but the interludes of the men were ſomewhat varied; he ſaw five or ſix performed, which were different from each other, and very much reſembled the drama of our ſtage dances. The next day, he went aſhore again, with Dr. Solander, and they directed their courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the dancing company, which, from the time of our ſecond landing, had gradually moved about two leagues in their courſe round the iſland. They ſaw more dancing and
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:013324_0196_0F90F2B254D54080"/>
more interludes, the interludes ſtill varying from each other: in one of them the performers, who were all men, were divided into two parties, which were diſtinguiſhed from each other by the colour of their cloaths, one being brown and the other white. The brown party repreſented a maſter and ſervants, and the white party a company of thieves: the maſter gave a baſket of meat to the reſt of his party, with a charge to take care of it: the dance of the white party conſiſted of ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients to ſteal it, and that of the brown party in preventing their ſucceſs. After ſome time, thoſe who had charge of the baſket placed themſelves round it, upon the ground, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it, appeared to go to ſleep; the others, improving this opportunity, came gently upon them, and lifting them up from the baſket, carried off their prize: the ſleepers ſoon after awakening, miſſed their baſket, but preſently fell a dancing, without any farther regarding their loſs; ſo that the dramatic action of this dance was, according to the ſevereſt laws of criticiſm, one, and our lovers of ſimplicity would have been gratified with an entertainment perfectly ſuited to the chaſtity of their taſte.</p>
                        <p>On the 9th, having ſpent the morning in trading with the canoes, we took the opportunity of a breeze, which ſprung up at Eaſt, and having ſtopped our leak, and got the freſh ſtock which we had purchaſed on board, we ſailed out of the harbour. When we were ſailing away, Tupia ſtrongly urged me to fire a ſhot towards Bolabola, poſſibly as a mark of his reſentment, and to ſhew the power of his new allies: in this I thought proper to gratify him, though we were ſeven leagues diſtant.</p>
                        <p>While we were about theſe iſlands, we expended very little of the ſhip's proviſions, and were very plentifully ſupplied with hogs, fowls, plantains and yams, which we hoped would have been of great uſe to us in our courſe to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but the hogs would not eat European grain of any kind, pulſe, or bread-duſt, ſo that we could not preſerve them alive; and the fowls were all very ſoon ſeized with a diſeaſe that affected the head ſo, that they continued to hold it down between their legs till they died: much dependence therefore muſt not be placed in live ſtock, taken on board at theſe places, at leaſt not till a diſcovery is made of ſome food that the hogs will eat, and ſome remedy for the diſeaſe of the poultry.</p>
                        <p>Having been neceſſarily detained at Ulietea ſo long, by the carpenters in ſtopping our leak, we determined to give up our deſign of going on ſhore at Bolabola, eſpecially as it appeared to be difficult of acceſs.</p>
                        <p>To theſe ſix iſlands, Ulietea, Otaha, Bolabola, Huaheine, Tubai, and Maurua, as they lie contiguous to each other, I

the names of SOCIETY ISLANDS, but did not think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to diſtinguiſh them ſeparately by any other names than thoſe by which they were known to the natives.</p>
                        <p>They are ſituated between the latitude of 16° 10′ and 16′ 55′ S. and between the longitude of 150° 57′ and 152° W. from the meridian of Greenwich. Ulietea and Otaha lie within about two miles of each other, and are both incloſed within one reef of coral rocks, ſo that there is no paſſage for ſhipping between them. This reef forms ſeveral excellent harbours; the entrances into them, indeed, are but narrow, yet when a ſhip is once in, nothing can hurt her. The har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours on the eaſt ſide have been deſcribed already; and on the weſt ſide of Ulietea, which is the largeſt of the two, there are three. The northermoſt, in which we lay, is called O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAMANENO: the channel leading into it is about quarter of a mile wide, and lies between two low ſandy iſlands, which are the northermoſt on this ſide; between, or juſt within the two iſlands, there is good anchorage in twenty-eight fathom, ſoft ground. This harbour, though ſmall, is preferable to the others, becauſe it is ſituated in the moſt fertile part of the iſland, and where freſh water is eaſily to be got. The other two harbours lie to the ſouthward of this, and not far from the ſouth end of the iſland: in both of them there is good anchorage, with ten, twelve, and fourteen fathom. They are ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>y known by three ſmall woody iſlands at their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. The ſouthermoſt of theſe two harbours lies within, and to the ſouthward of the ſouthermoſt of theſe iſlands, and the other lies between the two northermoſt. I was told that there were more harbours at the ſouth end of this iſland, but I did not examine whether the report was true.</p>
                        <p>Otaha affords 2 very good harbours, that on the eaſt ſide is called Ohamene, and has been mentioned already; the other is called OHERURUA, and lies about the middle of the ſouth weſt ſide of the iſland; it is pretty large, and affords good anchorage in twenty and twenty-five fathom, nor is there any want of freſh water. The breach in the reef, that forms a channel into this harbour, is about a quarter of a mile broad, and like all the reſt is very ſteep on both ſides; in general there is no danger here but what is viſible.</p>
                        <p>The iſland of Bolabola lies N. W. and by W. from Otaha, diſtant about four leagues; it is ſurrounded by a reef of rocks, and ſeveral ſmall iſlands, in compaſs together about eight leagues. I was told, that on the ſouth weſt ſide of the iſland there is a channel through the reef, into a very good har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but I did not think it worth while to examine it, for the reaſons that have been juſt aſſigned. This iſland is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered very remarkable by a high craggy hill, which appears

                           </gap> the 13th, about noon, when we ſaw land bearing S. E. which Tupia told us was an iſland called OHETEROA. About ſix in the evening, we were within two or three leagues of it, upon which I ſhortened ſail, and ſtood off and on all night: the next morning ſtood in for the land. We ran to leeward of the iſland, keeping cloſe in ſhore, and ſaw ſeveral of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, though in no great numbers, upon the beach. At nine o'clock I ſent Mr. Gore, one of my Lieutenants, in the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, to endeavour to land upon the iſland, and learn from the natives whether there was anchorage in a bay then in ſight, and what land lay farther to the ſouthward. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander accompanied Mr. Gore in this expedition, and as they thought Tupia might be uſeful, they took him with them.</p>
                        <p>As the boat approached the ſhore, thoſe on board perceived the natives to be armed with long lances: as they did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to land till they got round a point which run out at a little diſtance, they ſtood along the coaſt, and the natives therefore very probably thought they were afraid of them. They had now got together to the number of about ſixty, and all of them ſat down upon the ſhore, except two, who were diſpatched forward to obſerve the motions of thoſe in the boat. Theſe men, after walking a-breaſt of her for ſome time, at length leaped into the water, and ſwam towards her, but were ſoon left behind; two more then appeared, and attempted to board her in the ſame manner, but they alſo were ſoon left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; a fifth man then ran forward alone, and having got a good way a-head of the boat before he took to the water, eaſily reached her. Mr. Banks urged the officer to take him in, thinking it a good opportunity to get the confidence and good will of a people, who then certainly looked upon them as enemies; but he obſtinately refuſed, this man was therefore left behind like the others, and ſo was a ſixth, who followed him.</p>
                        <p>When the boat had got round the point, ſhe perceived that all her followers had deſiſted from the purſuit: ſhe now open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a large bay, at the bottom of which appeared another body of men, armed with long lances like the firſt. Here our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple prepared to land, and puſhed towards the ſhore, a canoe at the ſame time putting off to meet them. As ſoon as it
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:013324_0199_0F8FFB9951982A68"/>
came near them, they lay upon their oars, and calling out to them, told them that they were friends, and that if they would come up they would give them nails, which were held up for them to ſee: after ſome heſitation they came up to the boat's ſtern, and took ſome nails that were offered them with great ſeeming ſatisfaction; but in leſs than a minute they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have formed a deſign of boarding the boat, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her their prize: three of them ſuddenly leaped into it, and the others brought up the canoe, which the motion in quitting her had thrown off a little, manifeſtly with a deſign to follow their aſſociates, and ſupport them in their attempt. The firſt that boarded the boat, entered cloſe to Mr. Banks, and inſtantly ſnatched his powder-horn out of his pocket: Mr. Banks ſeized it, and with ſome difficulty wrenched it out of his hand, at the ſame time preſſing againſt his breaſt, in order to force him over-board, but he was too ſtrong for him, and kept his place: the officer then ſnapped his piece, but it miſſed fire, upon which he ordered ſome of the people to fire over their heads; two pieces were accordingly diſcharged, upon which they all inſtantly leaped into the water: one of the people, either from cowardice or cruelty, or both, level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a third piece at one of them, as he was ſwimming away, and the ball grazed his forehead; happily, however the wound was very ſlight, for he recovered the canoe, and ſtood up in her as active and vigorous as the reſt. The canoe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſtood in for the ſhore, where a great number of people, not leſs than two hundred, were now aſſembled. The boat alſo puſhed in, but found the land guarded all round with a ſhoal, upon which the ſea broke with a conſiderable ſurf; it was therefore thought adviſeable by the officer to proceed along ſhore in ſearch of a more convenient landing-place: in the mean time the people on board ſaw the canoe go on ſhore, and the natives gather eagerly round her to enquire the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of what had happened. Soon after, a ſingle man ran along the ſhore, armed with his lance, and when he came a-breaſt of the boat he began to dance, brandiſh his weapon, and call out in a very ſhrill tone, which Tupia ſaid was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance from the people. The boat continued to row along the ſhore, and the champion followed it, repeating his defiance by his voice and his geſtures; but no better landing-place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found than that where the canoe had put the natives on ſhore, the officer turned back with a view to attempt it there, hoping, that if it ſhould not be practicable, the people would come to a conference either on the ſhoals, or in their canoes, and that a treaty of peace might be concluded with them.</p>
                        <p>As the boat rowed ſlowly along the ſhore back again, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other champion came down, ſhouting defiance, and brandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his lance: his appearance was more formidable than that
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:013324_0200_0F90F2B4ADEE83B0"/>
of the other, for he wore a large cap made of the tail feathers of the tropic bird, and his body was covered with ſtripes of different coloured cloth, yellow, red, and brown. This gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alſo danced, but with much more nimbleneſs and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than the firſt; our people therefore, conſidering his agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and his dreſs, diſtinguiſhed him by the name of HARLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUIN. Soon after a more grave and elderly man came down to the beach, and hailing the people in the boat, enquired who they were, and from whence they came; Tupia anſwered in their own language, from Otaheite: the three natives then walked peaceably along the ſhore till they came to a ſhoal, upon which a few people were collected; here they ſtopped, and after a ſhort conference, they all began to pray very loud: Tupia made his reſponſes, but continued to tell us that they were not our friends. When their prayer, or as they call it, their <hi>Poorah,</hi> was over, our people entered into a parley with them, telling them, that if they would lay by their lances and clubs, for ſome had one, and ſome the other, they would come on ſhore, and trade with them for whatever they would bring: they agreed, but it was only upon condition that we ſhould leave behind us our muſquets: this was a condition which, however equitable it might appear, could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, nor indeed would it have put the two parties upon an equality, except their numbers had been equal. Here then the negociation ſeemed to be at an end; but in a little time they ventured to come nearer to the boat, and at laſt came near enough to trade, which they did very fairly, for a ſmall quantity of their cloth, and ſome of their weapons; but as they gave our people no hope of proviſions, nor indeed any thing elſe except they would venture through a narrow chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel to the ſhore, which, all circumſtances conſidered, they did not think it prudent to do, they put off the boat and left them.</p>
                        <p>With the ſhip and the boat we had now made the circuit of the iſland, and finding that there was neither harbour nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorage about it, and that the hoſtile diſpoſition of the people would render landing impracticable, without bloodſhed, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to attempt it, having no motive that could juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the riſk of life.</p>
                        <p>The bay which the boat entered lies on the weſt ſide of the iſland, the bottom was foul and rocky, but the water ſo clear that it could plainly be ſeen at the depth of five and twenty fathom, which is one hundred and fifty feet.</p>
                        <p>This iſland is ſituated in the latitude of 22° 27′ S. and in the longitude of 150° 47′ W. from the meridian of Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich. It is thirteen miles in circuit, and rather high than low, but neither populous nor fertile in proportion to the other iſlands that we had ſeen in theſe ſeas. The chief produce
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:013324_0201_0F9050C00D7A39D0"/>
ſeems to be the tree of which they make their weapons, called in their language <hi>Etoa;</hi> many plantations of it were ſeen along the ſhore, which is not ſurrounded, like the neighbouring iſlands, by a reef.</p>
                        <p>The people ſeemed to be luſty and well-made, rather brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than thoſe we had left: under their arm-pits they had black marks, about as broad as the hand, the edges of which formed not a ſtrait but indented line; they had alſo circles of the ſame colour, but not ſo broad, round their arms and legs, but were not marked on any other part of the body.</p>
                        <p>Their dreſs was very different from any that we had ſeen before, as well as the cloth of which it was made. The cloth was of the ſame materiaals as that which is worn in the other iſlands, and moſt of that which was ſeen by our people was dyed of a bright but deep yellow, and covered on the outſide with a compoſition like varniſh, which was either red, or of a dark lead-colour; over this ground it was again painted in ſtripes of many different patterns, with wonderful regularity, in the manner of our ſtriped ſilks in England; the cloth that was painted red was ſtriped with black, and that which was painted lead-colour with white. Their habit was a ſhort jacket of this cloth, which reached about as low as their knees; it was of one piece, and had no other making than a hole in the middle of it, ſtitched round with long ſtitches, in which it differed from all that we had ſeen before: through this hole the head was put, and what hung down was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to their bodies by a piece of yellow cloth, or ſaſh, which paſſing round the neck behind, was croſſed upon the breaſt, and then collected round the waiſt like a belt, which paſſed over another belt of red cloth, ſo that they made a very gay and warlike appearance; ſome had caps of the feathers of the tropic bird, which have been before deſcribed, and ſome had a piece of white or lead-coloured cloth wound about the head like a ſmall turban, which our people thought more becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>Their arms were long lances, made of the Etoa, the wood of which is very hard; they were well poliſhed and ſharpened at one end: ſome were near twenty feet long, though not more than three fingers thick: they had alſo a weapon which was both club and pike, made of the ſame wood, about ſeven feet long; this alſo was well poliſhed, and ſharpened at one end into a broad point. As a guard againſt theſe weapons, when they attack each other, they have mats folded up many times, which they place under their clothes, from the neck to the waiſt: the weapons themſelves indeed are capable of much leſs miſchief than thoſe of the ſame kind, which we ſaw at the other iſlands, for the lances were there pointed with the ſharp bone of the ſting-ray that is called the ſting, and the
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:013324_0202_0F90F2B52F53E7E0"/>
pikes were of much greater weight. The other things that we ſaw here were all ſuperior in their kind to any we had ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the cloth was of better colour in the dye, and painted with greater neatneſs and taſte; the clubs were better cut and poliſhed, and the canoe, though a ſmall one, was very rich in ornament, and the carving was executed in a better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: among other decorations peculiar to this canoe, was a line of ſmall white feathers, which hung from the head and ſtern on the outſide, and which, when we ſaw them, were thoroughly wetted by the ſpray.</p>
                        <p>Tupia told us, that there were ſeveral iſlands lying at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent diſtances, and in different directions from this, between the ſouth and the north weſt; and that at the diſtance of 3 day's ſail to the north-eaſt, there was an iſland called MANUA, bird-iſland: he ſeemed, however, moſt deſirous that we ſhould ſail to the weſtward, and deſcribed ſeveral iſlands in that direction, which he ſaid he had viſited; he told us that he had been ten or twelve days in going thither, and thirty in coming back, and that the <hi>Pahie</hi> in which he had made the voyage, ſailed much faſter than the ſhip: reckoning his Pahie therefore to go at the rate of forty leagues a day, which from my own obſervation I have great reaſon to think theſe boats will do, it would make four hundred leagues in ten days, which I compute to be the diſtance of Boſcawen and Keppel's iſlands, diſcovered by Captain Wallis, weſtward of Ulietea, and therefore think it very probable that they were the iſlands he had viſited. The fartheſt iſland that he knew any thing of to the ſouthward, he ſaid, lay at the diſtance of about two days ſail from Oteroah, and was called MOUTOU; but he ſaid that his father had told him there were iſlands to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of that: upon the whole, I was determined to ſtand ſouthward, in ſearch of a continent, but to ſpend no time in ſearching <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                        <p>WE ſailed from Oteroah on the 15th of Auguſt, and on Friday the 25th we celebrated the anniverſary of our leaving England, by taking a Cheſhire cheeſe from a locker, where it had been carefully treaſured up for this occaſion, and tapping a caſk of porter, which proved to be very good, and in excellent order. On the 29th, one of the ſailors got ſo drunk, that the next morning he died: we thought at firſt that he could not have come honeſtly by the liquor, but we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards learnt that the boatſwain, whoſe mate he was, had in mere good-nature given him part of a bottle of rum.</p>
                        <p>On the 30th we ſaw the comet; at one o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was a little above the horizon in the eaſtern part of the heavens; at about half an hour after four it paſſed the meridian, and its tail ſubtended an angle of forty-two degrees. Our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude was 38° 20′ S, our longitude, by log, 147° 6′ W. and the variation of the needle, by the azimuth, 7° 9′ E. Among others that obſerved the comet, was Tupia, who inſtantly cried out, that as ſoon as it ſhould be ſeen by the people of Bolabola, they would kill the inhabitants of Ulietea, who would with the utmoſt precipitation fly to the mountains.</p>
                        <p>On the 1ſt of September, being in the latitude of 40° 22′ S. and longitude 174° 29′ W. and there not being any ſigns of land, with a heavy ſea from the weſtward, and ſtrong gales, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>On the next day, there being ſtrong gales to the weſtward,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:013324_0204_0F90F2B9D1B33448"/>
I brought to, with the ſhip's head to the northward; but in the morning of the third, the wind being more moderate, we looſened the reef of the mainſail, ſet the top-ſails, and plied to the weſtward.</p>
                        <p>We continued our courſe till the 19th, when our latitude being 29° and our longitude 159° 29′, we obſerved the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be 8° 32′ E. On the 24th, being in latitude 33° 18′ longitude 162° 51′, we obſerved a ſmall piece of ſea wood, and a piece of wood covered with barnacles: the variation here was 10° 48′ E.</p>
                        <p>On the 27th, being in latitude 28° 59′, longitude 169° 5′, we ſaw a ſeal aſleep upon the water, and ſeveral bunches of ſea weed. The next day we ſaw more ſea weed in bunches, and on the 29th, a bird, which we thought a land bird, it ſomewhat reſembled a ſnipe, but had a ſhort bill. On the firſt of October, we ſaw birds innumerable, and another ſeal aſleep upon the water; it is a general opinion that ſeals never go out of ſoundings, or far from land, but thoſe that we ſaw in theſe ſeas prove the contrary. Rock-weed is, however, a certain indication that land is not far diſtant. The next day, it being calm, we hoiſted out the boat, to try whether there was a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but found none. Our latitude was 37° 10′, longitude 172° 54′ W. On the 3d, being in latitude 36° 56′, longitude 173° 27′, we took up more ſea weed, and another piece of wood covered with barnacles. The next day we ſaw two more ſeals, and a brown bird, about as big as a raven, with ſome white feathers under the wing. Mr. Gore told us, that birds of this kind were ſeen in great numbers about Falkland's-iſlands, and our people gave them the name of Port-Egmont hens.</p>
                        <p>On the 5th, we thought the water changed colour, but upon caſting the lead, had no ground with 180 fathom. In the evening of this day, the variation was 12° 50′ E. and while were going nine leagues it increaſed to 14° 2′.</p>
                        <p>On the next day, Friday, October the 6th, we ſaw land from the maſt-head, bearing W. by N. and ſtood directly for it; in the evening it could be juſt diſcerned from the deck, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared large. The variation this day, was by azimuth and amplitude, 15° 4′ ½ E. and by obſervation made of the ſun and moon, the longitude of the ſhip appeared to be 180° 55′ W. and by the medium of this and ſubſequent obſervations, there appeared to be an error in the ſhip's account of longitude during her run from Otaheite of 3° 16′, ſhe being ſo much to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the longitude reſulting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>On the 7th, it fell calm, we therefore approached the land ſlowly, and in the afternoon, when a breeze ſprung up, we were ſtill diſtant ſeven or eight leagues. It appeared ſtill larger
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:013324_0205_0F8FFB9A7B4E6368"/>
as it was more diſtinctly ſeen, with four or five ranges of hills, riſing one over the other, and a chain of mountains above all, which appeared to be of an enormous height. This land became the ſubject of much eager converſation; but the general opinion ſeemed to be that we had found the <hi>Terra auſtralis incognita.</hi> About five o'clock we ſaw the opening of a bay, which ſeemed to run pretty far inland, upon which we hauled our wind and ſtood in for it; we alſo ſaw ſmoke aſcending from different places on ſhore. When night came on, however, we kept plying off and on till day-light, when we found ourſelves to the lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the bay, the wind being at North: we could now perceive that the hills were clothed with wood, and that ſome of the trees in the valleys were very large. By noon we fetched in with the ſouth weſt point; but not being able to weather it, tacked and ſtood off: at this time we ſaw ſeveral canoes ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acroſs the bay, which in a little time made to ſhore, without ſeeming to take the leaſt notice of the ſhip; we alſo ſaw ſome houſes, which appeared to be ſmall, but neat; and near one of them a conſiderable number of the people collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, who were ſitting upon the beach, and who, we thought, were the ſame that we had ſeen in the canoes. Upon a ſmall peninſula, at the north eaſt head, we could plainly perceive a pretty high and regular paling, which incloſed the whole top of a hill; this was alſo the ſubject of much ſpeculation, ſome ſuppoſing it to be a park of deer, others an incloſure for oxen and ſheep. About four o'clock in the afternoon, we anchored on the north weſt ſide of the bay, before the entrance of a ſmall river, in ten fathom water, with a fine ſandy bottom, and at about half a league from the ſhore. The ſides of the bay are white cliffs of a great height; the middle is low land, with hills gradually riſing behind, one towering above another, and terminating in the chain of mountains which appeared to be far inland.</p>
                        <p>In the evening I went on ſhore, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with the pinnace and yawl, and a party of men. We landed abreaſt of the ſhip, on the eaſt ſide of the river, which was here about forty yards broad; but ſeeing ſome natives on the weſt ſide whom I wiſhed to ſpeak with, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the river not fordable, I ordered the yawl in to carry us over, and left the pinnace at the entrance. When we came near the place where the people were aſſembled, they all ran away; however, we landed, and leaving four boys to take care of the yawl, we walked up to ſome huts which were about two or three hundred yards from the water ſide. When we had got ſome diſtance from the boat, four men, armed with long lances, ruſhed out of the woods, and running up to attack the boat, would certainly have cut her off, if the people in the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace had not diſcovered them, and called to the boys to drop
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:013324_0206_0F8FFB9A8D09C0D8"/>
down the ſtream: the boys inſtantly obeyed; but being cloſely purſued by the Indians, the cockſwain of the pinnace, who had the charge of the boats, fired a muſquet over their heads; at this they ſtopped and looked round, but in a few minutes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the purſuit, brandiſhing their lances in a threatening manner: the cockſwain then fired a ſecond muſquet over their heads, but of this they took no notice; and one of them lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his ſpear to dart it at the boat, another piece was fired, which ſhot him dead. When he fell, the other three ſtood motionleſs for ſome minutes, as if petrified with aſtoniſhment; as ſoon as they recovered, they went back, dragging after them the dead body, which however they ſoon leſt, that it might not incumber their flight. At the report of the firſt muſquet we drew together, having ſtraggled to a little diſtance from each other, and made the beſt of our way back to the boat; and croſſing the river, we ſoon ſaw the Indian lying dead upon the ground. Upon examining the body, we found that he had been ſhot through the heart: he was a man of the middle ſize and ſtat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                           </gap>; his complexion was brown, but not very dark; and one ſide of his face was tattowed in ſpiral lines of a very regular figure: he was covered with a fine cloth, of a manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture altogether new to us, and it was tied on exactly according to the repreſentation in Valentyn's account of Abel Taſman's voyage, vol. iii. part 2. page 50; his hair alſo was tied in a knot on the top of his head, but had no feather in it. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned immediately to the ſhip, where we could hear the people on ſhore talking with great earneſtneſs, and in a very loud tone, probably about what had happened, and what ſhould be done.</p>
                        <p>In the morning, we ſaw ſeveral of the natives where they had been ſeen the night before, and ſome walking with a quick pace towards the place where we had landed, moſt of them unarmed; but three or four with long pikes in their hands. As I was deſirous to eſtabliſh an intercourſe with them, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered three boats to be manned with ſeamen and marines, and proceeded towards the ſhore, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, the other gentlemen, and Tupia; about fifty of them ſeemed to wait for our landing, on the oppoſite ſide of the river, which we thought a ſign of fear, and ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the ground; at firſt therefore, myſelf, with only Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Tupia, landed from the little boat, and advanced towards them; but we had not proceeded many paces before they all ſtarted up, and every man produced either a long pike, or a ſmall weapon of green Tale, extremely well poliſhed, about a foot long, and thick enough to weigh four or five pounds: Tupia called to them in the language of Otaheite; but they anſwered only by flouriſhing their weapons, and making ſigns to us to depart; a muſquet was then fired wide of them, and the ball ſtruck the water, the river being
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:013324_0207_0F90F2BA84FDC178"/>
ſtill between us: they ſaw the effect, and deſiſted from their threats: but we thought it prudent to retreat till the marines could be landed. This was ſoon done; and they marched with a jack carried before them, to a little bank, about fifty yards from the water ſide; here they were drawn up, and I again advanced, with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander; Mr, Green and Mr. Monkhouſe being with us. Tupia was again directed to ſpeak to them, and it was with great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that we perceived he was perfectly underſtood, he and the natives ſpeaking only different dialects of the ſame language. He told them that we wanted proviſion and water, and would give them iron in exchange, the properties of which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained as well as he was able. They were willing to trade, and deſired that we would come over to them for that purpoſe: to this we conſented, provided they would lay by their arms; which, however, they could by no means be perſuaded to do. During this converſation, Tupia warned us to be upon our guard, for they were not our friends: we then preſſed them in our turn to come over to us; and at laſt one of them ſtripped himſelf, and ſwam over without his arms: he was almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately followed by two more, and ſoon after by moſt of the reſt, to the number of twenty or thirty; but theſe brought their arms with them. We made them all preſents of iron and beads, but they ſeemed to ſet little value upon either, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the iron, not having the leaſt idea of its uſe; ſo that we got nothing in return but a few feathers: they offered indeed to exchange their arms for ours, and when we refuſed, made many attempts to ſnatch them out of our hands. As ſoon as they came over, Tupia repeated his declaration, that they were not our friends, and again warned us to be upon our guard; their attempts to ſnatch our weapons, therefore, did not ſucceed; and we gave them to underſtand by Tupia, that we ſhould be obliged to kill them if they offered any farther violence. In a few minutes, however, Mr. Green happening to turn about, one of them ſnatched away his hanger, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring to a little diſtance, waved it round his head, with a ſhout of exultation: the reſt now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> to be extremely inſolent, and we ſaw more coming to join them from the oppoſite ſide of the river. It was therefore become neceſſary to repreſs them, and Mr. Banks fired at the man who had taken the hanger with ſmall ſhot, at the diſtance of about fifteen yards; when the ſhot ſtruck him, he ceaſed his cry; but inſtead of returning the hanger, continued to flouriſh it over his head, at the ſame time ſlowly retreating to a greater diſtance. Mr. Monkhouſe ſeeing this, fired at him with ball, and he inſtantly dropped. Upon this the main body, who had retired to a rock in the middle of the river upon the firſt diſcharge, began to return; two that were near to the man who had been killed, ran up to
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:013324_0208_0F8FFB9B534EB020"/>
the body, one ſeized his weapon of green Talc, and the other endeavoured to ſecure the hanger, which Mr. Monkhouſe had but juſt time to prevent. As all that had retired to the rock were now advancing, three of us diſcharged our pieces, loaded only with ſmall ſhot, upon which they ſwam back to the ſhore; and we perceived, upon their landing, that two or three of them were wounded. They retired ſlowly up the country, and we reimbarked in our boats.</p>
                        <p>As we had unhappily experienced that nothing was to be done with theſe people at this pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e, and finding the water in the river to be ſalt, I proceeded in the boats round the head of the bay in ſearch of freſh-water, and with a deſign, if poſſible, to ſurprize ſome of the natives, and take them on board, where by kind treatment and preſents I might obtain their friendſhip, and by their means eſtabliſh an amicable correſpondence with their countrymen.</p>
                        <p>To my great regret, I found no place where I could land, a dangerous ſurf every where beating upon the ſhore; but I ſaw two canoes coming in from the ſea, one under ſail, and the other worked with paddles. I thought this a favourable opportunity to get ſome of the people into my poſſeſſion without miſchief, as thoſe in the canoe were probably fiſhermen and without arms, and I had three boats full of men. I therefore diſpoſed the boats ſo as moſt effectually to intercept them in their way to the ſhore; the people in the canoe that was pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled perceived us ſo ſoon, that by making to the neareſt land with their utmoſt ſtrength, they eſcaped us; the other ſailed on till ſhe was in the midſt of us, without diſcerning what we were; but the moment ſhe diſcovered us, the people on board ſtruck their ſail, and took to their paddles, which they plied ſo briſkly that ſhe out-ran the boat. They were however within hearing, and Tupia called out to them to come along-ſide, and promiſed for us that they ſhould come to no hurt: they chooſe, however, rather to truſt to their paddles than our promiſes, and continued to make from us with all their power. I then ordered a muſquet to be fired over their heads, as the leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable expedient to accompliſh my deſign, hoping it would either make them ſurrender or leap into the water. Upon the diſcharge of the piece, they ceaſed paddling; and all of them, being ſeven in number, began to ſtrip, as we imagined to jump over board; but it happened otherwiſe. They immediately formed a reſolution not to fly, but to fight; and when the boat came up, they began the attack with their paddles, and with ſtones and other offenſive weapons that were in the boat, ſo vigorouſly, that we were obliged to fire upon them in our defence: four were unhappily killed, and the other three who were boys, the eldeſt about nineteen, and the youngeſt about eleven, inſtantly leaped into the water; the
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:013324_0209_0F8FFB9C3A6D1F70"/>
eldeſt ſwam with great vigour, and reſiſted the attempts of our people to take him into the boat by every effort that he could make; he was however at laſt overpowered, and the other 2 were taken up with leſs difficulty. I am conſcious that the feeling of every reader of humanity will cenſure me for having fired upon theſe unhappy people, and it is impoſſible that, upon a calm review, I ſhould approve it myſelf. They certainly did not deſerve death for not chuſing to confide in my promiſes; or not conſenting to come on board my boat, even if they had apprehended no danger; but the nature of my ſervice required me to obtain a knowledge of their country, which I could no otherwiſe effect than by forcing my way into it in a hoſtile manner, or gaining admiſſion through the confidence and good will of the people. I had already tried the power of preſents without effect; and I was now prompted, by my deſire to avoid further hoſtilities, to get ſome of them on board, as the only method left of convincing them that we intended them no harm, and had it in our power to contribute to their gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and convenience. Thus far my intentions certainly were not criminal; and though in the conteſt, which I had not the leaſt reaſon to expect, our victory might have been complete without ſo great an expence of life; yet in ſuch ſituations, when the command to fire has been given, no man can reſtrain its exceſs, or preſcribe its effect.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as the poor wretches whom we had taken out of the water were in the boat, they ſquatted down, expecting no doubt inſtantly to be put to death: we made haſte to convince them of the contrary, by every method in our power; we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with clothes, and gave them every other teſtimony of kindneſs that could remove their fears and engage their good will. Thoſe who are acquainted with human nature will not wonder, that the ſudden joy of theſe young ſavages at being unexpectedly delivered from the fear of death, and kindly treated by thoſe whom they ſuppoſed would have been their inſtant executioners, ſurmounted their concern for the friends they had loft, and was ſtrongly expreſſed in their countenances and behaviour. Before we reached the ſhip, their ſuſpicions and fears being wholly removed, they appeared to be not only reconciled to their ſituation but in high ſpirits, and upon being offered ſome bread when they came on board, they devoured it with a voracious appetite. They anſwered and aſked many queſtions, with great appearance of pleaſure and curioſity; and when our dinner came, they expreſſed an inclination to taſte every thing that they ſaw; they ſeemed beſt pleaſed with the ſalt pork, though we had other proviſions upon the table. At ſun-ſet, they eat another meal with great eagerneſs, each de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring a large quantity of bread, and drinking above a quart of water. We then made them beds upon the lockers, and
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:013324_0210_0F8FFB9D62F6B2E8"/>
they went to ſleep with great ſeeming content. In the night, however, the tumult of their minds having ſubſided, and given way to reflection, they ſighed often and loud. Tupia, who was always upon the watch to comfort them, got up, and by ſoothing and encouragement made them not only eaſy but cheerful; their cheerfulneſs was encouraged ſo that they ſung a ſong with a degree of taſte that ſurpriſed us: the tune was ſolemn and ſlow, like thoſe of our pſalms, containing many notes and ſemitones. Their countenances were intelligent and expreſſive, and the middlemoſt; who ſeemed to be about fifteen, had an openneſs in his aſpect, and an eaſe in his deportment which were very ſtriking: we found that the two eldeſt were brothers, and that their names were Taahourange and Koike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range; the name of the youngeſt was Maragovete. As we were returning to the ſhip, after having taken theſe boys into the boat, we picked up a large piece of pummice ſtone floating upon the water; a ſure ſign that there either is; or has been a volcano in this neighbourhood.</p>
                        <p>In the morning, they all ſeemed to be cheerful, and eat another enormous meal; after this we dreſſed them, and adorned them with bracelets, ancklets, and necklaces, after their own faſhion, and the boat being hoiſted out, they were told that we were going to ſet them aſhore: this produced a tranſport of joy; but upon perceiving that we made towards our firſt landing place near the river, their countenances changed, and they entreated with great earneſtneſs that they might not be ſet aſhore at that place, becauſe they ſaid, it was inhabited by their enemies, who would kill them and eat them. This was a great diſappointment to me; becauſe I hoped the report and appearance of the boys would procure a favourable reception for ourſelves. I had already ſent an officer on ſhore with the marines and a party of men to cut wood, and I was determined to land near the place; not however to abandon the boys, if, when we got aſhore, they ſhould be unwilling to leave us; but to ſend a boat with them in the evening to that part of the bay to which they pointed, and which they called their home. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander and Tupia were with me, and upon our landing with the boys, and croſſing the river, they ſeemed at firſt to be unwilling to leave us; but at length they ſuddenly changed their mind, and, though not without a manifeſt ſtruggle, and ſome tears, they took their leave: when they were gone, we proceeded along a ſwamp, with a deſign to ſhoot ſome ducks, of which we ſaw great plenty, and four of the marines attended us, walking abreaſt of us upon a bank that overlooked the country. After we had advanced about a mile, theſe men called out to us and told us, that a large body of the Indians were in ſight, and advancing at a great rate. Upon receiving this intelligence, we drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:013324_0211_0F8FFB9DC49877C8"/>
and reſolved to make the beſt of our way to the boats; we had ſcarcely began to put this into execution, when the 3 Indian boys ſtarted ſuddenly from ſome buſhes, where they had concealed themſelves, and again claimed our protection: we readily received them, and repairing to the beach as the cleareſt place, we walked briſkly towards the boats. The Indians were in two bodies; one ran along the bank which had been quitted by the marines, the other fetched a compaſs by the ſwamp ſo that we could not ſee them: when they perceived that we had formed into one body, they ſlackened their pace, but ſtill followed us in a gentle walk: that they ſlackened their pace, was for us, as well as for them, a fortunate circumſtance; for when we came to the ſide of river, where we expected to find the boats that were to carry us over to the wooders, we found the pinnace at leaſt a mile from her ſtation, having been ſent to pick up a bird which had been ſhot by the officer on ſhore, and the little boat was obliged to make three trips be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we could all get over to the reſt of the party. As ſoon as we were drawn up on the other ſide, the Indians came down, not in a body as we expected, but by two or three at a time; all armed, and in a ſhort time their number increaſed to about two hundred: as we now deſpaired of making peace with them, ſeeing that the dread of our ſmall arms did not keep them at a diſtance, and that the ſhip was too far off to reach the place with a ſhot, we reſolved to re-imbark, leſt our ſtay ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil us in another quarrel, and coſt more of the Indians their lives. We therefore advanced towards the pinnace which was now returning, when one of the boys ſuddenly cried out, that his uncle was among the people who had marched down to us, and deſired us to ſtay and talk with them: we complied, and a parley immediately commenced between them and Tupia; during which the boys held up every thing we had given them as tokens of our kindneſs and liberality; but neither would either of the boys ſwim over to them, or any of them to the boys. The body of the man who had been killed the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſtill lay expoſed upon the beach; the boys ſeeing it lie very near us, went up to it, and covered it with ſome of the clothes that we had given them; and ſoon after a ſingle man, unarmed, who proved to be the uncle of Maragovete, the youngeſt of the boys, ſwam over to us, bringing in his hand a green branch, which we ſuppoſed, as well here as at Otaheite, to be an emblem of peace. We received his branch by the hands of Tupia, to whom he gave it, and made him many preſents; we alſo invited him to go on board the ſhip, but he declined it; we therefore left him, and expected that his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, and the two other young Indians would have ſtaid with him, but to our great ſurprize they choſe rather to go with us As ſoon as we had retired, he went and gathered another
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:013324_0212_0F90F2BBF38BBD60"/>
green branch, and with this in his hand, he approached the dead body which the youth had covered with part of his clothes, walking ſideways, with many ceremonies, and then throwing it towards him. When this was done, he returned to his companions, who had ſat down upon the ſand to obſerve the iſſue of his negociation: they immediately gathered round him, and continued in a body above an hour, without ſeeming to take any farther notice of us. We were more curious than they, and obſerving them with our glaſſes from on board the ſhip, we ſaw ſome of them croſs the river upon a kind of raft, or catamarine, and four of them carry off the dead body which had been covered by the boy, and over which his uncle had performed the ceremony of the branch, upon a kind of bier, between four men: the other body was ſtill ſuffered to remain where it had been firſt left.</p>
                        <p>After dinner, I directed Tupia to aſk the boys, if they had now any objection to going aſhore, where we had left their uncle, the body having been carried off, which we underſtood was a ratification of peace: they ſaid, they had not; and the boat being ordered, they went into it with great alacrity: when the boat, in which I had ſent two midſhipmen, came to land, they went willingly aſhore; but ſoon after ſhe put off, they returned to the rocks, and wading into the water, earneſtly entreated to be taken on board again; but the people in the boat, having poſitive orders to leave them, could not comply. We were very attentive to what happened on ſhore, and keeping a conſtant watch with our glaſſes, we ſaw a man paſs the river upon another raft, and fetch them to a place where forty or fifty of the natives were aſſembled, who cloſed round them, and continued in the ſame place till ſunſet; upon looking again, when we ſaw them in motion, we could plainly diſtinguiſh our three priſoners, who ſeparated themſelves from the reſt, came down to the beach, and having waved their hands three times towards the ſhip, ran nimbly back and joined their companions, who walked leiſurely away towards that part which the boys had pointed to as their dwelling place; we had therefore the greateſt reaſon to believe that no miſchief would happen to them, eſpecially as we perceived that they went off in the clothes we had given them.</p>
                        <p>After it was dark, loud voices were heard on ſhore in the bottom of the bay as uſual, of which we could never learn the meaning.</p>

                        <p>THE next morning at ſix o'clock, we weighed, and ſtood away from this unfortunate and inhoſpitable place, to which I gave the name of Poverty Bay, and which by the natives is called Taoneroa or Long Sand, as it did not afford us a ſingle article that we wanted except a little wood. It lies in latitude 38° 42′ S. and longitude 181° 36′ W; it is in the form of an horſe-ſhoe, and is known by an iſland lying cloſe under the north eaſt point: the two points which form the entrance are high, with ſteep white cliffs, and lie a league and a half or two leagues from each other, N. E. by E. and S. W. by W. the depth of water in the bay is from twelve to five fathom, with a ſandy bottom and good anchorage; but the ſituation is open to the wind between the ſouth and eaſt: boats can go in and out of the river at any time of the tide in fine weather; but as there is a bar at the entrance, no boat can go either in or out when the ſea runs high: the beſt place to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, is on the north eaſt ſide, and it is there practicable when it is not ſo in any other part. The ſhore of the bay, a little within its entrance, is a low flat ſand; behind which, at a ſmall diſtance, the face of the country is finely diverſified by hills and valleys, all clothed with wood, and covered with verdure. The country alſo appears to be well inhabited, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the valleys leading up from the bay, where we daily ſaw ſmoke riſing in clouds one behind another to a great diſtance, till the view terminated in mountains of a ſtupendous height.</p>
                        <p>The ſouth weſt point of the bay I named Young Nick's Head, after Nicholas Young, the boy who firſt ſaw the land; at noon, it bore N. W. by W. diſtant about three or four leagues, and we were then about three miles from the ſhore. The main land extended from N. E. by N. to ſouth, and I propoſed to follow the direction of the coaſt to the ſouthward as far as the latitude of 40 or 41; and then, if I met with no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to proceed farther, to return to the northward.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon we lay becalmed, which the people on ſhore perceiving, ſeveral canoes put off, and came within leſs than a quarter of a mile of the veſſel; but could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to come nearer, though Tupia exerted all the powers of his lungs and his eloquence upon the occaſion, ſhouting, and
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:013324_0214_0F90F2BCCC14CDD0"/>
promiſing that they ſhould not be hurt. Another canoe was now ſeen coming from Poverty Bay, with only four people on board, one of whom we well remembered to have ſeen in our firſt interview upon the rock. This canoe, without ſtopping or taking the leaſt notice of the others, came directly along ſide of the ſhip, and with very little perſuaſion, we got the Indians on board. Their example was ſoon followed by the reſt, and we had about us ſeven canoes, and about fifty men. We made them all preſents with a liberal hand; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, they were ſo deſirous to have more of our commodities, that they ſold us every thing they had, even the clothes from their backs, and the paddles from their boats. There were but two weapons among them, theſe were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of green talc, which were ſhaped ſomewhat like a pointed battledore, with a ſhort handle and ſharp edges; they were called <hi>Patoo-Patoo,</hi> and were well contrived for cloſe-fighting, as they would certainly ſplit the thickeſt ſcull at a ſingle blow.</p>
                        <p>When theſe people had recovered from the firſt impreſſions of fear, which notwithſtanding their reſolution in coming on board, had manifeſtly thrown them into ſome confuſion, we enquired after our poor boys. The man who firſt came on board immediately anſwered, that they were unhurt and at home; adding, that they had been induced to venture on board by the account which they had given of the kindneſs with which they had been treated, and the wonders that were contained in the ſhip.</p>
                        <p>While they were on board they ſhewed every ſign of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and invited us very cordially to go back to our old bay, or to a ſmall cove, which they pointed out, that was not quite ſo far off; but I choſe rather to proſecute my diſcoveries than go back, having reaſon to hope that I ſhould find a better harbour than any I had yet ſeen.</p>
                        <p>About an hour before ſun-ſet, the canoes put off from the ſhip, with the few paddles they had reſerved, which were ſcarcely ſufficient to ſet them on ſhore; but by ſome means or other three of their people were left behind; as ſoon as we diſcovered it, we hailed them; but not one of them would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to take them on board; this greatly ſurpriſed us; but we were ſurpriſed ſtill more to obſerve that the deſerted Indians did not ſeem at all uneaſy at their ſituation, but entertained us with dancing and ſinging after their manner, eat their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and went quietly to bed.</p>
                        <p>A light breeze ſpringing up ſoon after it was dark, we ſteered along the ſhore under an eaſy ſail till midnight, and then brought to, ſoon after which it fell calm; we were now ſome leagues diſtant from the place where the canoes had left us, and at day-break, when the Indians perceived it, they
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:013324_0215_0F90F2BD8B784F50"/>
were ſeized with conſternation and terror, and lamented their ſituation in loud complaints, with geſtures of deſpair and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tears. Tupia, with great difficulty, pacified them; and about ſeven o'clock in the morning, a light breeze ſpringing up, we continued to ſtand ſouth weſt along the ſhore. Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for our poor Indians, two canoes came off about this time, and made towards the ſhip; they ſtopped, however, at a little diſtance, and ſeemed unwilling to truſt themſelves nearer. Our Indians were greatly agitated in this ſtate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, and urged their fellows to come along ſide of the ſhip, both by their voice and geſtures, with the utmoſt eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impatience. Tupia interpreted what they ſaid, and we were much ſurpriſed to find, that among other arguments, they aſſured the people in the canoes, we did not eat men. We now began ſeriouſly to believe that this horrid cuſtom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed among them; for what the boys had ſaid, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a mere hyperbolical expreſſion of their fear. One of the canoes, at length, ventured to come under the ſhip's ſide; and an old man came on board, who ſeemed to be a chief from the finery of his garment, and the ſuperiority of his weapon, which was a Patoo-Patoo, made of bone, that, as he ſaid, had belonged to a whale. He ſtaid on board but a ſhort time, and when he went away, he took with him our gueſts, very much to the ſatisfaction both of them and us.</p>
                        <p>At the time when we ſailed, we were abreaſt of a point, from which the land trends S. S. W. and which, on account of its figure, I called CAPE TABLE. This point lies ſeven leagues to the ſouthward of Poverty Bay, in latitude 39° 7′ S. and longitude 181° 36′ W.: it is of a conſiderable height, makes in a ſhort angle, and appears to be quite flat at the top.</p>
                        <p>In ſteering along the ſhore to the ſouthward of the Cape, at the diſtance of two or three miles, our ſoundings were from twenty to thirty fathom, having a chain of rocks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the ſhore, which appeared at different heights above the water.</p>
                        <p>At noon, Cape Table bore N. 20 E. diſtant about four leagues, and a ſmall iſland, which was the ſouthermoſt land in ſight, bore S. 70 W. at the diſtance of about three miles. This iſland, which the natives call TEAHOWRAY, I named the ILAND OF PORTLAND, from its very great reſemblance to Portland in the Engliſh channel: it lies about a mile from a point on the main; but there appears to be a ridge of rocks, extending nearly, if not quite, from one to the other. N. 57 E. two miles from the ſouth point of Portland, lies a ſunken rock, upon which the ſea breaks with great violence We paſſed between this rock and the land, having from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen to twenty fathom.</p>

In ſailing along the ſhore, we ſaw the natives aſſembled in great numbers as well upon Portland Iſland as the main: we could alſo diſtinguiſh ſeveral ſpots of ground that were culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated; ſome ſeemed to be freſh turned up, and lay in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, like plowed land, and ſome had plants upon them in different ſtages of their growth. We ſaw alſo in two places, high rails upon the ridges of hills, like what we had ſeen upon the peninſula at the north eaſt head of Poverty bay: as they were ranged i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>About noon another canoe appeared, in which were four men; ſhe came within about a quarter of a mile of us, where the people on board ſeemed to perform divers ceremonies: one of them, who was in the bow, ſometimes ſeemed to aſk and to offer peace, and ſometimes to threaten war, by bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhing a weapon that he held in his hand: ſometimes alſo he danced, and ſometimes he ſung. Tupia talked much to him, but could not perſuade him to come to the ſhip.</p>
                        <p>Between one and two o'clock we diſcovered land to the weſtward of Portland, extending to the ſouthward as far as we could ſee; and as the ſhip was hauling found the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>At this time the iſland lay within a mile of us, making in white cliffs, and a long ſpit of low land running from it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the main. On the ſides of theſe cliffs ſat vaſt numbers of people, looking at us with a fixed attention, and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that they perceived ſome appearance of hurry and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion on board, and ſome irregularity in the working of the ſhip, while we were getting clear of the ſhallow water and broken ground, from which they might infer that we were alarmed or in diſtreſs; we thought that they wiſhed to take advantage of our ſituation, for five canoes were put off with the utmoſt expedition, full of men, and well armed: they came ſo near, and ſhewed ſo hoſtile a diſpoſition by ſhouting, brandiſhing their lances, and uſing threatening geſtures, that we were in ſome pain for our ſmall boat, which was ſtill em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſounding: a muſket was therefore fired over them, but finding it did them no harm, they ſeemed rather to be provoked than intimidated, and I therefore fired a four pounder, charged with grape-ſhot, wide of them: this had a better effect; upon the report of the piece they all roſe up and ſhouted, but inſtead of continuing the chace, drew altogether, and after a ſhort conſultation, when quietly away.</p>

Having got round Portland, we hauled in for the land N. W. having a gentle breeze at N. E. which about five o'clock died away, and obliged us to anchor; we had one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fathom, with a fine ſandy bottom: the ſouth point of Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land bore S. E. ½ S. diſtant about two leagues, and a low point on the main bore N. ½ E.: in the ſame direction with this low point, there runs a deep bay, behind the land of which Cape Table is the extremity, ſo as to make this land a peninſula, leaving only a low narrow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>eck between that and the main. Of this peninſula, which the natives call TERAKACO, Cape Table is the north point, and Portland the ſouth.</p>
                        <p>While we lay at anchor, two more canoes came off to us; one armed, and the other a ſmall fiſhing-boat, with only four men in her; they came ſo near that they entered into converſation with Tupia; they anſwered all the queſtions that he aſked them with great civility, but could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to come on board; they came near enough, however, to receive ſeveral preſents that were thrown to them from the ſhip, with which they ſeemed much pleaſed, and went away. During the night many fires were kept upon ſhore, probably to ſhew us that the inhabitants were too much upon their guard to be ſurprized.</p>
                        <p>About five o'clock in the morning of the 13th, a breeze ſpringing up northerly, we weighed, and ſteered in for the land. The ſhore here forms a large bay, of which Portland is the north eaſt point, and the bay that runs behind Cape Table an arm. This arm I had a great inclination to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, becauſe there appeared to be ſafe anchorage in it, but not being ſure of that, and the wind being right an end, I was unwilling to ſpare the time. Four and twenty fathom was the greateſt depth within Portland, but the ground was every where clear. The land hear the ſhore is of a moderate height, with white cliffs and ſandy beaches; within it riſes into the mountains, and upon the whole the ſurface is hilly, for the moſt part covered with wood, and to appearance plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and fertile. In the morning nine canoes came after the ſhip, but whether with peaceable or hoſtile intentions we could not tell, for we ſoon left them behind us.</p>
                        <p>In the evening we ſtood in for a place that had the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an opening, but found no harbour; we therefore ſtood ont again, and were ſoon followed by a large canoe, with eighteen or twenty men, all armed, who, though they could not reach us, ſhouted defiance, and brandiſhed their weapons, with many geſtures of menace and inſult.</p>
                        <p>In the morning we had a view of the mountains inland, upon which the ſnow was ſtill lying: the country near the ſhore was low and unfit for culture, but in one place we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:013324_0218_0F8FFBA20EB30408"/>
a patch of ſomewhat yellow, which had greatly the appearance of a corn field, yet was probably nothing more than ſome dead flaggs, which are not uncommon in ſwampy places: at ſome diſtance we ſaw groves of trees, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared high and tapering, and being not above two leagues from the ſouth weſt cod of the great bay, in which we had been coaſting for the two laſt days, I hoiſted out the pinnace and long-boat, to ſearch for freſh water; but juſt as they were about to put off, we ſaw ſeveral boats full of people coming from the ſhore, and therefore I did not think it ſafe for them to leave the ſhip. About ten o'clock, five of theſe boats having drawn together, as if to hold a conſultation, made towards the ſhip, having on board between eighty and ninety men, and four more followed at ſome diſtance, as if to ſuſtain the attack: when the firſt five came within about an hundred yards of the ſhip, they began to ſing their war ſong, and brandiſhing their pikes, prepared for an engagement. We had now no time to loſe, for if we could not prevent the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, we ſhould come under the unhappy neceſſity of uſing our fire-arms againſt them, which we were very deſirous to avoid. Tupia was therefore ordered to acquaint them that we had weapons which, like thunder, would deſtroy them in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that we would immediately convince them of their power by directing their effect ſo that they ſhould not be hurt; but that if they perſiſted in any hoſtile attempt, we ſhould be obliged to uſe them for our defence: a four-pounder, loaded with grape-ſhot, was then diſcharged wide of them, which produced the deſired effect; the report, the flaſh, and above all the ſhot, which ſpread very fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>In the afternoon we ſtood over to the ſouth point of the bay, but not reaching it before it was dark, we ſtood off and on all night. At eight the next morning, being a-breaſt of the point, ſeveral fiſhing boats came off to us, and ſold us ſome ſtinking fiſh: it was the beſt they had, and we were willing to trade with them upon any terms: theſe people behaved very well, and we ſhould have parted good friends if it had not been for a large canoe, with two and twenty armed men on board,
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:013324_0219_0F8FFBA2D4B22438"/>
which came boldly up along ſide of the ſhip. We ſoon ſaw that this boat had nothing for traffick, yet we gave them two or three pieces of cloth, an article which they ſeemed very fond of, I obſerved that one man had a black ſkin thrown over him, ſomewhat reſembling that of a bear, and being deſirous to know what animal was its firſt owner, I offered him for it a piece of red baize, and he ſeemed greatly pleaſed with the bargain, immediately pulling off the ſkin, and holding it up in the boat; he would not, however, part with it till he had the cloth in his poſſeſſion, and as there could be no transfer of property, if with equal caution I had inſiſted upon the ſame condition, I ordered the cloth to be handed down to him, upon which, with amazing coolneſs, inſtead of ſending up the ſkin, he began to pack up both that and the baize, which he had received as the purchaſe of it, in a baſket, without paying the leaſt regard to my demand or remonſtrances, and ſoon after, with the fiſhing boats, put off from the ſhip; when they were at ſome diſtance, they drew together, and after a ſhort conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation returned; the fiſhermen offered more fiſh, which though good for nothing, was purchaſed, and trade was again renewed. Among others who were placed over the ſhip's ſide to hand up what we bought, was little Tayeto, Tupia's boy; and one of the Indians, watching his opportunity, ſuddenly ſeized him, and dragged him down into the canoe; two of them held him down in the forepart of it, and the others, with great activity, paddled her off, the reſt of the canoes following as faſt as they could: upon this the marines, who were under arms upon deck, were ordered to fire. The ſhot was directed to that part of the canoe which was fartheſt from the boy, and rather wide of her, being willing rather to miſs the rowers than to hurt him: it happened, however, that one man dropped, upon which the others quitted their hold of the boy, who inſtantly leaped into the water, and ſwam towards the ſhip; the large canoe immediately pulled round and followed him, but ſome muſquets, and a great gun being fired at her, ſhe deſiſted from the purſuit. The ſhip being brought to, a boat was lowered, and the poor boy taken up unhurt, though ſo terrified that for a time he ſeemed to be deprived of his ſenſes. Some of the gentlemen who traced the canoes to ſhore with their glaſſes, ſaid, that they ſaw three men carried up the beach, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be either dead or wholly diſabled by their wounds.</p>
                        <p>To the cape off which this unhappy tranſaction happened, I gave the name of Cape Kidnappers. It lies in latitude 39° 43′, and longitude 182, 24 W. and is rendered remarkable by two white rocks like hay ſtacks, and the high white cliffs on each ſide. It lies S. W, by W. diſtant thirteen leagues from the iſle of Portland; and between them is the bay of which it is the ſouth point, and which, in honour of Sir Edward
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:013324_0220_0F8FFBA3F7D00278"/>
Hawke, then firſt Lord of the Admiralty, I called Hawkes-Bay. We found in it from twenty-four to ſeven fathom, and good anchorage. From Cape Kidnappers the land trends S. S. W. and in this direction we made our run along the ſhore, keeping at about a league diſtance, with a ſteady breeze and clear weather.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as Tayeto recovered from his fright, he brought a fiſh to Tupia, and told him, that he intended it as an offering to his Eatua, or God, in gratitude for his eſcape; Tupia commended his piety, and ordered him to throw the fiſh into the ſea, which was accordingly done.</p>
                        <p>About two o'clock in the afternoon, we paſſed a ſmall but high white iſland, lying cloſe to the ſhore, upon which we ſaw many houſes, boats, and people. The people we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be fiſhers, becauſe the iſland was totally barren; we ſaw ſeveral people alſo on ſhore, in a ſmall bay upon the main, within the iſland. At 11 we brought to till day-light, and then made ſail to the ſouthward, along the ſhore. About ſeven o'clock we paſt a high point of land, which lies S. S. W. twelve leagues from Cape Kidnappers: from this point the land trends three-fourths of a point more to the weſtward; at ten we ſaw more land open to the ſouthward, and at noon, the ſouthermoſt land that was in ſight, bore S. 39 W. diſtant eight or ten leagues, and a high bluff head, with yellowiſh cliffs, bore W. diſtant about two miles: the depth of water was thirty-two fathom.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon we had a freſh breeze at weſt, and during the night variable light airs and calms: in the morning a gentle breeze ſprung up between the N. W. and N. E. and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till now ſtood to the ſouthward, without ſeeing any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of meeting with a harbour, and the country manifeſtly altering for the worſe, I thought that ſtanding farther in that direction would be attended with no advantage, but on the contrary would be a loſs of time that might be employed with a better proſpect of ſucceſs in examining the coaſt to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; about one, therefore, in the afternoon, I tacked and ſtood north, with a freſh breeze at weſt. The high bluff head, with yellowiſh cliffs, which we were a-breaſt of at noon, I called CAPE TURNAGAIN, becauſe here we turned back. It lies in latitude 40° 34′ S. longitude, 182° 55′ W. diſtant eighteen leagues S. S. W. and S. S. W. ½ W. from Cape Kidnappers. The land between them is of a very unequal height; in ſome places it is lofty next the ſea with white cliffs, in others low, with ſandy beaches: the face of the country is not ſo well clothed with wood as it is about Hawke's bay, but looks more like our high downs in England: it is, however, to all appearance, well inhabited, for as we ſtood along the ſhore, we ſaw ſeveral villages, not only in the vallies, but on
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:013324_0221_0F8FFBA457745178"/>
the tops and ſides of the hills, and ſmoke in many other places. The ridge of mountains which has been mentioned before, extends to the ſouthward farther than we could ſee, and was then every where chequered with ſnow. At night we ſaw two fires inland, ſo very large, that we concluded they muſt have been made to clear the land for tillage; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that be, they are a demonſtration that the part of the country, where they appeared, is inhabited.</p>
                        <p>On the 18th, at four o'clock in the morning, Cape Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nappers bore N. 32 W. diſtant two leagues: in this ſituation we had ſixty-two fathom, and when the Cape bore W. by N. diſtant three or four leagues, we had forty-five fathom: in the mid-way between the iſle of Portland and the Cape we had ſixty-five fathom. In the evening, being a-breaſt of the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſula within Portland iſland, called TERAKAKO, a canoe came off from that ſhore, and with much difficulty overtook the ſhip; there were on board five people, two of whom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be Chiefs, and the other three ſervants: the Chiefs with very little invitation came on board, and ordered the reſt to remain in their canoe. We treated them with great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and they were not backward in expreſſing their ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they went down-into the cabin, and after a ſhort time told us that they had determined not to go on ſhore till the next morning. As the ſleeping on board was an honour which we neither expected nor deſired, I remonſtrated ſtrongly againſt it, and told them, that on their account it would not be proper, as the ſhip would probably be at a great diſtance from where ſhe was then, the next morning: they perſiſted, however, in their reſolution, and as I found it impoſſible to get rid of them without turning them by force out of the ſhip, I complied: as a proper precaution, however, I propoſed to take their ſervants alſo on board, and hoiſt their canoe into the ſhip; they made no objection, and this was accordingly done. The countenance of one of theſe Chiefs was the moſt open and the moſt ingenuous of all I have ever ſeen, and I very ſoon gave up every ſuſpicion of his having any ſiniſter deſign: they both examined every thing they ſaw with great curioſity and attention, and received very thankfully ſuch little preſents as we made them, neither of them however, could be perſuaded either to eat or drink, but their ſervants devoured every thing they could get with great voracity. We found that theſe men had heard of our kindneſs and liberality to the natives who had been on board before, yet we thought the confidence they placed in us, an extraordinary inſtance of their fortitude. At night I brought to till day-light, and then made ſail; at ſeven in the morning, I brought to again under Cape Table, and ſent away our gueſts with their canoe, who expreſſed ſome ſurpriſe at ſeeing themſelves ſo far from home,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:013324_0222_0F8FFBA6742BDD90"/>
but landed a-breaſt of the ſhip. At this time I ſaw other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes putting off from the ſhore, but I ſtood away to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward without waiting for their coming up.</p>
                        <p>About three, I paſſed a remarkable head land, which I called GABLE-END-FORELAND, from the very great likeneſs of the white cliff at the point, to the gable-end of a houſe: it is not more remarkable for its figure, than for a rock which riſes like a ſpire at a little diſtance. It lies from Cape Table N. 24 E. diſtant about twelve leagues. The ſhore between them forms a bay, within which lies Poverty Bay, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of four leagues from the head land, and eight from the Cape. At this place three canoes came off to us, and one man came on board; we gave him ſome trifles, and he ſoon returned to his boat, which, with all the reſt, dropped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern.</p>
                        <p>In the morning I made ſail in ſhore, in order to look into two bays, which appeared about two leagues to the northward of the Foreland; the ſouthermoſt I could not fetch, but I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored in the other about eleven o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Into this bay we were invited by the people on board many canoes, who pointed to a place where they ſaid there was plenty of freſh water: I did not find ſo good a ſhelter from the ſea as I expected, but the natives who came about us, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be of a friendly diſpoſition, I was determined to try whether I could not get ſome knowlege of the country here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceeded farther to the northward.</p>
                        <p>In one of the canoes that came about us as ſoon as we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored, we ſaw two men, who by their habits appeared to be Chiefs: one of them was dreſſed in a jacket, which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namented, after their manner, with dog's ſkin; the jacket of the other was almoſt covered with ſmall tufts of red feathers. Theſe men I invited on board, and they entered the ſhip with very little heſitation: I gave each of them about four yards of linen, and a ſpike nail; with the linen they were much pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſeemed to ſet no value upon the nail. We perceived that they knew what had happened in Poverty bay, and we had therefore no reaſon to doubt but that they would behave peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably; however, for further ſecurity, Tupia was ordered to tell them for what purpoſe we came thither, and to aſſure them that we would offer them no injury, if they offered none to us. In the mean time thoſe who remained in the canoes traded with our people very fairly for what they happened to have with them: the Chiefs, who were old men, ſtaid with us till we had dined, and about two o'clock I put off with the boats, manned and armed, in order to go on ſhore in ſearch of water, and the two chiefs went into the boat with me. The after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon was tempeſtuous, with much rain, and the ſurf every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> ſo high, that although we rowed almoſt round the
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:013324_0223_0F8FFBA68952DF10"/>
bay, we found no place where we could land; I determined therefore to return to the ſhip, which being intimated to the Chiefs, they called to the people on ſhore, and ordered a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe to be ſent off for themſelves; this was accordingly done, and they left us, promiſing to come on board again in the morning, and bring us ſome fiſh and ſweet potatoes.</p>
                        <p>In the evening, the weather having become fair and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, the boats were again ordered out, and I landed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. We were received with great expreſſions of friendſhip by the natives, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with a ſcrupulous attention not to give offence. In particular they took care not to appear in great bodies: one family, or the inhabitants of two or three houſes only, were generally placed together, to the number of fifteen or twenty, conſiſting of men, women and children. Theſe little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies ſat upon the ground, not advancing towards us, but inviting us to them, by a kind of beckon, moving one hand towards the breaſt. We made them ſeveral little preſents; and in our walk round the bay found two ſmall ſtreams of freſh water. This convenience, and the friendly behaviour of the people, determined me to ſtay at leaſt a day, that I might fill ſome of my empty caſks, and give Mr. Banks an opportunity of examining the natural produce of the country.</p>
                        <p>In the morning of the 21ſt, I ſent Lieutenant Gore on ſhore, to ſuperintend the watering, with a ſtrong party of men; and they were ſoon followed by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with Tupia, Tayeto, and four others.</p>
                        <p>The natives ſat by our people, and ſeemed pleaſed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them; but did not intermix with them: they traded however, chiefly for cloth, and after a ſhort time applied to their ordinary occupations, as if no ſtranger had been among them. In the forenoon, ſeveral of their boats went out a fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at dinner time every one repaired to his reſpective dwelling; from which, after a certain time, he returned. Theſe fair appearances encouraged Mr. Banks and Dr. Solan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to range the bay with very little precaution, where they found many plants, and ſhot ſome birds of exquiſite beauty. In their walk, they viſited ſeveral houſes of the natives, and ſaw ſomething of their manner of life; for they ſhowed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſerve, every thing which the Gentlemen deſired to ſee. They were ſometimes found at their meals, which the approach of the ſtrangers never interrupted. Their food at this ſeaſon conſiſted of fiſh, with which, inſtead of bread, they eat the root of a kind of fern, very like that which grows upon our commons in England. Theſe roots they ſcorch over the fire, and then beat with a ſtick, till the bark and dry outſide fall off; what remains is a ſoft ſubſtance, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what clammy and ſweet, not unpleaſing to the taſte, but mixed
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:013324_0224_0F8FFBA770C2A698"/>
with three or four times its quantity of ſtrings and fibres, which are very diſagreeable; theſe were ſwallowed by ſome, but ſpit out by the far greater number, who had baſkets under them to receive the rejected part of what had been chewed, which had an appearance very like that of tobacco in the ſame ſtate. In other ſeaſons they have certainly plenty of excellent vegetables; but no tame animals were ſeen among them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept dogs, which were very ſmall and ugly. Mr. Banks ſaw ſome of their plantations, where the ground was as well brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en down and tilled as even in the gardens of the moſt curious people among us: in theſe ſpots were ſweet potatoes, coccos or eddas, which are well known and much eſteemed both in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, and ſome gourds: the ſweet po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoes were planted in ſmall hills, ſome ranged in rows, and others in quincu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>x, all laid by a line with the greateſt regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity: the coccos were planted upon flat land, but none of them yet appeared above ground; and the gourds were ſet in ſmall hollows, or diſhes, much as in England. Theſe plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were of different extent, from one or two acres to ten: taken together, there appeared to be from one hundred and fifty to two hundred acres in cultivation in the whole bay, though we never ſaw an hundred people. Each diſtrict was fenced in, generally with reeds, which were placed ſo cloſe together, that there was ſcarcely room for a mouſe to creep between.</p>
                        <p>The women were plain, and made themſelves more ſo by painting their faces with red ocre and oil, which being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally freſh and wet upon their cheeks and foreheads, was eaſily transferred to the noſes of thoſe who thought fit to ſalute them; and that they were not wholly averſe to ſuch familiarity, the noſes of ſeveral of our people ſtrongly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; they were, however, as great coquets as any of the moſt faſhionable ladies in Europe, and the young ones as ſkittiſh as an unbroken filly: each of them wore a petticoat, under which there was a girdle, made of the blades of graſs highly perfumed, and to the girdle was faſtened a ſmall bunch of the leaves of ſome fragant plant, which ſerved their modeſty as its innermoſt ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>l. The faces of the men were not ſo generally painted, yet we ſaw one whoſe whole body, and even his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were rubbed over with dry ocre, of which he kept a piece conſtantly in his hand, and was every minute renewing the decoration in one part or another, where he ſuppoſed it was become deficient. In perſonal, delicacy they were not equal to our friends at Otaheite, for the coldneſs of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate did not invite them ſo often to bathe; but we ſaw among them one inſtance of cleanlineſs in which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded them, and of which, perhaps, there is no example in any other Indian nation. Every houſe, or every little cluſter

of three or four houſes, was furniſhed with a privy, ſo that the ground was every where clean. The offals of their food, and other litter, were alſo piled up in regular dunghills, which probably they made uſe of at a proper time for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure.</p>
                        <p>In this decent article of civil oeconomy they were before-hand with one of the moſt conſiderable nations of Europe, for I am credibly informed, that till the year 1760, there was no ſuch thing as a privy in Madrid, the metropolis of Spain, though it is plentifully ſupplied with water. Before that time it was the univerſal practice to throw the ordure out of the windows, during the night, into the ſtreet, where num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of men were employed to remove it, with ſhovels, from the upper parts of the city to the lower, where it lay till it was dry, and was then carried away in carts, and depoſited without the gates. His preſent Catholic Majeſty, having determined to free his capital from ſo groſs a nuiſance, ordered, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, that the proprietor of every houſe ſhould build a privy, and that ſinks, drains, and common ſewers ſhould be made at the public expence. The Spaniards, though long accuſtomed to an arbitrary government, reſented this procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation with great ſpirit, as an infringement of the common rights of mankind, and made a vigorous ſtruggle againſt its being carried into execution. Every claſs deviſed ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt it, but the phyſicians bid the faireſt to intereſt the king in the preſervation of the ancient privileges of his people; for they remonſtrated that if the filth was not, as uſual, thrown into the ſtreets, a fatal ſickneſs would probably enſue, becauſe the putreſcent particles of the air, which ſuch filth attracted, would then be imbibed by the human body. But this expedient, with every other that could be thought of, proved unſucceſsful, and the popular diſcontent then ran ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>gh, that it was very near producing an inſurrection; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, however, at length prevailed, and Madrid is now as clear as moſt of the conſiderable cities in Europe. But many of the citizens, probably upon the principles advanced by their phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, that heaps of filth prevent deleterious particles of air from fixing upon neighbouring ſubſtances, have to keep their food wholeſome, conſtructed their privies by the kitchen fire.</p>
                        <p>In the evening all our boats being employed in carrying the water on board, and Mr. Bands and his company finding it probable that they ſhould be left on ſhore after it was dark, by which much time would be loſt, which they were impatient to employ in putting the plants they had gathered in order, they applied to the Indians for a paſſage in one of their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes: they immediately conſented, and a canoes was launch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their uſe. They went all on board, being eight in number, but not being uſed to a veſſel that required ſo even
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:013324_0226_0F8FFBA8D66B26A8"/>
a balance, they unfortunately overſet her in the ſurf: no life however was loſt, but it was thought adviſeable that half of them ſhould wait for another turn. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Tupia, and Tayeto embarked again, and without any farther accident arrived ſafely at the ſhip, well pleaſed with the good-nature of their Indian friends, who cheerfully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to carry them a ſecond time, after having experienced how unfit a freight they were for ſuch a veſſel.</p>
                        <p>While theſe gentlemen were on ſhore, ſeveral of the natives went off to the ſhip, and trafficked, by exchanging their cloth for that of Otaheite: of this barter they were for ſome time very fond, preferring the Indian cloth to that of Europe; but before night it decreaſed in its value five hundred per cent. Many of theſe Indians I took on board, and ſhewed them the ſhip and her apparatus, at which they expreſſed equal ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and aſtoniſhment.</p>
                        <p>As I found it exceedingly difficult to get water on board on account of the ſurf, I determined to ſtay no longer at this place; on the next morning, therefore, about five o'clock, I weighed anchor and put to ſea.</p>
                        <p>This bay, which is called by the natives TEGADOO, lies in the latitude of 38° 10′ S., but as it has nothing to recommend it, a deſcription of it is unneceſſary.</p>
                        <p>From this bay I intended to ſtand on to the northward, but the wind being right againſt me, I could make no way. While I was beating about to windward, ſome of the natives came on board, and told me, that in a bay which lay a little to the ſouthward, being the ſame that I could not fetch the day I put into Tegadoo, there was excellent water, where the boats might land without a ſurf. I thought it better, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to put into this bay, where I might complete my water, and form farther connexions with the Indians, than to keep the ſea. With this view I bore up for it, and ſent in two boats, manned and armed, to examine the watering place, who confirming the report of the Indians at their return, I came to an anchor about one o'clock, in eleven fathom water, with a fine ſandy bottom, the north point of the bay N. by E. and the ſouth point S. E. The watering-place, which was in a ſmall cove, a little within the ſouth point of the bay, bore S. by E. diſtant about a mile. Many canoes came imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately off from the ſhore, and all traded very honeſtly for Otaheite cloth and glaſs bottles, of which they were immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately fond.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon of the 23d, as ſoon as the ſhip was moored, I went on ſhore to examine the watering place, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander: the boat landed in the cove, without the leaſt ſurf; the water was excellent, and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently ſituated; there was plenty of wood cloſe to high-water
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:013324_0227_0F8FFBAA0194B578"/>
mark, and the diſpoſition of the people was in every reſpect ſuch as we could wiſh.</p>
                        <p>Having, with Mr. Green taken ſeveral obſervations of the ſun and moon, the mean reſult of them gave 180°, 47′ W. longitude; but as all the obſervations made before exceeded theſe, I have laid down the coaſt from the mean of the whole. At noon I took the ſun's meridian altitude with an aſtronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal quadrant, which was ſet up at the watering place, and found the latitude to be 388 22′ 24″.</p>
                        <p>On the 24th, early in the morning, I ſent Lieutenant Gore on ſhore, to ſuperintend the cutting of wood and filling of water, with a ſufficient number of men for both purpoſes, and all the marines as a guard. After breakfaſt I went on ſhore myſelf, and continued there the whole day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander alſo went on ſhore to gather plants, and in their walks ſaw ſeveral things worthy of notice. They met with many houſes in the vallies that ſeemed to be wholly deſerted, the people living on the ridges of the hills, in a kind of ſheds very ſlightly built. As they were advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in one of theſe vallies, the hills on each ſide of which were very ſteep, they were ſuddenly ſtruck with the ſight of a very extraordinary natural curioſity. It was a rock, perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated through its whole ſubſtance, ſo as to form a rude but ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous arch or cavern, opening directly to the ſea; this aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was ſeventy-five feet long, twenty-ſeven broad, and five and forty high, commanding a view of the bay and the hills on the other ſide, which were ſeen through it, and, opening at once upon the view, produced an effect far ſuperior to any of the contrivances of art.</p>
                        <p>As they were returning to the watering-place in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they met an old man, who detained them ſome time by ſhowing them the military exerciſes of the country with the lance and Patoo-Patoo, which are all the weapons in uſe. The lance is from ten to fourteen feet long, made of a very hard wood, and ſharp at both ends: the Patoo-Patoo has been deſcribed already, it is about a foot long, made of Tale or bone, with ſharp edges, and uſed as a battle-axe. A poſt or ſtake was ſet up as his enemy, to which he advanced with a moſt furious aſpect, brandiſhing his lance, which he graſped with great firmneſs; when it was ſuppoſed to have been pierced by his lance, he ran at it with his Patoo-Patoo, and falling upon the upper end of it, which was to repreſent his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's head, he laid on with great vehemence, ſtriking many blows, any one of which would probably have ſplit the ſkull of an ox. From our champions falling upon his mock enemy with the Patoo-Patoo, after he was ſuppoſed to have been pierced with the lance, our Gentlemen inferred, that in the battles of this country there is no quarter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="201" facs="unknown:013324_0228_0F8FFBAA500768A8"/>
This afternoon, we ſet up the armourer's forge, to repair the braces of the tiller which had been broken, and went on getting our wood and water, without ſuffering the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation from the natives; who came down with different ſorts of fiſh, which we purchaſed with cloth, beads, and glaſs bottles, as uſual.</p>
                        <p>On the 25th, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went again on ſhore; and while they were ſearching for plants, Tupia ſtaid with the waterers: among other Indians who came down to them, was a prieſt, with whom Tupia entered into a very learned converſation. In their notions of religion they ſeemed to agree very well, which is not often the caſe between learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed divines on our ſide of the ocean: Tupia, however, ſeemed to have the moſt knowledge, and he was liſtened to with great deference and attention by the other. In the courſe of this converſation, after the important points of divinity had been ſettled, Tupia enquired if it was their practice to eat men, to which they anſwered in the affirmative; but ſaid that they eat only their enemies, who were ſlain in battle.</p>
                        <p>On the 26th, it rained all day, ſo that none of us could go aſhore; and very few of the Indians came either to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering-place or the ſhip.</p>
                        <p>On the 27th, I went with Dr. Solander to examine the bottom of the bay; but though we went aſhore at two places, we met with little worth notice. The people behaved very civilly, ſhewing us every thing that we expreſſed a deſire to ſee. Among other trifling curioſities which Dr. Solander purchaſed of them, was a boy's top, ſhaped exactly like thoſe which children play with in England; and they made ſigns, that to make it ſpin it was to be whipped. Mr. Banks in the mean time went aſhore at the watering-place, and climbed a hill which ſtood at a little diſtance, to ſee a fence of poles, which we had obſerved from the ſhip, and which had been much the ſubject of ſpeculation. The hill was extremely ſleep, and rendered almoſt inacceſſible by wood; yet he reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the place, near which he found many houſes that for ſome reaſon had been deſerted by their inhabitants. The poles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be about ſixteen feet high; they were placed in two rows, with a ſpace of about ſix feet between them, and the poles in each row were about ten feet diſtant from each other. The lane between them was covered by ſticks, that were ſet up ſloping towards each other, from the top of the poles on each ſide, like the roof of a houſe. This rail-work, with a ditch that was parallel to it, was carried about an hundred yards down the hill in a kind of curve; but for what purpoſe we could not gueſs.</p>
                        <p>The Indians, at the watering-place, at our requeſt, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained us with their war-ſong, in which the women joined,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:013324_0229_0F8FFBAB0DD1D780"/>
with the moſt horrid diſtortions of countenance, rolling their eyes, thruſting out their tongues, and often heaving loud and deep ſighs; though all was done in very good time.</p>
                        <p>On the 28th we went aſhore upon an iſland that lies to the left hand of the entrance of the bay, where we ſaw the largeſt canoe that we had yet met with: ſhe was ſixty-eight feet and an half long, five broad, and three feet ſix high; ſhe had a ſharp bottom, conſiſting of three trunks of trees hollowed, of which that in the middle was the longeſt: the ſide planks were ſixty-two feet long in one piece, and were not deſpicably carved in bas relief; the head alſo was adorned with carving ſtill more richly. Upon this iſland there was a larger houſe than any we had yet ſeen; but it ſeemed unfiniſhed and was full of chips. The wood work was ſquared ſo even and ſmooth, that we made no doubt of their having among them very ſharp tools. The ſides of the poſts were carved in a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſtile, though after their whimſical taſte, which ſeems to prefer ſpiral lines and diſtorted faces: as theſe carved poſts appeared to have been brought from ſome other place, ſuch work is probably of great value among them.</p>
                        <p>At four o'clock in the morning of the 29, having got on board our wood and water, and a large ſupply of excellent celery, with which the country abounds, and which proved a powerful antiſcorbutic, I unmoored and put to ſea.</p>
                        <p>This bay is called by the natives TOLAGA; it is moderately large, and has from ſeven to thirteen fathom, with a clean ſandy bottom, and good anchorage; and is ſheltered from all winds except the north eaſt. It lies in latitude 38° 22′ S. and four leagues and an half to the north of Gable-end Foreland. on the ſouth point lies a ſmall but high iſland, ſo near the main as not to be diſtinguiſhed from it. Cloſe to the north end of the iſland, at the entrance into the bay, are two high rocks; one is round like a corn-ſtack, but the other is long, and perforated in ſeveral places ſo that the openings appear like the arches of a bridge. Within theſe rocks is the cove where we cut wood, and filled our water-caſks. Off the north point of the bay is a pretty high rocky iſland; and about a mile without it, are ſome rocks and breakers. The variation of the compaſs here is 14° 31′ E. and the tide flows at the full and change of the moon, about ſix o'clock, and riſes and falls perpendicularly from five to ſix feet: whether the flood comes from the ſouthward or the northward I have not been able to determine.</p>
                        <p>We got nothing here by traffic but a few fiſh, and ſome ſweet potatoes, except a few trifles, which we conſidered merely as curioſities. We ſaw no four-footed animals, nor the appearance of any, either tame or wild, except dogs and rats, and theſe were very ſcarce: the people eat the dogs, like our
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:013324_0230_0F8FFBABC9308618"/>
friends at Otaheite: and adorn their garments with the ſkins, as we do ours with fur and ermine. I climbed many of the hills, hoping to get a view of the country, but I could ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the top except higher hills, in a boundleſs ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The ridges of theſe hills produce little beſides fern; but the ſides are moſt luxuriantly clothed with wood, and verdure of various kinds, with little plantations intermixed. In the woods we found trees of above twenty different ſorts, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſpecimens of each on board; but there was nobody among us to whom they were not altogether unknown. The tree which we cut for firing was ſomewhat like our maple, &amp; yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a whitiſh gum. We found another ſort of it of a deep yellow, which we thought might be uſeful in dying. We found alſo one cabbage tree, which we cut down for the cabbages. The country abounds with plants, and the woods with birds, in an endleſs variety, exquiſitely beautiful, and of which none of us had the leaſt knowledge. The ſoil both of the hills and valleys is light and ſandy, and very fit for the production of all kinds of roots; though we ſaw none except ſweet potatoes and yams.</p>

                        <p>ON Monday the 30th, about half an hour after one o'clock, having made ſail again to the northward for about ten hours, with a light breeze, I hauled round a ſmall iſland, which lay eaſt one mile from the north eaſt point of the land: from this place I found the land trend away N. W. by W. and W. N. W. as far as I could ſee, this point being the eaſtermoſt land on the whole coaſt. I gave it the name of EAST CAPE, and I called the iſland that lies off it EAST ISLAND; it is of a ſmall circuit, high and round, and appears white and barren: the Cape is high, with white cliffs, and lies in latitude 37° 42′30″ S. and longitude 181° W. The land from Tolaga Bay to Eaſt Cape is of a moderate, but unequal height, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral ſmall bays, in which are ſandy beaches: of the inland country we could not ſee much, the weather being cloudy and hazey. The ſoundings were from twenty to thirty fathom, at the diſtance of about a league from the ſhore. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had rounded the Cape, we ſaw in our run along the ſhore a great number of villages, and much cultivated land; the country in general appeared more fertile than before, and
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:013324_0231_0F8FFBADE979B8B8"/>
was low near the ſea, but hilly within. At ſix in the evening, being four leagues to the weſtward of Eaſt Cape, we paſſed a bay which was firſt diſcovered by Lieutenant Hicks, and which therefore I called HICKS's BAY. At eight in the evening, being eight leagues to the weſtward of the Cape, and three or four miles from the ſhore, I ſhortened ſail and brought to for the night, having at this time a freſh gale at S. S. E. and ſqually; but it ſoon became moderate, and at two in the morning, we made ſail again to the S. W. as the land now trended; and at eight o'clock in the morning, ſaw land which made like an iſland, bearing weſt, the ſouth weſtermoſt part of the main bearing ſouth weſt; and about nine no leſs than five canoes came off, in which were more than forty men, all armed with their country pikes and battle-axes, ſhouting and threatening an attack: this gave us great uneaſineſs, and was indeed what we did not expect; for we hoped, that the report both of our power and clemency had ſpread to a greater extent. When one of theſe canoes had almoſt reached the ſhip, another, of an immenſe ſize, the largeſt we had yet ſeen, crowded with people who were alſo armed, put off from the ſhore, and came up at a great rate; as it approached it received ſignals from the canoe that was neareſt to the ſhip, and we could ſee that it had ſixteen paddles on a ſide, beſide people that ſat, and others that ſtood in a row from ſtem to ſtern, being in all about 60 men: as they made directly to the ſhip, we were deſirous of preventing an attack, by ſhowing what we could do; and therefore fired a gun, loaded with grape-ſhot, ahead of them; this made them ſtop, but not retreat; a round ſhot was then fired over them, and upon ſeing it fall, they ſeized their padd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and made towards the ſhore with ſuch precipitation, that they ſcarcely ſeemed to allow themſelves time to breathe. In the evening 3 or 4 more canoes came off unarmed; but they would not venture within a muſquet ſhot of the veſſel. The cape, off which we had been threatened with hoſtilities, I called, from the haſty retreat of the enemy, CAPE RUNAWAY. It lies in latitude 37° 32′; longitude 181° 48′. In this day's run, we found rhat the land, which made like an iſland in the morning, bearing weſt, was ſo; and we gave it the name of WHITE ISLAND.</p>
                        <p>At day-break, on the firſt of November, we counted no leſs than five and forty canoes that were coming from the ſhore towards the ſhip: ſeven of them came up with us, and after ſome converſation with Tupia, ſold us ſome lobſters and muſcles, and two conger e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ls. Theſe people traded pretty fairly: but when they were gone, ſome others came off from another place, who began alſo to trade fairly; but after ſome time they took what was handed down to them, without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any return; one of them who had done ſo, upon being
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:013324_0232_0F8FFBAF16942AA8"/>
threatened, began to laugh, and with many marks of deriſion ſet us at defiance, at the ſame time putting off the canoe from the ſhip: a muſquet then was fired over his head, which brought him back in a more ſerious mood, and trade went on with great regularity. At length, when the cabin and gun-room had got as much as they wanted, the men were allowed to come to the gang-way, and trade for themſelves. Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the ſame care was not taken to prevent frauds as had been taken before, ſo that the Indians, finding that they could cheat with impunity, grew inſolent again, and proceeded to take greater liberties. One of the canoes, having ſold every thing on board, pulled forward, and the people that were in her ſeeing ſome linen hang over the ſhip's ſide to dry, one of them without any ceremony, untied it, and put it up in his bundle: he was immediately called to, and required to return it; inſtead of which he let his canoe drop a ſtern, and laughed at us: a muſquet was fired over his head, which did not put a ſtop to his mirth; another was then fired at him with ſmall ſhot, which ſtruck him upon the back; he ſhrunk a little when the ſhot hit him, but did not regard it more than one of our men would have done the ſtroke of a ratan: he continued with great compoſure to pack up the linen that he had ſtolen. All the canoes now dropped a ſtern about an hundred yards, and all ſet up their ſong of defiance, which they continued till the ſhip was diſtant from them about four hundred yards. As they ſeemed to have no deſign to attack us, I was not willing to do them any hurt; yet I thought their going off in a brava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do might have a bad effect, when it ſhould be reported aſhore. To ſhew them therefore that they were ſtill in our power, tho' very much beyond the reach of any miſſile weapon with which they were acquainted, I gave the ſhip a yaw, and fired a four pounder ſo as to paſs near them. The ſhot happened to ſtrike the water, and riſe ſeveral times at a great diſtance, beyond the canoes: this ſtruck them with terror, and they paddled away without once looking behind them.</p>
                        <p>About two in the afternoon, we ſaw a pretty high iſland, bearing weſt from us; and at five, ſaw more iſlands and rocks to the weſtward of that. We hauled our wind in order to go without them, but could not weather them before it was dark. I therefore bore up, and ran between them and the main. At ſeven, I was cloſe under the firſt, from which a large double canoe, or rather two canoes laſhed together at the diſtance of about a foot, and covered with boards ſo as to make a deck, put off, and made ſail for the ſhip: this was the firſt veſſel of the kind we had ſeen ſince we left the South Sea iſlands. When ſhe came near, the people on board en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered very freely into converſation with Tupia, and we thought ſhewed a friendly diſpoſition; but when it was juſt dark, they
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:013324_0233_0F8FFBB00A140848"/>
ran their canoe cloſe to the ſhip's ſide, and threw in a volley of ſtones, after which they paddled aſhore.</p>
                        <p>We learnt from Tupia, that the people in the canoe called the iſland which we were under MOWTOHORA; it is but a ſmall circuit, though high, and lies ſix miles from the main; on the ſouth ſide is anchorage in fourteen fathom water. Upon the main land S. W. by W. of this iſland, and apparently at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> great diſtance from the ſea, is a high round mountain, which I called MOUNT EDGECOMBE: it ſtands in the middle of a large plain, and is therefore the more conſpicuous; lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 37° 59′<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> longitude 193° 7′.</p>
                        <p>In ſtanding weſtward, we ſuddenly ſhoaled out water from ſeventeen to ten fathom; and knowing that we were not far from the ſmall iſlands and rocks which we had ſeen before dark, and which I intended to have paſſed before I brought to for the night, I thought it more prudent to tack, and ſpend the night under Mowtohora, where I knew there was no danger. It was indeed happy for us that we did ſo; for in the morning, after we had made ſail to the weſtward, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, ahead of us, ſeveral rocks, ſome of which were level with the ſurface of the water, and ſome below it: they lay N. N. E. from Mount Edgecombe, one league and an half diſtant from the iſland Mowtohora, and about nine miles from the main. We paſſed between theſe rocks and the main, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ten to ſeven fathom water.</p>
                        <p>This morning, many canoes and much people were ſeen along the ſhore; ſeveral of the canoes followed us, but none of them could reach us, except one with a ſail, which proved to be the ſame which had pelted us the night before. The people on board again entered into converſation with Tupia; but we expected another volley of their ammunition, which was not indeed dangerous to any thing but the cabbin win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. They continued abreaſt of the ſhip about an hour, and behaved very peaceably; but at laſt the ſalute which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected was given; we returned it by firing a muſquet over them, and they immediately dropped a-ſtern and left us, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps rather ſatisfied with having given a teſt of their courage by twice inſulting a veſſel ſo much ſuperior to their own, than intimidated by the ſhot.</p>
                        <p>At half an hour after ten, we paſſed between a low flat iſland and the main: the diſtance from one to the other was about four miles, and the depth of water from ten to twelve fathom. The main land between this flat iſland and Mowto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hora is of a moderate height, but level, pretty clear of wood, and full of plantations and villages. The villages, which were larger than any we had yet ſeen, were built upon emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences near the ſea, and fortified on the land ſide by a bank and ditch, with a high paling within it, which was carried all
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:013324_0234_0F8FFBB052C5ADE8"/>
round: beſides a bank, ditch, and palliſadoes, ſome of them appeared to have out-works. Tupia had a notion that the ſmall incloſures of palliſadoes, and a ditch that we had ſeen before, were Morais or places of worſhip; but we were of opinion that they were ſorts, and concluded that theſe people had neighbouring enemies, and were always expoſed to hoſtile attacks.</p>
                        <p>At two o'clock we paſſed a ſmall high iſland, lying four miles from a high round head upon the main. From this head the land trends N. W. as far as can be ſeen, and has a rugged and hilly appearance. As the weather was hazy, and the wind blew freſh on the ſhore, we hauled off for the weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt iſland in ſight which bore from us N. N. E. diſtant about ſix or ſeven leagues.</p>
                        <p>Under this iſland, which I called the MAYOR, we ſpent the night. At ſeven in the morning it bore S. 47 E. diſtant ſix leagues, and a cluſter of ſmall iſlands and rocks bore N. 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> E. diſtant one league, to which I gave the name of the COURT OF ALDERMEN. They lie in the compaſs of about half a league every way, and five leagues from the main, between which and them lie other iſlands, moſt of them bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren rocks, of which there is great variety: ſome of them are as ſmall in compaſs as the monument of London, but riſe to a much greater height, and ſome of them are inhabited. They lie in latitude 36° 57′, and at noon bore S. 60 E. diſtant three or four leagues; and a rock like a caſtle, lying not far from the main, bore N. 40 W. at the diſtance of one league. The country that we paſſed the night before, appeared, to be well inhabited, many towns were in ſight, and ſome hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reds of large canoes lay under them upon the beach; but the day, after having ſailed about fifteen leagues, it appeared to be barren and deſolate. As far as we had yet coaſted this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from Cape Turnagain, the people acknowledged one Chief, whom they called TERATU, and to whoſe reſidence they pointed, in a direction that we thought to be very far iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but afterwards found to be otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p>About one o'clock three canoes came off to us from the main, with one and twenty men on board. The conſtruction of theſe veſſels appeared to be more ſimple than that of any we had ſeen, they being nothing more than trunks of a ſingle tree hollowed by fire, without any convenience or ornament. The people on board were almoſt naked, and appeared to be of a browner complexion; yet naked and deſpicable as they were, they ſung their ſong of defiance, and ſeemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce againſt us inevitable deſtruction: they remained, how ever, ſome time out of ſtones throw, and then venturing nearer, with leſs appearance of hoſtility, one of our men were to the ſhip ſide, and was about to hand them a rope; the
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:013324_0235_0F8FFBB1116EA198"/>
courteſy, however, they thought fit to return by throwing a lance at him, which having miſſed him, they immediately threw another into the ſhip: upon this a muſquet was fired over them, which at once ſent them away.</p>
                        <p>About two we ſaw a large opening, or inlet, for which we bore up; we had now forty-one fathom water, which gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally decreaſed to nine, at which time we were one mile and an half diſtant from a high towered rock, which lay near the ſouth point of the inlet: this rock, and the northermoſt of the Court of Aldermen being in one, bearing S. 61 E.</p>
                        <p>About ſeven in the evening we anchored in ſeven fathom, a little within the ſouth entrance of the bay: to this place we were accompanied by ſeveral canoes and people like thoſe we had ſeen laſt, and for ſome time they behaved very civilly. While they were hovering about us, a bird was ſhot from the ſhip, as it was ſwimming upon the water: at this they ſhewed leſs ſurprize than we expected, and taking up the bird, they tied it to a fiſhing-line that was towing a-ſtern; as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment for this favour we gave them a piece of cloth: but notwithſtanding this effect of our fire-arms, and this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of civilities, as ſoon as it grew dark they ſung their war ſong, and attempted to tow away the buoy of the anchor. Two or three muſkets were then fired over them, but this ſeemed rather to make them angry than afraid, and they went away, threatening that to-morrow they would return with more force, and be the death of us all; at the ſame time ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off a boat, which they told us was going to another part of the bay for aſſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>There was ſome appearance of generoſity, as well as cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, in acquainting us with the time when they intended to make their attack, but they forfeited all credit which this procured them, by coming ſecretly upon us in the night, when they certainly hoped to find us aſleep: upon approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhip they found themſelves miſtaken, and therefore retired without ſpeaking a word, ſuppoſing that they were too early; after ſome time they came a ſecond time, and being again diſappointed, they retired as ſilently as before.</p>
                        <p>In the morning, at day-break, they prepared to effect by force what they had in vain attempted by ſtealth and artifice: no leſs than twelve canoes came againſt us, with about an hundred and fifty men, all armed with pikes, lances, and ſtones. As they could do nothing till they came very near the ſhip, Tupia was ordered to expoſtulate with them, and, if poſſible, to divert them from their purpoſe: during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation they appeared to be ſometimes friendly and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times otherwiſe; at length, however, they began to trade, and we offered to purchaſe their weapons, which ſome of them conſented to ſell: they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="209" facs="unknown:013324_0236_0F90F2BE6A255268"/>
what had been agreed upon for the purchaſe of a third, they refuſed to ſend it up, but offered it for a ſecond price; a ſecond was ſent down, but the weapon was ſtill detained, and a demand made of a third; this being refuſed with ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of diſpleaſure and reſentment, the offender, with many ludicrous tokens of contempt and defiance, paddling his canoe off a few yards from the ſhip. As I intended to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in this place five or ſix days, in order to make an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the tranſit of Mercury, it was abſolutely neceſſary, in order to prevent future miſchief, to ſhew theſe people that we were not to be treated ill with impunity; ſome ſmall ſhot were therefore fired at the thief, and a muſket ball through the bottom of his boat: upon this it was paddled to about an hundred yards diſtance, and to our great ſurprize, the people in the other canoes took not the leaſt notice of their wounded companion, though he bled very much, but returned to the ſhip, and continued to trade with the moſt perfect indifference and unconcern. They ſold us many more of their weapons without making any other attempt to defraud us, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time; at laſt, however, one of them thought fit to paddle away with two different pieces of cloth which had been given for the ſame weapon: when he had got about an hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red yards diſtance, and thought himſelf ſecure of his prize, a muſket was fired after him, which fortunately ſtruck the boat juſt at the water's edge, and made two holes in her ſide; this only incited them to ply their paddles with greater activity, and the reſt of the canoes alſo made off with the utmoſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. As the laſt proof of our ſuperiority therefore, we fired a round ſhot over them, and not a boat ſtopped till they got on ſhore.</p>
                        <p>About ten o'clock, I went with two boats to ſound the bay, and look out for a more convenient anchoring place, the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being in one boat, and myſelf in the other. We pulled firſt over to the north ſhore, from which ſome canoes came out to meet us; as we advanced, however, they retired, inviting us to follow them: but, ſeeing them all armed, I did not think it proper to comply, but went towards the head of the bay, where I obſerved a village upon a very high point, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in the manner that has been already deſcribed, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fixed upon an anchoring-place, not far from where the ſhip lay, I returned on board.</p>
                        <p>At three o'clock in the afternoon, I weighed, run in nearer to the ſhore, and anchored in four fathom and an half water, with a ſoft ſandy bottom, the ſouth point of the bay bearing E. diſtant one mile, and a river which the boats can enter at low water S. S. E. diſtant a mile and an half.</p>
                        <p>In the morning the natives came off again to the ſhip, and we had the ſatisfaction to obſerve that their behaviour was
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:013324_0237_0F8FFBB1DC864AB8"/>
very different from what it had been yeſterday: among them was an old man, whom we had before remarked for his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and honeſty: his name was TOIAVA, and he ſeemed to be a perſon of ſuperior rank; in the tranſactions of yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday morning he had behaved with great propriety and good ſenſe, lying in a ſmall canoe, always near the ſhip, and treating thoſe on board, as if he neither intended a fraud, nor ſuſpected an injury: with ſome perſuaſion this man and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other came on board, and ventured into the cabin, where I preſented each of them with a piece of Engliſh cloth, and ſome ſpike nails. They told us that the Indians were now very much afraid of us; and on our part we promiſed friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip if they would behave peceably, deſiring only to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe what they had to ſell upon their own terms.</p>
                        <p>After the natives had left us, I went with the pinnace and long-boat into the river, with a deſign to haul the ſeine, and ſent the Maſter in the yawl, to found the bay, and dredge for fiſh. The Indians who were on one ſide of the river, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their friendſhip by all the ſigns they could deviſe, beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning us to land among them; but we choſe to go aſhore on the other ſide, as the ſituation was more convenient for hauling the ſeine, and ſhooting birds, of which we ſaw great numbers of various kinds: the Indians, with much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, about noon, ventured over to us. With the ſeine we had very little ſucceſs, catching only a few mullets, neither did we get any thing by the trawl, or the dredge, except a few ſhells; but we ſhot ſeveral birds, moſt of them reſembling ſea-pies, except that they had black plumage, and red bills and feet. While we were abſent with our guns, the people who ſtaid by the boats ſaw two of the Indians quarrel and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ight: they began the battle with their lances, but ſome old men interpoſed and took them away, leaving them to decide the difference, like Engliſhmen, with their fiſts: they boxed with great vigour and obſtinacy for ſome time, but by degrees all retired behind a little hill, ſo that our people could not ſee the event of the combat.</p>
                        <p>In the morning the long-boat was ſent again to traul in the bay, and an officer, with the marines, and a party of men, to cut wood and haul the ſeine. The Indians on ſhore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very peaceable and ſubmiſſive, and we had reaſon to believe that their habitations were at a conſiderable diſtance, for we ſaw no houſes, and found that they ſlept under the buſhes: the bay is probably a place to which they frequently reſort in parties to gather ſhell-fiſh, of which it affords incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible plenty, for wherever we went, whether upon the hills or in the vallies, the woods or the plains, we ſaw vaſt heaps of ſhells, often many waggon loads together, ſome appearing to be very old, and others recent. We ſaw no cultivation in this place, which had a deſolate and barren appearance; the
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:013324_0238_0F8FFBB2881B8FC0"/>
tops of the hills were green, but nothing grew there except a large kind of fern, the roots of which the natives had got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in large quantities, in order to carry away with them. In the evening Mr. Banks walked up the river, which at the mouth looked fine and broad, but at the diſtance of about two miles was not deep enough to cover the foot; and the country inland was ſtill more barren than at the ſea-ſide. The ſeine and dredge were not more ſucceſsful to-day than yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, but the Indians in ſome meaſure compenſated for the diſappointment by bringing us ſeveral baſkets of fiſh, ſome dry, and ſome freſh dreſſed; it was not indeed of the beſt, but I ordered it all to be bought for the encouragement of trade.</p>
                        <p>On the 7th, the weather was ſo bad that none of us left the ſhip, nor did any of the Indians come on board.</p>
                        <p>On the 8th, I ſent a party of men on ſhore to wood and water; and in the mean time many canoes came off, in one of which was our friend Toiava; ſoon after he was alongſide of the ſhip, he ſaw two canoes coming from the oppoſite ſide of the bay, upon which he haſted back again to the ſhore with all his canoes, telling us that he was afraid of the people who were coming: this was a farther proof that the people of this country were perpetually committing hoſtilities againſt each other. In a ſhort time, however, he returned, having diſcovered that the people who had alarmed him were not the ſame that he had ſuppoſed. The natives that came to the ſhip this morning ſold us, for a few pieces of cloth, as much fiſh of the mackrel kind as ſerved the whole ſhip's company, and they were as good as ever were eaten. At noon, this day, I obſerved the ſun's meridional zenith diſtance by an aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical quadrant, which gave the latitude 36° 47′ 43" within the ſouth entrance of the bay.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went on ſhore, and collected a great variety of plants, altogether unknown, and not return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till the evening, had an opportunity of obſerving in what manner the Indians diſpoſed themſelves to paſs the night. They had no ſhelter but a few ſhrubs: the women and the children were ranged innermoſt, or fartheſt from the ſea; the men lay in a kind of half circle round them, and their arms were ſet up againſt the trees cloſe by them, in a manner which ſhowed that they were afraid of an attack by ſome ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my not far diſtant. It was alſo diſcovered that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged neither Teratu, nor any other perſon as their king: as in this particular they differed from all the people that we had ſeen upon other parts of the coaſt, we thought it poſſible that they might be a ſet of outlaws, in a ſtate of rebellion againſt Teratu, and in that caſe they might have no ſettled habitations, or cultivated land in any part of the country.</p>
                        <p>On the 9th, at day-break, a great number of canoes came
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:013324_0239_0F8FFBB4C70DADE8"/>
on board, loaded with mackrel of two ſorts, one exactly the ſame with thoſe caught in England, and the other ſomewhat different: we imagined the people had taken a large ſhoal, and brought us an overplus which they could not conſume; for they ſold them at a very low rate. They were, however, very welcome to us; at eight o'clock the ſhip had more fiſh on board than all her people could eat in three days; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night the quantity was ſo much increaſed, that every man who could get ſalt, cured as many as would laſt him a month.</p>
                        <p>After an early breakfaſt, I went aſhore with Mr. Green and proper inſtruments, to obſerve the tranſit of Mercury, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander being of the party; the weather had for ſome time been very thick, with much rain, but this day was ſo favourable that not a cloud intervened during the whole tranſit. The obſervation of the ingreſs was made by Mr. Green alone, while I was employed in taking the ſun's alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to aſcertain the time. It came on at 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> 20′ 58" apparent time: according to Mr. Green's obſervation, the internal contact was at 12<hi rend="sup">h</hi> 8′ 58″, the external at 12h 9′ 55″ P. M. And according to mine, the internal contact was at 12h 8′ 54″, and the external 12h 9′ 48″; the latitude of the place of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation was 30°. 48′ 5½ ″. The latitude obſerved at noon was 36°. 48′ 28″. The mean of this and yeſterday's obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gives 36°, 48′ 5½ ″ S. the latitude of the place of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the variation of the compaſs was 11° 9′ E.</p>
                        <p>About noon we were alarmed by the firing of a great gun from the ſhip; Mr. Gore, my Second Lieutenant, was at this time commanding officer on board, and the account that he gave was this. While ſome ſmall canoes were trading with the people, two very large ones came up, full of men, one of them having on board forty-ſeven, all armed with pikes, darts, and ſtones, and apparently with an hoſtile intention: they appeared to be ſtrangers, and to be rather conſcious of ſuperiority over us by their numbers, than afraid of any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons which could give us the ſuperiority over them: no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack however was made; probably becauſe they learnt from the people in the other canoes, with whom they immediately entered into conference, what kind of an enemy they had to deal with: after a little time, they began to trade, ſome of them offering their arms, and one of them a ſquare piece of cloth, which makes a part of their dreſs, called a <hi>Haahow;</hi> ſeveral of the weapons were purchaſed, and Mr. Gore having agreed for a Haahow, ſent down the price, which was a piece of Britiſh cloth, and expected his purchaſe: but the Indian, as ſoon as he got Mr. Gore's cloth in his poſſeſſion, refuſed to part with his own, and put off the canoe: upon being threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened for this fraud, he and his companions began to ſing their
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:013324_0240_0F8FFBB5E7C9F578"/>
war ſong in defiance, and ſhook their paddles: ſtill however they began no attack, only defying Mr. Gore to take any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in his power, which ſo provoked him that he levelled a muſquet loaded with ball at the offender, while he was hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cloth in his hand, and ſhot him dead. It would have been happy, if the effect of a few ſmall ſhot had been tried upon this occaſion, which upon ſome others had been ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                        <p>When the Indian dropped, all the canoes put off to ſome diſtance; but as they did not go away, it was thought they might ſtill meditate an attack. To ſecure therefore a ſafe paſſage for the boat, which it was neceſſary to ſend on ſhore, a round ſhot was fired over their heads, which effectually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the purpoſe, and put them all to flight. When an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what happened was brought aſhore, our Indians were alarmed, and drawing all together, retreated in a body. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort time, however, they returned, having heard a more particular account of the affair; and intimated that they thought the man who had been killed deſerved his fate.</p>
                        <p>A little before ſunſet the Indians retired to eat their ſupper, and we went with them to be ſpectators of the repaſt; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of fiſh of different kinds, among which were lobſters, and ſome birds, of a ſpecies unknown to us: theſe were either roaſted or baked; to roaſt them, they faſtened them upon a ſmall ſtick, which was ſtuck up in the ground, inclining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their fire; and to bake them they put them into a hole in the ground with hot ſtones, in the ſame manner as the people of Otaheite.</p>
                        <p>Among the natives that were aſſembled upon this occaſion, we ſaw a woman, who, after their manner, was mourning for the death of her relation: ſhe ſat upon the ground near the reſt, who, only one excepted, ſeemed not at all to regard her: the tears conſtantly trickled down her cheeks, and ſhe repeated in a low, but very mournful voice, words, which even Tupia did not at all underſtand: at the end of every ſentence ſhe cut her arms, her face, or her breaſt with a ſhell that ſhe held in her hand, ſo that ſhe was almoſt covered with blood, and was indeed one of the moſt affecting ſpectacles that can be conceived. The cuts, however, did not appear to be ſo deep as are ſometimes made upon ſimilar occaſions, if we may judge by the ſcars which we ſaw upon the arms, thighs, breaſts, and cheeks of many of them, which we were told were the remains of wounds which they had inflicted upon themſelves as teſtimonies of their affection and ſorrow.</p>
                        <p>The next day I went with two boats, accompanied by Mr. Banks and the other Gentlemen, to examine a large river that empties itſelf into the head of the bay. We rowed about four or five miles up, and could have gone much farther if the

weather had been favourable. It was here wider than at the mouth, and divided into many ſtreams by ſmall flat iſlands, which are covered with mangroves, and overflowed at high water. From theſe trees exudes a viſcous ſubſtance which very much reſembles reſin: we found it firſt in ſmall lumps upon the ſea beach, and now ſaw it ſticking to the trees, by which we knew whence it came. We landed on the eaſt ſide of the river, where we ſaw a tree upon which ſeveral ſhags had built their neſts, and here therefore we determined to dine; twenty of the ſhags were ſoon killed, and being broiled upon the ſpot, afforded us an excellent meal. We then went upon the hills, from whence, I thought, I ſaw the head of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The ſhore on each ſide, as well as the iſlands in the middle, were covered with Mangroves; and the ſand banks abounded in cockles and clams: in many places there were rock oyſters, and every where plenty of wild fowl, principally ſhags, ducks, curlieus, and the ſea-pie, that has been deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. We alſo ſaw fiſh in the river, but of what kind we could not diſcover: the country on the eaſt ſide of this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is for the moſt part barren, and deſtitute of wood; but on the weſt it has a better aſpect, and in ſome places is adorned with trees, but has in no part the appearance of cultivation. In the entrance of the river, and for two or three miles up, there is good anchoring in four and five fathom water, and places very convenient for laying a veſſel on ſhore, where the tide riſes and falls ſeven feet at the full and change of the moon. We could not determine, whether any conſiderable ſtream of freſh water came into this river out of the country; but we ſaw a number of ſmall rivulets iſſue from the adjacent hills. Near the mouth of this river, on the eaſt ſide, we found a little Indian village, conſiſting of ſmall temporary ſheds, where we landed, and were received by the people with the utmoſt kindneſs and hoſpitality: they treated us with a flat ſhell-fiſh of a moſt delicious taſte, ſomewhat like a cockle, which we eat hot from the coals. Near this place is a high point or peninſula, projecting into the river, and upon it are the remains of a fort, which they call <hi>Eppah</hi> or <hi>Heppah.</hi> The beſt engineer in Europe could not have choſen a ſituation better adapted to enable a ſmall number to defend themſelves againſt a greater. The ſteepneſs of the cliffs ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it wholly inacceſſible from the water which encloſes it on three ſides; and, to the land, it is fortified by a ditch, and a bank raiſed on the inſide: from the top of the bank to the bottom of the ditch, is two and twenty feet; the ditch on the outſide is fourteen feet deep, and its breadth is in proportion. The whole ſeemed to have been executed with great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and there had been a row of pickets or paliſadoes, both on the top of the bank and along the brink of the ditch
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:013324_0242_0F8FFBB711CA13C0"/>
on the outſide; thoſe on the outſide had been driven very deep into the ground, and were inclined towards the ditch, ſo as to project over it; out of theſe the thickeſt poſts only were left, and upon them there were evident marks of fire, ſo that the place had probably been taken and deſtroyed by an enemy. If any occaſion ſhould make it neceſſary for a ſhip to winter here, or ſtay any time, tents might be built in this place, which is ſufficiently ſpacious, with great convenience, and might eaſily be made impregnable to the whole country.</p>
                        <p>On the eleventh, there was ſo much wind and rain that no canoe came off; but the long-boat was ſent to fetch oyſters from one of the beds which had been diſcovered the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: the boat ſoon returned, deeply laden, and the oyſters, which were as good as ever came from Colcheſter, and about the ſame ſize, were laid down under the booms, and the ſhip's company did nothing but eat them from the time they came on board till night, when, as may reaſonably be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, great part of them were expended; this, however, gave us no concern, as we knew that not the boat only, but the ſhip might have been loaded, almoſt in one tide, as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>In the morning of Sunday the 12th, two canoes came off full of people whom we had never ſeen before, but who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have heard of us by the caution which they uſed in approaching us.

                        <p>After breakfaſt I went with the pinnace and yawl, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, over to the north ſide of the bay, to take a view of the country, and two forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied villages, which we had diſcovered at a diſtance. We landed near the ſmalleſt of them, the ſituation of which was the moſt beautifully romantic that can be imagined; it was built upon a ſmall rock, detached from the main, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded at high water. The whole body of this rock was perforated by an hollow or arch, which poſſeſſed much the largeſt part of it; the top of the arch was above ſixty feet perpendicular above the ſea, which at high water ſlowed through the bottom of it: the whole ſummit of the rock above the arch was fenced round after their manner; but the area was not large enough to contain more than five or ſix houſes: it was acceſſible only by one very narrow and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ort of the ſame kind, about a mile's diſtance. We made ſome preſents however to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and in the mean time we ſaw the inhabitants of the town which we were going to, coming towards us in a body, men, women and children, to the number of about one hundred: when they came near enough to be heard, they waved their hand, and called out <hi>Horomai;</hi> after which they ſat down among the buſhes near the beach: theſe ceremonies we were told were certain ſigns of their friendly diſpoſition. We ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the place where they were ſitting, and when we came up, made them a few preſents, and aſked leave to viſit their Heppah; they conſented with joy in their countenances, and immediately led the way. It is called WHARRETOUWA, and is ſituated upon a high promontory or point, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects into the ſea, on the north ſide, and near the head of the bay: two ſides of it are waſhed by the ſea, and theſe are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inacceſſible; two other ſides are to the land: up one of them, which is very ſteep, lies the avenue from the beach; the other is flat and open to the country upon the hill, which is a narrow ridge: the whole is incloſed by a palliſade about ten feet high, conſiſting of ſtrong pales, bound together with withes. The weak ſide next the land is alſo defended by a double ditch, the innermoſt of which has a bank, and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional palliſade; the inner palliſades are upon the bank next the town, but at ſuch a diſtance from the top of the bank as to leave room for men to walk and uſe their arms between them and the inner ditch: the outermoſt palliſades are between the two ditches, and driven obliquely into the ground, ſo that their upper ends incline over the ditch: the depth of this ditch, from the bottom to the top of the crown of the bank, is four and twenty feet. Cloſe within the innermoſt palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade is a ſtage, twenty feet high, forty feet long, and ſix broad; it is ſupported by ſtrong poſts, and is intended as a ſtation for thoſe who defend the place, from which they may annoy the aſſailants by darts and ſtones, heaps of which lay ready for uſe. Another ſtage of the ſame kind commands the ſteep avenue from the beach, and ſtands alſo within the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſade; on this ſide of the hill there are ſome little outworks and huts, not intended as advanced poſts, but as the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of people who for want of room could not be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated within the works, but who were, notwithſtanding, deſirous of placing themſelves under their protection. The palliſades, as has been obſerved already, run round the whole brow of the hill, as well towards the ſea, as towards the land; but the ground within having originally been a mount, they have reduced it not to one level, but to ſeveral, riſing in ſtages one above the other, like an amphitheatre, each of which is
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:013324_0244_0F8FFBB8EC08E360"/>
incloſed within its ſeparate palliſade; they communicate with each other by narrow lanes, which might eaſily be ſtopped up, ſo that if an enemy ſhould force the outward palliſade, he would have others to carry before the place could be wholly reduced, ſuppoſing theſe places to be obſtinately defended one after the other. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> only entrance is by a narrow paſſage, about twelve feet long, communicating with the ſteep aſcent from the beach: it paſſes under one of the fighting ſtages, and though we ſaw nothing like a door or gateway, it may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily barricaded in a manner that will make the forcing it a very dangerous and difficult undertaking. Upon the whole, this muſt be conſidered as a place of great ſtrength, in which a ſmall number of reſolute men may defend themſelves againſt all the force which a people with no other arms than thoſe that are in uſe here could bring againſt it. It ſeemed to be well furniſhed for a ſiege with every thing but water; we ſaw great quantities of fern root, which they eat as bread, and dried fiſh piled up in heaps; but we could not perceive that they had any freſh water nearer than a brook, which runs cloſe under the foot of the hill, whether they have any means of getting it from this place during a ſiege, or whether they have any method of ſtoring it within the works, in gourds, or other veſſels, we could not learn; ſome reſource they certainly have with reſpect to this article, an indiſpenſable neceſſary of life, for otherwiſe the laying up dry proviſions could anſwer no purpoſe. Upon our expreſſing a deſire to ſee their method of attack and defence, one of the young men mounted a ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtage, which they call <hi>Porava,</hi> and another went into the ditch: both he that was to defend the place, and he that was to aſſault it, ſung the war-ſong, and danced with the ſame frightful geſticulations that we had ſeen uſed in more ſerious circumſtances, to work themſelves up into a degree of that mechanical fury, which among all uncivilized nations, is the neceſſary prelude to a battle; for diſpaſſionate courage, a ſtrength of mind that can ſurmount the ſenſe of danger, without a flow of animal ſpirits by which it is extinguiſhed, ſeems to be the prerogative of thoſe who have projects of more laſting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and a keener ſenſe of honour and diſgrace, than can be formed or felt by men who have few pains or pleaſures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe of mere animal life, and ſcarcely any purpoſe but to provide for the day that is paſſing over them, to obtain plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or revenge an inſult: they will march againſt each other indeed in cool blood, though they find it neceſſary to work themſelves into paſſion before they engage; as among us there have been many inſtances of people who have deliberately made themſelves drunk, that they might execute a project which they formed when they were ſober, but which, while they continued ſo, they did not dare to undertake.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="218" facs="unknown:013324_0245_0F8FFBB954426E90"/>
On the ſide of the hill, near this incloſure, we ſaw about half an acre planted with gourds and ſweet potatoes, which was the only cultivation in the bay: under the foot of the point, upon which this fortification ſtands, are two rocks, one juſt broken off from the main, and the other not perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from it: they are both ſmall, and ſeem more proper for the habitations of birds than men; yet there are houſes and places of defence upon each of them. And we ſaw many other works of the ſame kind upon ſmall iſlands, rocks, and ridges of hills, on different parts of the coaſt, beſides many fortified towns, which appeared to be much ſuperior to this.</p>
                        <p>The perpetual hoſtility in which theſe poor ſavages, who have made every village a fort, muſt neceſſarily live, will account for there being ſo little of their land in a ſtate of cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation; and, as miſchiefs very often reciprocally produce each other, it may perhaps appear, that there being ſo little land in a ſtate of cultivation, will account for their living in perpetual hoſtility. But it is very ſtrange, that the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and diligence which have been uſed in the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of places ſo admirably adapted to defence, almoſt without tools, ſhould not, when urged by the ſome neceſſity, have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with a ſingle miſſile weapon except the lance, which is thrown by hand: they have no contrivance like a bow to diſcharge a dart, nor any thing like a ſling to aſſiſt them in throwing a ſtone; which is the more ſurpriſing, as the invention of ſlings, and bows and arrows, is much more obvious than the works which theſe people conſtruct, and both theſe weapons are found among much ruder nations, and in almoſt every other part of the world. Beſides the long lance and Patoo-Patoo, which have been mentioned already, they have a ſtaff about five-feet long, ſometimes pointed, like a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant's halberd, ſometimes only tapering to a point at one end, and having the other end broad, and ſhaped ſomewhat like the blade of an oar. They have alſo another weapon, about a foot ſhorter than theſe, pointed at one end, and at the other ſhaped like an axe. The points of their long lances are barbed, and they handle them with ſuch ſtrength and agility, that we can match them with no weapon but a loaded muſquet.</p>
                        <p>After taking a ſlight view of the country, and loading both the boats with celery, which we found in great plenty near the beach, we returned from our excurſion, and about five o'clock in the evening got on board the ſhip.</p>
                        <p>On the 15th, I ſailed out of the bay, and at the ſame time had ſeveral canoes on board, in one of which was our friend Toiava, who ſaid, that as ſoon as we were gone he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to his Heppah, or fort, becauſe the friends of the man who had been ſhot by Mr. Gore on the 9th, had threatened to revenge his death upon him, whom they had reproached as
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:013324_0246_0F90F2BF13470B18"/>
being our friend. Off the north point off the bay, I ſaw a great number of iſlands, of various extent, which lay ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to the north weſt, in a direction parallel with the main as far as I could ſee. I ſteered north eaſt for the north eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of theſe iſlands; but the wind coming to the north weſt, I was obliged to ſtand out to ſea.</p>
                        <p>To the bay which we had now left I gave the name of MER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CURY BAY, on account of the obſervation which we had made there of the tranſit of that planet over the ſun. It lies in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 36° 47′ S.; and in the longitude of 184° 4′ W.: there are ſeveral iſlands lying both to the ſouthward and northward of it, and a ſmall iſland or rock in the middle of the entrance: within this iſland the depth of water no where exceeds nine fathom: the beſt anchoring is in a ſandy bay, which lies juſt within the ſouth head, in five and four fathom, bringing a high tower or rock, which lies without the head, in one with the head, or juſt ſhut in behind it. This place is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient both for wooding and watering, and in the river there is an immenſe quantity of oyſters, and other ſhell-fiſh: I have for this reaſon given it the name of OYSTER RIVER. But for a ſhip that wants to ſtay here any time, the beſt and ſafeſt place is in the river, at the head of the bay; which, from the number of mangrove trees about it, I have called MANGROVE RIVER. To ſail into this river, the ſouth ſhore muſt be kept all the way on board. The country on the eaſt ſide of the river and bay is very barren, its only produce being fern, and a few other plants that will grow in a poor ſoil. The land on the north weſt ſide is covered with wood, and the ſoil being much more fertile, would doubtleſs produce all the neceſſaries of life with proper cultivation: it is not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſo fertile as the lands that we have ſeen to the ſouthward; nor do the inhabitants, though numerous, make ſo good an appearance: they have no plantations; their canoes are mean, and without ornament; they ſleep in the open air; and ſay, that Teratu, whoſe ſovereignty they do not acknowledge, if he was to come among them, would kill them. This fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured our opinion of their being outlaws; yet they told us, that they had Heppahs, or ſtrong holds, to which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in time of imminent danger.</p>
                        <p>We found, thrown upon the ſhore, in ſeveral parts of this bay, great quantities of iron-ſand, which is brought down by every little rivulet of freſh water that finds its way from the country; which is a demonſtration that there is ore of that metal not far inland: yet neither the inhabitants of this place, or any other part of the coaſt that we have ſeen, know the uſe of iron, or ſet the leaſt value upon it; all of them preferring the moſt worthleſs and uſeleſs, not only to a nail, but to any tool of that metal.</p>

Before we left the bay, we cut upon one of the trees near the watering-place the ſhip's name, and that of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, with the date of the year and month when we were there; and after diſplaying the Engliſh colours, I took a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal poſſeſſion of it in the name of his Britannic Majeſty King George the Third.</p>

                        <p>I Continued plying to windward two days, to get under the land, and on the 18th, about ſeven in the morning, we were abreaſt of a very conſpicuous promontory, being then in latitude 36° 26′, and in the direction of N. 48 W. from the north head of Mercury bay, or Point Mercury, which was diſtant nine leagues: upon this point ſtood many people, who ſeemed to take little notice of us, but talked together with great earneſtneſs. In about half an hour, ſeveral ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes put off from the different places, and came towards the ſhip; upon which the people on the point alſo launched a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe, and about twenty of them came in her up with the others. When two of theſe canoes, in which there might be about ſixty men, came near enough to make themſelves heard, they ſung their war-ſong; but ſeeing that we took little notice of it, they threw a few ſtones at us, and then rowed off towards the ſhore. We hoped that we had now done with them, but in a ſhort time they returned, as if with a fixed reſolution to provoke us into a battle, animating themſelves by their ſong, as they had done before. Tupia, without any directions from us, went to the poop, and began to expoſtulate: he told them that we had weapons which would deſtroy them in a moment; and that if they ventured to attack us, we ſhould be obliged to uſe them. Upon this they flouriſhed their weapons, and cried out in their language, "Come on ſhore, and we will kill you all:" Well, ſaid Tupia, but why ſhould you moleſt us while we are at ſea? as we do not wiſh to fight, we ſhall not accept your challenge to come on ſhore; and here there is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for a quarrel, the ſea being no more your property than the ſhip. This eloquence of Tupia though it greatly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed us, having given him no hints for the arguments he uſed, had no effect upon our enemies, who very ſoon renewed
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:013324_0248_0F8FFBBAC9AC70C0"/>
their battery: a muſquet was then fired through one of their boats, and this was an argument of ſufficient weight, for they immediately fell aſtern and left us.</p>
                        <p>From the point, of which we were now abreaſt, the land trends W. ½ S. near a league, and then S. S. E. as far as we could ſee; and, beſides the iſlands that lay without us, we could ſee land round by the S. W. as far as the N. W.; but whether this was the main or iſlands, we could not then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine: the fear of loſing the main, however, made me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to follow its direction. With this view, I hauled round the point and ſteered to the ſouthward, but there being light airs all round the compaſs, we made but little progreſs.</p>
                        <p>About one o'clock, a breeze ſprung up at eaſt, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards came to N. E. and we ſteered along the ſhore S. by E. and S. S. E. having from twenty-five to eighteen fathom.</p>
                        <p>At about half an hour after ſeven in the evening, having run ſeven or eight leagues ſince noon, I anchored in twenty-three fathom, not chuſing to run any farther in the dark, as I had now land on both ſides, forming the entrance of a ſtreight, bay, or river, lying S. by E. for on that point we could ſee no land.</p>
                        <p>At day-break, on the 19th, the wind being ſtill favourable, we weighed and ſtood with an eaſy ſail up the inlet, keeping neareſt to the eaſt ſide. In a ſhort time, two large canoes came off to us from the ſhore; the people on board ſaid, that they knew Toiava very well, and called Tupia by his name. I invited ſome of them on board; and as they knew they had nothing to fear from us, while they behaved honeſtly and peaceably, they immediately complied: I made each of them ſome preſents, and diſmiſſed them much gratified. Other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes afterwards came up to us from a different ſide of the bay; and the people on board of theſe alſo mentioned the name of Toiava, and ſent a young man into the ſhip, who told us he was his grandſon, and he alſo was diſmiſſed with a preſent.</p>
                        <p>After having run about five leagues from the place where we had anchored the night before, our depth of water gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally decreaſed to ſix fathom; and not chuſing to go into leſs, as it was tide of flood, and the wind blew right up the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, I came to an anchor about the middle of the channel, which is near eleven miles over; after which I ſent two boats out to ſound, one on one ſide, and the other on the other.</p>
                        <p>The boats not having found above three feet more water than we were now in, I determined to go no farther with the ſhip, but to examine the head of the bay in the boats; for, as it appeared to run a good way inland, I thought this a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opportunity to examine the interior part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and its produce.</p>
                        <p>At day-break, therefore, I ſet out in the pinnace and long-boat,
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:013324_0249_0F8FFBBCEC824D68"/>
accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Tupia; and we found the inlet end in a river, about nine miles above the ſhip: into this river we entered with the firſt of the flood, and within three miles found the water perfectly freſh. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had proceeded more than one third of that diſtance, we found an Indian town, which was built upon a ſmall bank of dry ſand, but intirely ſurrounded by a deep mud, which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the inhabitants might conſider as a defence. Theſe people as ſoon as they ſaw us, thronged to the banks, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited us on ſhore. We accepted the invitation, and made them a viſit notwithſtanding the mud. They received us with open arms, having heard of us from our good old friend Toiava; but our ſtay could not be long, as we had other objects of curioſity in view. We proceeded up the river till near noon, when we were fourteen miles within its entrance; and then finding the face of the country to continue nearly the ſame, without any alteration in the courſe of the ſtream, which we had no hope of tracing to its ſource, we landed on the weſt-ſide, to take a view of the lofty trees which every where adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its banks. They were of a kind that we had ſeen before, though only at a diſtance, both in Poverty Bay and Hawke's Bay. Before we had walked an hundred yards into the wood, we met with one of them which was nineteen feet eight inches in the girt, at the height of 6 feet above the ground: having a quadrant with me, I meaſured its height from the root to the firſt branch, and found it to be eighty-nine feet: it was as ſtrait as an arrow, and tapered but very little in proportion to its height; ſo that I judged there were three hundred and fifty-ſix feet of ſolid timber in it, excluſive of the branches. As we advanced, we ſaw many others that were ſtill larger; we cut down a young one, and the wood proved heavy and ſolid, not fit for maſts, but ſuch as would make the fineſt plank in the world. Our carpenter, who was with us, ſaid that the timber reſembled that of pitch-pine, which is lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by tapping; and poſſibly ſome ſuch method might be found to lighten theſe, and they would then be ſuch maſts as no country in Europe can produce. As the wood was ſwam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, we could not range far; but we found many ſtout trees of other kinds, all of them utterly unknown to us, ſpecimens of which we brought away.</p>
                        <p>The river at this height is as broad as the Thames at Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, and the tide of flood as ſtrong; it is not indeed quite ſo deep, but has water enough for veſſels of more than a middle ſize, and a bottom of mud, ſo ſoft that nothing could take damage by running aſhore.</p>
                        <p>About three o'clock, we reimbarked, in order to return with the firſt of the ebb, and named the river the THAMES, it having ſome reſemblance to our own river of that name.
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:013324_0250_0F8FFBBE16435F10"/>
In our return, the inhabitants of the village where we had been aſhore, ſeeing us take another channel, came off to us in their canoes, and trafficked with us in the moſt friendly manner, till they had diſpoſed of the few trifles they had. The tide of ebb juſt carried us out of the narrow part of the river, into the channel that run up from the ſea, before it was dark; and we pulled hard to reach the ſhip, but meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the flood, and a ſtrong breeze at N. N. W. with ſhowers of rain, we were obliged to deſiſt; and about midnight, we run under the land, and came to a grappling, where we took ſuch reſt as our ſituation would admit. At break of day, we ſet forward again, and it was paſt ſeven o'clock before we reached the ſhip. We were all extremely tired, but thought ourſelves happy to be on board; for before nine it blew ſo hard that the boat could not have rowed ahead, and muſt therefore either have gone aſhore, or taken ſhelter under it.</p>
                        <p>About three o'clock, having the tide of ebb, we took up our anchor, made ſail, and plied down the river till eight in the evening, when we came to an anchor again: early in the morning we made ſail with the firſt ebb, and kept plying till the flood obliged us once more to come to an anchor. As we had now only a light breeze, I went in the pinnace, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by Dr. Solander, to the weſtern ſhore; but I ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy of notice.</p>
                        <p>When I left the ſhip, many canoes were about it; Mr. Banks therefore choſe to ſtay on board, and traffic with the natives: they bartered their clothes and arms, chiefly for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and behaved with great friendſhip and honeſty. But while ſome of them were below with Mr. Banks, a young man who was upon the deck ſtole a half minute glaſs, which was in the binnacle, and was detected juſt as he was carrying it off. Mr. Hicks, who was commanding officer on board, took it into his head to puniſh him, by giving him twelve laſhes with a cat-o'nine-tails; and accordingly ordered him to be taken to the gang-way, and tied up to the ſhrouds. When the other Indians who were on board ſaw him ſeized, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to reſcue him; and being reſiſted, called for their arms, which were handed up from the canoes, and the people of one of them attempted to come up the ſhip's ſide. The tumult was heard by Mr. Banks, who, with Tupia, came haſtily upon the deck to ſee what had happened. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians ran immediately to Tupia, who, finding Mr. Hicks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable, could only aſſure them, that nothing was intended againſt the life of their companion; but that it was neceſſary he ſhould ſuffer ſome puniſhment for his offence, which being explained to them, they ſeemed to be ſatisfied. The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was then inflicted, and as ſoon as the criminal was unbound, an old man among the ſpectators, who was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:013324_0251_0F8FFBBF07AE6670"/>
to be his father, gave him a hearty beating, and ſent him down into his canoe. All the canoes then dropped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern, and the people ſaid that they were afraid to come any more near the ſhip: after much perſuaſion, however, they ventured back again, but their cheerful confidence was at an end, and their ſtay was ſhort; they promiſed indeed, at their departure, to return with ſome fiſh, but we ſaw no more of them.</p>
                        <p>On the 23, the wind being contrary, we kept plying down the river, and at ſeven in the evening, got without the N. W. point of the iſlands lying on the weſt ſide of it. The weather being bad, night coming on, and having land on every ſide of us, I thought it moſt adviſeable to tack, and ſtretch in under the point, where we anchored in nineteen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom. At five in the morning, of the 24th, we weighed, and made ſail to the N. W. under our courſes and double reefed top-ſails, the wind being at S. W. by W. and W. S. W. a ſtrong gale and ſqually. As the gale would not permit us to come near the land, we had but a ſlight and diſtant view of it from the time we got under ſail till noon, during our run of twelve leagues, but we never once loſt ſight of it. At this time, our latitude, by obſervation, was 36° 15′ 20″, we were not above two miles from a point of land on the main, and three leagues and half from a very high iſland, which bore N. E. by E.: in this ſituation we had twenty-ſix fathom water: the fartheſt point on the main that we could ſee bore N. W. but we could perceive ſeveral ſmall iſlands lying to the north of that direction. The point of land of which we were now a-breaſt, and which I called POINT RODNEY, is the N. W. extremity of the river Thames; for under that name I comprehend the deep bay which terminates in the freſh water ſtream, and the N. E. extremity is the promontory which we paſſed when we entered it, and which I called CAPE COLVILLE, in honour of the Right Honour able Lord Colville.</p>
                        <p>Cape Colville lies in latitude 36° 26′, longitude 194° 27′; it riſes directly from the ſea to a conſiderable height, and is remarkable for a lofty rock, which ſtands to the pitch of the point, and may be diſtinguiſhed at a very great diſtance. From the ſouth point of this Cape the river runs in a direct line S. by E. and is no where leſs than three leagues broad for the diſtance of fourteen leagues above the Cape, and there it is contracted to a narrow ſtream, but continues the ſame courſe through a low flat country, or broad valley, which lies parallel with the ſea coaſt, and the end of which we could not ſee. On the eaſt ſide of the broad part of this river the land is tolerably high and hilly; on the weſt ſide it is rather low, but the whole is covered with verdure and
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:013324_0252_0F8FFBBF58356340"/>
wood, and has the appearance of great fertility, though there were but a few ſmall ſpots which had been cultivated. At the entrance of the narrow part of the river the land is covered with mangroves and other ſhrubs; but farther, there are immenſe woods of perhaps the fineſt timber in the world, of which ſome account has already been given: in ſeveral places the wood extends to the very edge of the water, and where it is at a little diſtance, the intermediate ſpace is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhy, like ſome parts of the banks of the Thames in England: it is probable that the river contains plenty of fiſh, for we ſaw poles ſtuck up in many places to ſet nets for catching them, but of what kind I do not know. The greateſt depth of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that we found in this river was ſix and twenty fathom, which gradually decreaſed to one fathom and an half: in the mouth of the freſh water ſtream it is from four to three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, but there are large flats and ſand banks lying before it. A ſhip of moderate draught may, notwithſtanding, go a long way up this river with a flowing tide, for it riſes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly near ten feet, and at the full and change of the moon, it is high water about nine o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Six leagues within Cape Colville, under the eaſtern ſhore, are ſeveral ſmall iſlands, which, together with the main, ſeem to form good harbours; and oppoſite to theſe iſlands, under the weſtern ſhore, lie other iſlands, by which it is alſo probable that good harbours may be formed: but if there are no harbours about this river, there is good anchoring in every part of it where the depth of water is ſufficient, for it is defended from the ſea by a chain of iſlands of different ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which lie croſs the mouth of it, and which I have, for that reaſon, called BARRIER ISLANDS, they ſtretch N. W. and S. E. ten leagues. The ſouth end of the chain lies N. E. between two and three leagues from Cape Colville; and the north end lies N. E. four leagues and an half from Point Rodney. Point Rodney lies W N. W. nine leagues from Cape Colville, in latitude 36° 15′ S. longitude 184° 53′ W.</p>
                        <p>The natives reſiding about this river do not appear to be numerous, conſidering the great extent of the country. But they are a ſtrong, well-made, and active people, and all of them paint their bodies with red oker and oil from head to foot, which we had not ſeen before. Their canoes were large and well built, and adorned with carving, in as good a taſte as any that we had ſeen upon the coaſt.</p>
                        <p>We continued to ſtand along the ſhore till night, with the main land on one ſide, and iſlands on the other, and then anchored in a bay, with fourteen fathom and a ſandy bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. We had no ſooner come to an anchor, than we tried our lines, and in a ſhort time caught near one hundred fiſh, which the people called Sea-bream; they weighed from ſix
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:013324_0253_0F8FFBC00D39C1E8"/>
to eight pounds a piece, and conſequently would ſupply the whole ſhip's company with food for two days. From the ſucceſs of our lines here, we called the place BREAM BAY: the two points that form it lie north and ſouth, five leagues from each other; it is every where of a good breadth, and between three and four leagues deep: at the bottom of it there appears to be a river of freſh water. The north head of the bay, called BREAM HEAD, is high land, and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for ſeveral pointed rocks, which ſtand in a range upon the top of it: it may alſo be known by ſome ſmall iſlands which lie before it, called the HEN AND CHICKENS, one of which is high, and terminates in two peaks. It lies in lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 35° 46′ S., and at the diſtance of ſeventeen leagues and an half from Cape Colville, in the direction of N. 41 W.</p>
                        <p>The land between Point Rodney and Bream Head, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of ten leagues, is low, and wooded in tufts, with white ſand banks between the ſea and the firm land. We ſaw no inhabitants, but many fires in the night, and where there are fires, there are always people.</p>
                        <p>At day-break, on the 25th, we left the bay, and ſteered along ſhore to the northward: we found the variation of the compaſs to be 12° 42′ E. At noon, our latitude was 36° 36′ S., Bream Head bore ſouth, diſtant ten miles; and we ſaw ſome ſmall iſlands, to which I gave the name of the POOR KNIGHTS, at N. E. by N. diſtant three leagues; the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt land in ſight bore N. N. W.: we were in this place at the diſtance of two miles from the ſhore, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d had twenty-ſix fathom water.</p>
                        <p>The country appeared low, but well covered with wood: we ſaw ſome ſtraggling houſes, three or four fortified towns, and near them a large quantity of cultivated land.</p>
                        <p>In the evening, ſeven large canoes came off to us, with about two hundred men: ſome of them came on board, and ſaid that they had heard of us. To two of them, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be Chiefs, I gave preſents; but when theſe were gone out of the ſhip, the others became exceedingly trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Some of thoſe in the canoes began to trade, and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their cuſtom, to cheat, by refuſing to deliver what had been bought, after they had received the price: among theſe was one who had received an old pair of black breeches, which, upon a few ſmall ſhot being fired at him, he threw into the ſea. All the boats ſoon after paddled off to ſome diſtance, and when they thought they were out of reach, they began to defy us, by ſinging their ſong and brandiſhing their weapons. We thought it adviſeable to intimidate them, as well for their ſakes as our own, and therefore fired firſt ſome ſmall arms, and then round ſhot over their heads; the laſt put them in a terrible fright,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:013324_0253_0F8FFBC00D39C1E8"/>
though they received no damage, except by over-heating themſelves in paddling away, which they did with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expedition.</p>
                        <p>In the night we had variable light airs; but towards the morning a breeze ſprung up at S. and afterwards at S. E. with which we proceeded ſlowly to the northward, along the ſhore.</p>
                        <p>Between ſix and ſeven o'clock two canoes came off, and told us that they had heard of yeſterday's adventure, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which the people came on board, and traded very quietly and honeſtly for whatever they had: ſoon after two canoes came off from a more diſtant part of the ſhore; theſe were of a much larger ſize, and full of people, when they came near, they called off the other canoes which were along ſide of the ſhip, and after a ſhort conference they all came up together. The ſtrangers appeared to be perſons of a ſuperior rank; their canoes were well carved with many ornaments, and they had with them a great variety of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons: they had patoo-patoos both of ſtone and whalebone, upon which they appeared to ſet a great value; they had alſo ribs of whale, of which we had before ſeen imitations in wood, carved and adorned with tufts of dog's hair. Their complexions were browner than thoſe of the people we had ſeen to the ſouthward, and their bodies and faces were more marked with the black ſtains which they call Amoco: they had a broad ſpiral on each buttock; and the thighs of many of them were almoſt entirely black, ſome narrow lines only being left untouched, ſo that at firſt ſight they appeared to wear ſtriped breeches. With reſpect to the Amoco, every different tribe ſeemed to have a different cuſtom, for all the men, in ſome canoes, ſeemed to be almoſt covered with it, and thoſe in others had ſcarcely a ſtain, except on the lips, which were black in all of them without a ſingle exception. Theſe gentlemen, for a long time, refuſed to part with any of their weapons, whatever was offered for them; at laſt, however, one of them produced a piece of talc, wrought into the ſhape of an ax, and agreed to ſell it for a piece of cloth: the cloth was handed over the ſhip's ſide, but his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour immediately put off his canoes with the ax. We had recourſe to our uſual expedient, and fired a muſket ball over the canoe, upon which it put back to the ſhip, and the piece of cloth was returned; all the boats then went aſhore, without offering any further intercourſe.</p>
                        <p>At noon, the main land extended from S. by E. to N. W. by W. a remarkable point of land bearing W. diſtant four or five miles; at three we paſſed it, and I gave it the name of CAPE BRET, in honour of Sir Piercy. The land of this cape is conſiderably higher than any part of the adjacent coaſt: at
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:013324_0255_0F8FFBC0E1DFBCD8"/>
the point of it, is a high round hillock, and N. E. by N. at the diſtance of about a mile, is a ſmall high iſland or rock, which, like ſeveral that have already been deſcribed, was perforated quite through, ſo as to appear like the arch of a bridge. This cape, or at leaſt ſome part of it, is by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives called MOTUGOGOGO, and it lies in latitude 35° 10′ 30″ S. longitude 185° 25′ W. On the weſt ſide of it is a large and pretty deep bay, lying in S. W. by W. in which there appeared to be ſeveral ſmall iſlands: the point that forms the N. W. entrance lies W. ¼ N. at the diſtance of three or four leagues from Cape Bret, and I diſtinguiſhed it by the name of POINT POCOCKE. On the weſt ſide of the bay we ſaw ſeveral villages both upon iſlands and the main, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral very large canoes come off to us, full of people, who made a better appearance than any we had ſeen yet: they were all ſtout and well made; their hair, which was black, was tied up in a bunch on the crown of their heads, and ſtuck with white feathers. In each of the canoes were two or three chiefs, whoſe habits were of the beſt ſort of cloth, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with dog's ſkin, ſo as to make an agreeable appearance; moſt of theſe people were marked with the Amoco, like thoſe who had been alongſide of us before: their manner of trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was alſo equally fradulent; and the officers neglecting either to puniſh or fright them, one of the midſhipmen who had been defrauded in his bargain, had recourſe, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, to an expedient which was equally ludicrous and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere: he got a fiſhing line, and when the man who had cheated him was cloſe under the ſhip's ſide in his canoe, he heaved the lead with ſo good an aim that the hook caught him by the backſide; he then pulled the line, and the man holding back, the hook broke in the ſhank, and the beard was left ſticking in the fleſh.</p>
                        <p>During the courſe of this day, though we did not range more than ſix or eight leagues of the coaſt, we had along<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and on board the ſhip between four and five hundred of the natives, which is a proof that this part of the country is well inhabited.</p>
                        <p>At eight o'clock the next morning, we were within a mile of a group of iſlands which lie cloſe under the main, at the diſtance of two and twenty miles from Cape Bret, in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of N W. by W. ½ W. At this place, having but little wind, we lay about two hours, during which time ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral canoes came off, and ſold us ſome fiſh, which we called Cavalles, and for that reaſon I gave the ſame name to the iſlands. Theſe people were very inſolent, frequently threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening us, even while they were ſelling their fiſh; and when ſome more canoes came up, they began to pelt us with ſtones. Some ſmall ſhot were then fired, and hit one of them while he had a ſtone in his hand, in the very action of throwing it into
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:013324_0256_0F8FFBC187170488"/>
the ſhip: they did not, however, deſiſt, till ſome others had been wounded, and then they went away, and we ſtood off to ſea.</p>
                        <p>The wind being directly againſt us, we kept plying to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward till the 29th, when we had rather loſt than gained ground; I therefore bore up for a bay, which lies to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Cape Bret; at this time it was about two leagues to leeward of us; and about eleven o'clock we anchored under the ſouth weſt ſide of one of the many iſlands which line it on the ſouth eaſt, in four fathom and an half water; we ſhoaled our water to this depth all at once, and if this had not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened I ſhould not have come to an anchor ſo ſoon. The maſter was immediately ſent out with two boats to ſound, and he ſoon diſcovered that we had got upon a bank, which runs out from the north weſt end of the iſland, and that on the outſide of it there was from eight to ten fathom.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the natives, to the number of near four hundred, crouded upon us in their canoes, and ſome of them were admitted on board: to one, who ſeemed to be a chief, I gave a piece of broad cloth, and diſtributed ſome trifling pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents among the reſt. I perceived that ſome of theſe people had been about the ſhip when ſhe was off at ſea, and that they knew the power of our fire-arms, for the very ſight of a gun threw them into manifeſt confuſion: under this impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they traded very fairly; but the people in one of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes took the opportunity of our being at dinner to tow away our buoy: a muſket was fired over them without effect, we then endeavoured to reach them with ſome ſmall ſhot, but they were too far off: by this time they had got the buoy into their canoe, and we were obliged to fire a muſket at them with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>: this hit one of them, and they immediately threw the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> over board: a round ſhot was then fired over them, which ſtruck the water and went aſhore. Two or three of the canoes immediately landed their people, who ran about the beach, as we imagined, in ſearch of the ball. Tupia called to them, and aſſured them that while they were honeſt they ſhould be ſafe, and with a little perſuaſion many of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the ſhip, and their behaviour was ſuch as left us nor eaſon to ſuſpect that they intended to give us any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble.</p>
                        <p>After the ſhip was removed into deeper water, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſecured, I went with the pinnace and yawl, manned and armed, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and landed upon the iſland, which was about three quarters of a mile diſtant: we obſerved the canoes which were about the ſhip, did not follow us upon our leaving her, which we thought a good ſign; but we had no ſooner landed than they crouded to different parts of the iſland, and came on ſhore.
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:013324_0257_0F8FFBC3C7D89350"/>
We were in a little cove, and in a few minutes were ſurrounded by two or three hundred people, ſome ruſhing from behind the heads of the cove, and others appearing on the tops of the hills: they were all armed, but they came on in ſo confuſed and ſtraggling a manner that we ſcarcely ſuſpected they meant us any harm, and we were determined that hoſtilities ſhould not begin on our part. We marched towards them, and then drew a line upon the ſand, between them and us, which we gave them to underſtand they were not to paſs: at firſt they continued quiet, but their weapons were held ready to ſtrike, and they ſeemed to be rather irreſolute than peaceable. While we remained in this ſtate of ſuſpenſe, another party of Indians came up, and now growing more bold as their number in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, they began the dance and ſong, which are their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to a battle: ſtill, however, they delayed the attack, but a party ran to each of our boats, and attempted to draw them on ſhore; this ſeemed to be the ſignal, for the people about us at the ſame time began to preſs in upon our line: our ſituation was now become too critical for us to remain longer inactive, I therefore diſcharged my muſket, which was loaded with ſmall ſhot, at one of the forwardeſt, and Mr. Banks and two of the men fired immediately afterwards: this made them fall back in ſome confuſion, but one of the Chiefs, who was at the diſtance of about twenty yards, rallied them, and running forward waving his patoo-patoo, and calling loudly to his companions, led them to the charge. Dr. Solander, whoſe piece was not yet diſcharged, fired at this champion, who ſtopped ſhort upon feeling the ſhot, and then ran away with the reſt: they did not however diſperſe, but got together upon a riſing ground, and ſeemed only to want ſome leader of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to renew their attack. As they were now beyond the reach of ſmall ſhot, we fired with ball, but as none of them took place they ſtill continued in a body, and in this ſituation we remained about a quarter of an hour: in the mean time the ſhip, from whence a much greater number of Indians were ſeen than could be diſcovered in our ſituation, brought her broad-ſide to bear, and intirely diſperſed them, by firing a few ſhot over their heads. In this ſkirmiſh only two of the Indians were hurt with the ſmall ſhot, and not a ſingle life was loſt, which would not have been the caſe if I had not reſtrained the men, who, either from fear, or the love of miſchief, ſhewed as much impatience to deſtroy them as a ſportſman to kill his game. When we were in quiet poſſeſſion of our cove, we laid down our arms, and began to gather celery, which grew here in great plenty: after a little time we recollected to have ſeen ſome of the people hide themſelves in a cave of one of the rocks, we therefore went towards the place, when an old Indian, who proved to be the Chief that I had preſented

with a piece of broad cloth in the morning, came out with his wife, and his brother, and in a ſupplicating poſture put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under our protection. We ſpoke kindly to them, and the old man then told us that he had another brother, who was one of thoſe that had been wounded by the ſmall ſhot, and enquired with much ſolicitude and concern if he would die. We aſſured him that he would not, and at the ſame time put into his hand both a muſket ball, and ſome ſmall ſhot, telling him, that thoſe only who were wounded with the ball would die, and that the others would recover; at the ſame time aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring him, that if we were attacked again, we ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly defend ourſelves with the ball, which would wound them mortally. Having now taken courage, they came and ſat nown by us, and as a token of our perfect amity, we made them preſents of ſuch trifles as we happened to have about us.</p>
                        <p>Soon after we re-imbarked in our boats, and having rowed to another cove in the ſame iſland, climbed a neighbouring hill, which commanded the country to a conſiderable diſtance. The proſpect was very uncommon and romantic, conſiſting of innumerable iſlands, which formed as many harbours, where the water was as ſmooth as a mill-pool: we ſaw alſo many towns, ſcattered houſes, and plantations, the country being much more populous than any we had ſeen. One of the towns was very near us, from which many of the Indians advanced, taking great pains to ſhew us that they were unarmed, and in their geſtures and countenances expreſſing great meekneſs and humility. In the mean time ſome of our people, who, when the Indians were to be puniſhed for a fraud, aſſumed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable juſtice of a Lycurgus, thought fit to break into one of their plantations, and dig up ſome potatoes: for this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence I ordered each of them to be puniſhed with twelve laſhes, after which two of them were diſcharged; but the third, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting that it was no crime in an Engliſhman to plunder an Indian plantation, though it was a crime in an Indian to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud an Engliſhman of a nail, I ordered him back into his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, from which I would not releaſe him till he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived fix laſhes more.</p>
                        <p>On the 30th, there being a dead calm, and no probability of our getting to ſea, I ſent the maſter, with two boats to ſound the harbour; and all the forenoon had ſeveral canoes about the ſhip, who traded in a very fair and friendly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. In the evening we went aſhore upon the main, where the people received us very cordially; but found nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of notice.</p>
                        <p>In this bay we were detained by contrary winds and calms ſeveral days, during which time our intercourſe with the natives was continued in the moſt peaceable and friendly manner, they being frequently about the ſhip, and we aſhore,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:013324_0259_0F8FFBC5D17D14D0"/>
both upon the iſlands and the main. In one of our viſits to the continent, an old man ſhewed us the inſtrument they uſe in ſtaining their bodies, which exactly reſembled thoſe that were employed for the ſame purpoſe at Otaheite. We ſaw al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the man who was wounded in attempting to ſteal our buoy: the ball had paſſed thro' the fleſhy part of his arm, and grazed his breaſt; but the wound, under the care of nature, the beſt ſurgeon, and a ſimple diet, the beſt nurſe, was in a good ſtate, and ſeemed to give the patient neither pain nor apprehenſion. We ſaw alſo the brother of our old chief, who had been wounded with ſmall ſhot in our ſkirmiſh: they had ſtruck his thigh obliquely, and though ſeveral of them were ſtill in the fleſh, the wound ſeemed to be attended with neither danger nor pain. We found among their plantations the <hi>morus papy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifera,</hi> of which theſe people, as well as thoſe of Otaheite, make cloth; but here the plant ſeems to be rare, and we ſaw no pieces of the cloth large enough for any uſe but to wear by way of ornament in their ears.</p>
                        <p>Having one day landed in a very diſtant part of the bay, the people immediately fled, except one old man, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied us wherever we went, and ſeemed much pleaſed with the little preſents we made him. We came at laſt to a little fort, built upon a ſmall rock, which at high water was ſurrounded by the ſea, and acceſſible only by a ladder: we perceived that he eyed us with a kind of reſtleſs ſolicitude as we approached it, and upon our expreſſing a deſire to enter it, he told us that his wife was there: he ſaw that our curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity was not diminiſhed by this intelligence, and after ſome heſitation, he ſaid, if we would promiſe to offer no indecency he would accompany us: our promiſe was readily given, and he immediately led the way. The ladder conſiſted of ſteps faſtened to a pole, but we found the aſcent both difficult and dangerous. When we entered we found three women, who, the moment they ſaw us, burſt into tears of terror and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize: ſome kind words and a few preſents ſoon removed their apprehenſions, and put them into good humour. We examined the houſe of our old friend, and by his intereſt two others, which were all that the fortification contained, and having diſtributed a few more preſents, we parted with mutual ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>At four o'clock in the morning of the 5th of December, we weighed, with a light breeze, but it being variable with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent calms, we made little way. We kept turning out of the bay till the bay till the afternoon, and about ten o'clock we were ſuddenly becalmed, ſo that the ſhip would neither wear nor ſtay, and the tide of current ſetting ſtrong, ſhe drove towards land ſo faſt, that before any meaſures could be taken for her ſecurity, ſhe was within a cable's length of the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:013324_0260_0F8FFBC60828FD40"/>
we had thirteen fathom water, but the ground was ſo foul that we did not dare to drop our anchor; the pinnace therefore was immediately hoiſted out to take the ſhip in tow, and the men, ſenſible of their danger, exerting themſelves to the utmoſt, and a faint breeze ſpringing up off the land, we perceived with unſpeakable joy that ſhe made head way, after having been ſo near the ſhore that Tupia, who was not ſenſible of our hair's breadth eſcape, was at this very time converſing with the people upon the beach, whoſe voices were diſtinctly heard, notwithſtanding the roar of the breakers. We now thought all danger was over, but about an hour afterwards, juſt as the man in the chains had cried "ſeventeen fathom," the ſhip ſtruck. The ſhock threw us all into the utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation; Mr. Banks, who had undreſſed himſelf, and was ſtepping into bed, ran haſtily up to the deck, and the man in the chains called out "five fathom;" by this time, the rock on which we had ſtruck being to windward, the ſhip went off without having received the leaſt damage, and the water very ſoon deepened to twenty fathom.</p>
                        <p>This rock lies half a mile W. N. W. of the northermoſt or outermoſt iſland on the ſouth eaſt ſide of the bay. We had light airs from the land, whith calms, till nine o'clock the next morning, when we got out of the bay, and a breeze ſpringing up at N. N. W. we ſtood out to ſea.</p>
                        <p>This bay, as I have before obſerved, lies on the weſt ſide of Cape Bret, and I named it the BAY OF ISLANDS, from the great number of iſlands which line its ſhores, and form ſeveral harbours equally ſafe and commodious, where there is room and depth for any number of ſhipping. That in which we lay is on the ſouth weſt ſide of the ſouth weſtermoſt iſland, called MATUARO, on the ſouth eaſt ſide of the bay. I have made no accurate ſurvey of this bay, being diſcouraged by the time it would coſt me; I thought alſo that it was ſufficient to be able to affirm that it afforded us good anchorage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment of every kind. It was not the ſeaſon for roots, but we had plenty of fiſh, moſt of which, however, we purchaſed of the natives, for we could catch very little ourſelves either with net or line. When we ſhewed the natives our ſeine, which is ſuch as the King's ſhips are generally furniſhed with, they laughed at it, and in triumph produced their own, which was indeed of an enormous ſize, and made of a kind of graſs, which is very ſtrong: is was five fathom deep, and by the room it took up, it could not be leſs than three or four hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fathom long. Fiſhing indeed ſeems to be the chief buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life in this part of the country; we ſaw about all their towns a great number of nets, laid in heaps like hay-cocks, and covered with a thatch to keep them from the weather, and we ſcarcely entered a houſe where ſome of the people were not
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:013324_0261_0F8FFBC6CA33EC58"/>
employed in making them. The fiſh we procured here were ſharks, ſting-rays, ſea-bream, mullet, mackrel, and ſome others.</p>
                        <p>The inhabitants in this bay are far more numerous than in any other part of the country that we had before viſited; it did not appear to us that they were united under one head, and though their towns were fortified, they ſeemed to live together in perfect amity.</p>
                        <p>It is high water in this bay at the full and change of the moon, about eight o'clock, and the tide then riſes from ſix to eight feet perpendicularly. It appears, from ſuch obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations as I was able to make of the tides upon the ſea-coaſt, that the flood comes from the ſouthward; and I have reaſon to think that there is a current which comes from the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſets along the ſhore to the S. E. or S. S. E. as the land happens to lie.</p>

                        <p>ON Thurſday the 7th of December, at noon, Cape Bret bore S. S. E. ½ E. diſtant ten miles, and our latitude, by obſervation, was 34° 59′ S.; ſoon after we made ſeveral obſervations of the ſun and moon, the reſult of which made our longitude 185° 36′ W. The wind being againſt us, we had made but little way. In the afternoon, we ſtood in ſhore, and fetched cloſe under the Cavalles, from which iſlands the main trends W. by N.: ſeveral canoes put off and followed us, but a light breeze ſpringing up, I did not chuſe to wait for them. I kept ſtanding to the W. N. W. and N. W. till the next morning ten o'clock, when I tacked and ſtood in for the ſhore, from which we were about five leagues diſtant. At noon the weſtermoſt land in ſight bore W. by S. and was about four leagues diſtant. In the afternoon, we had a gentle breeze to the weſt, which in the evening came to the ſouth, and continuing ſo all night, by day-light brought us pretty well in with the land, ſeven leagues to the weſtward of the Cavalles, where we found a deep bay running in S. W. by W. and W. S. W. the bottom of which we could but juſt ſee, and there the land appeared to be low and level. To this bay, which I called DOUBTLESS BAY, the entrance is formed by two points, which lie W. N. W. and E. S. E. and are five miles diſtant from each other. The wind not permitting us to look in here, we ſteered for the weſtermoſt land in ſight, which bore from us W. N. W. about three leagues, but before we got the length of it it fell calm.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="235" facs="unknown:013324_0262_0F8FFBC7EBC663F0"/>
While we lay becalmed, ſeveral canoes came off to us, but the people having heard of our guns, it was not without great difficulty that they were perſuaded to come under our ſtern: after having bought ſome of their cloaths, as well as their fiſh, we began to make enquiries concerning their country, and learnt, by the help of Tupia, that, at the diſtance of three days rowing in their canoes, at a place called MOORE-WHENNUA, the land would take a ſhort turn to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and from thence extend no more to the weſt. This place we concluded to be the land diſcovered by Taſman, which he called CAPE MARIA VAN DIEMEN, and finding theſe people ſo intelligent, we inquired farther, if they knew of any country beſides their own: they anſwered, that they had never viſited any other, but that their anceſtors had told them, that to the N. W. by N. or N. N. W. there was a country of great extent, called. ULIMAROA, to which ſome people had ſailed in a very large canoe; that only part of them returned, and reported, that after a paſſage of a month they had ſeen a country where the people eat hogs. Tupia then enquired whether theſe adventurers brought any hogs with them when they returned; they ſaid no: then, replied Tupia, your ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is certainly falſe, for it cannot be believed that men who came back from an expedition without hogs, had ever viſited a country where hogs were to be procured. It is however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, notwithſtanding the ſhrewdneſs of Tupia's objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that when they mentioned hogs it was not by deſcription but by name, calling them <hi>Booah,</hi> the name which is given them in the South-ſea iſlands; but if the animal had been wholly unknown to them, and they had had no communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the people to whom it was known, they could not poſſibly have been acquainted with the name.</p>
                        <p>About ten o'clock at night, a breeze ſprung up at W. N. W. with which we ſtood off north; and at noon the next day, the Cavalles bore S. E. by E. diſtant eight leagues; the entrance of Doubtleſs Bay S. by W. diſtant three leagues; and the north weſt extremity of the land in ſight, which we judged to be the main, bore N. W. by W.: our latitude by obſervation was 34° 44′ S. In the evening, we found the variation to be 12° 41′ E. by the azimuth, and 12° 40′ by the amplitude.</p>
                        <p>Early in the morning, we ſtood in with the land, ſeven leagues to the weſtward of Doubtleſs Bay, the bottom of which is not far diſtant from the bottom of another large bay, which the ſhore forms at this place, being ſeparated only by a low neck of land, which juts out into a peninſula that I have called KNUCKLE POINT. About the middle of this bay, which we called SANDY BAY, it is a high mountain, ſtanding upon a diſtant ſhore, to which I gave the name of MOUNT CAMEL. The latitude here is 34° 51′ S. and longitude 186°
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:013324_0263_0F8FFBC8533E6C10"/>
50′. We had twenty-four and twenty-five fathom water, with a good bottom; but there ſeems to be nothing in this bay that can induce a ſhip to put into it; for the land about it is utterly barren and deſolate, and, except Mount Camel, the ſituation is low: the ſoil appears to be nothing but white ſand, thrown up in low irregular hills and narrow ridges, lying parallel with the ſhore. But barren and deſolate as this place is, it is not without inhabitants: we ſaw one village on the weſt ſide of Mount Camel, and another on the eaſt ſide; we ſaw alſo five canoes full of people, who pulled after the ſhip, but could not come up with us. At nine o'clock, we tacked and ſtood to the northward; and at noon the Cavalles bore S. E. by E. diſtant thirteen leagues; the north extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the land in ſight, making like an iſland, bore N. W. ¼ N. diſtant nine leagues; and Mount Camel bore S. W. by S. diſtance ſix leagues.</p>
                        <p>The wind being contrary, we kept plying northward till five o'clock in the evening of the 12th, when, having made very little way, we tacked and ſtood to the N. E. being two leagues to the northward of Mount Camel, and about a mile and an half from the ſhore, in which ſituation we had two and twenty fathom water.</p>
                        <p>At ten it began to blow and rain, which brought us under double reefed topſails; at twelve, we tacked and ſtood to the weſtward till ſeven the next morning, when we tacked and ſtood again to the N. E. being about a mile to windward of the place where we tacked laſt night. Soon after it blew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had at N. N. W. with heavy ſqualls and much rain, which brought us under our courſes, and ſplit the main topſail; ſo that we were obliged to unbend it and bend another: at ten it became more moderate, and we ſet the topſails, double reefed: at noon, having ſtrong gales and heavy weather, we tacked and ſtood to the weſtward, and had no land in ſight for the firſt time ſince we had been upon this coaſt.</p>
                        <p>We had now ſtrong gales at W. and W. S. W.; and at half an hour paſt three we tacked and ſtood to the northward. Soon after, a ſmall iſland lying off Knuckle Point bore S. ½ W. diſtant half a league. In the evening, having ſplit the ſore and mizen topſails, we brought the ſhip under her courſes; and at midnight, we wore, and ſtood to the ſouthward till five in the morning; when we tacked and ſtood to the N. W. and ſaw land bearing ſouth, at the diſtance of eight or nine leagues; by this we diſcovered that we had fallen much to the leeward ſince yeſterday morning. At noon, our latitude by obſervation was 34° 6′.; and the ſame land which we had ſeen before to the N. W. now bore S. W. and appeared to be the northern extremity of the country. We had a large ſwell rolling in from the weſtward, and therefore concluded
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:013324_0264_0F8FFBC90982E408"/>
that we were not covered by any land in that quarter. At eight in the evening, we tacked and ſtood to the weſtward, with as much ſail as we could bear; and at noon the next day, we were in latitude 34° 10′, longitude 185° 45′ W. and by eſtimation about ſeventeen leagues from the land, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our utmoſt endeavours to keep in with it.</p>
                        <p>On the 16th, at ſix in the morning, we ſaw land from the maſt-head, bearing S. S. W.; and at noon it bore S. by W. diſtant fourteen leagues: while we were ſtanding in for the ſhore we ſounded ſeveral times, but had no ground with ninety fathom, at eight we tacked in a hundred and eight fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, at about three or four miles from the ſhore, which was the ſame point of land that we had to the N. W. before we were blown off. At noon it bore S. W. diſtant about three miles; Mount Camel bore S. by E. diſtant about eleven leagues, and the weſtermoſt land in ſight bore S. 75 W.; the latitude by obſervation was 34° 20′ S. At four o'clock we tacked and ſtood in ſhore, in doing which, we met with a ſtrong rippling, and the ſhip fell faſt to leeward, which we imputed to a current ſetting eaſt. At eight, we tacked and ſtood off till eight the next morning; when we tacked and ſtood in, being about ten leagues from the land: at noon, the point of land which we were near the day before, bore S. S. W. diſtant five leagues. The wind ſtill continued at weſt; and at ſeven o'clock, we tacked in thirty-five fathom, when the point of land which has been mentioned before, bore N. W. by N. diſtant four or five miles; ſo that we had not gained one inch to windward the laſt twenty-four hours, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed our opinion that there was a current to the eaſtward. The point of land I called NORTH CAPE, it being the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern extremity of this country. It lies in latitude 34° 22′ S. longitude 186° 55′ W. and thirty-one leagues diſtant from Cape Bret, in the direction of N. 63 W. It forms the north point of Sandy Bay, and is a peninſula jutting out N. E. about two miles, and terminating in a bluff head that is flat at the top. The iſthmus which joins this head to the main land is very low, and for that reaſon the land of the cape, from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſituations, has the appearance of an iſland. It is ſtill more remarkable when it is ſeen from the ſouthward, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a high round iſland at the S. E. point of the cape; but this alſo is a deception; for what appears to be an iſland is a round hill, joined to the cape, by a low narrow neck of land. Upon the cape we ſaw a hippah, or village, and a few inhabitants; and on the ſouth eaſt ſide of it there appears to be anchorage, and good ſhelter from the ſouth weſt and north weſt winds.</p>
                        <p>We continued to ſtand off and on, making N. W, till noon on the 21ſt, when North Cape bore S. 39 E. diſtant thirty-eight leagues. Our ſituation varied only a few leagues till the
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:013324_0265_0F8FFBC9D908E7B0"/>
23d, when, about ſeven o'clock in the evening, we ſaw land from the maſt-head, bearing S. ½ E. At eleven the next morning, we ſaw it again, bearing S. S. E. at the diſtance of eight leagues: we now ſtood to the S. W.; and at four o'clock, the land bore S. E. by S. diſtant four leagues, and proved to be a ſmall iſland, with other iſlands or rocks, ſtill ſmaller, lying off the ſouth weſt end of it, and another lying off the north eaſt end, which were diſcovered by Taſman and called the Three Kings. The principal iſland lies in latitude 34° 12′ S. longitude, 187° 48′ W. and diſtant fourteen or fifteen leagues from North Cape, in the direction of W. 14 N. At midnight we tacked and ſtood to the N. E. till ſix the next morning, which was Chriſtmas day, when we tacked and ſtood to the ſouthward. At noon, the Three Kings bore E. 8 N. diſtant five or ſix leagues. The variation this morning by the azimuth was 11° 25′ E.</p>
                        <p>On the 26th we ſtood to the ſouthward cloſe upon a wind; and at noon were in latitude 35° 10′ S. longitude 188° 20′ W. the Three Kings bearing N. 26 W. diſtant twenty-two leagues. In this ſituation we had no land in ſight; and yet, by obſervation we were in the latitude of the Bay of Iſlands; and by my reckoning but twenty leagues to the weſtward of North Cape: from whence it appears, that the northern part of this iſland is very narrow; for otherwiſe we muſt have ſeen ſome part of the weſt ſide of it. We ſtood to the ſouthward till twelve at night, and then tacked and ſtood to the northward.</p>
                        <p>At four o'clock in the morning, the wind freſhened, and at nine blew a ſtorm; ſo that we were obliged to bring the ſhip to under her mainſail. Our courſe made good between noon this day and yeſterday was S. S. W. ½ W. diſtance eleven miles. The Three Kings bore N. 27 E. diſtant ſeventy-ſeven miles. The gale continued all this day, and till two the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when it fell, and began to veer to the ſouthward and S. W. where it fixed about four, when we made ſail and ſteered eaſt in for the land, under the fore-ſail and main-ſail; but the wind then riſing, and by eight o'clock being increaſed to a hurricane, with a prodigious ſea, we were obliged to take in the main-ſail; we then wore the ſhip, and brought her to with her head to the north weſt. At noon the gale was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abated, but we had ſtill heavy ſqualls. Our courſe made good this day, was north, a little eaſterly, twenty-nine miles; latitude by account 34° 50′ S. longitude 188° 27′ W. the Three Kings bore N. 41 E. diſtant 52 miles. At ſeven o'clock in the evening, the Wind being at S. W. and S. W. by W. with hard ſqualls, we wore and lay on the other tack; and at ſix the next morning ſpread more ſail. Our courſe and diſtance ſince yeſterday was E. by N. twenty-nine miles. In the afternoon we had hard ſqualls at S. W.; and at eight in
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:013324_0266_0F8FFBCC17285458"/>
the evening, wore and ſtood to the N. W. till five the next morning; and then wore and ſtood to the S. E. At ſix, we ſaw the land bearing N. E. diſtant about ſix leagues, which we judged to be Cape <hi>Maria Van Diemen,</hi> and which correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponded with the account that had been given of it by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. At midnight we wore and ſtood to the S. E. And on the next day at noon, Cape Maria Van Diemen bore N. E. by N. diſtant about five leagues. At ſeven in the evening, we tacked and ſtood to the weſtward, with a moderate breeze at S. W. by S. and S. W. Mount Camel then bore N. 83 E. and the northermoſt land, or Cape Maria Van Diemen, N. by W.; we were now diſtant from the neareſt land about three leagues, where we had ſomething more than forty fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom water; and it muſt be remarked, that Mount Camel, which, when ſeen on the other ſide, did not ſeem to be more than one mile from the ſea, ſeemed to be but little more when ſeen from this ſide; which is a demonſtration that the land here cannot be more than two or three miles broad, or from ſea to ſea.</p>
                        <p>At ſix o'clock in the morning of January the 1ſt, 1770, being New-year's day, we tacked and ſtood to the eaſtward, the Three Kings bearing N. W. by N. At noon we tacked again, and ſtood to the weſtward, being in latitude 34° 37′ S. the Three Kings bearing N. W. by N. at the diſtance of ten or eleven leagues; and Cape Maria Van Diemen N. 31 E. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant about four leagues and an half: in this ſituation we had fifty-four fathom water.</p>
                        <p>During this part of our navigation two particulars are very remarkable; in latitude 35 S. and in the midſt of ſummer, I met with a gale of wind, which for its ſtrength and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was ſuch as I had ſcarcely ever been in before, and we were three weeks in getting ten leagues to the weſtward, and five weeks in getting fifty leagues, for at this time it was ſo long ſince we paſſed Cape Bret. During the gale, we were happily at a conſiderable diſtance from the land, otherwiſe it is highly probable that we ſhould never have returned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our adventures.</p>
                        <p>At five o'clock in the evening, having a freſh breeze to the weſtward, we tacked and ſtood to the ſouthward: at this time North Cape bore E. ¾ N. and juſt open of a point that lies three leagues W. by N. from it.</p>
                        <p>This Cape, as I have obſerved before, is the northermoſt extremity of this country, and the eaſtermoſt point of a penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula, which runs out N. W. and N. W. by N. ſeventeen or eighteen leagues, and of which Cape Maria Van Diemen is the weſtermoſt point. Cape Maria lies in latitude 34° 30′ S. longitude 187° 18′ W.; and from this point the land trends away S. E. by S. and S. E. beyond Mount Camel, and is
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:013324_0267_0F8FFBCD39CA47F0"/>
every where a barren ſhore, conſiſting of banks of white ſand.</p>
                        <p>On the 2d at noon we were in latitude 35° 17′ S. and Cape Maria bore north, diſtant about ſixteen leagues, as near as we could gueſs; for we had no land in ſight, and did not dare to go nearer, as a freſh gale blew right on ſhore, with a rolling ſea. The wind continued at W. S. W. and S. W. with frequent ſqualls; in the evening we ſhortened ſail, and at midnight tacked, and made a trip to the N. W. till two in the morning, when we wore and ſtood to the ſouthward. At break of day we made ſail, and edged away, in order to make land; and at ten o'clock we ſaw it, bearing N. W. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be high, and at noon extended from N. to E. N. E. diſtant by eſtimation eight or ten leagues. Cape Maria then bore N. 2° 30′ W. diſtant thirty-three leagues; our latitude by obſervation was 36° 2′ S. About ſeven o'clock in the evening, we were within ſix leagues of it; but having a freſh gale upon it, with a rolling ſea, we hauled our wind to the S. E. and kept on that courſe cloſe upon the wind all night, ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral times, but having no ground with one hundred, and one hundred and ten fathom.</p>
                        <p>At eight o'clock the next morning, we were about five leagues from the land, and off a place which lies in latitude 36° 25′ and had the appearance of a bay or inlet. It bore eaſt; and in order to ſee more of it, we kept on our courſe till eleven o'clock, when we were not more than three leagues from it, and then diſcovered that it was neither inlet nor bay, but a tract of low land, bounded by higher lands on each ſide, which produced the deception. At this time we tacked and ſtood to the N. W.; and at noon the land was not diſtant more than three or four leagues. We were now in latitude 36° 31′ S. lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude 185° 50′ W. Cape Maria bore N. 25 W. diſtant for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four leagues and an half; ſo that the coaſt muſt be almoſt ſtrait, in the direction of S. S. E. ¾ E. and N. N. W. ¾ W. nearly. In about latitude 35° 45′ is ſome high land adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſea; to the ſouthward of which the ſhore is alſo high, and has the moſt deſolate and inhoſpitable appearance that can be imagined. Nothing is to be ſeen but hills of ſand, on which there is ſcarcely a blade of verdure; and a vaſt ſea impelled by the weſterly winds, breaking upon it in a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſurf, renders it not only forlorn, but frightful: complicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the idea of danger with deſolation, and impreſſing the mind at once with a ſenſe of miſery and death. From this place I ſteered to the northward, reſolving never more to come within the ſame diſtance of the coaſt, except the wind ſhould be very favourable indeed. I ſtood under a freſh ſail all the day, hoping to get an o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Our latitude by obſervation was 35° 10′ S.; and Cape Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria bore N. 10 E. diſtance forty-one miles. In the night the wind ſhifted from S. W. by S. to S. and blew freſh. Our courſe to the noon of the 5th was N. 75 W. diſtance eight miles.</p>
                        <p>At day-break on the 6th, we ſaw the land which we took to be Cape Maria, bearing N. N. E. diſtant eight or nine leagues: and on the 7th, in the afternoon, the land bore eaſt: and ſome time after, we diſcovered a turtle upon the water; but being awake, it dived inſtantly, ſo that we could not take it. At noon, the high land, which has juſt been mentioned, extended from N. to E. at the diſtance of five or ſix leagues; and in two places a flat gave it the appearance of a bay or inlet. The courſe that we made good the laſt four and twenty hours was S. 33 E. fifty-three miles; Cape Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria bearing N. 25 W. diſtant thirty leagues.</p>
                        <p>We ſailed within ſight of land all this day, with gentle gales between the N. E. and N. W.; and by the next noon had ſailed ſixty-nine miles, in the direction of S. 37 E.; our latitude by obſervation was 36° 39′ S. The land which on the fourth we had taken for a bay, now bore N. E. by N. diſtant five leagues and an half; and Cape Maria N. 29 W. forty-ſeven leagues.</p>
                        <p>On the 9th, we continued a ſouth eaſt courſe till eight o'clock in the evening, having run ſeven leagues ſince noon, with the wind at N. N. E. and N. and being within three or four leagues of the land, which appeared to be low and ſandy. I then ſteered S. E. by S. in a direction parallel with the coaſt, having from forty-eight to thirty-four fathom water, with a black ſandy bottom. At day-break the next morning, we found ourſelves between two and three leagues from the land, which began to have a better appearance, riſing in gentle ſlopes, and being covered with trees and herbage, We ſaw a ſmoke and a few houſes, but it appeared to be but thinly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited. At ſeven o'clock, we ſteered S. by E. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards S. by W. the land lying in that direction. At nine we were abreaſt of a point which riſes with an eaſy aſcent from the ſea to a conſiderable height: this point, which lies in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 37° 43′, I named WOODY HEAD. About eleven miles from this head, in the direction of S. W. ½ W. lies a very ſmall iſland, upon which we ſaw a great number of gannets, and which we therefore called GANNET ISLAND. At noon, a high craggy point bore E. N. E. diſtant about a league and a half, to which I gave the name of ALBETROSS POINT: it lies in latitude 38° 4′ S. longitude 184° 42′ W.; and is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſeven leagues in the direction of S. 17 W. from Woody Head. On the north ſide of this point the ſhore forms a bay, in which there apears to be anchorage and ſhelter for ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:013324_0269_0F8FFBCE4C11EB88"/>
Our courſe and diſtance for the laſt twenty-four hours was S. 37 E. ſixty-nine miles; and at noon this day Cape Maria bore N. 30 W. diſtant eighty-two leagues. Between twelve and one, the wind ſhifted at once from N. N. E. to S. S. W. with which we ſtood to the weſtward till four o'clock in the afternoon: and then tacked, and ſtood again in ſhore till ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; when we tacked again and ſtood to the weſtward till four o'clock in the afternoon; and then tacked, and ſtood again in ſhore till ſeven; when we tacked again and ſtood to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, having but little wind. At this time, Albetroſs Point bore N. E. diſtant near two leagues, and the ſouthermoſt land in ſight bore S. S. W. ½ W. being a very high mountain, and in appearance greatly reſembling the Pike of Teneriffe. In this ſituation we had thirty fathom water, and having but little wind all night, we tacked about four in the morning, and ſtood in for the ſhore. Soon after it fell calm; and being in forty-two fathom water, the people caught a few ſea-bream. At eleven a light breeze ſprung up from the weſt, and we made ſail to the ſouthward. We continued to ſteer S. by W. and S. S. W. along the ſhore, at the diſtance of about four leagues with gentle breezes from between N. W. and N. N. E. At ſeven in the evening we ſaw the top of the peak to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, above the clouds which concealed it below. And at this time, the ſouthermoſt land in ſight bore S. by W. the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation, by ſeveral azimuths which were taken both in the morning and the evening, appeared to be 14° 15′ eaſterly.</p>
                        <p>At noon on the 12th, we were diſtant about three leagues from the ſhore which lies under the peak, but the peak itſelf was wholly concealed by clouds: we judged it to bear about S. S. E.; and ſome very remarkable peaked iſlands, which lay under the ſhore, bore E. S. E. diſtant three or four leagues. At ſeven in the evening we founded, and had forty-two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, being diſtant from the ſhore between two and three leagues: we judged the peak to bear eaſt; and after it was dark, we ſaw fires upon the ſhore.</p>
                        <p>At five o'clock in the morning we ſaw, for a few minutes, the ſummit of the peak, towering above the clouds, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſnow. It now bore N. E.; it lies in latitude 39° 16′ S. longitude 185° 15′ W.; and I named it MOUNT EG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONT, in honour of the Earl. It ſeems to have a large baſe, and to riſe with a gradual aſcent; it lies near the ſea, and is ſurrounded by a flat country, of a pleaſant appearance, being clothed with verdure and wood, which renders it the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and the ſhore under it forms a large cape, which I named CAPE EGMONT. It lies S. S. W. ½ W. twenty-ſeven leagues diſtant from Albetroſs Point, and on the north ſide of it are two ſmall iſlands, which lie near a remarkable point on the main, that riſes to a conſiderable height in the form of
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:013324_0270_0F8FFBCF0F0E9188"/>
a ſugar loaf. To the ſouthward of the Cape, the land trends away S. E. by E. and S. S. E. and ſeems to be every where a bold ſhore. At noon Cape Egmont bore about N. E. and in this direction, at about four leagues from the ſhore, we had forty fathom of water. The wind during the reſt of the day was from W. to N. W. by W. and we continued to ſteer along the ſhore S. S. E. and S. E. by E. keeping at the diſtance of between two and three leagues. At half an hour after ſeven, we had another tranſient view of Mount Edgcombe, which bore N. 17 W. diſtant about ten leagues.</p>
                        <p>At five the next morning we ſteered S. E. by S. the coaſt inclining more ſoutherly; and in about half an hour, we ſaw land bearing S. W. by S. for which we hauled up. At noon the north weſt extremity of the land in ſight bore S. 63 W. and ſome high land, which had the appearance of an iſland lying under the main, bore S. S. E. diſtant five leagues. We were now in a bay, the bottom of which bearing ſouth we could not ſee, though it was clear in that quarter. Our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude by obſervation was 40° 27′ S. longitude 184° 39′ W. At eight in the evening, we were within two leagues of the land which we had diſcovered in the morning, having run ten leagues ſince noon: the land which then bore S. 63 W. now bore N. 59 W. at the diſtance of ſeven or eight leagues, and had the appearance of an iſland. Between this land and Cape Egmont lies the bay, the weſt ſide of which was our ſituation at this time, and the land here is of a conſiderable height, and diverſified by hill and valley.</p>

there being little wind, and what there was being variable, we were carried by the tide or current within two cable's length of the north weſt ſhore, where we had fifty-four fathom water, but by the help of our boats we got clear. Juſt at this time we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

We ſaw alſo ſome of the natives in a canoe croſs the bay, and a village ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated upon the point of an iſland which lies ſeven or eight miles within the entrance. At noon, we were the length of this iſland, but there being little wind, the boats were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ahead to row. About one o'clock, we hauled cloſe round the ſouth weſt end of the iſland; and the inhabitants of the village, which was built upon it, were immediately up in arms. About two we anchored in a very ſafe and convenient cove, on the north weſt ſide of the bay, and facing the ſouth weſt end of the iſland, in eleven fathom water, with ſoft ground, and moored with the ſtream anchor.</p>
                        <p>We were about four long cannon ſhot diſtant from the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage or Heppah, from which four canoes were immediately diſpatched, as we imagined to reconnoitre, and if they ſhould find themſelves able, to take us.

They rowed round the ſhip ſeveral times, with their uſual tokens of menace and defiance, and at laſt began the aſſault by throwing ſome ſtones: Tupia expoſtulated with them, but apparently of very little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and we began to fear that they would oblige us to fire at them, when a very old man in one of the boats expreſſed a deſire of coming on board. We gladly encouraged him in his deſign, a rope was thrown into his canoe, and ſhe was immediately along ſide of the ſhip: the old man roſe up, and prepared to come up the ſhip's ſide, upon which all the reſt expoſtulated with great vehemence againſt the attempt, and at laſt laid hold of him, and held him back; he adhered how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to his purpoſe with a calm but ſteady perſeverance, and having at length diſengaged himſelf, he came on board. We received him with all poſſible expreſſions of friendſhip and kindneſs, and after ſome time diſmiſſed him, with many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to his companions. As ſoon as he was returned on board his canoe, the people in all the reſt began to dance, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a token of enmity or friendſhip we could not certainly determine, for we had ſeen them dance in a diſpoſition both for peace and war. In a ſhort time, however, they retired to

their fort, and ſoon after I went on ſhore, with moſt of the gentlemen, at the bottom of the cove, a-breaſt of the ſhip.</p>
                        <p>We found a fine ſtream of excellent water, and wood in the greateſt plenty, for the land here was one foreſt of vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. As we brought the ſeine with us, we hauled it once or twice, and with ſuch ſucceſs that we caught near three hundred weight of fiſh of different ſorts, which was equally diſtributed among the ſhip's company.</p>
                        <p>At day-break, while we were buſy in careening the ſhip, three canoes came off to us, having on board above a hundred men, beſides everal of their women, which we were pleaſed to ſee, as it general it is a ſign of peace; but they ſoon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became very troubleſome, and gave us reaſon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſome miſchief from them to the people that were in our boats alongſide the ſhip. While we were in this ſituation, the long-boat was ſent aſhore with ſome water caſks, and ſome of the canoes attempting to follow her, we found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to intimidate them by firing ſome ſmall ſhot: we were at ſuch a diſtance that it was impoſſible to hurt them, yet our reproof had its effect, and they deſiſted from the purſuit. They had ſome fiſh in their canoes, which they now offered to ſell, and which, though it ſtunk, we conſented to buy: for this purpoſe a man in a ſmall boat was ſent among them, and they traded for ſome time very fairly. At length, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, one of them watching his opportunity, ſnatched at ſome paper which our market-man held in his hand, and miſſing it immediately put himſelf in a poſture of defence, flouriſhing his patoo-patoo, and making ſhew as if he was about to ſtrike; ſome ſmall ſhot then were fired at him from the ſhip, a few of which ſtruck him upon the knee: this put an end to our trade, but the Indians ſtill continued near the ſhip, rowing round her many times, and converſing with Tupia, chiefly concerning the traditions they had among them, with reſpect to the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of their country. To this ſubject they were led by the enquiries which Tupia had been directed to make, whether they had ever ſeen ſuch a veſſel as ours, or had ever heard that any ſuch had been upon their coaſt. Theſe enquiries were all anſwered in the negative, ſo that tradition has preſerved among them no memorial of Taſman; though, by an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation made this day, we find that we are only fifteen miles ſouth of Murderer's Bay, our latitude being 41° 5′ 32", and Murderer's bay, according to his account, being 40° 50′.</p>

Solander, Tupia, and ſome others, into another cove, about two miles diſtant from that in which the ſhip lay: in our way we ſaw ſomething floating upon the water, which we took for a dead ſeal, but upon rowing up to it, found it to be the body of a woman, which to all appearance had been dead ſome days. We proceeded to our cove, where we went on ſhore, and found a ſmall family of Indians, who appeared to be greatly terrified at our approach, and all ran away except one. A converſation between this perſon and Tupia ſoon brought back the reſt, except an old man and a child, who ſtill kept aloof, but ſtood peeping at us from the woods. Of theſe people our curioſity naturally led us to enquire after the body of the woman which we had ſeen floating upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and they acquainted us, by Tupia, that ſhe was a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who had died a natural death; and that, according to their cuſtom, they had tied a ſtone to the body, and thrown it into the ſea, which ſtone, they ſuppoſed, had by ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident been diſengaged.</p>
                        <p>This family, when we came aſhore, was employed in dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome proviſions: the body of a dog was at this time bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in their oven, and many proviſion baſkets ſtood near it. Having caſt our eyes careleſsly into one of theſe, as we paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, we ſaw two bones pretty cleanly picked, which did not ſeem to be the bones of a dog, and which, upon a nearer exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, we diſcovered to be thoſe of a human body. At this ſight we were ſtruck with horror, though it was only a confirmation of what we had heard many times ſince we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived upon this coaſt. As we could have no doubt but the bones were human, neither could we have any doubt but that the fleſh which covered them had been eaten. They were found in a proviſion baſket; the fleſh that remained appeared manifeſtly to have been dreſſed by fire, and in the griſtles at the end, were the marks of the teeth which had gnawed them; to put an end however to conjecture, founded upon circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and appearances, we directed Tupia to aſk what bones they were; and the Indians, without the leaſt heſitation, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, the bones of a man: they were then aſked what was become of the fleſh, and they replied that they had eaten it; but, ſaid Tupia, why did you not eat the body of the woman which we ſaw floating upon the water: the woman, ſaid they, died of diſeaſe; beſides, ſhe was our relation, and we eat only the bodies of our enemies, who are killed in battle. Upon enquiry who the man was whoſe bones we had found, they told us, that about five days before, a boat belonging to their enemies came into the bay, with many perſons on board, and that this man was one of ſeven whom they had killed. Though ſtronger evidence of this horrid practice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing among the inhabitants of this coaſt will ſcarcely be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:013324_0274_0F8FFBD3CCADBE28"/>
we have ſtill ſtronger to give. One of us aſked if they had any human bones with the fleſh remaining upon them, and upon their anſwering us that all had been eaten, we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to diſbelieve that the bones were human, and ſaid that they were the bones of a dog; upon which one of the Indians with ſome eagerneſs took hold of his own fore-arm, and thruſting it towards us, ſaid, that the bone which Mr. Banks held in his hand had belonged to that part of a human body; at the ſame time, to convince us that the fleſh had been eaten, he took hold of his own arm with his teeth, and made ſhew of eating: he alſo bit and gnawed the bone which Mr. Banks had taken, drawing it through his mouth, and ſhewing, by ſigns, that it had afforded a delicious repaſt; the bone was then returned to Mr. Banks, and he brought it away with him. Among the perſons of this family, there was a woman who had her arms, legs, and thighs frightfully cut in ſeveral places; and we were told that ſhe had inflicted the wounds upon herſelf, in token of her grief for the loſs of her huſband, who had been lately killed and eaten by their enemies, who had come from ſome place to the eaſtward, towards which the Indians pointed.</p>

                           </gap>ells, moſt exquiſitely tuned, and perhaps the diſtance, and the water between, might be no ſmall advantage to the ſound. Upon enquiry, we were informed that the birds here always began to ſing about two hours after midnight, and continuing their muſick till ſun-riſe, were, like our nightingales, ſilent the reſt of the day. In the forenoon, a ſmall canoe came off from the Indian village to the ſhip, and among thoſe that were in it, was the old man who had firſt come on board at our arrival in the bay. As ſoon as it came alongſide, Tupia renewed the converſation, that had paſſed the day before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their practice of eating human fleſh, during which they repeated what they had told us already; but, ſaid Tupia, where are the heads? do you eat them too? Of the heads, ſaid the old man, we eat only the brains, and the next time I come I will bring you ſome of them to convince you that what we have told you is truth. After ſome farther conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation between theſe people and Tupia, they told him that they expected their enemies to come very ſhortly, to revenge the death of the ſeven men whom they had killed and eaten.</p>
                        <p>On the 18th the Indians were more quiet than uſual, no canoe came near the ſhip, nor did we ſee any of them moving

on the ſhore, their fiſhing, and other uſual occupations being totally ſuſpended. We thought they expected an attack on this day, and therefore attended more diligently to what paſſed on ſhore; but we ſaw nothing to gratify our curioſity.</p>
                        <p>After breakfaſt, we went out in the pinnace, to take a view of the bay, which was of vaſt extent, and conſiſted of numberleſs ſmall harbours and coves, in every direction: we confine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>our excurſion however to the weſtern ſide, and the country being an impenetrable foreſt where we landed, we could ſee nothing worthy of notice: we killed, however, a good number of ſhaggs, which we ſaw ſitting upon their neſts in the trees, and which, whether roaſted or ſtewed, we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as very good proviſion. As we were returning, we ſaw a ſingle man in a canoe fiſhing; we rowed up to him, and to our great ſurpriſe he took not the leaſt notice of us, but even when we were alongſide of him, continued to follow his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, without adverting to us any more than if we had been inviſible. He did not, however, appear to be either ſullen or ſtupid: we requeſted him to draw up his net, that we might examine it, and he readily complied: It was of a circular form, extended by two hoops, and about ſeven or eight-feet in diameter: the top was open, and ſea-ears were faſtened to the bottom as a bait: this he let down ſo as to lay upon the ground, and when he thought fiſh enough were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled over it, he drew it up by a very gentle and even mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo that the fiſh roſe with it, ſcarcely ſenſible that they were lifted, till they came very near the ſurface of the water, and then were brought out in the net by a ſudden jerk. By this ſimple method he had caught abundance of fiſh, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are ſo plenty in this bay, that the catching them requires neither much labour nor art.</p>
                        <p>This day ſome of our people found in the ſkirts of the wood, near a hole or oven, three human hip-bones, which they brought on board; a farther proof that theſe people eat human fleſh: Mr. Monkhouſe, our ſurgeon, alſo brought on board, from a place where he ſaw many deſerted houſes, the hair of a man's head, which he had found, among many other things, tied up to the branches of trees.</p>
                        <p>In the morning of the 19th, we ſet up the armourer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>In the morning of the 20th, our old man kept his promiſe, and brought on board four of the heads of the ſeven people
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:013324_0276_0F8FFBD507E23FE0"/>
who had been ſo much the ſubject of our enquiries: the hair and fleſh were entire, but we perceived that the brains had been extracted; the fleſh was ſoft, but had by ſome method been preſerved from putrefaction, for it had no diſagreeable ſmell. Mr. Banks purchaſed one of them, but they ſold it with great reluctance, and could not by any means be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to part with a ſecond; probably they may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as trophies, like the ſcalps in America, and the jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones in the iſlands of the South Seas. Upon examining the head which had been bought by Mr. Banks, we perceived that it had received a blow upon the temples, which had frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured the ſkull. This day we made another excurſion in the pinnace, to ſurvey the bay, but we found no flat large enough for a potatoe garden, nor could we diſcover the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of cultivation: we met not a ſingle Indian, but found an excellent harbour; and about eight o'clock in the evening returned on board the ſhip.</p>
                        <p>On the 21ſt, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went a fiſhing with hook and line, and caught an immenſe quantity every where upon the rocks, in between four and five fathom water: the ſeine was hauled every night, and ſeldom failed to ſupply the whole ſhip's company with as much fiſh as they could eat. This day all the people had leave to go on ſhore at the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place, and divert themſelves as they ſhould think proper.</p>
                        <p>In the morning of the 22d, I ſet out again in the pinnace, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with a deſign to examine the head of the inlet, but after rowing about four or five leagues without ſo much as coming in ſight of it, the wind being contrary, and the day half ſpent, we went on ſhore on the ſouth eaſt ſide, to try what might be diſcovered from the hills.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander immediately employed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in botanizing near the beach, and I, taking a ſeaman with me, aſcended one of the hills: when I reached the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, I found a view of the inlet intercepted by hills, which in that direction roſe ſtill higher, and which were rendered inacceſſible by impenetrable woods; I was, however, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly compenſated for my labour, for I ſaw the ſea on the eaſtern ſide of the country, and a paſſage leading from it to that on the weſt, a little to the eaſtward of the entrance of the inlet where the ſhip now lay. The main land which lay on the ſouth eaſt ſide of this inlet, appeared to be a narrow ridge of very high hills, and to form part of the ſouth weſt ſide of the ſtreight; the land on the oppoſite ſide appeared to trend away eaſt as far as the eye could reach; and to the ſouth eaſt there appeared to be an opening to the ſea, which waſhed the eaſtern coaſt: on the eaſt ſide of the inlet alſo I ſaw ſome iſlands which I had before taken to be part of the main land.
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:013324_0277_0F8FFBD5CF0F2DC8"/>
Having made this diſcovery, I deſcended the hill, and as ſoon as we had taken ſome refreſhment, we ſet out on our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the ſhip. In our way, we examined the harbours and coves which lie behind the iſlands that I had diſcovered from the hill; and in this rout we ſaw an old village, in which there were many houſes that ſeemed to have been long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted: we alſo ſaw another village which was inhabited, but the day was too far ſpent for us to viſit it, and we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made the beſt of our way to the ſhip, which we reached between eight and nine o'clock at night.</p>
                        <p>The 23d I employed in carrying on a ſurvey of the place; and upon ſome of the iſlands where I landed, I ſaw many houſes which ſeemed to have been long deſerted, and no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any inhabitant.</p>
                        <p>On the 24th we went to viſit our friends at the Hippah, or village, on the point of the iſland near the ſhip's ſtation, who had come off to us at our firſt arrival in the bay. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us with the utmoſt confidence and civility, ſhewing us every part of their habitations, which were commodious and neat. The iſland or rock on which this town is ſituated, is divided from the main by a breach or fiſſure ſo narrow, that a man might almoſt leap from one to the other: the ſides of it are every where ſo ſteep as to render an artificial fortification of theſe people almoſt unneceſſary: there was, however, one ſlight palliſade, and one ſmall fighting ſtage, towards that part of the rock where acceſs was leaſt difficult.</p>
                        <p>The people here brought us out ſeveral human bones, the fleſh of which they had eaten, and offered them to ſale; for the curioſity of thoſe among us who had purchaſed them as memorials of the horrid practice which many, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reports of travellers, have profeſſed not to believe, had rendered them a kind of article of trade. In one part of this village we obſerved, not without ſome ſurprize, a croſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly like that of a crucifix; it was adorned with feathers, and upon our enquiring for what purpoſe it had been ſet up, we were told that it was a monument for a man who was dead: we had before underſtood that their dead were not buried, but thrown into the ſea; but to our enquiry, how the body of the man had been diſpoſed of, to whoſe memory this croſs had been erected, they refuſed to anſwer.</p>
                        <p>When we left theſe people, we went to the other end of the iſland, and there taking water, croſſed over to the main, where we ſaw ſeveral houſes, but no inhabitants, except a few in ſome ſtraggling canoes, that ſeemed to be fiſhing. After view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this place, we returned on board the ſhip to dinner.</p>
                        <p>During our viſit to the Indians this day, Tupia being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of our party, they had obſerved to be continually talking of guns, and ſhooting people: for this ſubject of their converſation
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:013324_0278_0F8FFBD6EF71EF60"/>
we could not at all account; and it had ſo much engaged our attention, that we talked of it all the way back, and even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we got on board the ſhip: we had perplexed ourſelves with various conjectures, which were all given up in their turn; but now we learnt, that on the 21ſt one of our officers, upon pretence of going out to fiſh, had rowed up to the Hippah, and that two or three canoes coming off towards his boat, his fears ſuggeſted that an attack was intended, in conſequence of which three muſkets were fired, one with ſmall ſhot, and two with ball, at the Indians, who retired with the utmoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, having probably come out with friendly intentions, for ſuch their behaviour both before and afterwards expreſſed, having no reaſon to expect ſuch treatment from people who had always behaved to them not only with humanity, but kindneſs, and to whom they were not conſcious of having given offence.</p>
                        <p>On the 25th I made another excurſion along the coaſt, in the pinnace, towards the mouth of the inlet, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and going on ſhore at a little cove, to ſhoot ſhaggs, we fell in with a large family of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, whoſe cuſtom it is to diſperſe themſelves among the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent creeks and coves, where fiſh is to be procured in the greateſt plenty, leaving a few only in the Hippah, to which the reſt repair in times of danger. Some of theſe people came out a good way to meet us, and gave us an invitation to go with them to the reſt of their party, which we readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. We found a company of about thirty men, women and children, who received us with all poſſible demonſtrations of friendſhip. We diſtributed among them a few ribands and beads, and in return, received the kiſſes and embraces of both ſexes, both young and old: they gave us alſo ſome fiſh, and after a little time we returned, much pleaſed with our new acquaintance.</p>
                        <p>In the morning of the 26th, I went again out in the boat, with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and entered one of the bays, which lie on the eaſt ſide of the inlet, in order to get another fight of the ſtreight, which paſſed between the eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and weſtern ſeas. For this purpoſe having landed at a convenient place, we climbed a hill of a very conſiderable height, from which we had a full view of it, with the land on the oppoſite ſhore, which we judged to be about four leagues diſtant; but as it was hazey in the horizon, we could not ſee far to the ſouth-eaſt: I reſolved however to ſearch the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage with the ſhip, as ſoon as I ſhould put to ſea. Upon the top of this hill we found a parcel of looſe ſtones, with which we erected a pyramid: and left in it ſome muſket balls, ſmall ſhot, beads, and other things, which we happened to have about us, that were likely to ſtand the teſt of time, and not
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:013324_0279_0F8FFBD74BC3DB28"/>
being of Indian workmanſhip, would convince any European who ſhould come to the place and pull it down, that other natives of Europe had been there before him. When this was done, we deſcended the hill, and made a comfortable meal of the ſhaggs and fiſh which our guns and lines had procured us, and which were dreſſed by the boat's crew in a place that we had appointed: in this place we found another Indian fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who received us, as uſual, with ſtrong expreſſions of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pleaſure, ſhewing us where to procure water, and doing us ſuch other good offices as were in their power. From this place we went to the town, of which the Indians had told us, who viſited us on the 19th; this, like that which we had ſeen before, was built upon a ſmall iſland or rock, ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult of acceſs, that we gratified our curioſity at the riſk of our necks. The Indians here alſo received us with open arms, carried us to every part of the place, and ſhewed us all that it contained: this town, like the other, conſiſted of between eighty and an hundred houſes, and had only one fighting-ſtage. We happened to have with us a few nails and ribands, and ſome paper, with which our gueſts were ſo gratified, that at our coming away they filled our boat with dried fiſh, of which we perceived they had laid up great quantities.</p>
                        <p>The 27th and 28th were ſpent in refitting the ſhip for the ſea, fixing a tranſom for the tiller, getting ſtones on board to put into the bottom of the bread room, to bring the ſhip more by the ſtern, in repairing the caſks, and catching fiſh.</p>
                        <p>On the 29th, we received a viſit from our old man, whoſe name we found to be TOPAA, and three other natives, with whom Tupia had much converſation. The old man told us, that one of the men who had been fired upon by the officer who had viſited their Hippah, under pretence of fiſhing, was dead; but to my great comfort I afterwards diſcovered that this report was not true, and that if Topaa's diſcourſes were taken literally, they would frequently lead us into miſtakes. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were ſeveral times on ſhore during the laſt two or three days, not without ſucceſs, but greatly circumſcribed in their walks by climbers of a moſt lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xuriant growth, which were ſo interwoven together, as to fill up the ſpace between the trees about which they grew, and render the woods altogether impaſſable. This day alſo I went on ſhore again myſelf, upon the weſtern point of the inlet, and from a hill of conſiderable height, I had a view of the coaſt to the N. W. The fartheſt land I could ſee in that quarter, was an iſland which has been mentioned before, at the diſtance of about ten leagues, lying not far from the main: between this Iſland and the place where I ſtood, I diſcovered cloſe under the ſhore, ſeveral other iſlands, forming many bays, in which there appeared to be good anchorage for ſhipping.
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:013324_0280_0F8FFBD8374BAF78"/>
After I had ſet off the different points for my ſurvey, I erected another pile of ſtones, in which I left a piece of ſilver coin, with ſome muſket balls and beads, and a piece of an old pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant flying on the top. In my return to the ſhip I made a viſit to ſeveral of the natives, whom I ſaw along the ſhore, and purchaſed a ſmall quantity of fiſh.</p>
                        <p>On the 30th, early in the morning, I ſent a boat to one of the iſlands for celery, and while the people were gathering it, about twenty of the natives, men, women, and children, landed near ſome empty huts: as ſoon as they were on ſhore, five or ſix of the women ſat down upon the ground together, and began to cut their legs, arms, and faces, with ſhells, and ſharp pieces of talk or jaſper, in a terrible manner. Our people underſtood that their huſbands had lately been killed by their enemies; but while they were performing this horrid ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the men ſet about repairing the huts, with the utmoſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence and unconcern.</p>
                        <p>The carpenter having prepared two poſts to be left as me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morials of our having viſited this place, I ordered them to be inſcribed with the ſhip's name, and the year and month; one of them I ſet up at the watering-place, hoiſting the Union flag upon the top of it; and the other I carried over to the iſland that lies neareſt the ſea, called by the natives MOTUARA. I went firſt to the village or Hippah, accompanied by Mr. Monkhouſe and Tupia, where I met with our old man, and told him and ſeveral others, by means of Tupia, that we were come to ſet up a mark upon the iſland, in order to ſhew to any other ſhip, which ſhould happen to come thither, that we had been there before. To this they readily conſented, and promiſed that they never would pull it down: I then gave ſomething to every one preſent; and to the old man I gave a ſilver three-pence, dated 1736, and ſome ſpike nails, with the King's broad arrow cut deep upon them; things which I tho't moſt likely to remain long among them: I then took the poſt to the higheſt part of the iſland, and after fixing it firmly in the ground, I hoiſted upon it the Union flag, and honoured this inlet with the name of QUEEN CHARLOTTE's SOUND, at the ſame time taking formal poſſeſſion of this and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent country, in the name and for the uſe of his Majeſty King George the Third. We then drank a bottle of wine to her Majeſty's health, and gave the bottle to the old man, who had attended us up the hill, and who was mightily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with his preſent.</p>
                        <p>While the poſt was ſetting up, we enquired of the old man concerning the paſſage into the eaſtern ſea, the exiſtence of which he confirmed; and then aſked him about the land to the S. W. of the ſtreight, where we were then ſituated: this land, he ſaid, conſiſted of two Whennuas, or iſland, which
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:013324_0281_0F8FFBDA67509EF8"/>
might be circumnavigated in a few days, and which he called TOVY POENAMMOO, the literal tranſlation of this word is, "the water of green talc:" and probably if we had underſtood him better, we ſhould have found that TOVY Poenammoo was the name of ſome particular place where they got the green talc or ſtone of which they make their ornaments and tools, and not a general name for the whole ſouthern diſtrict: he ſaid, there was alſo a third Whennua, on the eaſt ſide of the ſtreight, the circumnavigation of which would take up many moons: this he called EAHEINOMAUWE; and to the land on the borders of the ſtreight he gave the name of TIERA WITTF. Having ſet up our poſt, and procured this intelligence, we returned on board the ſhip, and brought the old man with us, who was attended by his canoe, in which, after dinner, he returned home.</p>
                        <p>On the 22ſt having compleated our woodding, and filled all our water caſks, I ſent out two parties, one to cut and make brooms, and another to catch fiſh, in the evening we had a ſtrong gale from the N. W. with ſuch a heavy rain that our little wild muſicians on ſhore ſuſpended their ſong, which till now we had conſtantly heard during the night, with a pleaſure which it was impoſſible to looſe without regret.</p>
                        <p>On the firſt the gale increaſed to a ſtorm, with heavy guſts from the high land, one of which broke the hawſer, that we had faſtened to the ſhore, and obliged us to let go another anchor. Towards midnight the gale became more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but the rain continued with ſuch violence, that the brook which had ſupplied us with water overflowed its banks, and carried away ten ſmall caſks which had been left there full of water, and notwithſtanding we ſearched the whole cove, we could never recover one of them.</p>
                        <p>On the third, as I intended to ſail the firſt opportunity, I went over to the Hippah on the eaſt ſide of the ſound, and purchaſed a conſiderable quantity of ſplit and half-dried fiſh, for ſea ſtores. The people here confirmed all that the old man had told us concerning the ſtreight and the country, and about noon I took leave of them: ſome of them ſeemed to be ſorry, and others glad, that we were going: the fiſh which I had bought they ſold freely, but there were ſome who ſhewed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſigns of diſapprobation. As we returned to the ſhip, ſome of us made an excurſion along the ſhore to the northward, to traffic with the natives for a farther ſupply of fiſh; in which, however, they had no great ſucceſs. In the evening, we got every thing off from the ſhore, as I intended to ſail in the morning, but the wind would not permit.</p>
                        <p>On the fourth, while we were waiting for a wind, we amuſed ourſelves with fiſhing, and gathering ſhells and ſeeds of various kinds; and early in the morning of the 5th, we
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:013324_0282_0F8FFBDB4BF6C268"/>
caſt off the hawſer, hove ſhort on the bower, and carried the kedge anchor out in order to warp the ſhip out of the cove, which having done about two o'clock in the afternoon, we hove up the anchor and got under ſail; but the wind ſoon failing, we were obliged to come to an anchor again a little above Motuara. When we were under ſail, our old man To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paa came on board to take leave of us, and as we were ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of making farther enquiries, whether any memory of Taſman had been preſerved among theſe people, Tupia was directed to aſk him whether he had ever heard that ſuch a veſſel as ours had before viſited the country. To this he replied in the negative, but ſaid, that his anceſtors had told him there had once come to this place a ſmall veſſel, from a diſtant country, called UDIMAROA, in which were four men, who, upon their coming on ſhore, were all killed: upon being aſked where this diſtant land lay, he pointed to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Of Ulimaroa we had heard ſomething before, from the people about the Bay of Iſlands, who ſaid that their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had viſited it; and Tupia had alſo talked to us of Uli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maroa, concerning which he had ſome confuſed traditionary notions, not very different from thoſe of our old man, ſo that we could draw no certain concluſions from the accounts of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>Soon after the ſhip came to an anchor the ſecond time, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went on ſhore, to ſee if any gleanings of natural knowledge remained, and by accident fell in with the moſt agreeable Indian family they had ſeen, which afforded them a better opportunity of remarking the perſonal ſubordination among theſe people, than had before offered. The principal perſons were a widow, and a pretty boy about ten years old: the widow was mourning for her huſband with tears of blood, according to their cuſtom, and the child, by the death of its father, was become proprietor of the land where we had cut our wood. The mother and the ſon were ſitting upon matts, and the reſt of the family, to the number of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or ſeventeen, of both ſexes, ſat round them in the open air, for they did not appear to have any houſe, or other ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the weather, the inclemencies of which, cuſtom has probably enabled them to endure without any laſting incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. Their whole behaviour was affable, obliging, and unſuſpicious; they preſented each perſon with fiſh, and a brand of fire to dreſs it, and preſſed them many times to ſtay till the morning, which they would certainly have done if they had not expected the ſhip to ſail, greatly regretting that they had not become acquainted with them ſooner, as they made no doubt but that more knowledge of the manners and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the inhabitants of this country would have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

from them in a day, than they had been able to acquire during our whole ſtay upon the coaſt.</p>
                        <p>On the 6th, about ſix o'clock in the morning a light breeze ſprung up at north, and we again got under ſail, but the wind proving variable, we reached no farther than juſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Motuara; in the afternoon, however, a more ſteady gale at N. by W. ſet us clear of the Sound, which I ſhall now deſcribe.</p>
                        <p>The entrance of Queen Charlotte's Sound is ſituated in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 41° S. longitude 184° 45′ W. and near the middle of the ſouth weſt ſide of the ſtreight in which it lies. The land of the ſouth eaſt head of the Sound, called by the natives KOAMAROO, off which lie two ſmall iſlands and ſome rocks, makes the narroweſt part of the ſtreight. From the north weſt head a reef of rocks runs out about two miles, in the direction of N. E. by N. part of which is above the water, and part below. By this account of the heads, the Sound will be ſufficiently known: at the entrance, it is three leagues broad, and lies in S. W. by S. S. W. and W. S. W. at leaſt ten leagues, and is a collection of ſome of the fineſt harbours in the world, as will appear from the plan, which is laid down with all the accuracy that time and circumſtances would admit. The land forming the harbour or cove in which we lay, is called by the natives TOTARRANUE: the harbour itſelf, which I called SHIP COVE, is not inferior to any in the found, either for convenience or ſafety: it lies on the weſt ſide of the ſound, and is the ſouthermoſt of three coves, that are ſituated within the iſland of Motuara, which bears eaſt of it. Ship Cove may be entered, either between Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuara and a long iſland, called by the natives HAMOTE, or between Motuara and the weſtern ſhore. In the laſt of theſe channels are two ledges of rocks, three fathom under water, which may eaſily be known by the ſea-weed that grows upon them. In ſailing either in or out of the ſound, with little wind, attention muſt be had to the tides, which flow about nine or ten o'clock at the full and change of the moon, and riſe and fall between ſeven and eight feet perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly. The flood comes in through the ſtreight from the S. E. and ſets ſtrongly over upon the north weſt head, and the reef that lies off it; the ebb ſets with ſtill greater rapidity to the S. E. over upon the rocks and iſlands that lie off the ſouth eaſt head. The variation of the compaſs we found from good obſervation to be 13° 5′ E.</p>
                        <p>The land about this ſound, which is of ſuch a height that we ſaw it at the diſtance of twenty leagues, conſiſts wholly of high hills and deep vallies, well ſtored with a variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent timber, fit for all purpoſes except maſts, for which it is too hard and heavy. The ſea abounds with a variety of
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:013324_0284_0F90F2C0C6E1C7A0"/>
fiſh, ſo that without going out of the cove where we lay, we caught every day, with the ſeine and hooks and lines, a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity ſufficient to ſerve the whole ſhip's company: and along the ſhore we found plenty of ſhags, and a few other ſpecies of wild fowl, which thoſe who have long lived upon ſalt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions will not think deſpicable food.</p>
                        <p>The number of inhabitants ſcarcely exceeds four hundred, and they live diſperſed along the ſhores, where their food, conſiſting of fiſh and fern roots, is moſt eaſily procured; for we ſaw no cultivated ground. Upon any appearance of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they retire to their hippahs, or forts; in this ſituation we found them, and in this ſituation they continued for ſome time after our arrival. In compariſon of the inhabitants of other parts of this country, they are poor, and their canoes are without ornament: the little traffic we had with them was wholly for fiſh, and indeed they had ſcarcely any thing elſe to diſpoſe of. They ſeemed, however, to have ſome knowledge of iron, which the inhabitants of ſome other parts had not; for they willingly took nails for their fiſh, and ſometimes ſeemed to prefer it to every thing elſe that we could offer, which had not always been the caſe. They were at firſt very fond of paper; but when they found that it was ſpoiled by being wet, they would not take it: neither did they ſet much value upon the cloth of Otaheite; but Engliſh broad cloth, and red kerſey were in high eſtimation; which ſhewed that they had ſenſe enough to appretiate the commodities which were offered by their uſe, which is more than could be ſaid of ſome of their neighbours, who made a much better appearance. Their dreſs has been mentioned already, particularly their large round head-dreſſes of feathers, which were far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unbecoming.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as we got out of the Sound, I ſtood over to the eaſtward, in order to get the ſtreight well open before the tide of ebb came on. At ſeven in the evening, the two ſmall iſlands which lie off Cape Koamaroo, the ſouth eaſt head of Queen Charlotte's Sound, bore eaſt, diſtant about four miles: at this time it was nearly calm, and the tide of ebb ſetting out, we were, in a very ſhort time, carried by the rapidity of the ſtream cloſe upon one of the iſlands, which was a rock riſing almoſt perpendicularly out of the ſea: we perceived our danger increaſe every moment, and had but one expedient to prevent our being daſhed to pieces, the ſucceſs of which a few minutes would determine. We were now within little more than a cable's length of the rock, and had more than ſeventy-five fathom water; but upon dropping an anchor, and veering about one hundred and fifty fathom of cable, the ſhip was happily brought up: this, however, would not have ſaved us, if the tide which ſet S. by E. had not, upon meeting
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:013324_0285_0F8FFBDC92269F28"/>
with the iſland, changed its direction to S. E. and carried us beyond the firſt point. In this ſituation we were not above two cable's length from the rocks; and here we remained in the ſtrength of the tide, which ſet to the S. E. after the rate of at leaſt five miles an hour, from a little after ſeven till near midnight, when the tide abated, and we began to heave. By three in the morning the anchor was at the bows, and having a light breeze at N. W. we made ſail for the eaſtern ſhore; but the tide being againſt us, we made but little way: the wind however afterwards freſhened, and came to N. and N. E. with which, and the tide of ebb, we were in a ſhort time hurried through the narroweſt part of the ſtreight, and then ſtood away for the ſouthermoſt land we had in ſight, which bore from us S. by W. Over this land appeared a mountain of ſtupendous height, which was covered with ſnow.</p>
                        <p>The narroweſt part of the ſtreight, through which we had been driven with ſuch rapidity, lies between Cape Tiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witte, on the coaſt of Eaheinomauvie, and Cape Koamaroo: the diſtance between them I judged to be between four or five leagues, and notwithſtanding the tide, now its ſtrength is known, may be paſſed without much danger. It is however ſafeſt to keep on the north eaſt ſhore, for on that ſide there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be nothing to fear; but on the other ſhore there are not only the iſlands and rocks which lie off Cape Koa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maroo, but a reef of rocks ſtretching from theſe iſlands ſix or ſeven miles to the ſouthward, at the diſtance of two or three miles from the ſhore, which I had diſcovered from the hill when I took my ſecond view of the ſtreight from the eaſt to the weſtern ſea. The length of the ſtreight we had paſſed I ſhall not pretend to aſſign.</p>
                        <p>About nine leagues north from Cape Tierawitte, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame ſhore, is a high and remarkable iſland which may be diſtinctly ſeen from Queen Charlotte's Sound, from which it is diſtant about ſix or ſeven leagues. This iſland, which was noticed when we paſſed it on the 14th of January, I have called ENTRY ISLE.</p>
                        <p>On the eaſt ſide of Cape Tierawitte, the land trends away S. E. by E. about eight leagues, where it ends in a point, and is the ſouthermoſt land on Eaheinomauwe. To this point I have given the name of CAPE PALLISER, in honour of my worthy friend Captain Palliſer. It lies in latitude 41° 34′ S. longitude 183° 58′ W. and bore from us this day at noon S. 79 E. diſtant about thirteen leagues, the ſhip being then in the latitude of 41° 27′ S.; Koamaroo at the ſame time bear N. ½ E. diſtant ſeven or eight leagues. The ſouthermoſt land in ſight bore S. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>6 W. and the ſnowy mountains S. W. At this time we were about three leagues from the ſhore, and abreaſt of a deep bay or inlet, to which I gave the name of
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:013324_0286_0F8FFBDD4F7DFCF8"/>
CLOUDY BAY, and at the bottom of which there appeared low land covered with tall trees.</p>
                        <p>At three o'clock in the afternoon we were abreaſt of the ſouthermoſt point of land that we had ſeen at noon which I called CAPE CAMPBEL; it lies S. by W. diſtant between twelve and thirteen leagues from Cape Koamaroo, in lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 41° 44′ S. longitude 183° 45′ W.; and with Cape Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſer forms the ſouthern entrance of the ſtreight, the diſtance between them being between thirteen and fourteen leagues W. by S. and E. by N.</p>
                        <p>From this cape we ſteered along the ſhore S. W. by S. till eight o'clock in the evening, when the wind died away. About half an hour afterwards, however, a freſh breeze ſprung up at S. W. and I put the ſhip right before it. My reaſon for this, was a notion which ſome of the officers had juſt ſtarted, that Eahienomauwe was not an iſland, and that the land might ſtretch away to the S. E. from between Cape Turnagain and Cape Palliſer, there being a ſpace of between twelve and fifteen leagues that we had not ſeen. I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſtrongeſt conviction that they were miſtaken, not only from what I had ſeen the firſt time I diſcovered the ſtreight, but from many other concurrent teſtimonies that the land in queſtion was an iſland; but being reſolved to leave no poſſibility of doubt with reſpect to an object of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, I took the opportunity of the wind's ſhifting, to ſtand eaſtward, and accordingly ſteered N. E. by E. all the night. At nine o'clock in the morning we were abreaſt of Cape Palliſer, and found the land trend away N. E. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Cape Turnagain, which I reckoned to be diſtant about twenty-ſix leagues; however, as the weather was hazy, ſo as to prevent our ſeeing above four or five leagues, I ſtill kept ſtanding to the N. E. with a light breeze at ſouth; and at noon Cape Palliſer bore N. 72 W. diſtant about three leagues.</p>
                        <p>About three o'clock in the afternoon, three canoes came up to the ſhip with between thirty and forty people on board, who had been pulling after us with great labour and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance for ſome time: they appeared to be more cleanly, and a better claſs, than any we had met with ſince we left the Bay of Iſlands, and their canoes were alſo diſtinguiſhed by the ſame ornaments which we had ſeen upon the northerly part of the coaſt. They came on board with very little invitation; and their behaviour was courteous and friendly: upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving preſents from us, they made us preſents in return, which had not been done by any of the natives that we had ſeen before. We ſoon perceived that our gueſts had heard of us, for as ſoon as they came on board, they aſked for <hi>Whow,</hi> the name by which nails were known among the people with whom we had trafficked: but though they had heard of nail,
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:013324_0287_0F90F2C2353EA938"/>
it was plain they had ſeen none; for when nails were given them, they aſked Tupia what they were. The term <hi>Whow,</hi> indeed, conveyed to them the idea not of their quality, but only of their uſe; for it is the ſame by which they diſtinguiſh a tool, commonly made of bone, which they uſe both as an augur and a chiſſel. However, their knowing that we had <hi>Whow</hi> to ſell, was a proof that their connections extended as far north as Cape Kidnappers, which was diſtant no leſs than forty-five leagues; for that was the ſouthermoſt place on this ſide the coaſt where we had any traffic with the natives. It is alſo probable, that the little knowledge which the inhabitants of Queen Charlotte's Sound had of iron, they obtained from their neighbours at Tierawitte; for we had no reaſon to think that the inhabitants of any part of this coaſt had the leaſt knowledge of iron, or its uſe, before we came among them, eſpecially as when it was firſt offered they ſeemed to diſregard it as of no value. We thought it probable, that we were now once more in the territories of Teratu; but upon enquiring of theſe people, they ſaid that he was not their king. After a ſhort time, they went away, much gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with the preſents that we had made them; and we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued our courſe along the ſhore to the N. E. till eleven o'clock the next morning. About this time, the weather hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to clear up, we ſaw Cape Turnagain, bearing N. by E. ½ E. at the diſtance of about ſeven leagues: I then called the officers upon deck, and aſked them, whether they were not now ſatisfied, that Eahienomauwe was an iſland; they readily anſwered in the affirmative, and all doubts being now removed, we hauled our wind to the eaſtward.</p>

                        <p>AT four o'clock in the afternoon, of Friday the 9th of February, having tacked, we ſtood S. W. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to make ſail to the ſouthward till ſunſet on the 11th, when a freſh breeze at N. E. had carried us back again the length of Cape Palliſer, of which, as the weather was clear, we had a good view. Between the foot of the high land and the ſea there is a low flat border, off which there are ſome rocks that appear above water. Between this Cape and Cape Turnagain, the land near the ſhore is, in many places, low and flat, and has a green and pleaſant appearance; but farther from the ſea it riſes into hills. The land between Cape Palliſer and Cape Tierawitte is high, and makes in table-points; it alſo ſeemed to us to form two bays, but we were at too great a diſtance from this part of the coaſt, to judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately from appearances. The wind having been variable with calms, we had advanced no farther by the 12th at noon than latitude 41:52, Cape Palliſer then bearing north, diſtant about five leagues; and the ſnowy mountain S. 83 W.</p>
                        <p>At noon on the 13th, we found ourſelves in the latitude of 42:2 S.; Cape Palliſer bearing N. 20 E. diſtant eight leagues. In the afternoon a freſh gale ſprung up at N. E. and we ſteered S. W. by W. for the ſouthermoſt land in ſight, which at ſunſet bore from us S. 74 W. At this time the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation was 15:4 E.</p>
                        <p>At eight o'clock in the morning of the 14th, having run one and twenty leagues S. 58 W. ſince the preceeding noon, it fell calm. We were then abreaſt of the ſnowy mountain, which bore from us N. W. and in this direction lay behind a mountainous ridge of nearly the ſame height, which riſes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from the ſea, and runs parallel with the ſhore, which lies N. E. ½ N. and S. W. ½ S. The north weſt end of the ridge riſes inland, not far from Cape Campbell; and both the mountain and the ridge are diſtinctly ſeen as well from Cape Koamaroo as Cape Palliſer: from Koamaroo they are
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:013324_0291_0F90F26B073CEBA8"/>
diſtant two and twenty leagues S. W. ½ S.; and from Cape Palliſer thirty leagues W. S. W.; and are of a height ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be ſeen at a much greater diſtance. At noon this day, we were in latitude 42:34 S. The ſouthermoſt land in ſight bore S. W. ½ W.; and ſome low land that appeared like an iſland, and lay cloſe under the foot of the ridge, bore N. W. by N. about five or ſix leagues.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon, when Mr. Banks was out in the boat a ſhooting, we ſaw, with our glaſſes, four double canoes, having on board fifty-ſeven men, put off from that ſhore, and make towards him: we immediately made ſignals for him to come on board; but the ſhip, with reſpect to him, being right in the wake of the ſun, he did not ſee them. We were at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance from the ſhore, and he was at a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance from the ſhip, which was between him and the ſhore; ſo that, it being a dead calm, I began to be in ſome pain for him, fearing that he might not ſee the canoes time enough to reach the ſhip before they ſhould get up with him: ſoon after, however, we ſaw his boat in motion, and had the pleaſure to take him on board before the Indians came up, who probably had not ſeen him, as their attention ſeemed to be wholly fixed upon the ſhip. They came within about a ſtone's caſt, and then ſtopped, gazing at us with a look of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant aſtoniſhment: Tupia exerted all his eloquence to prevail upon them to come nearer, but without any effect. After ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying us for ſome time, they left us, and made towards the ſhore; but had not meaſured more than half the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and the ſhip before it was dark. We imagined that theſe people had heard nothing of us, and could not but remark the different behaviour and diſpoſitions of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the different parts of this coaſt upon their firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the veſſel. Theſe kept aloof with a mixture of ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity and wonder; others had immediately commenced hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities, by pelting us with ſtones: the gentleman whom we had found alone, fiſhing in his boat, ſeemed to think us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely unworthy of his notice; and ſome, almoſt without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, had come on board with an air of perfect confidence and good-will. From the behaviour of our laſt viſitors, I gave the land from which they had put off, and which, as I have before obſerved, had the appearance of an iſland, the name of LOOKERS-ON</p>
                        <p>At eight o'clock in the evening, a breeze ſprung up at S. S. W. with which I ſtretched off ſouth eaſt, becauſe ſome on board thought they ſaw land in that quarter. In this courſe we continued till ſix o'clock the next morning, when we had run eleven leagues, but ſaw no land, except that which we had left. Having ſtood to the S. E. with a light breeze, which veered from the weſt to the north, till noon, our latitude by obſervation was 42:56 S. and the high land that we were
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:013324_0292_0F905036352BFFE0"/>
abreaſt of the preceeding noon bore N. N. W. ½ W. In the Afternoon we had a light breeze at N. E. with which we ſteered weſt, edging in for the land, which was diſtant about eight leagues. At ſeven in the evening, we were about ſix leagues from the ſhore, and the ſouthermoſt extremity of the land in ſight bore W. S. W.</p>
                        <p>At day-break on the 16th, we diſcovered land bearing S. by W. and ſeemingly detached from the coaſt we were upon. About eight, a breeze ſprung up, at N. by E. and we ſteered directly for it. At noon, we were in latitude 43:19 S. the peak on the ſnowy mountain bore N. 20 E. diſtant twenty-ſeven leagues; the ſouthern extremity of the land we could ſee bore weſt, and the land which had been diſcovered in the morning appeared like an iſland extending from S. S. W. to S. W. by W. ½ W. diſtant about eight leagues. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon we ſtood to the ſouthward of it, with a freſh breeze at north: at eight in the evening, we had run eleven leagues, and the land then extended from S. W. by W. to N. by W. We were then diſtant about three or four leagues from the neareſt ſhore, and in this ſituation had fifty fathom water, with a fine ſandy bottom. The variation of the compaſs by this morning's amplitude was 14:39 E.</p>
                        <p>At ſun-riſe, the next morning, our opinion that the land we had been ſtanding for was an iſland, was confirmed, by our ſeeing part of the land of Tovy Poenammoo open to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it, extending as far as W. by S. At eight in the morning, the extremes of the iſland bore N. 76 W. and N. N. E. E.: and an opening near the ſouth point, which ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> the appearance of a bay or harbour, N. 20 W. diſtant between three and four leagues: in this ſituation we had thirty-eight fathom water, with a brown ſandy bottom.</p>
                        <p>This iſland, which I named after Mr. Banks, lies about five leagues from the coaſt of Tovy Poenammoo; the ſouth point bears S. 21 W. from the higheſt peak on the ſnowy mountain, and lies in latitude 43:32 S. and in longitude 186:30 W. by an obſervation of the ſun and moon which was made this morning: it is of a circular figure, and about 24 leagues in compaſs: it is ſufficiently high to be ſeen at the diſtance of twelve or fifteen leagues, and the land has a broken irregular ſurface, with the appearance rather of barrenneſs than fertility; yet it was inhabited, for we ſaw ſmoke in one place, and a few ſtraggling natives in another.</p>
                        <p>When this iſland was firſt diſcovered in the direction of S. by W. ſome perſons on board were of opinion that they alſo ſaw land bearing S. S. E. and S. E. by E. I was myſelf upon the deck at the time, and told them, that in my opinion it was no more than a cloud, and that as the ſun roſe it would diſſipate and vaniſh. However, as I was determined to leave no ſubject for diſputation which experiment could remove, I
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013324_0293_0F90F26BB77DA870"/>
ordered the ſhip to be wore, and ſteered E. S. E. by compaſs, in the direction which the land was ſaid to bear from us at that time. At noon we were in latitude 44:7 S.; the ſouth point of Banks's Iſland bearing north, diſtant five leagues. By ſeven o'clock at night we had run eight and twenty miles, when ſeeing no land, nor any ſigns of any, but that which we had left, we bore away S. by W. and continued upon that courſe till the next day at noon, when we were in latitude 45:16, the ſouth point of Banks's iſland bearing N. 6:30 W. diſtant twenty eight leagues. The variation by the azimuth this morning was 15:30 E. As no ſigns of land had yet appeared to the ſouthward, and as I thought that we had ſtood far enough in that direction to weather all the land we had left, judging from the report of the natives in Queen Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte's Sound, I hauled to the weſtward.</p>
                        <p>We had a moderate breeze at N. N. W. and N. till eight in the evening, when it became unſettled; and at ten fixed at ſouth: during the night, it blew with ſuch violence that it brought us under our cloſe reefed topſails. At eight the next morning, having run twenty-eight leagues upon a W. by N. ½ N. courſe, and judging ourſelves to be to the weſtward of the land of Tovy Poenammoo, we bore away N. W. with a freſh gale at ſouth. At ten, having run eleven miles upon this courſe, we ſaw land extending from the S. W. to the N. W. at the diſtance of about ten leagues, which we hauled up for. At noon, our latitude by obſervation was 44:38, the ſouth eaſt point of Banks's Iſland bore N. 58:30 E. diſtant thirty leagues, and the main body of the land in ſight W. by N. A head ſea prevented us from making much way to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; at ſeven in the evening the extremes of the land ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from S. W. by S. to N. by W.; and at ſix leagues from the ſhore we had thirty-two fathom water. At four o'clock the next morning, we ſtood in for the ſhore W. by S. and dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a courſe of four leagues, our depth of water was from thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-two to thirteen fathom. When it was thirteen fathom we were but three miles diſtant from the ſhore, and therefore ſtood off; its direction is here nearly N. and S. The ſurface, to the diſtance of about five miles from the ſea, is low and flat; but it then riſes into hills of a conſiderable height. It appeared to be totally barren, and we ſaw no ſigns of its being inhabited. Our latitude, at noon, was 44:44; and the longitude which we made from Banks's Iſland to this place was 2:22 W. During the laſt twenty-four hours, though we carried as much ſail as the ſhip would bear, we were driven three leagues to the leeward.</p>
                        <p>We continued to ſtand off and on all this day and the next, keeping at the diſtance of between four and twelve leagues from the ſhore, and having water from thirty-five to fifty-three fathom. On the 22d, at noon, we had no obſervation, but by
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013324_0294_0F90F26C814A1018"/>
the land judged ourſelves to be about three leagues farther north than we had been the day before. At ſun-ſet, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which had been hazey, clearing up, we ſaw a mountain which roſe in a high peak, bearing N. W. by N.; and at the ſame time, we ſaw the land more diſtinctly than before, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from N. to S. W. by S. which, at ſome diſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the coaſt, had a lofty and mountainous appearance. We ſoon found that the accounts which had been given us by the Indians in Queen Charlotte's Sound of the land to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward were not true; for they had told us that it might be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumnavigated in four days.</p>
                        <p>On the 23d, having a hollow ſwell from the S. E. and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting wind from the ſame quarter, we kept plying between ſeven and fifteen leagues from the ſhore, having from ſeventy to 44 fathom. At noon, our latitude by obſervation was 44:40 S. and our longitude from Banks's Iſland 1:31 W. From this time to ſix in the evening it was calm; but a light breeze then ſpringing up at E. N. E. we ſteered S. S. E. all night, edging off from the land, the hollow ſwell ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing; our depth of water was from ſixty to ſeventy-five fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom. While we were becalmed, Mr. Banks, being out in the boat, ſhot two Port Egmont hens, which were in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the ſame as thoſe that are found in great numbers upon the iſland of Faro, and were the firſt of the kind we had ſeen upon this coaſt, though we fell in with ſome a few days before we made land.</p>
                        <p>At day-break, the wind freſhened, and before noon we had a ſtrong gale at N. N. E. At eight in the morning we ſaw the land extending as far as S. W. by S. and ſteered directly for it. At noon we were in latitude 45:22 S.; and the land which now ſtretched from S. W. ½ S. to N. N. W. appeared to be rudely diverſified by hill and valley. In the afternoon, we ſteered S. W. by S. and S. W. edging in for the land with a freſh gale at north; but though we were at no great diſtance, the weather was ſo hazey that we could ſee nothing diſtinctly upon it, except a ridge of high hills, lying not far from the ſea, and parallel to the coaſt, which in this place ſtretches S. by W. and N. by E. and ſeemed to end in a high bluff point to the ſouthward. By eight in the evening we were abreaſt of this point; but it being then dark, and I not knowing which way the land trended, we brought to for the night. At this time, the point bore weſt, and was diſtant about five miles: our depth of water was thirty-ſeven fathom, and the bottom conſiſted of ſmall pebbles.</p>
                        <p>At day-break, having made ſail, the point bore north, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant three leagues, and we now found that the land trended from it S. W. by W. as far as we could ſee. This point I named CAPE SAUNDERS, in honour of Sir Charles. Our latitude was 45:35 S. and longitude 189:4 W. By the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013324_0295_0F90EC9AF2CE39C0"/>
and the angles that are made by the coaſt, this point will be ſufficiently known; there is, however, about three or four leagues to the ſouth weſt of it, and very near the ſhore, a remarkable ſaddle-hill, which is a good direction to it on that quarter. From one league to four leagues north of Cape Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the ſhore forms two or three bays, in which there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be good anchorage, and effectual ſhelter from the S. W. weſterly, and N. weſterly winds; but my deſire of getting to the ſouthward, in order to aſcertain whether this country was an iſland or continent, prevented my putting into any of them.</p>
                        <p>We kept at a ſmall diſtance from the ſhore all this morning, with the Wind at S. W. and had a very diſtinct view of it: it is of a moderate height, and the ſurface is broken by many hills, which are green and woody; but we ſaw no appearance of inhabitants. At noon, Cape Saunders bore N. 30 W. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant about four leagues. We had variable winds and calms, till five o'clock in the evening, when it fixed at W. S. W. and ſoon blew ſo hard that it put us paſt our topſails, and ſplit the foreſail all to pieces: after getting another to the yard, we continued to ſtand to the ſouthward under two courſes; and at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ix the next morning, the ſouthermoſt land in ſight bore W. by N. and Cape Saunders N. by W. diſtant eight leagues: at noon, it bore N. 20 W. fourteen leagues; and our latitude by obſervation was 46:36. The gale continued with heavy ſqualls, and a large hollow ſea all the afternoon; and at ſeven in the evening, we lay too under our foreſail, with the ſhip's head to the ſouthward: at noon on the 27th, our latitude was 46:54, and our longitude from Cape Saunders 1:24 E. At ſeven in the evening, we made ſail under our courſes; and at eight the next morning ſet the topſails cloſe reefed. At noon our latitude was 47:43, and our longitude eaſt from Cape Saunders 2:10. At this time, we wore and ſtood to the northward: in the afternoon, we found the variation to be 16:34 E. At eight in the evening, we tacked and ſtood to the ſouthward, with the wind at weſt.</p>
                        <p>At noon this day, our latitude by account was 47:52, and our longitude from Cape Saunders 1:8 E. We ſtood to the ſouthward till half an hour paſt three in the afternoon; and then, being in latitude 48 S. and longitude 188 W. and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no appearance of land, we tacked and ſtood to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, having a large ſwell from the S. W. by W. At noon the next day, our latitude was 46:42 S.; and Cape Saunders bore N. 46 W. diſtant eighty-ſix miles. The ſouth weſt ſwell continuing till the 3d, confirmed our opinion, that there was no land in that quarter. At four in the Afternoon, we ſtood to the weſtward with all the ſail we could make. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 4th, we found the variation to be 16:16 E. This they we ſaw ſome whales and ſeals, as we had done ſeveral
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013324_0296_0F9050366ABA2028"/>
times after our having paſſed the ſtreight; but we ſaw no ſeal while we were upon the coaſt of Eahienomauwe. We ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both in the night and this morning, but had no ground with one hundred and fifty fathom. At noon, we ſaw Cape Saunders bearing N. ½ W.; and our latitude by obſervation was 46:31 S. At half an hour paſt one o'clock, we ſaw land bearing W. by S. which we ſteered for, and before it was dark were within three or four miles of it: during the whole night we ſaw fires upon it, and at ſeven in the morning were within about three leagues of the ſhore, which appeared to be high, but level. At three o'clock in the afternoon we ſaw the land extending from N. E. by N. to N. W. ½ N.; and ſoon after we diſcovered ſome low land, which appeared like an iſland, bearing S. ½ W. We continued our courſe to the W. by S. and in two hours we ſaw high land over the low land, extending to the ſouthward as far as S. W. by S.; but it did not appear to be joined to the land to the northward, ſo that there is either water, a deep bay, or low land between them.</p>
                        <p>At noon on the 6th, we were nearly in the ſame ſituation as at noon on the day before: in the afternoon we found the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation by ſeveral azimuths and the amplitude, to be 15:10 E. On the 7th at noon, we were in latitude 47:6 S. and had made twelve miles eaſting during the laſt twenty-four hours. We ſtood to the weſtward the remainder of this day, and all the next till ſun-ſet, when the extremes of the land bore from N. by E. to W. diſtant about ſeven or eight leagues: in this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our depth of water was fifty-five fathom, and the variation by amplitude 16:29 E. The wind now veered from the N. to the W. and as we had fine weather, and moonlight, we kept ſtanding cloſe upon the wind to the S. W. all night. At four in the morning, we had ſixty fathom water; and at day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, we diſcovered under our bow a ledge of rocks, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from S. by W. to W. by S. upon which the ſea broke very high: they were not more than three quarters of a mile diſtant, yet we had five and forty fathom water. As the Wind was at N. W. we could not now weather them, and as I was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to run to leeward, I tacked and made a trip to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; the wind however ſoon after coming to the northward, enabled us to get clear of all. Our ſoundings, while we were paſſing within the ledge, were from thirty-five to forty-ſeven fathom, with a rocky bottom.</p>
                        <p>This ledge lies S. E. ſix leagues from the ſouthermoſt part of the land, and S. E. by E. from ſome remarkable hills which ſtand near the ſhore: about three leagues to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it, there is another ledge, which lies full three leagues from the ſhore, and on which the ſea broke in a dreadful ſurf. As we paſſed theſe rocks to the north in the night, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the others under our bow at break of day, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013324_0297_0F90F26D53AF3EE0"/>
that our danger was imminent, and our eſcape critical in the higheſt degree: from the ſituation of theſe rocks, ſo well adapted to catch unwary ſtrangers, I called them the TRAPS. Our latitude at noon was 47:26 S. The Land in Sight, which had the appearance of an iſland, extended from N. E. by N. to N. W. by W. and ſeemed to be about five leagues diſtant from the main; the eaſtermoſt ledge of rocks bore S. S. E. diſtant one league and an half, and the northermoſt N. E. ½ E. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant about three leagues. This land is high and barren, with nothing upon it but a few ſtraggling ſhrubs, for not a ſingle tree was to be ſeen; it was however remarkable for a number of white patches, which I took to be marble, as they reflected the ſun's rays very ſtrongly: other patches of the ſame kind we had obſerved in different parts of this country, particularly in Mercury Bay: we continued to ſtand cloſe upon a wind to the weſtward, and at ſun-ſet the ſouthermoſt point of land bore N. 38 E. diſtant four leagues, and the weſtermoſt land in ſight bore N. 2 E. The point which lies in latitude 47:19 S. lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude 192:12 W. I named SOUTH-CAPE: the weſtermoſt land was a ſmall iſland, lying off the point of the main.</p>
                        <p>Suppoſing South Cape to be the ſouthern extremity of the country, as indeed it proved to be, I hoped to get round it by the weſt, for a large hollow ſwell from the ſouth weſt, ever ſince our laſt hard gale, had convinced me that there was no land in that direction.</p>
                        <p>In the night we had a hard gale at N. E. by N. and N. which brought us under our courſes, but about eight in the morning it became moderate; and at noon, veering to the weſt, we tacked and ſtood to the northward, having no land in ſight. Our latitude, by obſervation, was 47:33 S. our longitude, weſt from the South Cape, 59. We ſtood away N. N. E. cloſe upon a wind, without ſeeing any land, till two the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when we diſcovered an iſland bearing N. W. by N. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant about five leagues: about two hours afterwards we ſaw land a-head, upon which we tacked and ſtood off till ſix, when we ſtood in to take a nearer view of it: at eleven we were within three leagues of it, but the wind ſeeming to incline upon the ſhore, I tacked and ſtood off to the ſouthward. We had now ſailed round the land which we had diſcovered on the 5th, and which then did not appear to be joined to the main, which lay north of it; and being now come to the other ſide of what we ſuppoſed to be water, a bay, or low land, it had the ſame appearance, but when I came to lay it down upon paper I ſaw no reaſon to ſuppoſe it to be an iſland; on the contrary, I was clearly of opinion that it made part of the main. At ſoon, the weſtern extremity of the main bore N. 59 W. and the iſland which we had ſeen in the morning, S. 59 W. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant about five leagues. It lies in latitude 46:31 S. longitude 192:49 W. and is nothing but a barren rock, about a mile in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013324_0298_0F90F26DF40B3E00"/>
circuit, remarkably high, and lies full five leagues diſtant from the main. This iſland I named after Dr. Solander, and called it SOLANDER's ISLAND. The ſhore of the main lies neareſt E. by S. and W. by N. and forms a large open bay, in which there is no appearance of any harbour, or ſhelter for ſhipping againſt S. W. and ſoutherly winds: the ſurface of the country is broken into craggy hills, of a great height, on the ſummits of which are ſeveral patches of ſnow: it is not, however, wholly barren, for we could ſee wood not only in the vallies, but upon the higheſt ground, yet we ſaw no appearance of its being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited.</p>
                        <p>We continued to ſtand to the S. W. by S. till eleven o'clock the next morning, when the wind ſhifted to the S. W. by W. upon which we wore, and ſtood to the N. N. W. being then in latitude 47:40 S. longitude 193:50 W. and having a hollow ſea from the S. W.</p>
                        <p>During the night we ſteered N. N. W. till ſix in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when, ſeeing no land, we ſteered N. by E. till eight, when we ſteered N. E. by E. ½ E. to make the land, which at ten we ſaw bearing E. N. E. but it being hazy, we could diſtinguiſh nothing upon it. At noon, our latitude, by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, was 46:S. About two it cleared up, and the land appeared to be high, rude, and mountainous: about half an hour after three I hauled in for a bay, in which there appeared to be good anchorage; but in about an hour, finding the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance too great to run before it would be dark, and the wind blowing too hard to make the attempt ſafe in the night, I bore away along the ſhore.</p>
                        <p>This bay, which I called DUSKY BAY, lies in latitude 45 47 S.: it is between three and four miles broad at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and ſeems to be full as deep as it is broad: it contains ſeveral iſlands, behind which there muſt be ſhelter from all winds, though poſſibly there may not be ſufficient depth of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The north point of this bay, when it bears S. E. by S. is rendered very remarkable by five high peaked rocks which lie off it, and have the appearance of four fingers and thumb of a man's hand, for which reaſon I called it POINT FIVE FINGERS: the land of this point is farther remarkable, for being the only level land within a conſiderable diſtance. It extends near two leagues to the northward, is lofty, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with wood: the land behind it is very different, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting wholly of mountains, totally barren and rocky; and this difference gives the Cape the appearance of an iſland.</p>
                        <p>At ſun-ſet, the ſouthermoſt land in ſight bore due ſouth, diſtant about five or ſix leagues; and as this is the weſtermoſt point of land upon the whole coaſt, I called it WEST CAPE. It lies about three leagues to the ſouthward of Duſky Bay, in the latitude of 45:54 S. and in longitude 193:17 W. The land of this Cape is of a moderate height next the ſea, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013324_0299_0F90F26ECBFB69D0"/>
has nothing remarkable about it, except a very white cliff, two or three leagues to the ſouthward of it: to the ſouthward of it alſo the land trends away to the S. E. and to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it trends N. N. E.</p>
                        <p>Having brought to for the night, we made ſail along the ſhore at four in the morning, in the direction of N. E. ½ N. with a moderate breeze at S. S. E. At noon, our latitude, by obſervation, was 45:13 S. At this time, being about a league and an half from the ſhore, we ſounded, but had no ground with ſeventy fathom: we had juſt paſſed a ſmall nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row opening in land, where there ſeemed to be a very ſafe and convenient harbour, formed by an iſland, which lay in the middle of the opening at eaſt. The opening lies in lat. 45:16 S. and on the land behind it are mountains, the ſummits of which were covered with ſnow, that appeared to have been recently fallen; and indeed for two days paſt we had found the weather very cold. On each ſide the entrance of the opening, the land riſes almoſt perpendicularly from the ſea to a ſtupendous height, and this indeed was the reaſon why I did not carry the ſhip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, for no wind could blow there but right in, or right out, in the direction of either eaſt or weſt, and I thought it by no means adviſeable to put into a place whence I could not have got out but with a wind which experience had taught me did not blow more than one day in a month. In this, however, I acted contrary to the opinion of ſome perſons on board, who, in very ſtrong terms, expreſſed their deſire to harbour for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent convenience, without any regard to future diſadvantages.</p>
                        <p>In the evening, being about two leagues from the ſhore, we ſounded, and had no ground with 108 fathom: the variation of the needle, by azimuth, was 14 E. and by amplitude 15 2. We made the beſt of our way along the ſhore with what wind we had, keeping at the diſtance of between two and three leagues. At noon, we were in latitude 44:47, having run only twelve leagues upon a N. E. ¼ N. courſe, during the laſt four and twenty hours.</p>
                        <p>We continued to ſteer along the ſhore, in the direction of N. E. ¼ E. till ſix o'clock in the evening, when we brought to for the night. As four in the morning, we ſtood in for the land, and when the day broke we ſaw what appeared to be an inlet; but upon a nearer approach proved to be only a deep valley between two high lands: we proceeded therefore in the ſame courſe, keeping the ſhore at the diſtance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween four and five miles. At noon on the 16th, the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt point of land in ſight bore N. 60 E. at the diſtance of ten miles; and our latitude, by obſervation, was 44:5, our longitude from Cape Weſt 2:8 E. About two, we paſt the point which at noon had been diſtant ten miles, and found it to conſiſt of high red cliffs, down which there fell a caſcade of water in four ſmall ſtreams, and I therefore gave it the name
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013324_0300_0F905037289396A8"/>
of CASCADE POINT. From this Point the land trends firſt N. 76 E. and afterwards more to the northward. At the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of eight leagues from Caſcade Point, in the direction of E. N. E. and at a little diſtance from the ſhore, lies a ſmall low iſland, which bore from us S. by E. at the diſtance of about a league and a half.</p>
                        <p>At ſeven in the evening, we brought to, in thirty-three fathom, with a fine ſandy bottom, at ten we had fifty fathom, and at twelve wore in ſixty-five fathom, having driven ſeveral miles N. N. W. after our having brought to. At two in the morning, we had no ground with 140 fathom; by which it appears that the ſoundings extend but a little way from the ſhore. About this time it fell calm; at eight a breeze ſprung up at S. W. with which we ſteered along the ſhore, in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of N. E. by E. ½ E. at the diſtance of about three leagues. At ſix in the evening, being about one league from the ſhore, we had ſeventeen fathom; and at eight, being about three leagues from the ſhore, we had forty-four: we now ſhortened ſail and brought to, having run ten leagues N. E. by E. ſince noon.</p>
                        <p>It was calm moſt part of the night; but at ten in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a light breeze ſprung up at S. W. by W. when we made ſail again along ſhore, N. E. by N. having a large ſwell from the W. S. W. which had riſen in the night; at noon, our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, by obſervation, was 43:4 S. and our longitude from Cape Weſt 4:12 E. We obſerved, that the vallies as well as the mountains were this morning covered with ſnow, part of which we ſuppoſed to have fallen during the night, when we had rain. At ſix in the evening we ſhortened ſail, and at ten brought to, at the diſtance of about five leagues from the ſhore, where we had 115 fathom. At midnight there being little wind, we made ſail, and at eight in the morning we ſtood to the N. E. cloſe upon a wind till noon, when we tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being about three leagues from the land, and, by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in latitude 42:8, and longitude from Cape Weſt 5:5 E.</p>
                        <p>We continued to ſtand weſtward till two in the morning, when we made a trip to the eaſtward, and afterwards ſtood weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward till noon, when, by our reckoning, we were in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 42:23, and longitude from Cape Weſt 3:55 E. We now tacked and ſtood eaſtward, with a freſh gale at N. by W. till ſix in the evening, when the wind ſhifted to the S. and S. S. W. with which we ſteered N. E. by N. till ſix in the morning, when we hauled in E. by N. to make the land, which we ſaw ſoon afterwards; at noon, our latitude, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was 41:37, and our longitude from Cape Weſt 5:42 E. We were now within three or four leagues of the land, but it being foggy, we could ſee nothing upon it diſtinctly, and as
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013324_0301_0F90F26F7B761F48"/>
we had much wind, and a vaſt ſwell rolling in upon the ſhore, from the W. S. W. I did not think it ſafe to go nearer.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon, we had a gentle breeze from the S. S. W with which we ſteered north along the ſhore till eight, when, being within between two and three leagues, we ſounded, and had but thirty-four fathom; upon which we hauled off N. W. by N. till eleven at night, and then brought to, having ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four fathom. At four in the morning we made ſail to the N. E. with a light breeze at S. S W. which at eight veered to the weſtward, and ſoon after died away: at this time we were within three or four miles of the land, and had fifty-four fathom, with a large ſwell from the W. S. W. rolling oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the ſhore, which made me fear that I ſhould be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to anchor; but by the help of a light air now and then from the S. W. I was able to keep the ſhip from driving. At noon, the northermoſt land in ſight bore N. E. by E. ½ E. diſtant about ten leagues; our latitude, by account, was 40: 55 S. longitude from Cape Weſt 6:35 E. From this time we had light airs from the ſouthward, with intervals of calm, till noon on the 23d, when our latitude, by obſervation, was 40:36:30 S. and our longitude from Cape Weſt 6:52 E. The eaſtermoſt point of land in ſight bore E. 10 N. at the diſtance of ſeven leagues, and a bluff head or point, of which we had been abreaſt at noon the day before, and off which lay ſome rocks above water, bore S. 18 W. at the diſtance of ſix leagues. This point I called ROCK's POINT. Our latitude was now 40:55 S. and having nearly run down the whole of the north weſt coaſt of Tovy Poenammoo, I ſhall give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the face of the country.</p>
                        <p>I have already obſerved, that on the 11th, when we were off the ſouthern part, the land then ſeen was craggy and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous, and there is great reaſon to believe that the ſame ridge of mountains extends nearly the whole length of the iſland. Between the weſtermoſt land, which we ſaw that day, and the eaſtermoſt which we ſaw on the 13th, there is a ſpace of about ſix or eight leagues, of which we did not ſee the coaſt, though we plainly diſcovered the mountains in-land. The ſea coaſt near Cape Weſt is low, riſing with an eaſy and gradual aſcent to the foot of the mountains, and being in moſt parts covered with wood. From Point Five Fingers, down to latitude 44:20, there is a narrow ridge of hills that riſes directly from the ſea, and is covered with wood: cloſe behind theſe hills are the mountains, extending in another ridge of a ſtupenduous height, and conſiſting of rocks that are totally barren and naked, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept where they are covered with ſnow, which is to be ſeen in large patches upon many parts of them, and has probably lain there ever ſince the creation of the world: a proſpect more rude, craggy, and deſolate than this country affords from the ſea, cannot poſſibly be conceived, for as far inland as the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013324_0302_0F90EC9BB4D63EC0"/>
eye can reach, nothing appears but the ſummits of rocks, which ſtand ſo near together, that inſtead of Vallies there are only fiſſures between them. From the latitude of 44:20, to the latitude of 42:8, theſe mountains lie farther inland, and the ſea coaſt conſiſts of woody hills and vallies, of various height and extent, and has much appearance of fertility: many of the vallies form plains of conſiderable extent, wholly covered with wood, but it is very probable that the ground, in many places, is ſwampy and interſperſed with pools of water. From lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 42:8, to 41:30, the land is not diſtinguiſhed by any thing remarkable: it riſes into hills directly from the ſea, and is covered with wood; but the weather being foggy while we were upon this Part of the coaſt, we could ſee very little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, except now and then the ſummits of the mountains, tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above the cloudy miſts that obſcured them below, which confirmed my opinion that a chain of mountains extended from one end of the iſland to the other.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon we had a gentle breeze at S. W. which, before it was quite dark, brought us abreaſt of the eaſtern point, which we had ſeen at noon; but not knowing what courſe the land took on the other ſide of it, we brought to in thirty-four fathom, at the diſtance of about one league from the ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>re. At eight in the evening, there being little wind, we filled and ſtood on till midnight, and then we brought to till four in the morning, when we again made ſail, and at break of day we ſaw low land extending from the point to the S. S. E. as far as the eye could reach, the eaſtern extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of which appeared in round hillocks: by this time the gale had veered to the eaſtward, which obliged us to ply to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. At noon, next day, the eaſtern point bore S. W. by S. diſtant ſixteen miles, and our latitude was 40:19: the wind continuing eaſterly, we were nearly in the ſame ſituation at noon on the day following. About 3 o'clock the wind came to the weſtward, and we ſteered E. S. E. with all the ſail we could ſet till it was dark, and then ſhortened ſail till the morning: as we had thick hazey weather all night, we kept ſounding continually, and had from thirty-ſeven to forty-two fathom. When the day broke we ſaw land bearing S. E. by E. and an iſland lying near it, bearing E. S. E. diſtant about five leagues: this iſland I knew to be the ſame that I had ſeen from the entrance of Queen Charlotte's Sound, from which it bears N. W. by N. diſtant nine leagues. At noon, it bore ſouth, diſtant four or five miles, and the north weſt head of the Sound S. E. by S. diſtant ten leagues and an half. Our latitude, by obſervation, was 40:33 S.</p>
                        <p>As we had now circumnavigated the whole country, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came neceſſary to think of quitting it; but as I had thirty tons of empty water caſks on board, this could not be done till I
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013324_0303_0F90F27040590CE0"/>
had filled them: I therefore hauled round the iſland, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a bay, which lies between that and Queen Charlotte's Sound, leaving three more iſlands, which lay cloſe under the weſtern ſhore, between 3 and 4 miles within the entrance, on our ſtarboard hand: while we were running in, we kept the lead continually going, and had from forty to twelve fathom. At ſix o'clock in the evening, we anchored in eleven fathom with a muddy bottom, under the weſt ſhore, in the ſecond cove, that lies within the three iſlands; and as ſoon as it was light the next morning, I took a boat, and went on ſhore to look for a watering place, and a proper birth for the ſhip, both which I found, much to my ſatisfaction. As ſoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> the ſhip was moored I ſent an officer on ſhore to ſuperintend the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the carpenter, with his crew, to cut wood, while the long-boat was employed in landing the empty caſks.</p>
                        <p>In this employment we were buſy till the 30th, when the wind ſeeming to ſettle at S. E. and our water being nearly completed, we warped the ſhip out of the cove, that we might have room to get under ſail: and at noon I went away in the pinnace to examine as much of the bay as my time would admit.</p>
                        <p>After rowing about two leagues up it, I went aſhore upon a point of land on the weſtern ſide, and having climbed a hill, I ſaw the weſtern arm of this bay run in S. W. by W. about five leagues farther, yet I could not diſcover the end of it: there appeared to be ſeveral other inlets, or at leaſt ſmall bays, between this and the north weſt head of Queen Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte's Sound, in each of which, I make no doubt, there is anchorage and ſhelter, as they are all covered from the ſea wind by the iſlands which lie without them. The land about this bay, as far as I could ſee of it, is of a hilly ſurface, chiefly covered with trees, ſhrubs, and fern, which render travelling difficult and fatiguing. In this Excurſion I was accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who found ſeveral new plants. We met with ſome hutts, which ſeemed to have been long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, but ſaw no inhabitants. Mr. Banks examined ſeveral of the ſtones that lay upon the beach, which were full of veins, and had a mineral appearance; but he did not diſcover any thing in them which he knew to be ore; if he had an opportunity to examine any of the bare rocks, perhaps he might have been more fortunate. He was alſo of opinion that what I had taken for marble in another place, was a mineral ſubſtance; and that, conſidering the correſpondence of latitude between this place and South-America, it was not improbable but that, by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per examination, ſomething very valuable might be found.</p>
                        <p>At my return in the evening, I found all the wood and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on board, and the ſhip ready for the ſea; I reſolved therefore to quit the country, and return home by ſuch a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013324_0304_0F90F2711CDC32E8"/>
route as might be of moſt advantage to the ſervice; and upon this ſubject took the opinion of my officers. I had myſelf a ſtrong deſire to return by Cape Horn, becauſe that would have enabled me finally to determine, whether there is or not a ſouthern continent; but againſt this it was a ſufficient objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we muſt have kept in a high ſouthern latitude, in the very depth of winter, with a veſſel which was not thought ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the undertaking: and the ſame reaſon was urged againſt our proceeding directly for the Cape of Good Hope, with ſtill more force, becauſe no diſcovery of moment could be hoped for in that rout; it was therefore reſolved that we ſhould return by the Eaſt-Indies, and that with this view we ſhould, upon leaving the coaſt, ſteer weſtward, till we ſhould fall in with the eaſt coaſt of New-Holland, and then follow the direction of that coaſt to the northward, till we ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at its northern extremity; but if that ſhould be found im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, it was further reſolved that we ſhould endeavour to fall in with the land, or iſlands, ſaid to have been diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Quiros.</p>
                        <p>With this view, at break of day on Saturday the 31ſt of March 1770, we got under ſail, and put to ſea, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a freſh gale at S. E. and clear weather, taking our departure from the eaſtern point, which we had ſeen at noon on the 23, and to which, on this occaſion, I gave the name of CAPE FAREWELL.</p>
                        <p>The bay out of which we had juſt ſailed I called ADMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RALTY BAY, giving the name of CAPE STEPHENS to the north weſt point, and of CAPE JACKSON to the ſouth eaſt, after the two gentlemen who at this time were Secretaries to the Board.</p>
                        <p>Admiralty Bay may be eaſily known by the iſland that has been juſt mentioned, which lies two miles N. E. of Cape Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens, in latitude 40:37 S. longitude, 185:6 W. and is of a conſiderable height. Between this iſland and Cape Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, which are between fourteen and fifteen leagues diſtant from each other, in the direction of W. by N. and E. by S. the ſhore forms a large deep bay, the bottom of which we could ſcarcely ſee while we were ſailing in a ſtrait line from one cape to the other; it is, however, probable of leſs depth than it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be, for as we found the water ſhallower here, than at the diſtance from any other part of the coaſt, there is reaſon to ſuppoſe, that the land at the bottom which lies next the ſea is low, and therefore not eaſily to be diſtinguiſhed from it. I have for this reaſon called it BLIND BAY, and am of opinion that it is the ſame which was called Murderer's Bay by Taſman.</p>
                        <p>Such particulars of this country and its inhabitants, with their manners and cuſtoms, as could be learnt while we were circumnavigating the coaſt, ſhall now be related.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. VIII. A general Account of New Zealand: its firſt diſcovery, &amp;c.</head>
                        <p>NEW ZEALAND was firſt diſcovered by Abel Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Taſman, a Dutch Navigator, whoſe name has been ſeveral times mentioned in this narrative, on the 13th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, in the year 1642. He traverſed the eaſtern coaſt from latitude 34 to 43, and entered the ſtreight which divides the two iſlands, and in the chart is called COOK's STREIGHT: but being attacked by the natives ſoon after he came to an anchor, in the place to which he gave the name of Murderer's Bay, he never went on ſhore. He gave the country the name of STAATEN-ISLAND, or the land of the States, in honour of the States-General, and it is now generally diſtinguiſhed in our maps and charts by the name of NEW ZEALAND. As the whole of this country, except that part of the coaſt which was ſeen by Taſman from on board his ſhip, has from his time, to the voyage of the Endeavour, remained altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, it has by many been ſuppoſed to be part of a ſouthern continent. It is however now known to conſiſt of two large iſlands, divided from each other by a ſtreight or paſſage, which is about four or five leagues broad.</p>
                        <p>Theſe iſlands are ſituated between the latitudes of 34 and 48 S. and between the longitude of 181 and 194 W. which is now determined with uncommon exactneſs, from innumerable obſervations of the ſun and moon, and one of the tranſits of Mercury, by Mr. Green, a perſon of known abilities, who, as has been obſerved before, was ſent out by the Royal Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to obſerve the tranſit of Venus in the South Seas.</p>
                        <p>The northermoſt of theſe iſlands is called by the natives Eaheinomauwe, and the ſouthermoſt Tovy, or Tavai Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nammoo; yet, as I have obſerved before, we are not ſure whether the name of Tovy Poenammoo comprehends the whole ſouthern iſland, or only part of it. The figure and extent of theſe iſlands, with the ſituation of the bays and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours they contain, and the ſmaller iſlands that lie about them, will appear from the chart that I have drawn, every part of which, however, I cannot vouch to be equally accurate. The coaſt of Eaheinomauwe, from Cape Palliſer to Eaſt Cape, is laid down with great exactneſs, both in its figure, and the courſe and diſtance from point to point; for the opportunities that offered, and the methods that I uſed, were ſuch as could ſcarcely admit of an error. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>m Eaſt Cape to St. Maria van Diemen, the chart, tho' perhaps not equally exact, is without any error of moment, except poſſibly in ſome few places which are here, and in other parts of the chart, diſtinguiſhed by a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013324_0306_0F90EC9C6E35C9C8"/>
dotted line, and which I had no opportunity to examine: from Cape Maria van Diemen to latitude 36:15, we were ſeldom nearer the ſhore than between five and eight leagues; and therefore the line that marks the ſea coaſt may poſſibly be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous. From latitude 36:15, to nearly the length of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Iſland, our courſe was very near the ſhore, and in this part of the chart, therefore, there can be no material error, except, pethaps, at Cape Tierawitte. Between Entry Iſland and Cape Palliſer we were again farther from the ſhore, and this part of the coaſt therefore may not be laid down with minute exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: yet, upon the whole, I am of opinion that this iſland will be found not much to differ from the figure that I have given it, and that upon the coaſt there are few or no harbours which are not noticed in the journal or delineated in the chart. I cannot however ſay as much of Tovy Poenammoo, the ſeaſon of the year, and the circumſtances of the voyage, would not permit me to ſpend ſo much time about this iſland as I had employed upon the other; and the ſtorms that we met with made it both difficult and dangerous to keep near the ſhore. However, from Queen Charlotte's Sound to Cape Campbel, and as far to the S. W. as latitude 43, the chart will be found pretty accurate. Between latitude 43, and latitude 44<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>:20 the line may be doubted, for of ſome part of the coaſt which it repreſents, we had ſcarcely a view. From latitude 44:20, to Cape Saunders, our diſtance would not permit me to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and the weather was beſides extremely unfavourable. From Cape Saunders to Cape South, and even to Cape Weſt, there is alſo reaſon to fear that the chart will in many places be fouod erroneous, as we were ſeldom able to keep the ſhore, and were ſometimes blown to ſuch a diſtance that it could not be ſeen. From Cape Weſt to Cape Farewell, and even to Charlotte's Sound, it is not more to be truſted.</p>
                        <p>Tovy Poenammoo is for the moſt part a mountainous, and to all appearance a barren country; and the people whom we ſaw in Queen Charlotte's Sound, thoſe that came off to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſnowy mountains, and the fires to the weſt of Cape Saunders, were all the inhabitants, and ſigns of inhabitants, that we diſcovered upon the whole iſland.</p>
                        <p>Eaheinomauwe has much better appearance; it is indeed not only hilly but mountainous, yet even the hills and mountains are covered with wood, and every valley has a rivulet of water: the ſoil in theſe vallies, and in the plains, of which there are many that are not overgrown with wood, is in general light but fertile, and in the opinion of Mr. Banks and Dr. Salan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as well as of every other gentleman on board, every kind of European grain, plants, and fruit, would flouriſh here in the utmoſt luxuriance: from the vegetables that we found here, there is reaſon to conclude, that the winters are milder than
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013324_0307_0F90F27343B26558"/>
thoſe in England, and we found the ſummer not hotter, tho' it was more equally warm; ſo that if this country ſhould be ſettled by people from Europe, they would, with a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, be very ſoon ſupplied not only with the neceſſaries, but luxurious of life in great abundance.</p>
                        <p>In this country there are no quadrupeds but dogs and rats, at leaſt we ſaw no other, and the rats are ſo ſcarce that many of us never ſaw them. The dogs live with the people, who breed them for no other purpoſe than to eat: there might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be quadrupeds that we did not ſee, but this is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, becauſe the chief pride of the natives, with reſpect to their dreſs, is in the ſkins and hair of ſuch animals as they have, and we never ſaw the ſkins of any animal about them but thoſe of dogs and birds: there are indeed ſeals upon the coaſt, and we once ſaw a ſea lion; but we imagine they are ſeldom caught, for though we ſaw ſome of their teeth, which were faſhioned into an Ornament like a bodkin, and worn by the natives at their breaſt, and highly valued, we ſaw none of their ſkins: there are whales alſo upon this coaſt, and though the people did not appear to have any art or inſtrument by which ſuch an animal could be taken and killed, we ſaw pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too-pattoos in the poſſeſſion of ſome of them, which were made of the bone of a whale, or of ſome other animal whoſe bone had exactly the ſame appearance.</p>
                        <p>Of birds the ſpecies are not many; and of theſe none, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept perhaps the gannet, is the ſame with thoſe of Europe: here are ducks indeed, and ſhaggs of ſeveral kinds, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſembling thoſe of Europe, to be called the ſame, by thoſe who have not examined them very nicely. Here are alſo hawks, owls, and quails, which differ but little from thoſe of Europe at firſt ſight; and ſeveral ſmall birds, whoſe ſong, as has been remarked in the courſe of the narrative, is much more melodious than any that we had ever heard.</p>
                        <p>The ſea coaſt is alſo viſited by many oceanic birds, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly albatroſſes, ſheerwaters, pintados, and a few of the birds, which Sir John Narborough has called Penguins, and which indeed are what the French call <hi>Nuance,</hi> and ſeem to be a middle ſpecies between bird and fiſh; for their feathers, eſpecially thoſe upon their wings, differ very little from ſcales; and their wings themſelves, which they uſe only in diving, and not to accelerate their motion even upon the ſurface of the water, may, perhaps, with equal propriety, be called fins.</p>
                        <p>Neither are inſects in greater plenty than birds: a few but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terflies and beetles, fleſh flies, very like thoſe in Europe, and ſome muſquitos and ſand-flies, perhaps exactly the ſame with thoſe of North-America, make up the whole catalogue. Of muſquitos and ſand flies, however, which are juſtly accounted the curſe of every country where they abound, we did not ſee many; there were indeed a few in almoſt every place where
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013324_0308_0F90F273F964B020"/>
we went on ſhore, but they gave us ſo little trouble, that we did not make uſe of the ſhades which we had provided for the ſecurity of our faces.</p>
                        <p>For this ſcarcity of animals upon the land, the ſea, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, makes an abundant recompenſe; every creek ſwarming with fiſh, which are not only wholeſome, but equally deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious with thoſe of Europe: the ſhip ſeldom anchored in any ſtation, or with a light gale paſſed any place, that did not afford us enough with hook and line to ſerve the whole ſhip's company, eſpecially to the ſouthward: when we lay at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, the boats, with hook and line, near the rocks, could take fiſh in any quantity; and the ſeine ſeldom failed of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a ſtill more ample ſupply; ſo that both times when we anchored in Cook's Streight, every meſs in the ſhip, that was not careleſs and improvident, ſalted as much as laſted many weeks a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ter they went to ſea. Of this article, the variety was equal to the plenty; we had mackrel of many kinds, among which one was exactly the ſame as we have in England: theſe came in immenſe ſhoals, and were taken by the natives in their ſeines, who ſold them to us at a very eaſy rate. Beſides theſe, there were fiſh of many ſpecies which we had never ſeen before, but to all which the ſeamen very readily gave names; ſo that we talked here as familiarly of hakes, bream, cole-fiſh, and many others, as we do in England; and though they are by no means of the ſame family, it muſt be confeſſed that they do honour to the name. But the higheſt luxury which the ſea afforded us, even in this place, was the lobſter or ſea cray-fiſh, which are probably the ſame that in the account of Lord Anſon's voyage are ſaid to have been found at the iſland of Juan Fernandes, except that, although large, they are not quite equal in ſize: they differ from ours in England in ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, they have a greater number of prickles on their backs, and they are red when firſt taken out of the water. Theſe we alſo bought every where to the northward in great quantities of the natives, who catch them by diving near the ſhore, and finding out where they lie with their feet. We had alſo a fiſh that Frezier, in his voyage to the Spaniſh Main in South-America, has deſcribed by the names <hi>Elefant, Pejegallo,</hi> or <hi>Poiſon coq,</hi> which, though courſe, we eat very heartily. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpecies of the ſkate, or ſting-ray, are alſo found here, which were ſtill coarſer than the Elefant; but as an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we had among many kind of dog-fiſh one, ſpotted with white, which was in flavour exactly ſimilar to our beſt ſkate, but much more delicious. We had alſo a flat fiſh reſembling both ſoles and flounders, beſides eels and congers of various kinds, with many others of which thoſe who ſhall hereafter vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit this coaſt will not fail to find the advantage; and ſhell-fiſh in great variety, particularly clams, cockles, and oyſters.</p>

Among the vegetable productions of this country, the trees claim a principal place; for here are forreſts of vaſt extent, full of the ſtraiteſt, the cleaneſt, and the largeſt timber trees that we had ever ſeen; their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> one in particular which, when we, were upon the coaſt, was rendered conſpicuous by a ſcarlet flower, that ſeemed to be a compendage of many fibres; it is about as large as an oak, and the wood is exceedingly hard and heavy, and excellently adapted to the uſe of the mill-wright. There is another which grows in the ſwamps, remarkably tall and ſtrait, thick enough to make maſts for veſſels of any ſize, and, if a judgment may be formed by the direction of its grain, very tough: this, which, as has been before remarked, our carpenter thought to reſemble the pitch-pine, may probably be lightened by tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and it will then make the fineſt maſts in the world: it has a leaf not unlike a yew, and bears berries in ſmall bunches.</p>
                        <p>Great part of the country is covered with a luxuriant ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and our natural hiſtorians were gratified by the novelty, if not the variety of the plants. Sow-thiſtle, garden night-ſhade, one or two kinds of graſs, the ſame as in England, and two or three kinds of fern, like thoſe of the Weſt Indies, with a few of the plants that are to be found in almoſt every part of the world, were all, out of about four hundred ſpecies, that have hitherto been deſcribed by any botaniſts, or had been ſeen elſewhere during the courſe of this voyage, except about five or ſix which had been gathered at Terra del Fuego.</p>
                        <p>Of eatable vegetables there are but few; our people indeed, who had been long at ſea, eat, with equal pleaſure and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, of wild celery, and a kind of creſſes, which grew in great abundance upon all parts of the ſea-ſhore. We alſo, once or twice, met with a plant like what the country people in England call <hi>Lamb's quarters,</hi> or Fat-hen, which we boiled inſtead of greens; and once we had the good fortune to find a cabbage tree, which afforded us a delicious meal; and, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the fern-root, and one other vegetable, totally unknown in Europe, and which, though eaten by the natives, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diſagreeable to us, we found no other vegetable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction that was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>it for food, among thoſe that appeared to be the wild produce of the country; and we could find but three eſculent plants among thoſe which are raiſed by cultivation, yams, ſweet potatoes, and coccos. Of the yams and potatoes there are plantations conſiſting of many acres, and I believe that any ſhip which ſhould happen to be here in the autumn, when they are dug up, might purchaſe them in any quantity.</p>
                        <p>Gourds are alſo cultivated by the natives of this place, the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013324_0310_0F90F2758781B8F0"/>
fruit of which furniſhes them with veſſels for various uſes. We alſo found here the Chineſe paper mulberry tree, the ſame as that which the inhabitants of the South Sea iſlands make their cloth; but it is ſo ſcarce, that though the New Zealanders alſo make cloth of it, they have not enough for any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than to wear as an ornament in the holes which they make in their ears, as I have obſerved before.</p>
                        <p>But among all the trees, ſhrubs, and plants of this country, there is not one that produces fruit, except a berry which has neither ſweetneſs nor flavour, and which none but the boys took the pains to gather, ſhould be honoured with that appellation. There is, however, a plant that ſerves the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants inſtead of hemp and flax, which excels all that are put to the ſame purpoſes in other countries. Of this plant there are two ſorts; the leaves of both reſemble thoſe of flags, but the flowers are ſmaller, and their cluſters more numerous; in one kind they are yellow, and in the other a deep red. Of the leaves of theſe plants, with very little preparation, they make all their common apparel; and of theſe they make alſo their ſtrings, lines, and cordage for every purpoſe, which are ſo much ſtronger than any thing we can make with hemp, that they will not bear a compariſon. From the ſame plant, by another preparation, they draw long ſlender fibres, which ſhine like ſilk, and are as white as ſnow: of theſe, which are alſo ſurprizingly ſtrong, the finer clothes are made; and of the leaves, without any other preparation than ſplitting them into proper breadths, and tying the ſtrips together, they make their fiſhing nets; ſome of which, as I have before remarked, are of an enormous ſize.</p>
                        <p>A plant, which with ſuch advantage might be applied to ſo many uſeful and important purpoſes, would certainly be a great acquiſition to England, where it would probably thrive with very little trouble, as it ſeems to be hardy, and to affect no particular ſoil; being found equally in hill and valley, in the drieſt mould, and the deepeſt bogs: the bog, however, it ſeems rather to prefer, as near ſuch places we obſerved it to be larger than elſewhere.</p>
                        <p>I have already obſerved, that we found great plenty of iron ſand in Mercury Bay, and therefore that iron ore is undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly to be found at no great diſtance. As to other metals we had ſcarcely knowledge enough of the country for conjecture.</p>
                        <p>If the ſettling of this country ſhould ever be thought an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject worthy the attention of Great Britain, the beſt place for eſtabliſhing a colony would be either on the banks of the Thames, or in the country bordering upon the Bay of Iſlands. In either place there would be the advantage of an excellent harbour; and, by means of the river, ſettlements might be extended, and a communication eſtabliſhed with the inland

parts of the country, veſſels might be built of the fine timber which abounds in theſe parts, at very little trouble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, fit for ſuch a navigation as would anſwer the purpoſe. I cannot indeed exactly aſſign the depth of water which a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel intended to navigate this river, even as far up as I went wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>When we firſt arrived upon the coaſt of this country, we imagined it to be much better peopled than we afterwards found it, concluding that the inland parts were populous from the ſmoke that we ſaw at a conſiderable diſtance from the ſhore; and perhaps that may really be the caſe with reſpect to the country behind Poverty Bay, and the Bay of Plenty, where the inhabitants appeared to be more numerous than in other places. But we had reaſon to believe, that, in general, no part of country bnt the ſea coaſt is inhabited; and even there we found the people but thinly ſcattered, all the weſtern coaſt from Cape Maria Van Diemen to Mount Egmont being totally deſolate; ſo that upon the whole the number of inhabitants bears no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the extent of country.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. IX. A deſcription of the inhabitants, their habitations, apparel, &amp;c.</head>
                        <p>THE ſtature of the men in general is equal to the largeſt of thoſe in Europe: they are ſtout, well limbed, and fleſhy; but not fat, like the lazy and luxurious inhabitants of the iſlands in the South Seas: they are alſo exceedingly vigorous and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and have an adroitneſs, and manual dexterity in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common degree, which are diſcovered in whatever they do. I have ſeen the ſtrokes of fifteen paddles on a ſide, in one of their canoes made with incredible quickneſs, and yet with ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute exactneſs of time, that all the rowers ſeemed to be actuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one common ſoul. Their colour in general is brown; but in few deeper than that of a Spaniard, who has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the ſun; in many not ſo deep. The women have not a feminine delicacy in their appearance, but their voice is remarkably ſoft; and by that, the dreſs of both ſexes being the ſame, they are principally diſtinguiſhed: they have, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, like women of other countries, more airy cheerfulneſs, and a greater flow of animal ſpirits, than the other ſex. Their hair, both of the head and beard, is black; and their teeth extremely regular, and as white as ivory: the features of both
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013324_0312_0F90EC9D2F4C7D70"/>
ſexes are good; they ſeem to enjoy high health, and we ſaw many who appeared to be of a great age. The diſpoſitions both of the men and women ſeemed to be mild and gentle; they treat each other with the tendereſt affection, but are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable towards their enemies, to whom, as I have before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, they never give quarter. It may perhaps, at firſt, ſeem ſtrange, that where there is ſo little to be got by victory, there ſhould ſo often be war; and that every little diſtrict of a country inhabited by people ſo mild and placid, ſhould be at enmity with all the reſt. But poſſibly more is to be gained by victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry among theſe people than at firſt appears, and they may be prompted to mutual hoſtilities by motives which no degree of friendſhip or affection is able to reſiſt. It appears, by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that has already been given of them, that their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal food is fiſh, which can only be procured upon the ſea-coaſt; and there, in ſufficient quantities, only at certain times: the tribes, therefore, who live inland, if any ſuch there are, and even thoſe upon the coaſt, muſt be frequently in danger of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing by famine. Their country produces neither ſheep, nor goats, nor hogs, nor cattle; tame fowls they have none, nor any art by which thoſe that are wild can be caught in ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent plenty to ſerve as proviſion. If there are any whoſe ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cuts them off from a ſupply of fiſh, the only ſuccedaneum of all other animal food, except dogs, they have nothing to ſupport life, but the vegetables that have already been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of which the chief are fern root, yams, clams, aod potatoes: when by any accident theſe fail, the diſtreſs muſt be dreadful; and even among the inhabitants of the coaſt, many tribes muſt frequently be reduced to nearly the ſame ſituation, either by the failure of their plantations, or the deficiency of their dry ſtock, during the ſeaſon when but few fiſh are to be caught. Theſe conſiderations will enable us to account, not only for the perpetual danger in which the people who inhabit this country appear to live, by the care which they take to fortify every village, but for the horrid practice of eating thoſe who are killed in battle; for the hunger of him who is preſſed by famine to fight, will abſorb every feeling, and every ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which would reſtrain him from allaying it with the body of his adverſary. It may however be remarked, that if this account of the origin of ſo horrid a practice is true, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief does by no means end with the neceſſity that produced it: after the practice has been once begun on one ſide by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it will naturally be adopted on the other by revenge. Nor is this all, for though it may be pretended, by ſome who wiſh to appear ſpeculative and philoſophical, that whether the dead body of an enemy be eaten or buried, is in itſelf a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfectly indifferent; as it is, whether the breaſts and thighs of a woman ſhould be covered or naked; and that prejudice
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013324_0313_0F90503805CA0288"/>
and habit only make us ſhudder at the violation of cuſtom in one inſtance, and bluſh at it in the other: yet, leaving this as a point of doubtful diſputation, to be diſcuſſed at leiſure, it may ſafely be affirmed, that the practice of eating human fleſh, whatever it may be in itſelf, is relatively, and in its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, moſt pernicious; tending manifeſtly to eradicate a principle which is the chief ſecurity of human life, and more frequently reſtrains the hand of murder than the ſenſe of duty, or even the fear of puniſhment.</p>
                        <p>Among thoſe who are accuſtomed to eat the dead, death muſt have loſt much of its horror; and where there is little horror at the ſight of death, there will not be much repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to kill. A ſenſe of duty, and fear of puniſhment, may be more eaſily ſurmounted than the feelings of nature, or thoſe which have been engrafted upon nature by early prejudice and uninterrupted cuſtom. The horror of the murderer ariſes leſs from the guilt of the fact, than its natural effect; and he who has familiariſed the effect, will conſequently looſe much of the horror. By our laws, and our religion, murder and theft in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the ſame puniſhment, both in this world and the next; yet, of the multitude who would deliberately ſteal, there are but very few who would deliberately kill, even to procure much greater advantage. But there is the ſtrongeſt reaſon to believe, that thoſe who have been ſo accuſtomed to prepare a human body for a meal, that they can with as little feeling cut up a dead man, as our cook-maids divide a dead rabit for a fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſee, would feel as little horror in committing a murder, as in picking a pocket, and conſequently would take away life with as little compunction as property; ſo that men, under theſe circumſtances, would be made murderers by the ſlight temptations that now make them thieves. If any man doubts whether this reaſon is concluſive, let him aſk himſelf, whether in his own opinion he ſhould not be ſafer with a man in whom the horror of deſtroying life is ſtrong, whether in conſequence of natural inſtinct unſubdued, or of early prejudice, which has nearly an equal influence; than in the power of a man who under any temptation to murder him would be reſtrained only by conſiderations of intereſt; for to theſe all motives of mere duty may be reduced, as they muſt terminate either in hope of good, or fear of evil.</p>
                        <p>The ſituation and circumſtances, however, of theſe poor people, as well as their temper, are favourable to thoſe who ſhall ſettle as a colony among them. Their ſituation ſets them in need of protection, and their temper renders it eaſy to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach them by kindneſs; and whatever may be ſaid in favour of a ſavage life, among people who live in luxurious idleneſs upon the bounty of nature, civilization would certainly be a bleſſing to thoſe whom her parſimony ſcarcely furniſhes with
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013324_0314_0F90EC9DF1891F30"/>
the bread of life, and who are perpetually deſtroying each other by violence, as the only alternative of periſhing by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                        <p>But theſe people, from whatever cauſe, being inured to war, and by habit conſidering every ſtranger as an enemy, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſpoſed to attack us when they were not intimidated by our manifeſt ſuperiority. At firſt, they had no notion of any ſuperiority but numbers; and when this was on their ſide, they conſidered all our expreſſions of kindneſs as the artifices of fear and cunning, to circumvent them, and preſerve ourſelves; but when they were once convinced of our power, after having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked us to the uſe of our fire-arms, tho' loaded only with ſmall ſhot; and of our clemency by forbearing to make uſe of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons ſo dreadful, except in our defence; they became at once friendly, and even affectionate, placing in us the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded confidence, and doing every thing which could incite us to put equal confidence in them. It is alſo remarkable, that when an intercourſe was once eſtabliſhed between us, they were very rarely detected in any act of diſhoneſty. Before, indeed, and while they conſidered us as enemies, who came upon their coaſt only to make an advantage of them, they did not ſcruple by any means to make an advantage of us; and would, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when they had received the price of any thing they had offered to ſell, pack up both the purchaſe and purchaſe-money with all poſſible compoſure, as ſo much lawful plunder from people who had no view but to plunder them.</p>
                        <p>I have obſerved that our friends in the South Seas had not even the idea of indecency, with reſpect to any object or any action; but this was by no means the caſe with the inhabitants of New Zealand, in whoſe carriage and converſation there was as much modeſt reſerve and decorum with reſpect to actions, which yet in their opinion were not criminal, as are to be found among the politeſt people in Europe. The women were not impregnable; but the terms and manner of compliance were as decent as thoſe in marriage among us, and according to their notions, the agreement was as innocent. When any of our people made an overture to one of their young women, he was given to underſtand that the conſent of her friends was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and by the influence of a proper preſent, it was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained; but when theſe preliminaries were ſettled, it was alſo neceſſary to treat the wife for a night, with the ſame delicacy that is here required by the wife for life, and the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver who preſumed to take any liberties by which this was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, was ſure to be diſappointed.</p>
                        <p>One of our gentlemen having made his addreſſes to a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the better ſort, received an anſwer, which, tranſlated into our language, according to the mode and ſpirit of it, as well as the letter, would have been exactly in theſe terms: <q>Any
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013324_0315_0F90F276FB5A7D10"/>
of theſe young ladies will think themſelves honoured by your addreſſes, but you muſt firſt make me a ſuitable preſent, and you muſt then come and ſleep with us on ſhore, for day-light muſt by no means be a witneſs of what paſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have already obſerved, that in perſonal cleanlineſs they are not quite equal to our friends at Otaheite, becauſe, not having the advantage of ſo warm a climate, they do not ſo oſter go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water; but the moſt diſguſtful thing about them is the oil, with which, like the iſlanders, they anoint their hair: it is certainly the fat either of fiſh or birds, melted down, and though the better ſort have it freſh, their inferiors uſe that which is rancid, and conſequently are almoſt as diſagreeable to the ſmell as a Hottentot; neither are their heads free from vermin, though we obſerved that they were furniſhed with combs, both of bone and wood: theſe combs are ſometimes worn, ſtuck upright in the hair as an ornament, a faſhion which at preſent prevails among the ladies of England. The men generally wear their beards ſhort, and their hair tied upon the crown of the head, in a bunch, in which they ſtick the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of various birds, in different manners, according to their fancies; ſometimes one is placed on each ſide of the temples, pointing forwards, which, we thought, made a very diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appearance. The women wear their hair ſometimes cropped ſhort, and ſometimes flowing over their ſhoulders.</p>
                        <p>The bodies of both ſexes are marked with the black ſtains called Amoco, by the ſame method that is uſed at Otaheite, and called Tattowing; but the men are more marked, and the women leſs. The women in general ſtain no part of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies but the lips, though ſometimes they are marked with ſmall black patches on other parts; the men, on the contrary, ſeem to add ſomething every year to the ornaments of the laſt, ſo that ſome of them, who appeared to be of an advanced age, were almoſt covered from head to foot. Beſides the Amoco, they have marks impreſſed by a method unknown to us, of a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary kind: they are furrows of about a line deep, and a line broad, ſuch as appear upon the bark of a tree which has been cut through, after a year's growth: the edges of theſe furrows are afterwards indented by the ſame method, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly black, they make a moſt frightful appearance. The faces of the old men are almoſt covered with theſe marks; thoſe who are very young, black only their lips like the women; when they are ſomewhat older, they have generally a black patch upon one cheek, and over one eye, and ſo proceed gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, that they may grow old and honourable together: but though we could not but be diſguſted with the horrid Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which theſe ſtains and furrows produced in the <q>human face divine,</q> we could not but admire the dexterity and art
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013324_0316_0F90F27A746CEDD0"/>
with which they were impreſſed. The marks upon the face in general are ſpirals, which are drawn with great nicety, and even elegance, thoſe on one ſide exactly correſponding with thoſe on the other: the marks on the body ſomewhat reſemble the foliage in old chaſed ornaments, and the convolutions of fill agree work; but in theſe they have ſuch a luxuriance of fancy, that of an hundred, which at firſt ſight appeared to be exactly the ſame, no two were, upon a cloſe examination, found to be alike. We obſerved, that the quantity and form of theſe marks were different in different parts of the coaſt, and that as the principal ſeat of them at Otaheite was the breach, in New Zealand it was ſometimes the only part which was free, and in general was leſs diſtinguiſhed than any other.</p>
                        <p>The ſkins of theſe people, however, are not only dyed, but painted, for as I have before obſerved, they ſmear their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with red oker, ſome rubbing it on dry, and ſome apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in large patches mixed with oil, which is always wet, and which the leaſt touch will rub off, ſo that the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſuch of our people as were guilty of raviſhing a kiſs from theſe blooming beauties, were moſt legibly written upon their faces.</p>
                        <p>The dreſs of a New Zealander is certainly, to a ſtranger at firſt ſight, the moſt uncouth that can be imagined. It is made of the leaves of the flag, which has been deſcribed among the vegetable productions of this country: theſe leaves are ſplit into three or four ſlips, and the ſlips, when they are dry, interwoven with each other into a kind of ſtuff between netting and cloth, with all the ends, which are eight or nine inches long, hanging out on the upper ſide, like the ſhag or thrumb matts, which we ſometimes ſee lying in a paſſage. Of this cloth, if cloth it may be called, two pieces ſerve for a complete dreſs; one of them is tied over their ſhoulders with a ſtring, and reaches as low as their knees; to the end of this ſtring is faſtened a bodkin of bone, which is eaſily paſſed through any two parts of this upper garment, ſo as to tack them together; the other piece is wrapped round the waiſt, and reaches nearly to the ground: the lower garment, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is worn by the men only upon particular occaſions; but they wear a belt, to which a ſtring is faſtened, for a very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular uſe. The inhabitants of the South Sea iſlands ſlit up the prepuce ſo as to prevent it from covering the glans of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, but theſe people, on the contrary, bring the prepuce over the glans, and to prevent it from being drawn back by the contraction of the part, they tie the ſtring which hangs from their girdle, round the end of it. The glans indeed ſeemed to be the only part of their body which they were ſolicitous to conceal, for they frequently threw off all their dreſs but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

manifeſt ſigns of confuſion, when, to gratify our curioſity, they were requeſted to untie the ſtring, and never conſented but with the utmoſt reluctance and ſhame. When they have only their upper garment on, and ſit upon their hams, they bear ſome reſemblance to a thatched houſe; but this covering, though it is ugly, is well adapted to the uſe of thoſe who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſleep in the open air, without any other ſhelter from the rain.</p>
                        <p>But beſides this courſe ſhag or thatch, they have two ſorts of cloth, which have an even ſurface, and are very ingeniouſly made, in the ſame manner with that manuf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

One ſort is as coarſe as our coarſeſt canvas, and ſomewhat reſembles it in the manner of laying the threads, but it is ten times as ſtrong: the other is formed by many threads lying very cloſe one way, and a few croſſing them the other, ſo as to bind them together; but theſe are about half an inch aſunder, ſomewhat like the round pieces of cane matting which are ſometimes placed under the diſhes upon a table. This is frequently ſtriped, and always had a pretty appearance, for it is compoſed of the fibres of the ſame plant, which are prepared ſo as to ſhine like ſilk. It is made in a kind of frame, of the ſize of the cloth, generally about five feet long, and four broad, acroſs which the long threads, which lie cloſe together, or warp, are ſtrained, and the croſs threads or woof, are worked in by hand, which muſt be a very tedious operation.</p>
                        <p>To both theſe kinds of cloth they work borders of different colours, in ſtitches, ſomewhat like carpeting, or rather like thoſe uſed in the ſamplars which girls work at ſchool. Theſe borders are of various patterns, and wrought with a neatneſs, and even an elegance, which, conſidering they have no needle, is ſurprizing: but the great pride of their dreſs conſiſts in the fur of their dogs, which they uſe with ſuch oeconomy that they cut it into ſtripes, and ſew them upon their cloth at a diſtance from each other, which is a ſtrong proof that dogs are not plenty among them; theſe ſtripes are alſo of different colours, and diſpoſed ſo as to produce a pleaſing effect. We ſaw ſome dreſſes that were adorned with feathers inſtead of fur, but theſe were not common; and we ſaw one that was entirely covered with the red feathers of the parrot.</p>
                        <p>The dreſs of the man who was killed, when we firſt went aſhore in Poverty Bay, has been deſcribed already; but we ſaw the ſame dreſs only once more during our ſtay upon the coaſt, and that was in Queen Charlotte's Sound.</p>
                        <p>The women, contrary to the cuſtom of the ſex in general, ſeemed to affect dreſs rather leſs than the men: their hair, which, as I have obſerved before, is generally cropt ſhort, is never tied upon the top of the head when it is ſuffered to be
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013324_0318_0F90F27C33B0FC88"/>
long, nor is it ever adorned with feathers. Their garments were made of the ſame materials, and in the ſame form, as thoſe of the other ſex, but the lower one was always bound faſt round them, except when they went into the water to catch lobſters, and then they took great care not to be ſeen by the men. Some of us happening one day to land upon a ſmall iſland in Tolaga Bay, we ſurprized ſeveral of them at this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; and the chaſte Diana, with her nymphs, could not have diſcovered more confuſion and diſtreſs at the ſight of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeon, than theſe women expreſſed upon our approach. Some of them hid themſelves among the rocks, and the reſt crouched down in the ſea till they had made themſelves a girdle and apron of ſuch weeds as they could find, and when they came out, even with this veil, we could perceive that their modeſty ſuffered much pain by our preſence. The girdle and apron which they wear in common, have been mentioned before.</p>
                        <p>Both ſexes bore their ears, and by ſtretching them the holes become large enough to admit a ſinger at leaſt. In theſe holes they wear ornaments of various kinds, cloth, feathers, bones of large birds, and even ſometimes a ſtick of wood; and to theſe receptacles of finery they generally applied the nails which we gave them, and every thing which it was poſſible they could contain. The women ſometimes thruſt through them the down of the albatroſs, which is as white as ſnow, and which, ſpreading before and behind the hole in a bunch almoſt as big as the fiſt, makes a very ſingular, and however ſtrange it may be thought, not a diſagreeable appearance. Beſides the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are thruſt through the holes of the ears, many others are ſuſpended to them by ſtrings; ſuch as chiſſels or bodkins made of green talc, upon which they ſet a high value, the nails and teeth of their deceaſed relations, the teeth of dogs, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing elſe that they can get, which they think either curious or valuable. The women alſo wear bracelets and anclets, made of the bones of birds, ſhells, or any other ſubſtances which they can perforate, and ſtring upon a thread. The men had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hanging to a ſtring, which went round the neck, a piece of green talc, or whalebone, ſomewhat in the ſhape of a tongue, with the rude figure of a man carved upon it; and upon this ornament they ſet a high value. In one inſtance, we ſaw the griſtle that divides the noſtrils, and called by anatomiſts, the <hi>ſeptum naſi,</hi> perforated, and a feather thruſt through the hole, which projected on each ſide over the cheeks: it is probable that this frightful ſingularity was intended as an ornament, but of the many people we ſaw, we never obſerved it in any other, nor even a perforation that might occaſionally ſerve for ſuch a purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>Their houſes are the moſt inartificially made of any thing among them, being ſcarcely equal, except in ſize, to an Engliſh dog-kennel:
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013324_0319_0F905038A7A2AEC8"/>
they are ſeldom more than eighteen or twenty feet long, eight or ten broad, and five or ſix high, from the pole that runs from one end to the other, and forms the ridge, to the ground: the framing is of wood, generally ſlender ſticks, and both walls and roof conſiſt of dry graſs and hay, which, it muſt be confeſſed, is very tightly put together; and ſome are alſo lined with the bark of trees, ſo that in cold weather they muſt afford a very comfortable retreat. The roof is ſlop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like thoſe of our barns, and the door is at one end, juſt high enough to admit a man, creeping upon his hands and knees: near the door is a ſquare hole, which ſerves for the double office of window and chimney, for the fire-place is at that end, nearly in the middle between the two ſides: in ſome conſpicuous part, and generally near the door, a plank is fixed, covered with carving after their manner: this they value as we do a picture, and in their eſtimation it is not an inferior orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the ſide walls aud roof project about two feet beyond the walls at each end, ſo as to form a kind of porch, in which there are benches for the accommodation of the family. That part of the floor which is allotted for the fire-place, is encloſed in a hollow ſquare, by partitions either of wood or ſtone, and in the middle of it the fire is kindled. The floor along the inſide of the walls, is thickly covered with ſtraw, and upon this the family ſleep.</p>
                        <p>Their furniture and implements conſiſt of but few articles, and one cheſt commonly contains them all, except their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion baſkets, the gourds that hold their freſh water, and the hammers that are uſed to beat their fern-root, which generally ſtand without the door: ſome rude tools, their cloaths, arms, and a few feathers to ſtick in their hair, make the reſt of their treaſure.</p>
                        <p>Some of the better ſort, whoſe families are large, have three or four houſes encloſed within a court-yard, the walls of which are conſtructed of poles and hay, and are about ten or twelve feet high.</p>
                        <p>When we were on ſhore in the diſtrict called Tolaga, we ſaw the ruins, or rather the frame of a houſe, for it had never been finiſhed, much ſuperior in ſize to any that we ſaw elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: it was thirty feet in length, about fifteen in breadth, and twelve high: the ſides of it were adorned with many carv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed planks, of a workmanſhip much ſuperior to any other that we had met with in the country; but for what purpoſe it was built, or why it was deſerted, we could never learn.</p>
                        <p>But theſe people, though in their houſes they are ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from the inclemency of the weather, ſeem to be quite indifferent whether they have any ſhelter at all during their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions in ſearch of fern roots and fiſh, ſometimes ſetting up a ſmall ſhade to windward, and ſometimes altogether neglecting
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013324_0320_0F90F27D473A0578"/>
even that precaution, ſleeping with their women and children under buſhes, with their weapons ranged round them, in the manner that has already been deſcribed. The party conſiſting of forty or fifty, whom we ſaw at Mercury Bay, in a diſtrict which the natives call Opoorage, never erected the leaſt ſhelter while we ſtaid there, though it ſometimes rained inceſſantly for four and twenty hours together.</p>
                        <p>The articles of their food have been enumerated already; the principal, which to them is what bread is to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Europe, is the roots of the fern which grows upon the hills, and is nearly the ſame with what grows upon our high commons in England, and is called indifferently fern, bracken, or brakes. The birds which ſometimes ſerve them for a feaſt, are chiefly penguins and albatroſſes, with a few other ſpecies that have been occaſionally mentioned in this narrative.</p>
                        <p>Having no veſſel in which water can be boiled, their cooke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiſts wholly of baking and roaſting. They bake nearly in the ſame manner as the inhabitants of the South Seas, and to the account that has been already given of their roaſting, nothing need be added, but that the long ſkewer or ſpit, to which the fleſh is faſtened, is placed ſloping towards the fire, by ſetting one ſtone againſt the bottom of it, and ſupporting it near the middle with another, by the moving of which to a greater or leſs diſtance from the end, the degree of obliquity is increaſed, or diminiſhed, at pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>To the northward, as I have obſerved, there are plantations of yams, ſweet potatoes, and coccos, but we ſaw no ſuch to the ſouthward; the inhabitants therefore of that part of the country muſt ſubſiſt wholly upon fern root and fiſh, except the ſcanty and accidental reſource which they may find in ſea fowl and dogs; and that fern and fiſh are not to be procured at all ſeaſons of the year, even at the ſea ſide, and upon the neighbouring hills, is manifeſt from the ſtores of both that we ſaw laid up dry, and the reluctance which ſome of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed at ſelling any part of them to us when we offered to purchaſe them, at leaſt the fiſh, for ſea ſtores: and this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſeems to confirm my opinion that this country ſcarcely ſuſtains the preſent number of its inhabitants, who are urged to perpetual hoſtilities by hunger, which naturally prompted them to eat the dead bodies of thoſe who were ſlain in the conteſt.</p>
                        <p>Water is their univerſal and only liquor, as far as we could diſcover, and if they have really no means of intoxication, they are, in this particular, happy beyond any other people that we have yet ſeen or heard of.</p>
                        <p>As there is perhaps no ſource of diſeaſe either critical or chronic, but intemperance and inactivity, it cannot be thought ſtrange that theſe people enjoy perfect and uninterrupted
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013324_0321_0F90F27F400C3500"/>
health: in all our viſits to their towns, where young and old, men and women, crouded about us, prompted by the ſame curioſity that carried us to look at them, we never ſaw a ſingle perſon who appeared to have any bodily complaint, nor among the numbers that we have ſeen naked, did we once perceive the ſlighteſt eruption upon the ſkin, or any marks that an eruption had left behind: at firſt, indeed, obſerving that ſome of them when they came off to us were marked in patches with a white flowery appearance upon different parts of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, we thought that they were leprous, or highly ſcorbutic; but upon examination we found that theſe marks were owing to their having been wetted by the ſprey of the ſea in their paſſage, which, when it was dried away, left the ſalts behind it in a fine white powder.</p>
                        <p>Another proof of health, which we have mentioned upon a former occaſion, is the facility with which the wounds healed that had left ſcars behind them, and that we ſaw in a recent ſtate; when we ſaw the man who had been ſhot with a muſket ball thro' the fleſhy part of his arm, his wound ſeemed to be ſo well digeſted, and in ſo fair a way of being perfectly healed, that if I had not known no application had been made to it, I ſhould certainly have enquired, with a very intereſted curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, after the vulnerary herbs, and ſurgical art of the country.</p>
                        <p>A farther proof that human nature is here untainted with diſeaſe, is the great number of old men that we ſaw, many of whom, by the loſs of their hair and teeth, appeared to be very ancient, yet none of them were decrepit, and though not equal to the young in muſcular ſtrength, were not a whit behind them in cheerfulneſs and vivacity.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. X. Of the canoes and navigation of the inhabitants of New Zealand; their tillage, weapons, &amp;c.</head>
                        <p>THE ingenuity of theſe people appears in nothing more than in their canoes; they are long and narrow, and in ſhape very much reſemble a New England whale boat: the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſort ſeem to be built chiefly for war, and will carry from forty to eighty, or an hundred armed men. We meaſured one which lay aſhore at Tolaga: ſhe was ſixty-eight feet and an half long, five feet broad, and three feet and an half deep; the bottom was ſharp, with ſtrait ſides like a wedge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of three lengths, hollowed out to about two inches, or an
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013324_0322_0F90F27F63654780"/>
inch and an half thick, and well faſtened together with ſtrong plaiting: each ſide conſiſted of one entire plank, ſixty-three feet long, ten or twelve inches broad, and about an inch and a quarter thick, and theſe were fitted and laſhed to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom part with great dexterity and ſtrength. A conſiderable number of thwarts were laid from gunwale to gunwale, to which they were ſecurely laſhed on each ſide, as a ſtrenthening to the boat. The ornament at the head projected five or ſix feet beyond the body, and was about four feet and an half high; the ornament at the ſtern was fixed upon that end, as the ſtern-poſt of a ſhip is upon her keel, and was about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen feet high, two feet broad, and an inch and and half thick. They both conſiſted of boards of carved work; of which the deſign was much better than the execution. All their canoes, except a few at Opoorage or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> Bay, which were of one piece, and hollowed by fire, are built after this plan, and few are leſs than twenty feet long: ſome of the ſmaller ſort have outriggers, and ſometimes two of them are joined together, but this is not common. The carving upon the ſtern and head ornaments of the inferior boats, which ſeem to be intended wholly for fiſhing, conſiſts of the figure of a man, with a face as ugly as can be conceived, and a monſtrous tongue thruſt out of the mouth, with the white ſhells of ſea ears ſtuck in for the eyes. But the canoes of the ſuperior kind, which ſeem to be their men of war, are magnificently adorned with open work, and covered with looſe fringes of black feathers, which had a moſt elegant appearance: the gunwale boards were alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently carved in a groteſque taſte, and adorned with tufts of white feathers, placed upon a black ground. Of viſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that are wholly new, no verbal deſcription can convey a juſt idea, but in proportion as they reſemble ſome that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready known, to which the mind of the reader muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: the carving of theſe people are of a ſingular kind, and not in the likeneſs of any thing that is known on our ſide of the ocean, <q>either in the heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters that are under the earth.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The paddles are ſmall, light, and neatly made; the blade of it is of an oval ſhape, or rather of a ſhape reſembling a large leaf, pointed at the bottom, broadeſt in the middle, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually looſing itſelf in the ſhaft, the whole length being about ſix feet, of which the ſhaft or loom, including the handle, is four, and the blade two. By the help of theſe oars they puſh on their boats with amazing velocity.</p>
                        <p>In ſailing they are not expert, having no art of going other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than before the wind: the ſail is of netting or matt, which is ſet up between two poles that are fixed upright upon each gunwale, and ſerve both for maſts and yards: two ropes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the purpoſe of ſheets, and were conſequently faſtened
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013324_0323_0F90F27FF0E97FE8"/>
above, to the top of each pole. But clumſy and inconvenient as this apparatus is, they make good way before the wind, and are ſteered by two men who ſit in the ſtern, with each a paddle in his hand for that purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>Having ſaid thus much of their workmanſhip, I ſhall now give ſome account of their tools; they have adzes, axes, and chiſſels, which ſerve them alſo as augers for the boring of holes: as they have no metal, their adzes and axes are made of a hard black ſtone, or of a green talc, which is not only hard but tough; and their chiſſels of human bone, or ſmall frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of jaſpar, which they chip off from a block in ſharp an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular pieces, like a gun-flint. Their axes they value above all that they poſſeſs, and never would part with one of them for any thing that we could give: I once offered one of the beſt axes I had in the ſhip, beſides a number of other things for one of them, but the owner would not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ell it; from which I conclude that good ones are ſcarce among them. Their ſmall tools of jaſpar, which are uſed in finiſhing their niceſt work, they uſe till they are blunt, and then, as they have no means of ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening them, throw them away. We had given the people at Tolaga a piece of glaſs, and in a ſhort time they found means to drill a hole through it, in order to hang it round the neck as as ornament by a thread; and we imagine the tool muſt have been a piece of this jaſpar. How they bring their large tools firſt to an edge, and ſharpen the weapon which they call Patoo-Patoo, we could not certainly learn; but probably it is by bruiſing the ſame ſubſtance to powder, and, with this, grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two pieces againſt each other.</p>
                        <p>Their nets, particularly their ſeine, which is of an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſize, have been mentioned already: one of theſe ſeems to be the joint work of a whole town, and I ſuppoſe it to be the joint property alſo: the other net, which is circular, and extended by two or three hoops, has been particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, as well as the manner of baiting and uſing it. Their hooks are of bone or ſhell, and in general are ill made. To receive the fiſh when it is caught, and to hold their other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, they have baſkets of various kinds and dimenſions, very neatly made of wicker work.</p>
                        <p>They excel in tillage, as might naturally be expected where the perſon that ſows is to eat the produce, and where there is ſo little beſides that can be eaten: when we firſt came to TE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GADOO, a diſtrict between Poverty Bay and Eaſt Cape, their crops were juſt covered, and had not yet begun to ſprout; the mould was as ſmooth as in a garden, and every root had its ſmall hillock, ranged in a regular quincunx by lines, which, with the pegs, were ſtill remaining in the field. We had not an opportunity to ſee any of theſe huſbandmen work, but we ſaw what ſerves them at once for ſpade and plough: this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013324_0324_0F90F28554BDB910"/>
is nothing more than a long narrow ſtake ſharpened to an edge at one end, with a ſhort piece faſtened tranſverſely at a little diſtance above it, for the convenience of preſſing it down with the foot. With this they turn up pieces of ground ſix or ſeven acres in extent, though it is not more than three inches broad; but as the ſoil is light and ſandy it makes little reſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>Tillage, weaving, and the other arts of peace, ſeem to be beſt known and moſt practiſed in the northern part of this country; for there is little appearance of any of them in the South: but the arts of war flouriſh equally through the whole coaſt.</p>
                        <p>Of weapons they have no great variety, but ſuch as they have are well fitted for deſtruction; they have ſpears, darts, battle-axes, and the Patoo-Patoo. The ſpear is fourteen or fifteen feet long, pointed at both ends, and ſometimes headed with bone: theſe are graſped by the middle, ſo that the part behind balancing that before, makes a puſh more difficult to be parried, than that of a weapon which is held by the end. The dart and other weapons have been ſufficiently deſcribed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and it has alſo been remarked, that theſe people have neither ſling nor bow. They throw the dart by hand, and ſo they do ſtones; but darts and ſtones are ſeldom uſed, except in defending their forts. Their battles, whether in boats or on ſhore, are generally hand to hand, and the ſlaughter muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently be great, as a ſecond blow with any of their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons is unneceſſary, if the firſt takes place: their truſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſeems to be principally placed in the Patoo-Patoo, which is faſtened to their wriſts by a ſtrong ſtrap, leſt it ſhould be wrenched from them, and which the principal people generally wear ſticking in their girdles, conſidering it as a military or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, and part of their dreſs, like the poinard of the Aſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, and the ſword of the European. They have no defenſive armour; but, beſides their weapons, the Chiefs carried a ſtaff of diſtinction, in the ſame manner as our officers do the ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toon: this was generally the rib of a whale, as white as ſnow, with many ornaments of carved work, dog's hair, and feathers; but ſometimes it was a ſtick, about ſix feet long, adorned in the ſame manner, and inlaid with a ſhell like mother-of-pearl. Thoſe who bore this mark of diſtinction were generally old, at leaſt paſt the middle age, and were alſo more marked with the <hi>Amoco</hi> than the reſt.</p>
                        <p>One or more perſons, thus diſtinguiſhed, always appeared in each canoe; when they came to attack us, according to the ſize of it. When they came within about a cable's length of the ſhip, they uſed to ſtop, and the Chiefs riſing from their ſeat, put on a dreſs which ſeemed appropriated to the occaſion, generally of dog's ſkin, and holding out their decorated ſtaff, or a weapon, directed the reſt of the people what they ſhould
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013324_0325_0F8FFB8CAD19CAA8"/>
do. When they were at too great a diſtance to reach us with a lance or a ſtone, they preſumed that we had no weapons with which we could reach them, here then the defiance was given, and the words were almoſt univerſally the ſame, <hi>Haromai, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romai, har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>e uta a Patoo-Patoo age:</hi> 
                           <q>Come to us, come on ſhore, and we will kill you all with our Patoo-Patoos.</q> While they were uttering theſe menaces they came gradually nearer and nearer, till they were cloſe along ſide; talking at intervals in a peaceable ſtrain, and anſwering any queſtions that we aſked them; and at intervals renewing their defiance and threats, till being encouraged by our apparent timidity, they began their war-ſong and dance, as a prelude to an attack, which always followed, and was ſometimes continued till it became abſolutely neceſſary to repreſs them by firing ſome ſmall-ſhot; and ſometimes ended after throwing a few ſtones on board, as if content with having offered us an inſult, which we did not dare to revenge.</p>
                        <p>The war-dance conſiſts of a great variety of violent motions, and hideous contortions of the limbs, during which the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance alſo performs its part; the tongue is frequently thruſt out to an incredible length, and the eye-lids ſo forcibly drawn up that the white appears both above and below, as well as on each ſide of the iris, ſo as to form a circle round it; nor is any thing neglected that can render the human ſhape frightful and deformed: at the ſame time they brandiſh their ſpears, ſhake their darts, and cleave the air with their Patoo-Patoos. This horrid dance is always accompanied by a ſong; it is wild indeed, but not diſagreeable, and every ſtrain ends in a loud and deep ſigh, which they utter in concert. In the motions of the dance, however horrid, there is a ſtrength, firmneſs, and agility, which we could not but behold with admiration; and in their ſong they keep time with ſuch exactneſs, that I have often heard above an hundred paddles ſtruck againſt the ſides, of their boats at once, ſo as to produce but a ſingle ſound, at the diviſions of their muſic.</p>
                        <p>A ſong not altogether unlike this, they ſometimes ſing without the dance, and as a peaceable amuſement: they have alſo other ſongs which are ſung by the women, whoſe voices are remarkably mellow and ſoft, and have a pleaſing and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der effect; the time is ſlow, and the cadence mournful; but it is conducted with more taſte than could be expected among the poor ignorant ſavages of this half deſolate country; eſpecially as it appeared to us, who were none of us much acquainted with muſic as a ſcience, to be ſung in parts; it was at leaſt ſung by many voices at the ſame time.</p>
                        <p>They have ſonorous inſtruments, but they can ſcarcely be called inſtruments of muſic; one is the ſhell, called the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's trumpet, with which they make a noiſe not unlike that
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013324_0326_0F90F2884387F9F8"/>
which our boys ſometimes make with a cow's horn: the other is a ſmall wooden pipe, reſembling a child's nine-pin, only much ſmaller, and in this there is no more muſic than in a pea-whiſtle. They ſeem ſenſible indeed that theſe inſtruments are not muſical; for we never heard an attempt to ſing to them, or to produce with them any meaſured tones that bore the leaſt reſemblance to a tune.</p>
                        <p>To what has been already ſaid of the practice of eating hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fleſh, I ſhall only add, that in almoſt every cove where we landed, we found fleſh bones of men near the places where fires had been made; and that among the heads that were brought on board by the old man, ſome ſeemed to have falſe eyes, and ornaments in their ears as if alive. That which Mr. Banks bought was ſold with great reluctance by the poſſeſſor: the head was manifeſtly that of a young perſon about fourteen or fifteen years of age, and by the contuſions on one ſide ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have received many violent blows, and indeed a part of the bone near the eye was wanting. Theſe appearances confirmed us in the opinion that the natives of this country give no quarter, nor take any priſoners to be killed and eaten at a future time, as is ſaid to have been a practice among the Indians of Florida: for if priſoners had been taken, this poor young creature, who cannot be ſuppoſed capable of making much reſiſtance, would probably have been one, and we knew that he was killed with the reſt, for the fray had happened but a few days before.</p>
                        <p>The towns or Hippahs of theſe people, which are all forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, have been ſufficiently deſcribed already, and from the Bay of Plenty to Queen Charlotte's Sound they ſeem to be the conſtant reſidence of the people: but about Poverty Bay, Hawk's Bay, Tegadoo, and Tolaga, we ſaw no Hippahs, but ſingle houſes ſcattered at a diſtance from each other; yet upon the ſides of the hills there were ſtages of great length, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſtones and darts, probably as retreats for the people at the laſt extremity, as upon theſe ſtages a fight may be carried on with much advantage againſt thoſe below, who may be reached, with great effect, by darts and ſtones, which it is impoſſible for them to throw up with equal force. And indeed the forts themſelves ſeem to be no farther ſerviceable than by enabling the poſſeſſors to repreſs a ſudden attack; for as there is no ſupply of water within the lines, it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſuſtain a ſiege. A conſiderable ſtock of fern-root and dry fiſh is indeed laid up in them; but they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved againſt ſeaſons of ſcarcity, and that ſuch ſeaſons there are, our obſervations left us no room to doubt; beſides, while an enemy ſhould be prowling in the neighbourhood, it would be eaſy to ſnatch a ſupply of water from the ſide of the hill, though it would be impoſſible to dig up fern root, or catch fiſh.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="38" facs="unknown:013324_0327_0F8FFB8D91CD5B98"/>
In this diſtrict, however, the people ſeemed to live in a ſtate of conſcious ſecurity, and to avail themſelves of their advantage: their plantations were more numerous, their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes were more decorated, and they had not only finer carv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but finer clothes. This part of the coaſt alſo was much the moſt populous, and poſſibly their apparent peace and plenty might ariſe from their being united under one Chief, or King; for the inhabitants of all this part of the country told us, that they were the ſubjects of Teratu: when they pointed to the reſidence of this Prince, it was in a direction which we thought inland; but which, when we knew the country better, we found to be the Bay of Plenty.</p>
                        <p>It is much to be regretted that we were obliged to leave this country without knowing any thing of Teratu but his name. As an Indian Monarch his territory is certainly extenſive: he was acknowledged from Cape Kidnappers to the northward, and weſtward as far as the Bay of Plenty, a length of coaſt upwards of eighty leagues; and we do not yet know how much farther weſtward his dominions may extend. Poſſibly the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified towns we ſaw in the Bay of Plenty may be his Barrier; eſpecially as at Mercury Bay he was not acknowledged, nor indeed any other ſingle Chief: for wherever we landed, or ſpoke with the people upon that coaſt, they told us that we were but at a ſmall diſtance from their enemies.</p>
                        <p>In the dominions of Teratu we ſaw ſeveral ſubordinate Chiefs, to whom great reſpect was paid, and by whom juſtice was probably adminiſtered; for upon our complaint to one of them, of a theft that had been committed on board the ſhip by a man that came with him, he gave him ſeveral blows and kicks, which the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>eived as the chaſtiſement of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, againſt which no reſiſtance was to be made, and which he had no right to reſent. Whether this authority was poſſeſſed by appointment or inheritance we could not learn; but we obſerved that the Chiefs, as well here as in other parts, were elderly men. In other parts, however, we learnt that they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed their authority by inheritance.</p>
                        <p>The little ſocieties which we found in the ſouthern parts ſeemed to have ſeveral things in common, particularly their fine clothes and fiſhing nets. Their fine clothes, which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly might be the ſpoils of war, were kept in a ſmall hut, which was erected for that purpoſe in the middle of the town: the nets we ſaw making in almoſt every houſe, and the ſeveral parts being afterwards collected were joined together. Leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſeems to be made of the women here than in the South Sea iſlands; ſuch at leaſt was the opinion of Tupia, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of it as an indignity to the ſex. We obſerved that the two ſexes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

till the ground, make nets, catch birds, and go out in their boats to fiſh; and that the women dig up fern roots, collect lobſters and other ſhell fiſh near the beach, dreſs the victuals, and weave cloth: ſuch at leaſt were their employments when we had an opportunity of obſerving them, which was but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for in general our appearance made a holiday wherever we went, men, women, and children, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> round us, either to gratify their curioſity, or to purchaſe ſome of the valuable merchandize which we carried about with us, conſiſting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally of nails, paper, and broken glaſs.</p>
                        <p>Of the religion of theſe people it cannot be ſuppoſed that we could learn much; they acknowledge the influence of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior beings, one of whom is ſupreme, and the reſt ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate; and gave nearly the ſame account of the origin of the world, and the production of mankind, as our friends in Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heite: Tupia, however, ſeemed to have a much more deep and extenſive knowledge of theſe ſubjects than any of the people here; and whenever he was diſpoſed to inſtruct them, which he ſometimes did in a long diſcourſe, he was ſure of a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous audience, who liſtened in profound ſilence, with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and attention, that we could not but wiſh them a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teacher.</p>
                        <p>What homage they pay to the deities they acknowledge we could not learn; but we ſaw no place of public worſhip, like the Morais of the South Sea iſlands: yet we ſaw, near a plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſweet potatoes, a ſmall area, of a ſquare figure, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with ſtones, in the middle of which one of the ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſtakes, which they uſe as a ſpade, was ſet up, and upon it was hung a baſket of fern roots: upon enquiry, the natives told us, that it was an offering to the gods, by which the owner hoped to render them propitious, and obtain a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful crop.</p>
                        <p>As to their manner of diſpoſing of their dead, we could form no certain opinion of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the accounts that we received by no means agreed. In the northern parts, they told us that they buried them in the ground; and in the ſouthern, that they threw them into the ſea: it is however certain that we ſaw no grave in the country, and that they affected to conceal every thing relating to their dead with a kind of myſterious ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy. But whatever may be the ſepulchre, the living are themſelves the monuments; for we ſaw ſcarcely a ſingle perſon of either ſex whoſe body was not marked by the ſcars of wounds which they had inflicted upon themſelves as a teſtimony of their regret for the loſs of a relation or friend: ſome of theſe wounds we ſaw in a ſtate ſo recent that the blood was ſcarcely ſtaunch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which ſhows that death had been among them while we were upon the coaſt; and makes it more extraordinary that no funeral ceremony ſhould have fallen under our notice: ſome of
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013324_0329_0F9050396AD9D940"/>
the ſcars were very large and deep, and in many inſtances had greatly disfigured the face. One monument indeed we obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of another kind, the croſs that was ſet up near Queen Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte's Sound.</p>
                        <p>Having now given the beſt account in my power of the cuſtoms and opinions of the inhabitants of New Zealand, with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They have both a tradition that their anceſtors, at a very remote period of time, came from another country; and, according to the tradition of both, that the name of that country was HEAWIJE; but the ſimilitude of the language ſeems to put the matter altogether out of doubt. I have already obſerved, that Tupia, when he accoſted the people here in the language of his own country, was perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; and I ſhall give a ſpecimen of the ſimilitude by a liſt of words in both languages, according to the dialect of the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern and ſouthern iſlands of which New Zealand conſiſts, by which it will appear that the language of Otaheite does not differ more from that of New Zealand, than the language of the two iſlands from each other.</p>

                        <p>By this ſpecimen, I think it appears to demonſtration that the language of New Zealand and Otaheite is radically the ſame. The language of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>he northern and ſouthern parts of New Zealand differs chiefly in the pronunciation, as the ſame Engliſh word is pronounced <hi>gate</hi> in Middleſex, and <hi>geate</hi> in Yorkſhire: and as the ſouthern and northern words were not written down by the ſame perſon, one might poſſibly uſe more letters to produce the ſame ſound than the other.</p>
                        <p>I muſt alſo obſerve, that it is the genius of the language, eſpecially in the ſouthern parts, to put ſome article before a noun, as we do <hi>the</hi> or <hi>a;</hi> the articles uſed here were generally <hi>he</hi> or <hi>ko:</hi> it is alſo common here to add the word <hi>oeia</hi> after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other word, as an iteration, eſpecially if it is an anſwer to a queſtion: as we ſay <hi>yes indeed, to be ſure, really, certainly:</hi> this ſometimes led our gentlemen into the formation of words of an enormous length, judging by the ear only, without being able to refer each ſound into its ſignification. An example will make this perfectly underſtood.</p>
                        <p>In the Bay of Iſlands there is a remarkable one, called by the natives MATU ARO. One of our gentlemen having aſked a native the name of it, he anſwered, with the particle, <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matuaro;</hi> the gentleman hearing the ſound imperfectly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated his queſtion, and the Indian repeating his anſwer, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>ocia,</hi> which made the word <hi>Kematuaro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                              </gap>ia:</hi> and the ſame transformation, by the ſame means, might happen to an Engliſh word. Suppoſe a native of New Zealand at Hackney church, to enquire <q>what village is this?</q> the anſwer would be, "it is Hackney:" ſuppoſe the queſtion to be repeated with an air of doubt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, the anſwer might be "it is Hackney indeed," and the New Zealander, if he had the uſe of letters, would probab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly record, for the information of his countrymen, that during his reſidence among us he had viſited a village called "Ityſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hakneeindede." The article uſed by the inhabitants of the South Sea iſlands inſtead of <hi>he</hi> or <hi>ko,</hi> is <hi>to</hi> or <hi>ta,</hi> but the word <hi>oeia</hi> is common to both; and when we began to learn the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, it led us into many ridiculous miſtakes.</p>
                        <p>But ſuppoſing theſe iſlands, and thoſe in the South Seas, to have been peopled originally from the ſame country, it will perhaps for ever remain a doubt what country that is: we were, however, unanimouſly of opinion, that the people did not come from America, which lies to the eaſtward; and except there ſhould appear to be a continent to the ſouthward, in a moderate latitude, it will follow that they came from the weſtward.</p>
                        <p>Thus far our navigation has certainly been unfavourable to the notion of a ſouthern continent, for it has ſwept away at leaſt three-fourths of the poſitions upon which it has been found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The principal navigators, whoſe authority has been urged on this occaſion, are Taſman, Juan Fernandes, Hermite, the commander of a Dutch ſquadron, Quiros, and Roggewein; and the track of the Endeavour has demonſtrated that the land ſeen by theſe perſons, and ſuppoſed to be part of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, is not ſo; it has alſo totally ſubverted the theoretical ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which have been brought to prove that the exiſtence of a ſouthern continent is neceſſary to preſerve an equilibrium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two hemiſpheres; for upon this principle what we have already proved to be water, would render the ſouthern hemiſphere too light. In our rout to the northward, after doubling Cape Horn, when we were in the latitude of 40°, our longitude was 110°; and in our return to the ſouthward, after leaving Ulietea, when we were again in latitude 40°, our longitude was 145°; the difference is 35°. When we were in latitude 30° the difference of longitude between the two tracks was 21°, which continued till we were as low as 20°; but a ſingle view of the chart will convey a better idea of this than the moſt minute deſcription: yet as upon a view of the chart it will appear that there is a large ſpace extending quite to the Tropics, which neither we, nor any other navigators to bur knowledge have explored, and as there will appear to be room enough for the Cape of a ſouthern continent, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013324_0332_0F90F28D836AD8F0"/>
northward into a low ſouthern latitude, I ſhall give my reaſons for believing there is no Cape, of any ſouthern con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, to the northward of 40° ſouth.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding what has been been laid down by ſome geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers in their maps, and alledged by Mr. Dalrymple, with reſpect to Quiros, it is improbable in the higheſt degree, that he ſaw to the ſouthward of two iſlands, which he diſcovered in latitude 25 or 26, and which I ſuppoſe may lie between the longitude of 130° and 140° W. any ſigns of a continent, much leſs any thing, which, in his opinion, was a known or indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable ſign of ſuch land; for if he had, he would certainly have ſailed ſouthward in ſearch of it, and if he had ſought, ſuppoſing the ſigns to have been indubitable, he muſt have found: the diſcovery of a ſouthern continent was the ultimate object of Quiros's voyage, and no man appears to have had it more at heart; ſo that if he was in latitude 26° S. and in lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude 146° W. where Mr. Dalrymple has placed the iſlands he diſcovered, it may fairly be inferred that no part of a ſouthern continent extends to that latitude.</p>
                        <p>It will, I think, appear with equal evidence from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of Roggewein's voyage, that between the longitudes of 130° and 150° W. there is no main land to the northward of 35 S. Mr. Pingre, in a treatiſe concerning the tranſit of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, which he went out to obſerve, has inſerted an extract of Roggewein's voyage, and a map of the South Seas; and for reaſons which may be ſeen at large in his work, ſuppoſes him, after leaving Eaſter Iſland, which he places in latitude 28½ S. longitude 123° W. to have ſteered S. W. as high as 34° S. and afterwards W. N. W; and if this was indeed his rout, the proof that there is no main land to the northward of 35° S. is irrefragable. Mr. Dalrymple indeed ſuppoſes his rout to have been different, and that from Eaſter Iſle he ſteered N. W. taking a courſe afterwards very little different from that of La Maire; but I think it is highly improbable that a man, who at his own requeſt was ſent to diſcover a ſouthern continent, ſhould take a courſe in which La Maire had already proved no continent could be found: it muſt however be confeſſed, that Roggewein's track cannot certainly be aſcertained, becauſe in the accounts that have been publiſhed of his voyage, neither longitudes nor latitudes are mentioned. As to myſelf I ſaw nothing that I thought a ſign of land, in my rout either to the northward, ſouthward or weſtward, till a few days before I made the eaſt coaſt of New Zealand: I did indeed frequently ſee large flocks of birds, but they were generally ſuch as are found at a very remote diſtance from any coaſt; and it is alſo true that I frequently ſaw pieces of rock-weed, but I could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>Thus have I given my reaſons for thinking that there is no continent to the northward of latitude 40° S.; of what may lie farther to the ſouthward than 40° I can give no opinion; but I am ſo far from wiſhing to diſcourage any future attempt, finally to determine a queſtion which has long been an object of attention to many nations; that now this voyage has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the only poſſible ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In the morning of the 9th, being in latitude 38:29 S. we ſaw a tropic bird, which in ſo high a latitude is very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
                        <p>In the morning of the 10th, being in latitude 38:51 S. longitude 202:43 W. we found the variation, by the ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to be 11:25 E. and by the azimuth 11:20.</p>
                        <p>In the morning of the 11th, the variation was 13:48, which is two degrees and an half more than the day before, though I expected to have found it leſs.</p>

I found the variation to be 12:27 E. and in the morning of the 14th, it was 11:30; this day we alſo ſaw ſome flying fiſh. On the 15th, we ſaw an egg bird and a gannet, and as theſe are birds that never go far from the land, we continued to ſound all night, but had no ground with 130 fathom. At noon on the 16th, we were in latitude 39:45 S. longitude 208° W. At about two o'clock the wind came about to the W. S. W. upon which we tacked and ſtood to the N. W.; ſoon after a ſmall land-bird perched upon the rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, but we had no ground with 120 fathom. At eight we wore and ſtood to the ſouthward till twelve at night, and then wore and ſtood to the N. W. till four in the morning, when we again ſtood to the ſouthward, having a freſh gale at W. S. W. with ſqualls and dark weather till nine, when the weather became clear, and there being little wind, we had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to take ſeveral obſervations of the ſun and moon, the mean reſult of which gave 207:56 W. longitude: our lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude at noon was 39:36 S. We had now a hard gale from the ſouthward, and a great ſea from the ſame quarter, which obliged us to run under our ſore-ſail and mizen all night, during which we ſounded every two hours, but had no ground with 120 fathom.</p>
                        <p>In the morning of the 18th, we ſaw two Port Egmont hens, and a pintado bird, which are certain ſigns of approaching land, and indeed by our reckoning we could not be far from it, for our longitude was now one degree to the weſtward, of the eaſt ſide of Van Diemen's land, according to the longitude laid down by Taſman, whom we could not ſuppoſe to have erred much in ſo ſhort a run as from this land to New Zealand, and by our latitude we could not be above fifty or fifty-five leagues from the place whence he took his departure. All this day we had frequent ſqualls and a great ſwell. At one in the morning we brought to and ſounded, but had no ground with 130 fathom; at ſix we ſaw land extending from N. E. to W. at the diſtance of five or ſix leagues, having eighty fathom wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with a fine ſandy bottom.</p>
                        <p>We continued ſtanding weſtward, with the wind at S. S. W. till eight, when we made all the ſail we could, and bore away

To the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of this point no land was to be ſeen, though it was very clear in that quarter, and by our longitude, compared with that of Taſman, not as it is laid down in the printed charts, but in the extracts from Taſman's journal, publiſhed by Rembrantſe, the body of Van Diemen's land ought to have borne due ſouth; and indeed, from the ſudden falling of the ſea, after the wind abated, I had reaſon to think it did; yet as I did not ſee it, and as I found this coaſt trend N. E. and S. W. or rather more to the eaſtward, I cannot determine whether it joins to Van Diemen's land or not.</p>
                        <p>At noon, we were in latitude 37:50, longitude 210:29 W. The extreams of the land extended from N. W. to E. N. E. and a remarkable point bore N. 20° E. at the diſtance of about four leagues. This point riſes in a round hillock, very much reſembling the Ram Head, at the entrance of Plymouth Sound, and therefore I called it by the ſame name. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation by an azimuth, taken this morning, was 3:7 E.; and what we had now ſeen of the land, appeared low and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel: the ſea ſhore was a white ſand, but the country within was green and woody. About one o'clock, we ſaw three wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpouts at once; two were between us and the ſhore, and the third at ſome diſtance, upon our larboard quarter: this phaenomenon is ſo well known, that it is not neceſſary to give a particular deſcription of it here.</p>
                        <p>At ſix o'clock in the evening, we ſhortened ſail, and brought to for the night, having fifty-ſix fathom water, and a fine ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bottom. The northermoſt land in ſight then bore N. by E. ½ E. and a ſmall iſland lying cloſe to a point on the main bore W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>We brought to for the night, and and at four in the morning made ſail along ſhore to the northward. At ſix, the norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt land in ſight bore N. N. W. and we were at this time about four leagues from the ſhore. At noon, we were in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 36:51 S. longitude 209:53 W. and about three leagues diſtant from the ſhore. The weather being clear, gave us a good view of the country, which has a very pleaſing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: it is of a moderate height, diverſified by hills and vallies, ridges and plains, interſperſed with a few lawns of no great extent, but in general covered with wood: the aſcent of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013324_0336_0F90F28FCBF4BEC8"/>
the hills and ridges is gentle, and the ſummits are not high. We continued to ſail along the ſhore to the northward, with a ſoutherly wind, and in the afternoon we ſaw ſmoke in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, by which we knew the country to be inhabited. At ſix in the evening we ſhortened ſail, and ſounded: we found forty-four fathom water, with a clear ſandy bottom, and ſtood on under an eaſy ſail till twelve, when we brought to for the night, and had ninety fathom water.</p>
                        <p>At four in the morning we made ſail again, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of about five leagues from the land, and at ſix, we were abreaſt of a high mountain, lying near the ſhore, which, on account of its figure, I called MOUNT DROMEDARY: under this mountain the ſhore forms a point, to which I gave the name of POINT DROMEDARY, and over it there is a peaked hillock. At this time, being in latitude 36:18 S. longitude 209:55 W. we found the variation to be 10:42 E.</p>
                        <p>Between ten and eleven, Mr. Green and I took ſeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of the ſun and moon, the mean reſult of which gave 209:17 longitude W. By an obſervation made the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, our longitude was 210:9 W. from which, 20 being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, there remains 209:49, the longitude of the ſhip this day at noon, the mean of which, with this day's obſervation, gives 209:33, by which I fix the longitude of this coaſt. At noon, our latitude was 35:49 S. Cape Dromedary bore S. 30 W. at the diſtance of twelve leagues, and an open bay, in which were three or four ſmall iſlands, bore N. W. by W. at the diſtance of five or fix leagues. This bay ſeemed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford but little ſhelter from the ſea winds, and yet it is the only place where there appeared a probability of finding anchorage upon the whole coaſt. We continued to ſteer along the ſhore N. by E. and N. N. E. at the diſtance of about three leagues, and ſaw ſmoke in many places near the beach. At five in the evening, we were abreaſt of a point of land which roſe in a perpendicular cliff, and which, for that reaſon, I called POINT UPRIGHT. Our latitude was 35:35 S. when this Point bore from us due weſt, diſtant about two leagues; in this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, we had about thirty-one fathom water, with a ſandy bottom. At ſix in the evening, the wind falling, we hauled off E. N. E. and at this time the northermoſt land in ſight bore N. by E. ½ E. At midnight, being in ſeventy fathom water, we brought to till four in the morning, when we made ſail in for the land; but at day break, found our ſituation nearly the ſame as it had been at five in the evening before, by which it was apparent that we had been driven about three leagues to the ſouthward, by a tide or current during the night. After this we ſteered along the ſhore N. N. E. with a gentle breeze at S. W. and were ſo near the land as to diſtinguiſh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the natives upon the beach, who appeared to be of a
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013324_0337_0F90F29075A26860"/>
black, or very dark colour. At noon, our latitude, by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, was 35:27 S. and longitude 209:23 W. Cape Dromedary bore S. 28 W. diſtant nineteen leagues, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable peaked hill, which reſembled a ſquare dove-houſe, with a dome at the top, and which for that reaſon I called the PIGEON HOUSE, bore N. 32:30 W. and a ſmall low iſland, which lay cloſe under the ſhore, bore N. W. diſtant about two or three leagues. When I firſt diſcovered this iſland, in the morning, I was in hopes, from its appearance, that I ſhould have found ſhelter for the ſhip behind it, but when we came near it, it did not promiſe ſecurity even for the landing of a boat: I ſhould however have attempted to ſend a boat on ſhore, if the wind had not veered to that direction, with a large hollow ſea rolling in upon the land from the S. E. which indeed had been the caſe ever ſince we had been upon it. The coaſt ſtill continued to be of a moderate height, forming alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately rocky points and ſandy beaches; but within, between Mount Dromedary, and the Pigeon Houſe, we ſaw high mountains, which, except two, are covered with wood: theſe two lie inland, behind the Pigeon Houſe, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably flat at the top, with ſteep rocky cliffs all round them, as far as we could ſee. The trees which almoſt every where clothe this country, appear to be large and lofty. This day the variation was found to be 9:50 E. and for the two laſt days, the latitude, by obſervation, was twelve or fourteen miles to the ſouthward of the ſhip's account, which could have been the effect of nothing but a current ſetting in that direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. About four in the afternoon, being near five leagues from the land, we tacked and ſtood off S. E. and E. and the wind having veered in the night, from E. to N. E. and N. we tacked about four in the morning, and ſtood in, being then about nine or ten leagues from the ſhore. At eight, the wind began to die away, and ſoon after it was calm. At noon, our latitude, by obſervation, was 35:38, and our diſtance from the land about ſix leagues. Cape Dromedary bore S. 37 W. diſtant ſeventeen leagues, and the Pigeon Houſe N. 40 W. In this ſituation we had ſeventy-four fathom water. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon we had variable light airs and calms, till ſix in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when a breeze ſprung up at N. by W.: at this time, being about four or five leagues from the ſhore, we had ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fathom water. The Pigeon Houſe bore N. 45 W. Mount Dromedary S. 30 W. and the northermoſt land in ſight N. 19 E.</p>
                        <p>We ſtood to the north eaſt till noon the next day, with a gentle breeze at N. W. and then we tacked and ſtood weſtward. At this time, our latitude, by obſervation, was 35:10 S. and longitude 208:51 W. A point of land which I had diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on St. George's day, and which therefore I called CAPE
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013324_0338_0F8FFB8E8B379CD0"/>
GEORGE, bore W. diſtant nineteen miles, and the Pigeon Houſe, (the latitude and longitude of which I found to be 35:19 S. and 209:42 W.) S. 75 W. In the morning, we had found the variation, by amplitude, to be 7:50 E. and by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral azimuths 7:54 E. We had a freſh breeze at N. W. from noon till three; it then came to the weſt, when we tacked and ſtood to the northward. At five in the evening, being about five or ſix leagues from the ſhore, with the Pigeon Houſe bearing W. S. W. diſtant about nine leagues, we had eighty-ſix fathom water; and at eight, having thunder and lightning, with heavy ſqualls, we brought to in 120 fathom.</p>
                        <p>At three in the morning, we made ſail again to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, having the advantage of a freſh gale at S. W. At noon, we were about three or four leagues from the ſhore, and in latitude 34:22 S. longitude 208:36 W. In the courſe of this day's run from the preceding noon, which was forty-five miles north eaſt, we ſaw ſmoke in ſeveral places near the beach. About two leagues to the northward of Cape George, the ſhore ſeemed to form a bay, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſhelter from the north eaſt winds, but as the wind was with us, it was not in my power to look into it without beating up, which would have coſt me more time than I was willing to ſpare. The north point of this bay, on account of its figure, I named LONG NOSE; its latitude is 35:6, and about eight leagues north of it there lies a point; which, from the colour of the land about it, I called RED POINT: its latitude is 34:29, and longitude 208:45 W. To the north weſt of Red Point, and a little way inland, ſtands a round hill, the top of which looks like the crown of a hat. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon of this day, we had a light breeze at N. N. W. till five in the evening, when it fell calm: at this time, we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween three and four leagues from the ſhore, and had forty-eight fathom water: the variation by azimuth was 8:48 E. and the extremities of this land were from N. E. by N. to S. W. by S. Before it was dark, we ſaw ſmoke in ſeveral places along the ſhore, and a fire two or three times afterwards. During the night we lay becalmed, driving in before the ſea till one in the morning, when we got a breeze from the land, with which we ſteered N. E. being then in thirty-eight fathom. At noon, it veered to the N. E. by N. and we were then in latitude 34:10 S. longitude 208:27 W.: the land was diſtant about five leagues, and extended from S. 37 W. to N. ½ E. In this latitude, there are ſome white cliffs, which riſe perpendicularly from the ſea to a conſiderable height. We ſtood off the ſhore till two o'clock, and then tacked and ſtood in till ſix, when we were within four or five miles of it, and at that diſtance had fifty fathom water. The extremities of the land bore from S. 28 W. to N. 25:30 E. We now
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:013324_0339_0F90F2914A913EF8"/>
tacked and ſtood off till twelve, then tacked and ſtood in again till four in the morning, when we made a trip off till day light; and during all this time we loſt ground, owing to the variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the winds. We continued at the diſtance of between four and five miles from the ſhore, till the afternoon, when we came within two miles, and I then hoiſted out the pinnace and yawl to attempt a landing, but the pinnace proved to be ſo leaky that I was obliged to hoiſt her in again. At this time we ſaw ſeveral of the natives walking briſkly along the ſhore, four of whom carried a ſmall canoe upon their ſhoulders: we flattered ourſelves that they were going to put her into the water, and come off to the ſhip, but finding ourſelves diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, I determined to go on ſhore in the yawl, with as many as it would carry: I embarked therefore, only with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Tupia, and four rowers: we pulled for that part of the ſhore where the Indians appeared, near which four ſmall canoes were lying at the water't edge. The Indians ſat down upon the rocks, and ſeemed to wait for our landing; but to our great regret, when we came within about a quarter of a mile, they ran away into the woods: we determined however to go aſhore, and endeavour to procure an interview, but in this we were again diſappointed, for we found ſo great a ſurf beating upon every part of the beach, that landing with our little boat was altogether impracticable: we were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obliged to be content with gazing at ſuch objects as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves from the water: the canoes, upon a near view, ſeemed very much to reſemble thoſe of the ſmaller ſort at New Zealand. We obſerved, that among the trees on ſhore, which were not very large, there was no underwood; and could diſtinguiſh that many of them were of the palm kind, and ſome of them cabbage trees: after many a wiſhful look we were obliged to return, with our curioſity rather excited than ſatisfied, and about five in the evening got on board the ſhip. About this time it fell calm, and our ſituation was by no means agreeable: we wete now not more than a mile and a half from the ſhore, and within ſome breakers, which lay to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but happily a light breeze came off the land, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us out of danger: with this breeze we ſtood to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and at day-break we diſcovered a bay, which ſeemed to be well ſheltered from all winds, and into which, therefore, I determined to go with the ſhip. The pinnace being repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſent her, with the Maſter, to ſound the entrance, while I kept turning up, having the wind right out. At noon, the mouth of the bay bore N. N. W. diſtant about a mile, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſmoke on the ſhore, we directed our glaſſes to the ſpot, and ſoon diſcovered ten people, who, upon our nearer approach, left their fire, and retired to a little eminence, whence they could conveniently obſerve our motions. Soon after two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:013324_0340_0F8FFB8F907B9EA8"/>
each having two men on board, came to the ſhore, juſt under the eminence, and the men joined the leſt on the top it. The pinnace, which had been ſent a head to ſound, now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the place, upon which all the Indians retired farther up the hill, except one, who hid himſelf among ſome rocks, near the landing-place. As the pinnace proceeded along the ſhore, moſt of the people took the ſame route, and kept abreaſt of her at a diſtance: when ſhe came back, the maſter told us, that in a cove, a little within the harbour, ſome of them had come down to the beach, and invited him to land by many ſigns and words, of which he knew not the meaning; but that all of them were armed with long pikes, and a wooden weapon, ſhaped ſomewhat like a cimeter. The Indians who had not followed the boat, ſeeing the ſhip approach, uſed many threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening geſtures, and brandiſhed their weapons; particularly two, who made a very ſingular appearance, for their faces ſeemed to have been duſted with a white powder, and their bodies painted with broad ſtreakes of the ſame colour, which, paſſing obliquely over their breaſts and backs, looked not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the croſs-belts worn by our ſoldiers; the ſame kind of ſtreaks were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>We continued to ſtand into the bay, and early in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon anchored under the ſouth ſhore, about two miles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the entrance, in ſix fathom water, the ſouth point bearing S. E. and the north point Eaſt. As we came in we ſaw, on both points of the bay, a few huts, and ſevetal of the natives, men, women, and children. Under the ſouth head we ſaw four ſmall canoes, with each one man on board, who were very buſily employed in ſtriking fiſh with a long pike or ſpear; they ventured almoſt into the ſurf, and were ſo intent upon what they were doing, that although the ſhip paſſed within a quarter of a mile of them, they ſcarcely turned their eyes towards her; poſſibly being deafened by the ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>f, and their attention wholly fixed upon their buſineſs or ſport, they neither ſaw nor heard her go paſt them.</p>
                        <p>The place where the ſhip had anchored was abreaſt of a ſmall village, conſiſting of about ſix or eight houſes; and while we were preparing to hoiſt out the boat, we ſaw an old woman, followed by three children, come out of the wood; ſhe was loaded with fire-wood, and each of the children had alſo its little burden: when ſhe came to the houſes three more child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, younger than the others, came out to meet her: ſhe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten looked at the ſhip, but expreſſed neither fear nor ſurpriſe: In a ſhort time ſhe kindled a fire, and the four canoes came in
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:013324_0341_0F90503AE36F5D88"/>
from fiſhing. The men landed, and having hauled up their boats, began to dreſs their dinner, to all appearance wholly unconcerned about us, though we were within half a mile of them. We thought it remarkable that of all the people we had yet ſeen, not one had the leaſt appearance of clothing, the old woman herſelf being deſtitute even of a fig-l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>.</p>
                        <p>After dinner the boats were manned, and we ſet out from the ſhip, having Tupia of our party. We intended to land where we ſaw the people, and began to hope that as they had ſo little regarded the ſhip's coming into the bay, they would as little regard our coming on ſhore; in this, however, we were diſappointed; for as ſoon as we approached the rocks, two of the men came down upon them to diſpute our landing, and the reſt ran away. Each of the two champions was armed with a lance, about ten feet long, and a ſhort ſtick, which he ſeemed to handle as if it was a machine to aſſiſt him in managing or throwing the lance: they called to us in a very loud tone, and in a harſh diſſonant language, of which neither we nor Tupia underſtood a ſingle word: they brandiſhed their weapons, and ſeemed reſolved to defend their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

I could not but admire their courage, and being very unwilling that hoſtilities ſhould commence with ſuch inequality of force between us, I ordered the boat to lie upon her oars: we then parlied by ſigns for about a quarter of an hour, and to beſpea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> their good-will, I threw them nails, beads, and other trifles, which they took up and ſeemed to be well pleaſed with. I then made ſigns that I wanted water, and by all the means that I could deviſe, endeavoured to convince that we would do them no harm: they now waved to us, and I was willing to interpret it as an invitation; but upon our putting the boat in, they came again to oppoſe us. One appeared to be a youth about nineteen or twenty, and the other a man of middle age: as I had now no other reſource I fired a muſket between them. Upon the report, the youngeſt dropped a bundle of lances upon the rock, but recollecting himſelf in an inſtant he ſnatched them up again with great haſte: a ſtone was then thrown at us, upon which I ordered a muſquet to be fired with ſmall ſhot, which ſtruck the eldeſt upon the legs, and he immediately ran to one of the houſes, which was diſtant about an hundred yards: I now hoped that our conteſt was over, and we immediately landed; but we had ſcarcely left the boat when he returned, and we then perceived that he had left the rock only to fetch a ſhield or target for his defence. As ſoon as he came up, he threw a lance at us, and his comrade an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; they fell where we ſtood thickeſt, but happily hurt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body. A third muſquet with ſmall ſhot was then fired at them, upon which one of them threw another lance, and both imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:013324_0342_0F90F292076858D8"/>
ran away: if we had purſued, we might probably have taken one of them; but Mr. Banks ſuggeſting that the lances might be poiſoned, I thought it not prudent to venture into the woods. We repaired immediately to the huts, in one of which we found the children, who had hidden themſelves behind a ſhield and ſome bark; we peeped at them, but left them in their retreat, without their knowing that they had been diſcovered, and we threw into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> houſe, when we went away, ſome beads, ribbons, pieces of cloth, and other preſents, which we hoped would procure us the good-will of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants when they ſhould return; but the lances which we found lying about, we took away with us, to the number of about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: they were from ſix to fifteen feet long, and all of them had four prongs in the manner of a fiſh-gig, each of which was pointed with fiſh-bone, and very ſharp: we obſerved that they were ſmeared with a viſcous ſubſtance of a green colour, which favoured the opinion of their being poiſoned, though we afterwards diſcovered that it was a miſtake: they appeared by the ſea-weed that we found ſticking to them, to have been uſed in ſtriking fiſh. Upon examining the canoes that lay upon the beach, we found them to be the worſt we had ever ſeen: they were between twelve and fourteen feet long, and made of the bark of a tree, in one piece, which was drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and tied up at each end, the middle being kept open by ſticks, which were placed acroſs them from gunwale to gunwale, as thwarts. We then ſearched for freſh water, but found none, except in a ſmall hole which had been dug in the ſand.</p>
                        <p>Having reimbarked in our boat, we depoſited our lances on board the ſhip, and then went over to the north point of the bay, where we had ſeen ſeveral of the inhabitants when we were entering it, but which we now found totally deſerted. Here however we found freſh water, which trickled down from the top of the rocks, and ſtood in pools among the hollows at the bottom; but it was ſituated ſo as not to be procured for our uſe without difficulty.</p>
                        <p>In the morning, therefore, I ſent a party of men to that part of the ſhore where we firſt landed, with orders to dig holes in the ſand, where the water might gather; but upon going aſhore myſelf with the Gentlemen ſoon afterwards, we found, upon a more diligent ſearch, a ſmall ſtream, more than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for our purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>Upon viſiting the hut, where we had ſeen the children, we were greatly mortified to find that the beads and ribbons which we had left there the night before, had not been moved from their places, and that not an Indian was to be ſeen.</p>
                        <p>Having ſent ſome empty water caſks on ſhore, and left a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of men to cut wood, I myſelf went in the pinnace to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:013324_0343_0F90F292BA91D1F8"/>
ſound, and examine the bay; during my excurſion I ſaw ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the natives, but they all fled at my approach. In one of the places where I landed I found ſeveral ſmall fires, and freſh muſcles broiling upon them; here alſo I found ſome of the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt oyſter-ſhells I had ever ſeen.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as the wooders and waterers came on board to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ten or twelve of the natives came down to the place, and looked with great attention and curioſity at the caſks, but did not touch them: they took away however the canoes, which lay near the landing-place, and again diſappeared. In the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, when our people were again aſhore, ſixteen or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Indians, all armed, came boldly within about an hundred yards of them, and then ſtopped: two of them advanced ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what nearer; and Mr. Hicks, who commanded the party on ſhore, with another, advanced to meet them, holding out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to them as he approached, and expreſſing kindneſs and amity by every ſign he could think of, but all without effect; for before he could get up with them they retired, and it would have anſwered no purpoſe to purſue. In the evening I went with Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander, to a ſandy cove, on the north ſide of the bay, where, in three or four hauls with the ſeine, we took above three hundred weight of fiſh, which was equally divided among the ſhip's company.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, before day-break, the Indians came down to the houſes that were abreaſt of the ſhip, and were heard frequently to ſhout very loud. As ſoon as it was light, they were ſeen walking along the beach; and ſoon after they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to the woods, where, at the diſtance of about a mile from the ſhore, they kindled ſeveral fires.</p>
                        <p>Our people went aſhore as uſual, and with them Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander, who, in ſearch, of plants, repaired to the woods. Our men, who were employed in cutting graſs, being the fartheſt removed from the main body of the people, a company of 14 or 15 Indians advanced towards them, having ſticks in their hands, which, according to the report of the Serjeant of the marines, ſhone like a muſquet. The graſs-cutters, upon ſeeing them approach, drew together, and repaired to the main body. The Indians, being encouraged by this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a flight, purſued them; they ſtopped however when they were within about a furlong of them, and after ſhouting ſeveral times went back into the woods. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they came again in the ſame manner, ſtopped at the ſame diſtance, ſhouted and retired. I followed them myſelf, alone and unarmed, for a conſiderable way along the ſhore, but I could not prevail upon them to ſtop.</p>
                        <p>This day Mr. Green took the ſun's meridian altitude, a little within the ſouth entrance of the bay, which gave the latitude 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Early the next morning, the body of Forby Sutherland, one of our ſeamen, who died the evening before, was buried near the watering-place; and from this incident I called the ſouth point of this bay SUTHERI AND POINT. This day we reſolved to make an excurſion into the country. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, myſelf, and ſeven others, properly accoutred for the expedition, ſet out, and repaired firſt to the huts, near the watering place, whither ſome of the natives continued every day to reſort; and though the little preſents which we had left there before had not yet been taken away, we left others of ſomewhat more value, conſiſting of cloth, looking glaſſes, combs, and beads, and then went up into the country. We found the ſoil to be either ſwamp or light ſand, and the face of the country finely diverſified by wood and lawn. The trees are tall, ſtrait, and without underwood, ſtanding at ſuch a diſtance from each other that the whole country, at leaſt where the ſwamps do not render it incapable of cultivation, might be cultivated without cutting down one of them: between the trees the ground is covered with graſs, of which there is great abundance, growing in tufts about as big as can well be graſped in the hand, which ſtand very cloſe to each other. We ſaw many houſes of the inhabitants, and places where they had ſlept upon the graſs without any ſhelter; but we ſaw only one of the people, who, the moment he diſcovered us, ran away. At all theſe places we left preſents, hoping that at length they might produce confidence and good will. We had a tranſient and imperfect view of a quadruped, about as big as a rabbit: Mr. Banks's greyhound, which was with us, got ſight of it, and would probably have caught it, but the moment he ſet off he lamed himſelf, againſt a ſtump which lay concealed in the long graſs. We afterwards ſaw the dung of an animal which fed upon graſs, and which we judged could not be leſs than a deer; and the footſteps of another, which was clawed like a dog, and ſeemed to be about as big as a wolf: we alſo tracked a ſmall animal, whoſe foot reſembled that of a polcat, or weaſel. The trees over our head abounded with birds of various kinds, among which were many of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite beauty, particularly loriquets, and cockatoos, which flew in flocks of ſeveral ſcores together. We found ſome wood which had been felled by the natives, with a blunt inſtrument, and ſome that had been barked. The trees were not of many ſpecies; among others there was a large one which yielded a gum not unlike the <hi>Sanguis draconis;</hi> and in ſome of them ſteps had been cut at about three feet diſtance from each other, for the convenience of climbing them.</p>
                        <p>From this excurſion we returned between three and four o'clock, and having dined on board, we went aſhore again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Mr. Gore, the Second Lieutenant, had been ſent out in the morning with a boat to dredge for oyſters, at the head of the bay; when he had performed this ſervice, he went aſhore, and having taken a midſhipman with him, and ſent the boat away, ſet out to join the waterers by land. In his way he fell in with a body of two and twenty Indians, who followed him, and were often not more than twenty yards diſtance; when Mr. Gore perceived them ſo near, he ſtopped, and faced about, upon which they ſtopped alſo; and when he went on again, continued their purſuit: they did not however attack him, though they were all armed with lances, and he and the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipman got in ſafety to the watering-place. The Indians, who had ſlackened their purſuit when they came in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ight of the main body of our people, halted at about the diſtance of a quarter of a mile, where they ſtood ſtill. Mr. Monkhouſe and two or three of the waterers took it in their head to march up to them; but ſeeing the Indians keep their ground, till they came pretty near them, they were ſeized with a ſudden fear, very common to the raſh and fool-hardy, and made a haſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat: this ſtep, which inſured the danger that it was taken to avoid, encouraged the Indians, and four of them running for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, diſcharged their lances at the fugitives, with ſuch force that, flying no leſs than forty yards, they went beyond them. As the Indians did not purſue, our people, recovering their ſpirits, ſtopped to collect the lances, when they came to the place where they lay; upon which the Indians, in their turn, began to retire. Juſt at this time I came up, with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Tupia; and being deſirous to convince the Indians that we were neither afraid of them, nor intended them any miſchief, we advanced towards them, making ſigns of expoſtulation and entreaty, but they could not be perſuaded to wait till we could come up. Mr. Gore told us, that he had ſeen ſome of them up the bay, who had invited him by ſigns to come on ſhore, which he, certainly with great prudence, declined.</p>
                        <p>The morning of the next day was ſo rainy, that we were all glad to ſtay on board. In the afternoon, however, it cleared up, and we made another excurſion along the ſea coaſt to the ſouthward: we went aſhore, and Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander gathered many plants; but beſides theſe we ſaw nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of notice. At our firſt entering the woods, we met with three of the natives, who inſtantly ran away: more of them were ſeen by ſome of the people, but they all diſappeared, with great precipitation, as ſoon as they found that they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. By the boldneſs of theſe people at our firſt landing, and the terror that ſeized them at the ſight of us afterwards, it appears that they were ſufficiently intimidated by our fire-arms: not that we had any reaſon to think the people much hurt by
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:013324_0346_0F90F2944B232A70"/>
the ſmall ſhot which we were obliged to fire at them, when they attacked us at our coming out of the boat; but they had probably ſeen the effects of them, from their lurking-places, upon the birds that we had ſhot. Tupia, who was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a good markſman, frequently ſtrayed from us to ſhoot parrots; and he had told us, that while he was thus employed, he had once met with nine Indians, who, as ſoon as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived he ſaw them, ran from him, in great confuſion and terror.</p>
                        <p>The next day, twelve canoes, in each of which was a ſingle Indian, came towards the watering place, and were within half a mile of it a conſiderable time: they were employed in ſtriking fiſh, upon which, like others that we had ſeen before, they were ſo intent, that they ſeemed to regard nothing elſe. It happened, however, that a party of our people were out a ſhooting near the place, and one of the men, whoſe curioſity might at length perhaps be rouſed by the report of the fowling pieces, was obſerved by Mr. Banks to haul up his canoe, upon the beach, and go towards the ſhooting party: in ſomething more than a quarter of an hour he returned, launched his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe, and went off in her to his companions. This incident makes it probable that the natives acquired a knowledge of the deſtructive power of our fire arms, when we knew nothing of the matter; for this man was not ſeen by any of the party whoſe operations he had reconnoitred.</p>
                        <p>While Mr. Banks was gathering plants near the watering-place, I went with Dr. Solander and Mr. Monkhouſe to the head of the bay, that I might examine that part of the country, and make farther attempts to form ſome connection with the natives. In our way we met with eleven or twelve ſmall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes, with each a man in it, probably the ſame that were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards abreaſt of the ſhore, who all made into ſhoal water upon our approach. We met other Indians on ſhore the firſt time we landed, who inſtantly took <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> their canoes, and paddled away.</p>
                        <p>We went up the country to ſome diſtance, and found the face of it nearly the ſame with that which has been deſcribed already, but the ſoil was much richer; for inſtead of ſand, I found a deep black mould, which I thought very fit for the production of grain of any kind. In the woods we found a tree which bore fruit that in colour and ſhape reſembled a cherry; the juice had an agreeable tartneſs, though but little flavour. We found alſo interſperſed ſome of the fineſt meadows in the world; ſome places however were rocky, but theſe were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively few: the ſtone is ſandy, and might be uſed with advantage for building. When we returned to the boat, we ſaw ſome ſmoke upon another part of the coaſt, and went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in hopes of meeting with the people, but at our approach, theſe alſo ran away. We found ſix ſmall canoes, and ſix fires
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:013324_0347_0F90F294F872C288"/>
very near the beach, with ſome muſcles roaſting upon them, and a few oyſters lying near: by this we judged that there had been one man in each canoe, who having picked up ſome ſhell-fiſh had come aſhore to eat it, and that each made his ſeparate fire for that purpoſe: we taſted of their cheer, and left them, in return, ſome ſtrings of beads, and other things which we thought would pleaſe them. At the foot of a tree in this place we found a ſmall well of freſh water, ſupplied by a ſpring; and the day being now far ſpent, we returned to the ſhip. In the evening, Mr. Banks made a little excurſion with his gun, and found ſuch a number of quails, reſembling thoſe in England, that he might have ſhot as many as he pleaſed; but his object was variety and not number.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, as the wind would not permit me to fail, I ſent out ſeveral parties into the country, to try again whether ſome intercourſe could not be eſtabliſhed with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. A midſhipman, who belonged to one of theſe parties, having ſtraggled a long way from his companions, met with a very old man and woman, and ſome little children; they were ſitting under a tree by the water ſide, and neither party ſaw the other till they were cloſe together: the Indians ſhewed ſigns of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ear, but did not attempt to run away. The man happened to have nothing to give them but a parrot that he had ſhot; this he offered, but they refuſed to accept it, withdrawing themſelves from his hand, either through fear or averſion. His ſtay with them was but ſhort, for he ſaw ſeveral canoes near the beach a fiſhing, and being alone, he feared they might come aſhore, and attack him: he ſaid, that theſe people were very dark coloured, but not black; that the man and woman appeared to be very old, being both grey-headed; that the hair of the man's head was buſhy, and his beard long and rough; that the woman's hair was cropped ſhort, and both of them were ſtark naked. Mr. Monkhouſe the ſurgeon, and one of the men, who were with another party near the watering-place, alſo ſtrayed from their companions, and as they were coming out of a thicket, obſerved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> Indians ſtanding together, at the diſtance of about fifty yards. One of them pronounced a word very loud, which was ſuppoſed to be a ſignal, for a lance was immediately thrown at him out of the wood, which very narrowly miſſed him. When the Indians ſaw that the weapon had not taken effect, they ran away with the greateſt precipitation; but on turning about towards the place whence the lance had been thrown, he ſaw a young Indian, whom he judged to be about nineteen or twenty years old, come down from a tree, and he alſo ran away with ſuch ſpeed as made it hopeleſs to follow him. Mr. Monkhouſe was of opinion that he had been watched by theſe Indians, in his paſſage through the thicket, and that
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:013324_0348_0F90F295C5FFC440"/>
the youth had been ſtationed in the tree, to diſcharge the lance at him, upon a ſignal as he ſhould come by; but however this be, there could be no doubt but that he was the perſon who threw the lance.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon, I went myſelf with a party over to the north ſhore, and while ſome of our people were hauling the ſeine, we made an excurſion a few miles into the country, proceeding afterwards in the direction of the coaſt. We found this place without wood, and ſomewhat reſembling our moors in England; the ſurface of the ground, however, was covered with a thin bruſh of plants, about as high as the knees: the hills near the coaſt are low, but others riſe behind them, increaſing by a gradual aſcent, to a conſiderable diſtance, with marſhes and moraſſes between. When we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the boat, we found that our people had caught with the ſeine a great number of ſmall fiſh, which are well known in the Weſt-Indies, and which our ſailors call Leather jackets, becauſe their ſkin is remarkably thick. I had ſent the Second Lieutenant out in the yawl a ſtriking, and when we got back to the ſhip, we found that he had alſo been very ſucceſsful. He had obſerved that the large ſting-rays, of which there is great plenty in the bay, followed the flowing tide into very ſhallow water; he therefore took the opportunity of flood, and ſtruck ſeveral in not more than two or three feet water: one of them weighed no leſs than two hundred and forty pounds after his entrails were taken out.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, as the wind ſtill continued northerly, I ſent out the yawl again, and the people ſtruck one ſtill larger, for when his entrails were taken out, he weighed three hundred and thirty-ſix pounds.</p>
                        <p>The great quantity of plants which Mr. Banks and Dr. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander collected in this place induced me to give it the name of BOTANY BAY. It is ſituated in the latitude of 34° S. lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude 208:37 W. It is capacious, ſafe, and convenient, and may be known by the land on the ſea-coaſt, which is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly level, and of a moderate height; in general higher than it is farther inland, with ſteep rocky cliffs next the ſea, which have the appearance of a long iſland, lying cloſe under the ſhore. The harbour lies about the middle of this land, and in approaching it from the ſouthward, is diſcovered before the ſhip comes abreaſt of it; but from the northward it is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſo ſoon: the entrance is a little more than a quarter of a mile broad, and lies in W. N. W. To ſail into it the ſouthern ſhore ſhould be kept on board, till the ſhip is within a ſmall bare iſland, which lies cloſe under the north ſhore; within this iſland the deepeſt water on that ſide is ſeven fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, ſhallowing to five a good way up. At a conſiderable diſtance from the ſouth ſhore there is a ſhoal, reaching from
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:013324_0349_0F90F296727AED88"/>
the inner ſouth point, quite to the head of the harbour; but over towards the north and north weſt ſhore there is a channel of twelve or fourteen feet at low water, for three or four leagues, up to a place where there is three or four fathom, but here I fonnd very little freſh water. We anchored near the ſouth ſhore, about a mile within the entrance, for the convenience of ſailing with a ſoutherly wind, and becauſe I thought it the beſt ſituation for watering; but I afterwards ſound a very fine ſtream on the north ſhore, in the firſt ſandy cove within the iſland, before which a ſhip might lie almoſt land-locked, and procure wood as well as water in great abundance. Wood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is every where plenty, but I ſaw only two kinds which may be conſidered as timber. Theſe trees are as large, or larger than the Engliſh oak, and one of them has not a very different appearance: this is the ſame that yields the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh gum like <hi>ſanguis draconis,</hi> and the wood is heavy, hard, and dark-coloured, like <hi>

There are a few ſhrubs, and ſeveral kinds of the palm; mangroves alſo grow in great plenty near the head of the bay. The country in general is level, low, and woody, as far as we could ſee. The woods, as I have before obſerved, abound with birds of exquiſite beauty, particularly of the parrot kind; we found alſo crows here, exactly the ſame with thoſe in England. About the head of the harbour, where there are large flats of ſand and mud, there is great plenty of water-fowl, moſt of which were altogether unknown to us: one of the moſt remarkable was black and white, much larger than a ſwan, and in ſhape ſomewhat reſembling a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican. On theſe banks of ſand and mud there are great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of oyſters, muſcles, cockles, and other ſhell-fiſh, which ſeem to be the principal ſubſiſtence of the inhabitants, who go into ſhoal water with their little canoes, and pick them out with their hands. We did not obſerve that they eat any of them raw, nor do they always go on ſhore to dreſs them, for they have frequently fires in their canoes for that purpoſe. They do not however ſubſiſt wholly upon this food, for they catch a variety of other fiſh, ſome of which they ſtrike with gigs, and ſome they take with hook and line. All the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants that we ſaw were ſtark naked: they did not appear to be numerous, nor to live in ſocieties, but like other animals were ſcattered about along the coaſt, and in the woods. Of their manner of life, however, we could know but little, as we were never able to form the leaſt connection with them: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt conteſt at our landing, they would never come near enough to parley; nor did they touch a ſingle article of all
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:013324_0350_0F90F29758282C70"/>
that we had left them at their huts, and the places they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, on purpoſe for them to take away.</p>
                        <p>During my ſtay in this harbour, I cauſed the Engliſh colours to be diſplayed on ſhore every day, and the ſhip's name, and the date of the year, to be inſcribed upon one of the trees near the watering-place.</p>
                        <p>It is high water here at the full and change of the moon about eight o'clock, and the tide riſes and falls perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly between four and five feet.</p>

                        <p>AT day-break, on Sunday the 6th of May 1770, we ſet ſail from Botany Bay, with a light breeze at N. W. which ſoon after coming to the ſouthward, we ſteered along the ſhore N. N. E.; and at noon, our latitude, by obſervation, was 33:50 S. At this time we were between two and three miles diſtant from the land, and a-breaſt of a bay, or harbour, in which there appeared to be good anchorage, and which I called PORT JACKSON. This harbour lies three leagues to the northward of Botany Bay: the variation, by ſeveral azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muths, appeared to be 8° E. At ſun-ſet, the northermoſt land in ſight bore N. 26 E. and ſome broken land that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to form a bay, bore N. 40 W. diſtant four leagues. This bay, which lies in latitude 33:42, I called BROKEN BAY. We ſteered along the ſhoore N. N. E. all night, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of about three leagues from the land, having from thirty-two to thirty-ſix fathom water, with a hard ſandy bottom.</p>
                        <p>Soon after ſun-riſe on the 7th, I took ſeveral azimuths, with four needles belonging to the azimuth compaſs, the mean reſult of which gave the variation 7:56 E. At noon, our latitude by obſervation, was 33:22 S.: we were about three leagues from the ſhore; the northermoſt land in ſight bore N. 19 E. and ſome lands which projected in three bluff points, and which, for that reaſon, I called CAPE THREE POINTS, bore S. W. diſtant five leagues. Our longitude from Botany Bay was 19 E. In the afternoon, we ſaw ſmoke in ſeveral places upon the ſhore, and in the evening, found the variation to be 8:25 E. At this time we were between two and three miles from the ſhore, in twenty-eight fathom; and at noon the next day, we had not advanced one ſtep to the northward. We ſtood off ſhore, with the winds northerly, till twelve at night, and at the diſtance of about five leagues, had ſeventy
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:013324_0351_0F90F29805097978"/>
fathom; at the diſtance of ſix leagues we had eighty fathom, which is the extent of the ſoundings; for at the diſtance of ten leagues, we had no ground with 150 fathom.</p>
                        <p>The wind continuing northerly, till the morning of the 10th, we continued to ſtand in and off the ſhore, with very little change of ſituation in other reſpects; but a gale then ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up at S. W. we made the beſt of our way along the ſhore to the northward. At ſun-riſe, our latitude was 33:2 S. and the variation 8° E. At nine in the forenoon, we paſſed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable hill, which ſtood a little way inland, and ſomewhat reſembled the crown of a hat: and at noon, our latitude, by obſervation, was 32:53 S. and our longitude 208° W. We were about two leagues diſtant from the land, which extended from N. 41 E. to S. 41 W., and a ſmall round rock, or iſland, which lay cloſe under the land, bore S. 82 W. diſtant between three and four leagues. At four in the afternoon, we paſſed, at the diſtance of about a mile, a low rocky point, which I called POINT STEPHENS, on the north ſide of which is an inlet, which I called PORT STEPHENS: this inlet appeared to me, from the maſt head, to be ſheltered from all winds. It lies in latitude 32:40, longitude 207:51, and at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance are three ſmall iſlands, two of which are high; and on the main, near the ſhore, are ſome high round hills, which at a diſtance appear like iſlands. In paſſing this bay, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of two or three miles from the ſhore, our ſoundings were from thirty-three, to twenty-ſeven fathom, from which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that there muſt be a ſufficient depth of water within it. At a little diſtance within land, we ſaw ſmoke in ſeveral places; and at half an hour paſt five, the northermoſt land in ſight bore N. 36 E. and Point Stephens S. W. diſtant four leagues. Our ſoundings in the night, were from forty-eight to ſixty-two fathom, at the diſtance of between three and four leagues from the ſhore, which made in two hillocks. This Point I called CAPE HAWKE: it lies in the latitude of 32:14 S., longitude 207:30 W.; and at four o'clock in the morning bore W. diſtant about eight miles; at the ſame time the northermoſt land in ſight bore N. 6 E. and appeared like an iſland. At noon, this land bore N. 8 E. the norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt land in ſight N. 13 E. and Cape Hawke S. 37 W. Our latitude, by obſervation was 32:2 S. which was twelve miles to the ſouthward of that given by the log; ſo that probably we had a current ſetting that way: by the morning ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and azimuth, the variation was 9:10 E. During our run along the ſhore, in the afternoon, we ſaw ſmoke in ſeveral places, at a little diſtance from the beach, and one upon the top of a hill, which was the firſt we had ſeen upon elevated ground, ſince our arrival upon the coaſt. At ſun ſet, we had twenty-three fathom, at the diſtance of a league and an half
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:013324_0352_0F90F29986264F70"/>
from the ſhore: the northermoſt land then bore N. 13 E. and three hills, remarkably large and high, lying contiguous to each other, and not far from the beach, N. N. W. As theſe hills bore ſome reſemblance to each other, we called them the THREE BROTHERS. They lie in latitude 31:40, and may be ſeen fourteen or ſixteen leagues. We ſteered N. E. by N. all night, having from twenty-ſeven to ſixty-ſeven fathom, at the diſtance of between two and ſix leagues from the ſhore.</p>
                        <p>At day-break, we ſteered north, for the northermoſt land in ſight. At noon we were four leagues from the ſhore, and by obſervation, in latitude 31:18 S., which was fifteen miles to the ſouthward of that given by the log; our longitude 206:58 W. In the afternoon we ſtood in for the land, where we ſaw ſmoke in ſeveral places, till ſix in the evening, when, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within three or four miles of it, and in twenty-four fathom of water, we ſtood off with a freſh breeze at N. and N. N. W. till midnight, when we had 118 fathom, at the diſtance of eight leagues from the land, and then tacked. At three in the morning, the wind veered to the weſtward, when we tacked and ſtood to the northward. At noon, our latitude, by obſervation, was 30:43 S., and our longitude 206:45 W. At this time we were between three and four leagues from the ſhore, the northermoſt part of which bore from us N. 13 W. and a point, or head land, on which we ſaw fires that produced a great quantity of ſmoke, bore W. diſtant four leagues. To this point I gave the name of SMOKEY CAPE: it is of a conſiderable height, and over the pitch of the point is a round hillock; within it are two others, much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and larger, and within them the land is very low. Our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude was 30:31 S., longitude 206:54 W.: this day the obſerved latitude was only five miles ſouth of the log. We ſaw ſmoke in ſeveral parts along the coaſt, beſides that ſeen upon Smoky Cape.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon, the wind being at N. E. we ſtood off and on, and at three or four miles diſtance from the ſhore had thirty fathom water: the wind afterwards coming croſs off land, we ſtood to the northward, having from thirty to twenty-one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, at the diſtance of four or five miles from the ſhore.</p>
                        <p>At five in the morning the wind veered to the north, and blew freſh, attended with ſqualls: at eight, it began to thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and rain, and in about an hour it fell calm, which gave us an opportunity to ſound, and we had eighty-ſix fathom at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween four and five leagues from the ſhore: ſoon after this we had a gale from the ſouthward, with which we ſteered N. by W. for the northermoſt land in ſight. At noon we were about four leagues from the ſhore, and by obſervation, in latitude 30:22, which was nine miles to the ſouthward of our reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                        <p>As we advanced to the northward, from Botany Bay, the land gradually increaſed in height, ſo that in this latitude it may be called a hilly country. Between this latitude and the Bay, it exhibits a pleaſing variety of ridges, hills, vallies, and plains, all clothed with wood, of the ſame appearance with that which has been particularly deſcribed: the land near the ſhore is in general low and ſandy, except the points, which are rocky, and over many of them are high hills, which, at their firſt riſing out of the water, have the appearance of iſlands. In the afternoon, we had ſome ſmall rocky iſlands between us and the land, the ſouthermoſt of which lies in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 30:10, and the northermoſt in 29:58, and ſomewhat more than two leagues from the land: about two miles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the northermoſt iſland we had thirty-three fathom water, having the advantage of a moon, we ſteered along the ſhore all night, in the direction of N. and N. by E. keeping at the diſtance of about three leagues from the land, and having from twenty to twenty-five fathom water. As ſoon as it was light, having a freſh g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At noon, our latitude, by obſervation, was 28:39 S., and longitude 206:27 W. A high point of land, which I named CAPE BYRON, bore N. W. by W. at the diſtance of three miles. It lies in latitude 28:37:30 S., longitude 206:30 W. and may be known by a remarkable ſharp peaked mountain, which lies inland, and bears from it N. W. by W. From this point, the land trends N. 13 W.: inland it is high and hilly, but low near the ſhore; to the ſouthward of the point it is alſo low and level. We conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to ſteer along the ſhore with a freſh gale, till ſun-ſet, when we ſuddenly diſcovered breakers a-head, directly in the ſhip's courſe, and alſo on our larboard bow. At this time we
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:013324_0354_0F90F29B037C49C8"/>
were about five miles from the land, and had twenty fathom water: we hauled up eaſt till eight, when we had run eight miles, and increaſed our depth of water to forty-four fathom: we then brought to, with the ſhip's head to the eaſtward, and lay upon this tack till ten, when, having increaſed our ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſeventy-eight fathom, we wore, and lay with the ſhip's head to the land till five in the morning, when we made ſail, and at daylight we were greatly ſurprized to find ourſelves far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſouthward, than we had been the evening before, though the wind had been ſoutherly, and blown freſh all night: we now ſaw the breakers again within us, and paſſed them at the diſtance of one league. They lie in latitude 28:8 S. ſtretching off eaſt two leagues, from a point of land, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

W. by W. for this reaſon I have named it MOUNT WARNING. It lies ſeven or eight leagues inland, in latitude 28:22 S. The land about it is high and hilly, but it is of itſelf ſufficiently conſpicuous to be at once diſtinguiſhed from every other object. The point off which theſe ſhoals lie, I have named POINT DANGER. To the northward of this point the land is low, and trends N. W. by N.; but it ſoon turns again more to the northward.</p>
                        <p>At noon we were about two leagues from the land, and by obſervation, in latitude 27:46 S. which was ſeventeen miles to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

We purſued our courſe along the ſhore, at the diſtance of about two leagues, in the direction of N. ¾ E. till between four and five in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, when we diſcovered breakers on our larboard bow. Our depth of water was thirty-ſeven fathom, and at ſun-ſet, the northermoſt land bore N. by W. the breakers N. W. by W. diſtant four miles, and the northermoſt land ſet at noon, which formed a point, and to which I gave the name of POINT LOOK-OUT, W. diſtant five or ſix miles, in the latitude of 27 6. On the north ſide of this point, the ſhore forms a wide open bay, which I called MORETON's BAY, in the bottom of which the land is ſo low that I could but juſt ſee it from the top-maſt head. The breakers lie between three and four miles from Point Look-out; and at this time we had a great ſea from the ſouth, which broke upon them very high. We ſtood on N. N. E. till eight o'clock, when having paſſed the breakers, and deepened our water to fifty-two fathom, we brought to till midnight, when we made ſail again to the N. N. E. At four in the morning, we had 135 fathom, and when the day broke, I perceived that during the night I had got much farther northward, and from the ſhore than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:013324_0355_0F90F29BB7BE2C10"/>
from the courſe we ſteered, for we were diſtant at leaſt ſeven leagues; I therefore hauled in N. W. by W. with a freſh gale at S. S. W. The land that was fartheſt to the north the night before, now bore S. S. W. diſtant ſix leagues, and I gave it the name of CAPE MORETON, it being the north point of Moreton's Bay: its latitude is 26:56, and its longitude is 206:28. From Cape Moreton the land trends away weſt, farther than can be ſeen, for there is a ſmall ſpace, where at this time no land is viſible, and ſome on board having alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the ſea looked paler than uſual, we were of opinion that the bottom of Moreton's Bay opened into a river: we had here thirty-four fathom water, and a fine ſandy bottom: this alone would have produced the change that had been obſerved in the colour of the water; and it was by no means neceſſary to ſuppoſe a river to account for the land at the bottom of the bay not being viſible, for ſuppoſing the land there to be as low as we knew it to be in an hundred other parts of the coaſt, it would have been impoſſible to ſee it from the ſtation of the ſhip; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if any future navigator ſhould be diſpoſed to determine the queſtion, whether there is or is not a river in this place, which the wind would not permit us to do, the ſituation may always be found by three hills, which lie to the northward of it, in the latitude of 26:53. Theſe hills lie but a little way inland, and not far from each other: they are remarkable for the ſingular form of their elevation, which very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles a glaſs-houſe, and for which reaſon I called them the GLASS HOUSES: the northermoſt of the three is the higheſt and largeſt: there are alſo ſeveral other peaked hills, inland to the northward of theſe, but they are not nearly ſo remarkable. At noon, our latitude was, by obſervation, 26:28 S. which was ten miles to the northward of the log, a circumſtance which had never before happened upon this coaſt; our longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude was 206:46. At this time we were between two and three leagues from the land, and had twenty-four fathom wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. A low bluff poiut, which was the ſouth head of a ſandy bay, bore N. 62 W. diſtant three leagues, and the northermoſt point of land in ſight bore N. ¼ E. This day we ſaw ſmoke in ſeveral places, and ſome at a conſiderable diſtance inland.</p>
                        <p>In ſteering along the ſhore, at the diſtance of two leagues, our ſoundings were from twenty-four to thirty-two fathom, with a ſandy bottom. At ſix in the evening, the northermoſt point of land bore N. ¼ W. diſtant four leagues; at ten it bore N. W. by W. ½ W. and as we had ſeen no land to the northward of it, we brought to, not well knowing which way to ſteer.</p>
                        <p>At two in the morning, however, we made ſail with the wind at S. W. and at day-light, we ſaw the land extending as far as N. ¾ E. the point we had ſet the night before bore S. W.
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:013324_0356_0F90F29C786F6B10"/>
by W. diſtant between three and four leagues. It lies in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 25:58, longitude 206:48 W.: the land within it is of a moderate and equal height, but the point itſelf is ſo unequal that it looks like two ſmall iſlands lying under the land, for which reaſon I gave it the name of DOUBLE ISLAND POINT; it may alſo be known by the white cliffs on the north ſide of it. Here the land trends to the N. W. and forms a large open bay, the bottom of which is ſo low a flat that from the deck it could ſcarcely be ſeen. In croſſing this bay, our depth of water was from thirty to twenty-two fathom, with a white ſandy bottom. At noon we were about three leagues from the ſhore, in lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 25:34 S. longitude 206:45 W.: Double Iſland Point bore S. ¾ W. and the northermoſt land in ſight N. ¾ E. This part of the coaſt, which is of a moderate height, is more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren than any we had ſeen, and the ſoil more ſandy. With our glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we could diſcover that the ſands, which lay in great patches of many acres, were moveable, and that ſome of them had not been long in the place they poſſeſſed; for we ſaw in ſeveral parts, the trees half buried, the tops of which were ſtill green; and in others, the naked trunks of ſuch as the ſand had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded long enough to deſtroy. In other places the woods appeared to be low and ſhrubby, and we ſaw no ſigns of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. Two water ſnakes ſwam by the ſhip: they were beautifully ſpotted, and in every reſpect like land ſnakes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that their tails were broad and flat, probably to ſerve them inſtead of fins in ſwimming. In the morning of this day, the variation was 8:20 E. and in the evening, 8:36. During the night, we continued our courſe to the northward, with a light breeze from the land, being diſtant from it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two and three leagues, and having from twenty-three to twenty-ſeven fathom, with a fine ſandy bottom.</p>
                        <p>At noon, on the 19th, we were about four miles from the land, with only thirteen fathom. Our latitude was 25:4, and the northermoſt land in ſight bore N. 21 W. diſtant eight miles. At one o'clock, being ſtill four miles diſtant from the ſhore, but having ſeventeen fathom water, we paſſed a black bluff head, or point of land, upon which a great number of the natives were aſſembled, and which therefore I called INDIAN HEAD: it lies in latitude 25:3. About four miles N. by W. of this Head, is another very like it, from whence the land trends away ſomewhat more to the weſtward: next to the ſea it is low and ſandy, and behind it nothing was to be ſeen, even from the maſt-head. Near Indian Head we ſaw more of the natives, and upon the neighbouring ſhore fires by night, and ſmoke by day. We kept to the northward all night, at the diſtance of from four miles to four leagues from the ſhore, and with a depth of water from ſeventeen to thirty-four fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom. At day-break, the northermoſt land bore from us W.

S. W. and ſeemed to end in a point, from which we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a reef running out to the northward as far as we could ſee. We had hauled our wind to the weſtward before it was light, and continued the courſe till we ſaw the breakers upon our lee bow. We now edged away N. W. and N. N. W. along the eaſt ſide of the ſhoal, from two to one mile diſtant, having regular ſoundings from thirteen to ſeven fathom, with a fine ſandy bottom. At noon, our latitude, by obſervation, was 20:26, which was thirteen miles to the northward of the log: we judged the extream point of the ſhoal to bear from us about N. W. and the point from which it ſeemed to run out, bore S. ¾ W. diſtant twenty miles. This point I named SANDY CAPE, from two very large patches of white ſand which lay upon it. It is ſufficiently high to be ſeen at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of twelve leagues, in clear weather, and lies in latitude 24:45, longitude 206:51: the land trends from it S. W. as far as it can be ſeen. We kept along the eaſt ſide of the ſhoal till two in the afternoon, when, judging that there was a ſufficient depth of water upon it, to allow paſſage for the ſhip, I ſent the boat a-head to ſound, and upon her making the ſignal for more than five fathom, we hauled our wind, and ſtood over the tail of it in ſix fathom. At this time we were in latitude 24:22, and Sandy Cape bore S. ½ E. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant eight leagues; but the direction on the ſhoal is neareſt N. N. W. and S. S. E. It it remarkable that when on board the ſhip we had ſix fathom, the boat, which was ſcarcely a quarter of a mile to the ſouthward, had little more than five, and that immediately after ſix fathom we had thirteen, and then twenty, as faſt as the man could caſt the lead: from theſe circumſtances, I conjectured that the weſt ſide of the ſhoal was ſteep. This ſhoal I called the BREAK SEA SPIT, becauſe we had now ſmooth water, and to the ſouthward of it we had always a high ſea from the S. E. At ſix in the evening, the land of Sandy Cape extended from S. 17 E. to S. 27 E. at he diſtance of eight leagues; our depth of water was twenty-three fathom: with the ſame ſoundings we ſtood to the weſtward all night. At ſeven in the morning, we ſaw, from the maſt head, the land of Sandy Cape bearing S. E. ½ E. diſtant about thirteen leagues: at nine we diſcovered land to the weſtward, and ſoon after ſaw ſmoke in ſeveral places. Our depth of water was now decreaſed to ſeventeen fathom, and by noon we had no more than thirteen, though we were ſeven leagues from the land, which extended from S. by W. to W. N. W. Our latitude at this time was 24:28 S. For a few days paſt we had ſeen ſeveral of the ſea birds called boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, not having met with any of them before; laſt night a ſmall flock of them paſſed the ſhip, and went away to the N. W. and in the morning, from about half an hour before
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:013324_0358_0F90F29EB5AA72F8"/>
ſun-riſe, to half an hour after, flights of them were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally coming from the N. N. W. and flying to the S. S. E. nor was one of them ſeen to fly in any other direction; we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conjectured that there was a lagoon, river, or inlet of ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low water, in the bottom of the deep bay, to the ſouthward of us, whither theſe birds reſorted to feed in the day, and that not far to the northward there were ſome iſlands to which they repaired in the night. To this bay I gave the name of HER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEY's BAY, in honour of Captain Hervey. In the afternoon, we ſtood in for the land, ſteering S. W. with a gentle breeze at S. E. till four o'clock, when, being in latitude 24:36, about two leagues from the ſhore, and having nine fathom water, we bore away along the coaſt N. W. by W. and at the ſame time could ſee land extending to the S. S. E. about eight leagues. Near the ſea the land is very low, but within there are ſome lofty hills, all thickly clothed with wood. While we were running along the ſhore, we ſhallowed our water from nine to ſeven fathom, and at one time we had but ſix, which determined us to anchor for the night.</p>
                        <p>At ſix in the morning we weighed, with a gentle breeze from the ſouthward, and ſteered N. W. ¼ W. edging in for the land till we got within two miles of it, with water from ſeven to eleven fathom: we then ſteered N. N. W. as the land lay, and at noon, our latitude was 24:19. We continued in the ſame courſe, at the ſame diſtance, with from twelve fathom to ſeven, till five in the evening, when we were abreaſt of the ſouth point of a large open bay, in which I intended to anchor. During this courſe, we diſcovered with our glaſſes that the land was covered with palm-nut-trees, which we had not ſeen from the time of our leaving the iſlands within the Tropick: we alſo ſaw two men walking along the ſhore, who did not condeſcend to take the leaſt notice of us. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, having hauled cloſe upon a wind, and made two or three trips, we anchored about eight o'clock in five fathom, with a fine ſandy bottom. The ſouth point of the bay bore E. ¾ S. diſtant two miles, the north point N. W. ¼ N. and about the ſame diſtance from the ſhore.</p>
                        <p>Early the next morning I went aſhore, with a party of men, in order to examine the country, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, the other gentlemen, and Tupia: the wind blew freſh, and we found it ſo cold, that being at ſome diſtance from the ſhore, we took our cloaks as a neceſſary equipment for the voyage. We landed a little within the ſouth point of the bay, where we found a channel leading into a large la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goon: this channel I proceeded to examine, and found three fathom water till I got about a mile up it, where I met with a ſhoal, upon which there was little more than one fathom, but having paſſed over it, I had three fathom again. The
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:013324_0359_0F90F29F75617760"/>
entrance of this channel lies cloſe to the ſouth point of the bay, being formed by the ſhore on the eaſt, and on the weſt by a large ſpit of ſand: it is about a quarter of a mile broad, and lies in S. by W. In this place there is room for a few ſhips to lie in great ſecurity, and a ſmall ſtream of freſh water; I would have rowed into the lagoon, but was prevented by ſhallows. We found ſeveral bogs, and ſwamps of ſalt water, upon which, and by the ſides of the lagoon, grows the true mangrove, ſuch as is found in the Weſt-Indies, and the firſt of the kind that we had met with. In the branches of theſe mangroves there were many neſts of a remarkable kind of ant, that was as green as graſs: when the branches were diſturbed they came out in great numbers, and puniſhed the offender by a much ſharper bite than ever we had felt from the ſame kind of animal before. Upon theſe mangroves alſo we ſaw ſmall green caterpillars in great numbers: their bodies were thick ſet with hairs, and they were ranged upon the leaves ſide by ſide, like a file of ſoldiers, to the number of twenty or thirty together: when we touched them, we found that the hair on their bodies had the quality of a nettle, and gave us a much more acute, though leſs durable pain. The country here is manifeſtly worſe than about Botany Bay: the ſoil is dry and ſandy, but the ſides of the hills are covered with trees, which grow ſeparately, without underwood. We found here the tree that yields a gum like the <hi>Sanguis draconis;</hi> but it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what different from the trees of the ſame kind which we had ſeen before, for the leaves are longer, and hang down like thoſe of the weeping willow. We found alſo much leſs gum upon them, which is contrary to the eſtabliſhed opinion, that the hotter the climate, the more gums exude. Upon a plant alſo, which yielded a yellow gum, there was leſs than upon the ſame kind of plant in Botany Bay, among the ſhoals and ſand banks we ſaw many large birds, ſome in particular of the ſame kind, that we had ſeen in Botany Bay, much bigger than ſwans, which we judged to be pelicans; but they were ſo ſhy that we could not get within gun-ſhot of them. Upon the ſhore we ſaw a ſpecies of the buſtard, one of which we ſhot, it was as large as a turkey, and weighed ſeventeen pounds and an half. We all agreed that this was the beſt bird we had eaten ſince we left England; and in honour of it we called this inlet BUSTARD BAY. It lies in latitude 24:4, longitude 208:18. The ſea ſeemed to abound with fiſh; but, unhappily, we tore our ſeine all to pieces at the firſt haul: upon the mud banks, under the mangroves, we found innumerable oyſters of various kinds; among others the hammer oyſter, and a large proportion of ſmall pearl-oyſters: if in deeper water there is equal plenty of ſuch oyſters at their full growth, a pearl fiſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry might certainly be eſtabliſhed here to a very great advantage.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="71" facs="unknown:013324_0360_0F90F2A0373B0DA8"/>
The people who were left on board the ſhip ſaid, that while we were in the woods about twenty of the natives came down to the beach, abreaſt of her, and having looked at her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, went away; but we, that were aſhore, though we ſaw ſmoke in many places, ſaw no people: the ſmoke was at places too diſtant for us to get to them by land, except one, to which we repaired: we found ten ſmall fires ſtill burning within a few paces of each other; but the people were gone: we ſaw near them ſeveral veſſels of bark, which we ſuppoſed to have contained water, and ſome ſhells and fiſh-bones, the remains of a recent meal. We ſaw alſo, lying upon the ground, ſeveral pieces of ſoft bark, about the length and breadth of a man, which we imagined might be their beds; and, on the windward ſide of the fires, a ſmall ſhade, about a foot and an half high, of the ſame ſubſtance. The whole was in a thicket of cloſe trees, which afforded good ſhelter from the wind. The place ſeemed to be much trodden, and as we ſaw no houſe, nor any remains of a houſe, we were inclined to believe that as theſe people had no clothes, they had no dwelling; but ſpent their nights among the other commoners of Nature, in the open air: and Tupia himſelf, with an air of ſuperiority and compaſſion, ſhook his head, and ſaid that they were <hi>Taata Enos,</hi> 'poor wretches.' I meaſured the perpendicular height of the laſt tide, and found it to be 8 feet above low-water mark, and from the time of low water this day, I found that it muſt be high water at the full and change of the moon at eight o'clock,</p>
                        <p>At four o'clock in the morning we weighed, and with a gentle breeze at ſouth made ſail out of the bay. In ſtanding out, our ſoundings were from five to fifteen fathom; and at day-light, when we were in the greateſt depth, and abreaſt of the north head of the bay, we diſcovered breakers ſtretching out from it N. N. E. between two and three miles, with a rock at the outermoſt point of them, juſt above water. While we were paſſing theſe rocks, at the diſtance of about half a mile, we had from fifteen to twenty fathom, and as ſoon as we had paſſed them, we hauled along ſhore W. N. W. for the fartheſt land we had in ſight. At noon, our latitude by obſervation was 23:52 S.; the north part of Buſtard Bay bore S. 62 E. diſtant ten miles; and the northermoſt land in ſight N. 60 W.; the longitude was 208:37, and our diſtance from the neareſt ſhore ſix miles, with fourteen fathom water.</p>
                        <p>Till five in the afternoon it was calm, but afterwards we ſteered before the wind N. W. as the land lay, till ten at night, and then brought to, having had all along 14 and 15 fathom. At five in the morning we made ſail: and at day-light the northermoſt point of the main bore N. 70 W. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we ſaw more land, making like iſlands, and bearing N. W.
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:013324_0361_0F90F2A10A2ECBD8"/>
by N. At nine, we were abreaſt of a point, at the diſtance of one mile, with fourteen fathom water. This point I found to lie directly under the Tropic of Capricorn; and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I called it CAPE CAPRICORN: its longitude is 208:58 W.; it is of a conſiderable height, looks white and barren, and may be known by ſome iſlands which lie to the N. W. of it, and ſome ſmall rocks at the diſtance of about a league S. E. On the weſt ſide of the Cape there appeared to be a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goon, and on the two ſpits which formed the entrance we ſaw an incredible number of the large birds that reſemble a peli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. The northermoſt land now in ſight bore from Cape Capricorn N. 24 W. and appeared to be an iſland; but the main land trended W. by N. ½ N. which courſe we ſteered, having from fifteen to ſix fathom, and from ſix to nine, with a hard ſandy bottom. At noon, our latitude by obſervation was 23:24 S.; Cape Capricorn bore S. 60 E. diſtant two leagues; and a ſmall iſland N. by E. two miles: in this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation we had nine fathom, being about four miles from the main, which, next the ſea, is low and ſandy, except the points which are high and rocky. The country inland is hilly, but by no means of a pleaſing aſpect. We continued to ſtand to the N. W. till four o'clock in the afternoon, when it fell calm; and we ſoon after anchored in twelve fathom, having the main land and iſlands in a manner all round us, and Cape Capricorn bearing S. 54 E. diſtant four leagues. In the night, we found the tide riſe and fall near ſeven feet; and the flood to ſet to the weſtward, and the ebb to the eaſtward, which is juſt contrary to whhat we found when we were at anchor to the eaſtward of Buſtard Bay.</p>
                        <p>At ſix in the morning we weighed, with a gentle breeze at South, and ſtood away to the N. W. between the outermoſt range of iſlands and the main, leaving ſeveral ſmall iſlands between the main and the ſhip, which we paſſed at a very little diſtance: our ſoundings being irregular, from twelve to four fathom, I ſent a boat a-head to ſound. At noon we were about three miles from the main, and about the ſame diſtance from the iſlands without us: our latitude by obſervation was 23:7 S.: the main land here is high and mountainous; the iſlands which lie off it are alſo moſt of them high, and of a ſmall circuit, having an appearance rather of barrenneſs than ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. At this time we ſaw ſmoke in many places, at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance inland, and therefore conjectured that there might be a lagoon, river, or inlet running up the country, the rather as we had paſſed two places which had the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of being ſuch; but our depth of water was too little to encourage me to venture where I ſhould probably have leſs. We had not ſtood to the northward above an hour, before we ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fell into three fathom; upon which I anchored, and
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:013324_0362_0F90F2A1B6A14A60"/>
ſent away the Maſter to ſound the channel which lay to leeward of us, between the northermoſt iſland and the main: it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be pretty broad, but I ſuſpected that it was ſhallow, and ſo indeed it was found; for the maſter reported at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn that in many places he had only two fathom and an half, and where we lay at anchor we had only ſixteen feet, which was not two feet more than the ſhip drew. While the maſter was ſounding the channel, Mr. Banks tried to fiſh from the cabin windows, with hook and line: the water was too ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for fiſh; but the ground was almoſt covered with crabs, which readily took the bait, and ſometimes held it ſo faſt in their claws, that they did not quit their hold till they were conſiderably above water. Theſe crabs were of two ſorts, and both of them ſuch as we had not ſeen before: one of them was adorned with the fineſt blue that can be imagined, in every reſpect equal to the ultramarine, with which all his claws, and every joint was deeply tinged: the under part of him was white, and ſo exquiſitely poliſhed that in colour and brightneſs it exactly reſembled the white of old china: the other was alſo marked with the ultramarine upon his joints, and his toes, but ſomewhat more ſparingly; and his back was marked with three brown ſpots, which had a ſingular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. The people who had been out with the boat to found, reported, that upon an iſland where we had obſerved two fires, they had ſeen ſeveral of the inhabitants, who called to them, and ſeemed very deſirous that they ſhould land. In the evening, the wind veered to E. N. E. which gave us an opportunity to ſtretch three or four miles back by the way we came; after which, the wind ſhifted to the ſouth, and obliged us again to anchor in ſix fathom.</p>
                        <p>At five in the morning, I ſent away the maſter to ſearch for a paſſage between the iſlands, while we got the ſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſail; and as ſoon as it was light we followed the boat, which made a ſignal that a paſſage had been found. As ſoon as we got again into deep water, we made ſail to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as the land lay, with ſoundings from nine fathom to fifteen, and ſome ſmall iſlands ſtill without us. At noon we were about two leagues diſtant from the main; and by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in latitude 22:53 S. The northermoſt point of land in ſight now bore N. N. W. diſtant ten miles. To this point I gave the name of CAPE MANIFOLD, from the number of high hills which appeared over it: it lies in latitude 22:43 S. and diſtant about ſeventeen leagues from Cape Capricorn, in the direction of N. 26 W. Between theſe Capes the ſhore forms a large bay, which I called KEPPEL BAY; and I alſo diſtinguiſhed the iſlands by the name of KEPPEL's ISLAND<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. In this bay there is a good anchorage; but what refreſhments it may afford, I know not: we caught no fiſh, though we
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:013324_0363_0F90F2A272585228"/>
were at anchor; but probably there is freſh water in ſeveral places, as both the iſlands and the main are inhabited. We ſaw ſmoke and fires upon the main; and upon the iſlands we ſaw people. At three in the afternoon, we paſſed Cape Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold, from which the land trends N. N. W. The land of the Cape is high, riſing in hills directly from the ſea; and may be known by three iſlands which lie off it, one of them near the ſhore, and the other two eight miles out at ſea. One of theſe iſlands is low and flat, and the other high and round. At ſix o'clock in the evening we brought to, when the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt part of the main in ſight bore N. W. and ſome iſlands which lie off it N. 31 W. Our ſoundings after twelve o'clock were from twenty to twenty-five fathom, and in the night from thirty to thirty-four.</p>
                        <p>At day-break we made ſail, Cape Manifold bearing S. by E. diſtant eight leagues, and the iſlands which I had ſet the night before were diſtant four miles in the ſame direction. The far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt viſible point of the main bore N. 67 W. at the diſtance of twenty-two miles; but we could ſee ſeveral iſlands to the northward of this direction. At nine o'clock in the forenoon, we were abreaſt of the point which I called CAPE TOWN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEND. It lies in latitude 22:15; longitude 209:43: the land is high and level, and rather naked than woody. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral iſlands lie to the northward of it, at the diſtance of four or five miles out at ſea; three or four leagues to the S. E. the ſhore forms a bay, in the bottom of which there appeared to be an inlet or harbour. To the weſtward of the Cape the land trends S. W. ½ S. and there forms a very large bay, which turns to the eaſtward, and probably communicates with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and makes the land of the cape an iſland. As ſoon as we got round this cape, we hauled our wind to the weſtward, in order to get within the iſlands, which lie ſcattered in the bay in great numbers, and extend out to ſea as far as the eye could reach, even from the maſt head: theſe iſlands vary both in height and circuit from each other; ſo that, although they are very numerous, no two of them are alike. We had not flood long upon a wind before we came into ſhoal water, and were obliged to tack at once to avoid it. Having ſent a boat ahead, I bore away W. by N. many ſmall iſlands, rocks and ſhoals, lying between us and the main, and many of a larger extent without us: our ſoundings till near noon were from fourteen to ſeventeen fathom, when the boat made the ſignal for meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſhoal water: upon this we hauled cloſe upon a wind to the eaſtward, but ſuddenly fell into three fathom and a quarter; we immediately dropped an anchor, which brought the ſhip up with all her ſails ſtanding. When the ſhip was bought up we had four fathom, with a coarſe ſandy bottom, and found a ſtrong tide ſetting to the N. W. by W. ½ W. at
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:013324_0364_0F90F2A34D65E2C8"/>
the rate of near three miles an hour, by which we were ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly carried upon the ſhoal. Our latitude by obſervation was 22:8 S.; Cape Townſhend bore E. 16 S. diſtant thirteen miles; and the weſtermoſt part of the main in ſight W. ¾ N. At this time a great number of iſlands lay all round us.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon, having ſounded round the ſhip, and found that there was water ſufficient to carry her over the ſhoal, we weighed, and about three o'clock made ſail and ſtood to the weſtward, as the land lay, having ſent a boat ahead to ſound. At ſix in the evening, we anchored in ten fathom, with a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy bottom, at about two miles diſtance from the main; the weſtermoſt part of which bore W. N. W. and a great number of iſlands, lying a long way without us, were ſtill in ſight.</p>
                        <p>At five o'clock the next morning, I ſent away the maſter with two boats to ſound the entrance of an inlet, which bore from us weſt, at about the diſtance of a league, into which I intended to go with the ſhip, that I might wait a few days till the moon ſhould encreaſe, and in the mean time examine the country. As ſoon as the ſhip could be got under ſail, the boats made the ſignal for anchorage; upon which we ſtood in, and anchored in five fathom water, about a league within the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the inlet; which, as I obſerved a tide to flow and ebb conſiderably, I judged to be a river that ran up the country to a conſiderable diſtance. In this place I had thoughts of laying the ſhip aſhore, and cleaning her bottom; I therefore landed with the maſter in ſearch of a convenient place for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and was accompanied by Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander. We found walking here exceedingly troubleſome, for the ground was covered with a kind of graſs, the ſeeds of which were very ſharp, and bearded backwards; ſo that whenever they ſtuck into our clothes, which indeed was at every ſtep, they worked forwards by means of the beard, till they got at the fleſh; and at the ſame time we were ſurrounded by a cloud of muſquitos, which inceſſantly tormented us with their ſtings. We ſoon met with ſeveral places where the ſhip might conveniently be laid aſhore; but to our great diſappointment we could find no freſh water. We proceeded however up the country, where we found gum trees like thoſe that we had ſeen before, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that here alſo the gum was in very ſmall quantities. Upon the branches of theſe trees, and ſome others, we found ants neſts, made of clay, as big as a buſhel, ſomething like thoſe deſcribed in Sir Hans Sloan's Natural Hiſtory of Jamaica, vol. 2. p. 221, tab. 258, but not ſo ſmooth: the ants which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited theſe neſts were ſmall, and their bodies white. But upon another ſpecies of the tree we found a ſmall black ant, which perforated all the twigs, and having worked out the pit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

which they ſwarmed in ſuch amazing numbers, bore leaves and flowers, and appeared to be in as flouriſhing a ſtate as thoſe that were ſound. We found alſo an incredible number of but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terflies, ſo that for the ſpace of three or four acres the air was ſo crowded with them that millions were to be ſeen in every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, at the ſame time that every branch and twig was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with others that were not upon the wing. We found here alſo a ſmall fiſh of a ſingular kind; it was about the ſize of a minnow, and had two very ſtrong breaſt fins: we found it in places that were quite dry, where we ſuppoſed it might have been left by the tide; but it did not ſeem to have become lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid by the want of water; for upon our approach it leaped away, by the help of the breaſt ſins, as nimbly as a frog, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed did it ſeem to prefer water to land; for when we found it in the water, it frequently leaped out, and purſued its way upon dry ground: we alſo obſerved that when it was in places where ſmall ſtones were ſtanding above the ſurface of the water, at a little diſtance from each other, it choſe rather to leap from ſtone to ſtone, than to paſs through the water; and we ſaw ſeveral of them paſs entirely over puddles in this manner, till they came to dry ground, and then leap away.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon we renewed our ſearch after freſh water, but without ſucceſs; and therefore I determined to make my ſtay here but ſhort: however, having obſerved from an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence that the inlet penetrated a conſiderable way into the country, I determined to trace it in the morning.</p>
                        <p>At ſun-riſe I went aſhore, and climbing a conſiderable hill, I took a view of the coaſt and the iſlands that lie off it, with their bearings, having an azimuth compaſs with me for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but I obſerved that the needle differed very conſiderably in its poſition, even to thirty degrees, in ſome places more, in others leſs; and once I found it differ from itſelf no leſs than two points, in the diſtance of fourteen feet. I took up ſome of the looſe ſtones that lay upon the ground, and applied them to the needle, but they produced no effect; and I therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that there was iron ore in the hills, of which I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked other indications both here, and in the neighbouring parts. After I had made my obſervations upon the hill, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with Dr. Solander up the inlet; I ſet out with the firſt of the flood, and long before high-water I had advanced above eight leagues. Its breadth thus far was from two to five miles, upon a S. W. by S. direction; but here it opened every way, and formed a large lake, which to the N. W. communicated with the ſea; and I not only ſaw the ſea in this direction, but found the tide of flood coming ſtrongly in from that point: I alſo obſerved an arm of this lake extending to the eaſtward, and it is not improbable that it may communicate with the ſea in the bottom of the bay, which lies to the weſtward of
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:013324_0366_0F8FFB93D7F50A98"/>
Cape Townſhend. On the ſouth ſide of the lake is a ridge of high hills which I was very deſirous to climb; but it being high water, and the day far ſpent, I was afraid of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildered among the ſhoals in the night, eſpecially as the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was dark and rainy; and therefore I made the beſt of my way to the ſhip. In this excurſion I ſaw only two people, and they were at a diſtance; they followed the boat along the ſhore a good way, but the tide running ſtrongly in my favour, I could not prudently wait for them: I ſaw however ſeveral fires in one direction, and ſmoke in another, but they alſo were at a diſtance. While I was tracing the inlet with Dr. Solander, Mr. Banks was endeavouring to penetrate into the country, where ſeveral of the people, who had leave to go aſhore, were alſo rambling about. Mr. Banks and his party found their courſe obſtructed by a ſwamp, covered with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groves, which however they reſolved to paſs; the mud was almoſt knee deep, yet they reſolutely went on; but before they got half way, they repented of their undertaking; the bottom was covered with branches of trees, interwoven with each other, ſometimes they kept their footing upon them, ſometimes their feet ſlipt through, and ſometimes they were ſo entangled among them, that they were forced to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by groping in the mud and ſlime with their hands. In about an hour however they croſſed it, and judged it might be about a quarter of a mile over. After a ſhort walk they came up to a place where there had been four ſmall fires, and near them ſome ſhells and bones of fiſh, that had been roaſted: they found alſo heaps of graſs laid together, where four or five people appeared to have ſlept. The Second Lieutenant, Mr. Gore, who was at another place, ſaw a little water lying in the bottom of a gully, and near it the track of a large animal: ſome buſtards were alſo ſeen, but none of them ſhot, nor any other bird except a few of the beautiful loriquets, which we had ſeen in Botany Bay. Mr. Gore, and one of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>The inlet in which the ſhip lay I called THIRSTY SOUND, becauſe it afforded us no freſh water. It lies in latitude 22:10 S. and longitude 210:18 W.; and may be known by a group of ſmall iſlands lying under the ſhore, from two to five leagues diſtant, in the direction of N.

is a high round hill, which on the N. W. is a peninſula that at high water is ſurrounded by the ſea: they are bold to both the ſhores, and the diſtance between them is about two miles. In this inlet is good anchorage in ſeven, ſix, five, and four fathom; and places very convenient for laying a ſhip down, where, at ſpring-tides, the water does not riſe leſs than ſixteen or eighteen feet. The tide flows at the full and change of the moon about eleven o'clock. I have already obſerved that here is no freſh water, nor could we procure refreſhment or any other kind: we ſaw two turtles, but we were not able to take either of them: neither did we catch either fiſh or wild fowl, except a few ſmall land-birds: we ſaw indeed the ſame ſorts of water-fowl as in Botany Bay, but they were ſo ſhy that we could not get a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

E. and kept without the group of iſlands that lie in ſhore, and to the N. W. of Thirſty Sound, as there appeared to be no ſafe paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the main: at the ſame time we had a number of iſlands without us, extending as far as we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ould ſee: during our run in this direction our depth of water was ten, eight, and nine fathom. At noon, the weſt point of Thirſty Sound, which I have called PIER HEAD, bore S. 36 E. diſtant five leagues; the eaſt point of the other inlet, which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with the ſound, bore S. by W. diſtant two leagues: the group of iſlands juſt mentioned lay between us and the point, and the fartheſt part of the main in ſight, on the other ſide of the inlet, bore N. W. Our latitude by obſervation was 21:53. At half an hour after twelve, the boat, which was ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ahead, made the ſignal for ſhoal water, and we immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately hauled our wind to the N. E. At this time we had ſeven fathom, at the next caſt five, and at the next three, upon which we inſtantly dropped an anchor, that brought the ſhip up. Pier Head the north weſt point of Thirſty-Sound, bore S. E. diſtant ſix leagues, being half way between the iſlands which lie off the eaſt point of the weſtern inlet, and three ſmall iſlands which lie directly without them. It was now the firſt of the flood, which we found to ſet N. W. by W. ½ W.; and having ſounded about the ſhoal, upon which we had three fathom, and found deep water all round it, we got under ſail, and having hauled round the three iſlands that have been juſt mentioned, came to an anchor under the lee of them, in fifteen fathom water; and the weather being dark, hazy, and rainy, we remained there till ſeven o'clock in the morning. At this time we got again under ſail, and ſtood to the N. W. with a freſh breeze at S. S. E.; having the main
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:013324_0368_0F8FFB948E97FE10"/>
land in ſight, and a number of iſlands all round us, ſome of which lay out at ſea as far as the eye could reach. The weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern inlet, which in the chart is diſtinguiſhed by the name of Broad Sound, we had now all open; at the entrance, is at leaſt nine or ten leagues wide: in it, and before it lie ſeveral iſlands, and probably ſhoals alſo; for our ſoundings were very irregular, varying ſuddenly from ten to four fathom. At noon, our latitude by obſervation was 21:29 S.; a point of land which forms the north weſt entrance into Broad Sound, and which I have named CAPE PALMERSTON, lying in latitude 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

W. by N. as the land lay, under an eaſy ſail, having a boat ahead to ſound: at firſt the ſoundings were very irregular, from nine to four fathom; but afterwards they were regular, from nine to eleven. At eight in the evening, being about two leagues from the main land, we anchored in eleven fathom, with a ſandy bottom; and ſoon after we found the tide ſetting with a ſlow motion to the weſtward. At one o'clock it was ſlack or low-water; and at half an hour after 2 the ſhip tended to the eaſtward, and rode ſo till ſix in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when the tide had riſen eleven feet. We now got un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſail, and ſtood away in the direction of the coaſt, N. N. W. From what we had obſerved of the tide during the night, it is plain, that the flood came from the N. W.; whereas the preceeding day, and ſeveral days before, it came from the S. E.; nor was this the firſt, or even ſecond time that we had remarked the ſame thing. At ſun-riſe this morning, we found the variation to be 6:45 E.; and in ſteering along the ſhore, between the iſland and the main, at the diſtance of about two leagues from the main, and three or four from the iſland, our ſoundings were regular from twelve to nine fathom; but about eleven o'clock in the forenoon we were again embaraſſed in ſhoal water, having at one time not more than three fathom; yet we got clear without caſting anchor. At noon we were about two leagues from the main, and four from the iſlands without us. Our latitude by ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The land here is diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by mountains, hills, plains, and valleys, and ſeems to be well clothed with herbage and wood: the iſlands which lie parallel to the coaſt, and from five to eight or nine miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, are of various height and extent; ſcarcely any of them are more than five leagues in circumference, and many are not four miles: beſides this chain of iſlands, which lie at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the coaſt, there are others much leſs, which lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the land, from which we ſaw ſmoke riſing in different places. We continued to ſteer along the ſhore, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of about two leagues, with regular ſoundings from nine to ten fathom. At ſun-ſet, the fartheſt point of the main bore N. 48 W. and to the northward of this lay ſome high land, which I took to be an iſland, and of which the north weſt point bore 41 W.; but not being ſure of a paſſage, I came to an anchor about eight o'clock in the evening, in ten fathom water, with a muddy bottom. About ten we had a tide ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the northward, and at two it had fallen nine feet; after this it began to riſe, and the flood came from the northward, in the direction of the iſlands which lay out to ſea; a plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication that there was no paſſage to the N. W. This how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had not appeared at day-break, when we got under ſail and ſtood to the N. W. At eight o'clock in the morning, we diſcovered low land quite acroſs what we took for an opening, which proved to be a bay, about five or ſix leagues deep; upon this we hauled our wind to the eaſtward round the north point of the bay, which at this time bore from us N. E. by N. diſtant four leagues: from this point we found the land trend way N. by W. ½ W, and a ſtreight or paſſage between it and a large iſland, or iſlands, lying parallel to it. Having the tide of ebb in our favour, we ſtood for this paſſage; and at noon were juſt within the entrance: our latitude by obſervation was 20:26 S.; Cape Hillſborough bore S. by E. diſtant ten leagues; and the north point of the bay S. 19 W. diſtant fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This point, which I named CAPE CONWAY, lies in latitude 26:36, S. longitude 211:28 W.; and the bay which lies between this cape and Cape Hillſborough I called REPULSE BAY. The greateſt depth of water which we found in it was thirteen fathom, and the leaſt eight. In all parts there was ſafe anchorage, and I believe that, upon proper exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, ſome good harbours would be found in it; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the north ſide within Cape Conway; for juſt within that cape there lie two or three ſmall iſlands, which alone would ſhelter that ſide of the bay from the ſoutherly and ſouth eaſterly winds, that ſeem to prevail here as a T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Among the many iſlands that lie upon this coaſt, there is one more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable than the reſt; it is of a ſmall circuit, very high and peaked, and lies E. by S. ten miles from Cape Conway, at the ſouth end of the paſſage.

It is formed by the main on the weſt, and by the iſlands on the eaſt, one of which is at leaſt five leagues in length: our depth of water in running through was from twenty to twenty-five fathom, with good anchorage every where, and the whole paſſage may be conſidered as one:

ſafe harbour, excluſive of the ſmall bays and coves which abound on each ſide, where ſhips might lie as in a baſon. The land both upon the main and iſlands is high, and diverſified by hill and valley, wood and lawn, with a green and pleaſant appearance. On one of the iſlands we diſcovered with our glaſſes two men and a woman, and a canoe with an outrigger, which appeared to be larger, and of a conſtruction very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe of bark tied together at the ends, which we had ſeen upon other parts of the coaſt; we hoped therefore that the people here had made ſome farther advances beyond mere animal life, than thoſe we had ſeen before. At ſix o'clock in the evening, we were nearly the length of the north end of the paſſage; the north weſtermoſt point of the main in fight bore N. 54<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> W. and the north end of the iſland N. N. E. with an open ſea between the two points. As this paſſage was diſcovered on Whitſunday, I called it WHITSUNDAY's PASSAGE, and I called the iſlands that form it CUMBERLAND ISLANDS, in honour of his Royal Highneſs the Duke. We kept under an eaſy ſail, with the lead going all night, being about three leagues from the ſhore, and having from twenty-one to twenty-three fathom water. At day-break, we were abreaſt of the point which had been the fartheſt in fight to the north weſt the evening before, which I named CAPE GLOU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESTER. It is a lofty promontory, in latitude 19:59 S. lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude, 211:49 W. and may be known by an iſland which lies out at ſea N. by W. ½ W. at the diſtance of five or ſix leages from it, and which I called HOLBORNE ISLE; there are alſo iſlands lying under the land between Holborne Iſle, and Whitſunday's Paſſage. On the weſt ſide of Cape Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter the land trends away S. W. and S. S. W. and forms a deep bay, the bottom of which I could but juſt ſee from the maſt-head: it is very low, and a continuation of the low land which we had ſeen at the bottom of Repulſe Bay. This bay I called EDGECUMBE BAY; but without ſtaying to look into it, we continued our courſe to the weſtward, for the fartheſt land we could ſee in that direction, which bore W. by N. ½ N. and appeared very high. At noon we were about three leagues from the ſhore, by obſervation in latitude 19:47 S. and Cape Glouceſter bore S. 63 E. diſtant ſeven leagues and an half. At ſix in the evening, we were abreaſt of the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt point juſt mentioned, at about three miles diſtance, and becauſe it riſes abruptly from the low lands which ſurround it, I called it CAPE UPSTART. It lies in latitude 19:39 S. longitude 212:32 W. fourteen leagues W. N. W. from Cape Glouceſter, and is of a height ſufficient to be ſeen at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of twelve leagues: inland there are ſome high hills or mountains, which, like the Cape, afford but a barren pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Having paſſed this Cape, we continued ſtanding to

the W. N. W. as the land lay, under an eaſy ſail, having from ſixteen to ten fathom, till two o'clock in the morning, when we fell into ſeven fathom; upon which we hauled our wind to the northward, judging ourſelves to be very near land: at day-break, we found our conjecture to be true, being within little more than two leagues of it. In this part of the coaſt the land, being very low, is nearer than it appears to be, though it is diverſified with here and there a hill. At noon we were about four leagues from the land, in fifteen fathom water, and our latitude, by obſervation, was 19:12 S. Cape Upſtart bearing S. 32:30 E. diſtant twelve leagues. About this time ſome very large columns of ſmoke were ſeen riſing from the low lands. At ſun-ſet, the preceeding night, when we were cloſe under Cape Upſtart, the variation was nearly 9 E. and at ſun-riſe this day, it was no more than 5:35; I judged therefore that it had been influenced by iron ore, or other magnetical matter, contained under the ſurface of the earth.</p>
                        <p>We continued to ſteer W. N. W. as the land lay, with twelve or fourteen fathom water, till noon on the 6th, when our latitude by obſervation, was 19:1 S. and we had the mouth of a bay all open, extending from S. ½ E. to S. W. ½ S. diſtant two leagues. This bay, which named CLEAVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND BAY, appeared to be about five or ſix miles in extent every way: the eaſt point I named CAPE CLEAVELAND, and the weſt, which had the appearance of an iſland, MAGNETI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAL ISLE, as we perceived that the compaſs did not traverſe well when we were near it: they are both high, and ſo is the main land within them, the whole forming a ſurface the moſt rugged, rocky, and barren of any we had ſeen upon the coaſt; it was not however without inhabitants, for we ſaw ſmoke in ſeveral parts of the bottom of the bay. The northermoſt land that was in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

W. keeping the main land on board, the outermoſt part of which, at ſun-ſet, bore W. by N. but without it lay high land, which we judged not to be part of it. At day-break, we were abreaſt of the eaſtern part of this land, which we found to be a group of iſlands, lying about five leagues from the main: at this time, being between the two ſhores, we advanced ſlowly to the N. W. till noon, when our latitude, by obſervation, was 18:49 S. and our diſtance from the main about five leagues: the north weſt part of it bore from us N. by W. ½ W. the iſlands extending from N. to E. and the neareſt being diſtant about two miles: Cape Cleaveland bore S. 50 E. diſtant eighteen leagues. Our ſoundings, in the courſe that we had ſailed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

this time and the preceeding noon, were from fourteen to eleven fathom.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon, we ſaw ſeveral large columns of ſmoke upon the main; we ſaw alſo ſome people and canoes, and upon one of the iſlands what had the appearance of cocoa nut-trees: as a few of theſe nuts would have been very acceptable, I ſent Lieutenant Hicks aſhore, and with him went Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, to ſee what refreſhment could be procured, while I kept ſtanding in for the iſland with the ſhip. About ſeven o'clock in the evening they returned, with an account that what we had taken for cocoa nut-trees, were a ſmall kind of cabbage palm, and that, except about fourteen or fifteen plants, they had met with nothing worth bringing away. While they were aſhore, they ſaw none of the people, but juſt as they had put off, one of them came very near the beach, and ſhouted with a loud voice; it was ſo dark that they could not ſee him, however they turned towards the ſhore, but when he heard the boat putting back, he ran away or hid himſelf, for they could not get u glimpſe of him, and though they ſhouted, he made no reply. After the return of the boats, we ſtood away N. by W. for the northermoſt land in ſight, of which we were abreaſt at three o'clock in the morning, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed all the iſlands three or four hours before. This land, on account of its figure, I name POINT HILLOCK: it is of a conſiderable height, and may be known by a round hillock, or rock, which joins to the point, but appears to be detached from it. Between this cape and Magnetical iſle the ſhore forms a large bay, which I called HALIFAX BAY: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it lay the group of iſlands which has been juſt mentioned, and ſome others, at a leſs diſtance from the ſhore. By theſe iſlands the bay is ſheltered from all winds, and it affords good anchorage. The land near the beach, in the bottom of the bay, is low and woody, but farther back it is one continued ridge of high land, which appeared to be barren and rocky. Having paſſed Point Hillock, we continued ſtanding to the N. N. W. as the land trended, having the advantage of a light moon. At ſix, we were abreaſt of a point of land which lies N. by W. ½ W. diſtant eleven miles from Point Hillock, which I named CAPE SANDWICH. Between theſe two points the land is very high, and the ſurface is craggy and barren. Cape Sandwich may be known not only by the high craggy land over it, but by a ſmall iſland which lies eaſt of it, at the diſtance of a mile, and ſome others that lie about two leagues to the northward. From Cape Sandwich the lands trends W. and afterwards N. forming a fine large bay, which I called ROCKINGHAM BAY, where there appears to be good ſhelter, and good anchorage, but I did not ſtay to examine it; I kept ranging along the ſhore to the northward, for a cluſter of ſmall
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:013324_0373_0F90F2A7CD275EE0"/>
iſlands, which lie off the northern point of the bay. Between the three outermoſt of theſe iſlands, and theſe near the ſhore, I found a channel about a mile broad, through which I paſſed, and upon one of the neareſt iſlands we ſaw with our glaſſes about thirty of the natives, men, women, and children, all ſtanding together, and looking with great attention at the ſhip; the firſt inſtance of curioſity that we had ſeen among them: they were all ſtark naked, with ſhort hair, and of the ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At noon, our latitude, by obſervation, was 17:59, and we were abreaſt of the north point of Rockingham Bay, which bore from us W. at the diſtance of about two miles. This boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of the bay is formed by an iſland of conſiderable height, which in the chart is diſtinguiſhed by the name of DUNK ISLE, and which lies ſo near the ſhore as not to be eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from it. Our longitude was 213:57 W. Cape Sandwich bore S. by E. ½ E. diſtant nineteen miles, and the northermoſt land in ſight N. ½ W.: our depth of water for the laſt ten hours had not been more than ſixteen, nor leſs than ſeven fathom. At ſun-ſet, the northern extremity of the land bore N. 25 W. and we kept our courſe N. by W. along the coaſt, at the diſtance of between three and four leagues, with an eaſy ſail all night, having from twelve to fifteen fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom water.</p>
                        <p>At ſix o'clock in the morning, we were abreaſt of ſome ſmall iſlands, which we called FRANKLAND's ISLES, and which lie about two leagues diſtant from the main land. The moſt diſtant point in ſight to the northward bore N. by W. ½ W. and we thought it was part of the main, but afterwards found it to be an iſland of conſiderable height, and about four miles in circuit. Between this iſland and a point on the main, from which it is diſtant about two miles, I paſſed with the ſhip. At noon, we were in the middle of the channel, and by obſervation in the latitude of 16:57 S. with 20 fathom wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the point on the man of which we were now abreaſt, I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led CAPE GRAFTON, its latitude is 16:57 S. and longitude 214:6 W. and the land here, as well as the whole coaſt for about twenty leagues to the ſouthward, is high, has a rocky ſurface, and is thinly covered with wood: during the night we had ſeen ſeveral fires, and about noon ſome people. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hauled round Cape Grafton, we found the land trend away N. W. by W. and three miles the weſtward of the Cape we found a bay, in which we anchored about two miles from the ſhore, in four fathom water, with an ouzey bottom. The eaſt point of the bay bore S. 74 E. the weſt point S. 83 W. and a low, green, woody iſland, which lies in the offing, N. 35 E. This iſland, which lies N. by E. ½ E. diſtant three or four

                        <p>As ſoon as the ſhip was brought to an anchor, I went aſhore, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander.

When we got aſhore we found the country every where riſing into ſteep rocky hills, and as no freſh water could conveniently be procured, I was unwilling to loſe time by going in ſearch of lower land elſewhere: we therefore made the beſt of our way back to the ſhip, and about midnight we weighed and ſtood to the N. W. having but little wind, with ſome ſhowers of rain. At four in the morning, the breeze freſhened at S. by E. and the weather became fair: we continued ſteering N. N. W. ½ W. as the land lay, at about three leagues diſtance, with ten, twelve, and fourteen fathom water. At ten we hauled off north, in order to get without a ſmall low iſland, which lay about two leagues diſtant from the main, and great part of which at this time, it being high water, was overflowed: about three leagues to the north weſt of this iſland, cloſe under the main land, is another iſland, the land of which riſes to a greater height, and which at noon bore from us N. 55 W. diſtant ſeven or eight miles. At this time our latitude was 16:20 S. Cape Grafton bore S. 29 E. diſtant 40 miles, and the northermoſt point of land in ſight N. 20 W.; our depth of water was fifteen fathom. Between this point and Cape Grafton, the ſhore forms a large, but not a very deep bay, which being diſcovered on Trinity Sunday, I called TRINI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY BAY.</p>

                        <p>This Cape lies in latitude 16:6 S. and longitude 214:39 W. We ſteered along the ſhore N. by W. at the diſtance of between three and four leagues, having from fourteen to twelve, and ten fathom water: in the offing we ſaw two iſlands, which lie in latitude 6 S. and about 6 or 7 leagues from the main. At ſix in the evening, the northermoſt land in ſight bore N. by W. ½ W. and 2 low woody iſlands, which ſome of us took to be rocks above water, bore N. ½ W. At this time we ſhortened ſail, and hauled off ſhore E. N. E. and N. E. by E. cloſe upon a wind, for it was my deſign to ſtretch off all night, as well to avoid the danger we ſaw ahead, as to ſee whether any iſlands lay in the offing, eſpecially as we were now near the latitude aſſigned to the iſlands which were diſcovered by Quiros, and which ſome geographers, for what reaſon I know not, have thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We had the advantage of a fine breeze, and a clear moonlight night, and in ſtanding off from ſix till near nine o'clock, we deepened our water from fourteen to twenty-one fathom, but while we were at ſupper it ſuddenly ſhoaled, and we fell into twelve, ten, and eight fathom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of a few minutes; I immediately ordered every body to their ſtation, and all was ready to put about, and come to an anchor, but meeting at the next caſt of the lead with deep water again, we concluded that we had gone over the tail of the ſhoals, which we had ſeen at ſun-ſet, and that all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was paſt: before ten we had twenty and one and twenty fathom, and this depth continuing, the gentlemen left the deck in great tranquility and went to bed; but a few minutes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eleven, the water ſhallowed at once from twenty to ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen fathom, and before the lead could be caſt again, the ſhip ſtruck, and remained immoveable, except by the heaving of the ſurge, that beat her againſt the craggs of the rock upon which ſhe lay. In a few moments every body was upon deck, with countenances which ſufficiently expreſſed the horrors of our ſituation. We had ſtood off the ſhore three hours and an half, with a pleaſant breeze, and therefore knew that we could not be very near it, and we had too much reaſon to conclude that we were upon a rock of coral, which is more fatal than any other, becauſe the points of it are ſharp, and every part of the ſurface ſo rough as to grind away whatever is rubbed againſt it, even with the gentleſt motion. In this ſituation all the ſails were immediately taken in, and the boats hoiſted out to examine the depth of water round the ſhip: we ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that our fears had not aggravated our misfortune, and
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:013324_0376_0F90F2A9F47A9200"/>
that the veſſel had been lifted over a ledge of the rock, and lay in a hollow within it: in ſome places there was from three to four fathom, and in others not ſo many feet. The ſhip lay with her head to the N. E.; and at the diſtance of about thirty yards on the ſtarboard ſide, the water deepened to eight, ten, and twelve fathom. As ſoon as the long boat was out, we ſtruck our yards and top-maſts, and carried out the ſtream anchor on the ſtarboard bow, got the coaſting anchor and cable into the boat, and were going to carry it out the ſame way; but upon ſounding a ſecond time round the ſhip, the water was found to be deepeſt aſtern: the anchor therefore was carried out from the ſtarboard quarter, inſtead of the ſtarboard bow, that is, from the ſtern inſtead of the head, and having taken ground, our utmoſt force was applied to the capſtern, hoping that if the anchor did not come home, the ſhip would be go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We had now no chance to lighten her, and we had loſt the opportunity of doing that to the greateſt advantage, for unhappily we went on ſhore juſt at high water, and by this time it had conſiderably fallen, ſo that after ſhe ſhould be lightened ſo as to draw as much leſs water as the water had ſunk, we ſhould be but in the ſame ſituation as at firſt; and the only alleviation of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance was, that as the tide ebbed the ſhip ſettled to the rocks, and was not beaten againſt them with ſo much violence. We had indeed ſome hope from the next tide, but it was doubtful whether ſhe would hold together ſo long, eſpecially as the rock kept grating her bottom under the ſtarboard bow with ſuch force as to be heard in the fore ſtore-room. This however was no time to indulge conjecture, nor was any effort remitted in deſpair of ſucceſs: that no time might be loſt, the water was immediately ſtarted into the hold, and pumped up; ſix of our guns, being all we had upon the deck, our iron and ſtone ballaſt, caſks, hoops, ſtaves, oil jars, decayed ſtores, and many other things that lay in the way of heavier materials were thrown over board with the utmoſt expedition, every one exerting himſelf with an alacrity almoſt approaching to cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, without the leaſt repining or diſcontent; yet the men were ſo far impreſt with a ſenſe of their ſituation, that not an oath was heard among them, the habit of profaneneſs, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtrong, being inſtantly ſubdued, by the dread of incurring guilt, when death ſeemed to be ſo near.</p>

While we were thus employed, day broke upon us, and we ſaw the land at about eight leagues diſtance, without any iſland in the intermediate ſpace, upon which, if the ſhip ſhould have gone to pieces, we might have been ſet aſhore by the boats, and from which they might have taken us by different turns to the main: the wind however gradually died away, and early in the forenoon it was a dead calm; if it had blown hard the ſhip muſt inevitably have been deſtroyed. At 11 in the forenoon we expected high water, and anchors were got out, and every thing made ready for another effort to heave her off if ſhe ſhould float, but to our inexpreſſible ſurprize and concern ſhe did not float by ½ foot, though we had lightened her near fifty ton, ſo much did the day-tide fall ſhort of that in the night. We now proceeded to lighten her ſtill more, and threw overboard every thing that it was poſſible for us to ſpare: hitherto ſhe had not admitted much water, but as the tide fell, it ruſhed in ſo faſt, that two pumps, inceſſantly worked, could ſcarcely keep her free. At two o'clock ſhe lay heeling two or three ſtreaks to ſtarboard, and the pinnace, which lay under her bows, touched the ground: we had now no hope but from the tide at midnight, and to prepare for it we carried out our two bower anchors, one on the ſtarboard quarter, and the other right a-ſtern, got the blocks and tackle which were to give us a purchaſe upon the cables in order, and brought the falls, or ends of them, in abaft, ſtraining them tight, that the next effort might operate upon the ſhip, and by ſhortening the length of the cable between that and the anchors, draw her off the ledge upon which ſhe reſted, towards the deep water. About five o'clock in the afternoon, we obſerved the tide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to riſe, but we obſerved at the ſame time that the leak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to a moſt alarming degree, ſo that two more pumps were manned, but unhappily only one of them would work: three of the pumps however were kept going, and at nine o'clock the ſhip righted, but the leak had gained upon us ſo conſiderably, that it was imagined ſhe muſt go to the bottom as ſoon as ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It was ſome comfort to find that ſhe did not now admit more water than ſhe had done upon the rock; and though, by the gaining of the leak upon the pumps, there was no leſs than three feet nine inches water in the hold, yet the men did not relinquiſh their labour, and we held the water as it were at bay; but having now endured exceſſive fatigue of body, and agitation of the mind, for more than four and twenty hours, and having but little hope of ſucceeding at laſt, they began to flag: none of them could work at the pump more than five or ſix minutes together, and then, being totally exhauſted, they threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves down upon deck, though a ſtream of water was running over it from the pumps between three and four inches deep; when thoſe who ſucceeded them had worked their ſpell, and were exhauſted in their turn, they threw themſelves down in the ſame manner, and the others ſtarted up again, and renewed their labour; thus relieving each other till an accident was very near putting an end to their efforts at once. The plank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which lines the inſide of the ſhip's bottom is called the cieling, and between this, and the outſide planking, there is a ſpace of about eighteen inches: the man who till this time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

New confidence and new hope, however founded, inſpired new vigour; and though our ſtate was the ſame as when the men firſt began to ſlacken in their labour, through wearineſs and deſpondency, they now renewed their efforts with ſuch alacrity and ſpirit, that before eight o'clock in the morning the leak was ſo far from having gained upon the pumps, that the pumps had gained conſiderably upon the leak. Every body now talked of getting the ſhip into ſome harbour, as a thing not to be doubted, and as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                              <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>

Our next buſineſs was to get up the fore-top-maſt and fore-yard, and warp the ſhip to the ſouth-eaſt, and at eleven, having now a breeze from the ſea, we once more got under ſail, and ſtood for the land.</p>
                        <p>It was however impoſſible long to continue the labour by which the pumps had been made to gain upon the leak, and as the exact ſituation of it could not be diſcovered, we had no hope of ſtopping it within. In this ſituation, Mr. Monkhouſe, one of my midſhipmen, came to me and propoſed an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that he had once ſeen uſed on board a merchant ſhip, which ſprung a leak that admitted above four feet water an hour, and which by this expedient was brought ſafely from Virginia to London; the maſter having ſuch confidence in it, that he took her out of harbour, knowing her condition, and did not think it worth while to wait till the leak could be otherwiſe ſtopped. To this man, therefore, the care of the expedient, which is called fothering the ſhip, was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed, four or five of the people being appointed to aſſiſt him, and he performed it in this manner: He took a lower ſtudding ſail, and having mixed together a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of oakham and wool, chopped pretty ſmall, he ſtitched i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> horſe dung if we had had it, would have been better. When the ſail was thus prepared, it was hauled under the ſhip's bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom by ropes, which kept it extended, and when it came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the leak, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

By the ſucceſs of this expedient our leak was ſo fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

reduced, that inſtead of gaining upon three pumps, it was eaſily kept under with one. This was a new ſource of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and comfort; the people could ſcarcely have expreſſed more joy if they had been already in port; and their views were ſo far from being limited to running the ſhip aſhore in ſome harbour, either of an iſland or the main, and building a veſſel out of her materials, to carry us to the Eaſt-Indies, which had ſo lately been he utmoſt object of our hope, that nothing was now thought of but ranging along the ſhore, in ſearch of a convenient place to repair the damage ſhe had ſuſtained, and then proſecuting the voyage upon the ſame plan as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had happened. Upon this occaſion I muſt obſerve, both in juſtice and gratitude to the ſhip's company, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on board, that although in the midſt of our diſtreſs eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſeemed to have a juſt ſenſe of his danger, yet no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate exclamations, or frantic geſtures, were to be heard or ſeen; every one appeared to have the perfect poſſeſſion of his mind, and every one exerted himſelf to the uttermoſt, with a quiet and patient perſeverance, equally diſtant from tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous violence of terror, and the gloomy inactivity of deſpair.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, having light airs at E. S. E. we got up the main top-maſt, and main-yard, and kept edging in for the land, till about ſix o'clock in the evening, when we came to an anchor in ſeventeen fathom water, at the diſtance of ſeven leagues from the ſhore, and one from the ledge of rocks upon which we had ſtruck.</p>
                        <p>This ledge or ſhoal lies in latitude 15:45 S. and between ſix and ſeven leagues from the main. It is not however the only ſhoal on this part of the coaſt, eſpecially to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and at this time we ſaw one to the ſouthward, the tail of which we paſſed over, when we had uneven ſoundings about two hours before we ſtruck. A part of this ſhoal is always above water, and has the appearance of white ſand: a part alſo of that upon which we had lain is dry at low water, and in that place conſiſts of ſand ſtones; but all the reſt of it is a coral rock.</p>
                        <p>While we lay at anchor for the night, we found that the ſhip made about fifteen inches of water an hour, from which no immediate danger was to be apprehended; and at ſix o'clock in the morning, we weighed and ſtood to the N. W. ſtill edging in for the land with a gentle breeze at S. S. E. At nine we paſſed cloſe without two ſmall iſlands that lie in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 15:41 S. and about four leagues from the main: to reach theſe iſlands had, in the height of our diſtreſs, been the object of our hope, or perhaps rather of our wiſhes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I called them HOPE ISLANDS. At noon we were about three leagues from the land, and in latitude 15:37 S.; the northermoſt part of the main in ſight bore N. 30 W.; and

Hope Iſlands extended from S. 30 E. to S. 40 E. In this ſituation we had twelve fathom water, and ſeveral ſand banks without us. At this time the leak had not increaſed; but that we might be prepared for all events, we got the ſail ready for another fothering. In the afternoon having a gentle breeze at S. E. by E. I ſent out the maſter with two boats, as well to ſound ahead of the ſhip, as to look out for a harbour where we might repair our defects, and put the ſhip in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per trim. At three o'clock we ſaw an opening that had the appearance of an harbour, and ſtood off and on while the boats examined it; but they ſoon found that there was not depth of water in it ſufficient for the ſhip. When it was near ſun-ſet, there being many ſhoals about us, we anchored in four fathom, at the diſtance of about two miles from the ſhore, the land ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from N. ½ E. to S. by E. ½ E. The pinnace was ſtill out with one of the mates; but at nine o'clock ſhe returned, and reported, that about two leagues to the leward ſhe had diſcovered juſt ſuch a harbour as we wanted, in which there was a ſufficient riſe of water, and every other convenience that could be deſired, either for laying the ſhip aſhore, or heaving her down.</p>
                        <p>In conſequence of this information, I weighed at ſix o'clock in the morning, and having ſent two boats ahead, to lie upon the ſhoals that we ſaw in our way, we ran down to the place; but notwithſtanding our precaution, we were once in three fathom water. As ſoon as theſe ſhoals were paſſed, I ſent the boats to lie in the channel that led to the harbour, and by this time it began to blow. It was happy for us that a place of refuge was at hand; for we ſoon found that the ſhip would not work, having twice miſſed ſtays: our ſituation, however, though it might have been much worſe, was not without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; we were entangled among ſhoals, and I had great reaſon to fear being driven to leeward, before the boats could place themſelves ſo as to preſcribe our courſe. I therefore anchored in four fathom, about a mile from the ſhore, and then made the ſignal for the boats to come on board. When this was done I went myſelf and buoyed the channel, which I found very narrow; the harbour alſo I found ſmaller than I expected, but moſt excellently adapted to our purpoſe; and it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that in the whole courſe of our voyage we had ſeen no place which, in our preſent circumſtances, could have afforded us the ſame relief. At noon, our latitude was 15:26 S. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the reſt of this day, and the whole night, it blew too freſh for us to venture from our anchor, and run into the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and for our farther ſecurity, we got down the top-gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant yards, unbent the mainſail, and ſome of the ſmall ſails; got down the fore-top-gallant maſt, and the gibb boom, and ſprit-ſail, with a view to lighten the ſhip forwards as much as
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:013324_0382_0F90F2AD0A72DDA0"/>
poſſible, in order to come at her leak, which we ſuppoſed to be ſomewhere in that part; for in all the joy of our unexpected deliverance, we had not forgot that at this time there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a lock of wool between us and deſtruction. The gale continuing, we kept our ſtation all the fifteenth. On the 16th, it was ſomewhat more moderate: and about ſix o'clock in the morning, we h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

It is remarkable that the ſea breeze, which blew freſh when we anchored, continued to do ſo almoſt every day while we ſtayed here; it was calm only while we were upon the rock, except once; and even the vale that afterwards wafted us to the ſhore, would then certainly have beaten us to pieces. In the evening of the preceding day, we had obſerved a fire near the beach over againſt us; and as it would be neceſſary for us to ſtay ſometime in this place, we were not without hope of making an acquaintance with the people. We ſaw more fires upon the hills to-day, and with our glaſſes diſcovered four In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians going along the ſhore, who ſtopped, and made two fires; but for what purpoſe it was impoſſible we ſhould gueſs.</p>
                        <p>The ſcurvy now began to make its appearance among us, with many formidable ſymptoms. Our poor Indian, Tupia, who had ſometime before complained that his gums were ſore and ſwelled, and who had taken plentifully of our lemon juice by the ſurgeon's direction, had now livid ſpots upon his legs, and other indubitable teſtimonies that the diſeaſe had made a rapid progreſs, notwithſtanding all our remedies, among which the bark had been liberally adminiſtered. Mr. Green, our aſtronomer, was alſo declining; and theſe, among other circumſtances, imbittered the delay which prevented our going aſhore.</p>
                        <p>In the morning of the 17th, though the wind was ſtill freſh, we ventured to weigh, and puſh in for the harbour; but in doing this we twice run the ſhip aground: the firſt time ſhe went off without any trouble, but the ſecond time ſhe ſtuck faſt. We now got down the fore yard, fore top-maſts and booms, and taking them overboard, made a raft of them alongſide of the ſhip. The tide was happily riſing, and about one o'clock in the afternoon ſhe floated. We ſoon warped her into the harbour, and having moored her along-ſide of a ſteep beach, to the ſouth, we got the anchors, cables, and all the hawſers on ſhore before night.</p>

As ſoon as the tent for the ſick was got ready for their reception, they were ſent aſhore to the number of eight or nine, and the boat was diſpatched to haul the ſeine, in hopes of procuring ſome fiſh for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment; but ſhe returned without ſucceſs. In the mean time, climbed one of the higheſt hills among thoſe that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked the harbour, which afforded by no means a comfortable proſpect: the low land near the river is wholly over-run with mangroves, among which the ſalt water flows every tide; and the high land appeared to be every where ſtoney and barren. In the mean time Mr. Banks had alſo taken a walk up the country, and met with the frames of ſeveral old Indian houſes, and places where they had dreſſed ſhell-fiſh; but they ſeemed not to have been frequented for ſome months. Tupia, who had employed himſelf in angling, and lived intirely upon what he caught, recovered in a ſurpriſing degree; but Mr. Green ſtill continued to be extremely ill.</p>
                        <p>The next morning I got the four remaining guns out of the hold, and mounted them upon the quarter-deck; I alſo got a ſpare anchor, and anchor ſtock aſhore, and the remaining part of the ſtores and ballaſt that were in the hold: ſet up the ſmith's forge, and employed the armourer and his mate to make nails and other neceſſaries for the repair of the ſhip. In the afternoon, all the officers ſtores and the ground tier of water were got out; ſo that nothing remained in the fore and main hold, but the coals, and a ſmall quantity of ſtone ballaſt. This day Mr. Banks croſſed the river, to take a view of the country on the other ſide: he ſound it conſiſt principally of ſand-hills, where he ſaw ſome Indian houſes, which appeared to have been very lately inhabited.

This evening Mr. Banks obſerved that in many parts of the inlet there were large quantities of pumice ſtones, which lay at a conſiderable diſtance above high water mark; whither they might have been carried either by the freſhes, or extraordinary high tides, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Her draught of water for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was now ſeven feet nine inches, and abaft thirteen feet ſix inches. At eight o'clock, it being high water, I hauled her bow cloſe aſhore; but kept her ſtern afloat, becauſe I was afraid of neiping her; it was however neceſſary to lay the whole of her as near the ground as poſſible.</p>
                        <p>At two o'clock in the morning of the 22d, the tide left her, and gave us an opportunity to examine her leak, which we found to be at her floor heads, a little before the ſtarboard fore-chains, in this place the rocks had made their way through four planks, and even into the timbers; three more planks were much damaged, and the appearance of theſe breaches was very extraordinary: there was not a ſplinter to be ſeen, but all was as ſmooth, as if the whole had been cut away by an inſtrument: the timbers in this place were happily very cloſe, and if they had not, it would have been abſolutely impoſſible to have ſaved the ſhip. But after all, her preſervation depended upon a circumſtance ſtill more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable: in one of the holes, which was big enough to have ſunk us, if we had had eight pumps inſtead of four, and been able to keep them inceſſantly going, was in a great meaſure plugged up by a fragment of the rock, which, after having made the wound <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

By nine o'clock in the morning the carpenters got to work upon her, while the ſmiths were buſy in making bolts and nails. In the mean time, ſome of the people were ſent on the other ſide of the water to ſhoot pigeons for the ſick, who at their return reported that they had ſeen an animal as large as a greyhound, of a ſlender make, a mouſe colour, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſwift; they diſcovered alſo many Indian houſes, and a fine ſtream of freſh water.</p>

This day the carpenter finiſhed the repairs that were neceſſary on the ſtarboard ſide; and at nine o'clock in the evening, we heeled the ſhip the other way, and hauled her off about two feet for fear of neiping. This day almoſt every body had ſeen the animal which the pigeon-ſhooters had brought an account of the day before; and one of the ſeamen, who had been rambling in the woods, told us at his return, that he verily believed he had ſeen the devil: we naturally enquired in what form he had appeared, and his anſwer was in ſo ſingular ſtile, that I ſhall ſet down his own words; <q>He was (ſays John) as large as a one gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon keg, and very like it; he had horns and wings, yet he crept ſo ſlowly through the graſs, that if I had not been <hi>afeard</hi> I might have touched him.</q> This formidable appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition we afterwards diſcovered to have been a batt; and the batts here muſt be acknowledged to have a frightful appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, for they are nearly black, and full as large as a part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge; they have indeed no horns, but the fancy of a man who thought he ſaw the devil might eaſily ſupply that defect.</p>
                        <p>Early on the 24th the carpenters began to repair the ſheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the larboard bow, where we found two planks cut about half through; and in the mean time I ſent a party of men, under the direction of Mr. Gore, in ſearch of refreſhments for the ſick: this party returned about noon with a few palm cabbages, and a bunch or two of wild plantains; the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were the ſmalleſt I had ever ſeen, and the pulp, though

it was well taſted, was full of ſmall ſtones. As I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this morning at a little diſtance from the ſhip, I ſaw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf one of the animals which had been ſo often deſcribed: it was of a light mouſe colour, and in ſize and ſhape very much reſembling a greyhound; it had a long tail alſo, which it carri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

Mr. Banks alſo had an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect view of this animal, and was of opinion that its ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies was hitherto unknown.</p>
                        <p>After the ſhip was hauled aſhore, all the water that came into her of courſe went backwards; ſo that although ſhe was dry forward, ſhe had nine feet water abaft: as in this part therefore her bottom could not be examined on the inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

They found the ſheathing gone about the floor heads abreaſt of the mainmaſt, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

The carpenters however conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to work under her bottom in the evening till they were prevented by the tide; the morning tide did not ebb out far enough to permit them to work at all, for we had only one tolerable high and low tide in four and twenty hours, as indeed we had experienced when we lay upon the rock. The poſition of the ſhip, which threw the water in her abaft, was very near depriving the world of all the knowledge which Mr. Banks had endured ſo much labour, and ſo many riſks, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; for he had removed the curious collection of plants, which he made during the whole voyage, into the bread room, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Moſt of them however were, by indefatigable care and attention, reſtored to a ſtate of preſervation, but ſome were entirely ſpoilt and deſtroyed.</p>
                        <p>The 25th was employed in filling water, and over-hauling the rigging, and at low water the carpenters finiſhed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs

under the larboard bow, and every other place which the tide would them permit to come at; ſome caſks were then laſhed under her bows to facilitate her floating, and at night, when it was high water, we endeavoured to heave her off, but without ſucceſs, for ſome of the caſks that were laſhed to her gave way.</p>
                        <p>The morning of the 26th was employed in getting more caſks ready for the ſame purpoſe, and in the afternoon we laſhed no leſs than eight and thirty under the ſhip's bottom, but to our great mortification theſe alſo proved ineffectual, and we found ourſelves reduced to the neceſſity of waiting till the next ſpring-tide.</p>
                        <p>This day ſome of our gentlemen who had made an excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the woods, brought home the leaves of a plant, which was thought to be the ſame that in the Weſt-Indies is called coccos, but upon trial, the roots roved too acrid to be eaten; the leaves however were little inferior to ſpinnage. In the place where theſe plants were gathered, grew plenty of the cabbage trees, which have occaſionally been mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a kind of wild plantain, the fruit of which was ſo full of ſtones as ſcarcely to be eatable; another fruit was alſo found about the ſize of a ſmall golden pippin, but flatter, and of a deep purple colour: when firſt gathered from the tree it was very hard and diſagreeable, but after being kept a few days became ſoft, and taſted very much like an indifferent da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcene.</p>
                        <p>The next morning we began to move ſome of the weight from the after-part of the ſhip forward, to eaſe her; in the mean time the armourer continued to work at the forge, the carpenter was buſy in caulking the ſhip, and the men employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in filling water and over-hauling the rigging: in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, I went myſelf in the pinnace up the harbour, and made ſeveral hauls with the ſeine, but caught only between twenty and thirty fiſh, which were given to the ſick and convaleſcent.</p>
                        <p>On the 28th Mr. Banks went with ſome of the ſeamen up the country, to ſhew them the plant which in the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies is called Indian kale, and which ſerved us for greens. Tupia had much meliorated the root of the coccos, by giving them a long dreſſing in his country oven, but they were ſo ſmall that we did not think them an object for the ſhip. In their walk they found one tree which had been notched for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of climbing it, in the ſame manner with thoſe we had ſeen in Botany Bay: they ſaw alſo many neſts of white ants, which reſemble thoſe of the Eaſt-Indies, the moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious inſects in the world. The neſts were of a pyramidical figure, from a few inches to ſix feet high, and very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the ſtones in England, which are ſaid to be monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Druids. Mr. Gore, who was alſo this day four
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:013324_0388_0F90F2159D850990"/>
or five miles up the country, reported that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>At two o'clock in the morning of the 29th, I obſerved, in conjunction with Mr. Green, an emerſion of Jupiter's firſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellite; the time here was 2<hi rend="sup">h</hi> 18<hi rend="sup">m</hi> 53<hi rend="sup">•</hi>, which gave the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of this place 214<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 42<hi rend="sup">m</hi> 30<hi rend="sup">8</hi> W.: its latitude is 15:26 S. At break of day, I ſent the boat out again with the ſeine, and in the afternoon, it returned with as much fiſh as enabled me to give every man a pound and an half. One of my mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipmen, an American, who was this day abroad with his gun, reported that he had ſeen a wolf, exactly like thoſe which he had been uſed to ſee in his own country, and that he had ſhot at it, but did not kill it.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, encouraged by the ſucceſs of the day before, I ſent the boat again to haul the ſeine, and another party to gather greens: I ſent alſo ſome of the young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to take a plan of the harbour, and went myſelf upon a hill, which lies over the ſouth point, to take a view of the ſea. At this time it was low water, and I ſaw, with great concern innumerable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

The innermoſt lay about three or four miles from the ſhore, the outermoſt extended as far as I could ſee with my glaſs, and many of them did but juſt riſe above water There was ſome appearance of a paſſage to the northward, and I had no hope of getting clear but in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for as the wind blows conſtantly from the S. E. it would have been difficult if not impoſſible, to return back to the ſouthward.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gore reported, that he had this day ſeen two animals like dogs, of a ſtraw colour, that they ran like a hare, and were about the ſame ſize. In the afternoon the people returned from hauling the ſeine, with ſtill better ſucceſs than before, for I wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The next day, July the 1ſt, being Sunday, every body had liberty to go aſhore, except one from each meſs, who were again ſent out with the ſeine. The ſeine was again equally ſucceſsful, and the people who went up the country gave an account of having ſeen ſeveral animals, though none of them were to be caught. They ſaw a ſire alſo about a mile up the river, and Mr. Gore, the Second Lieutenant, picked up the huſk of a cocoa nut, which had been caſt upon the beach, and was full of barnacles: this probably might come from ſome
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:013324_0389_0F905010EC07B698"/>
iſland to windward, perhaps from the Terra del Eſpirito San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of Quiros, as we were now in the latitude where it is ſaid to lie. This day the thermometer in the ſhade roſe to 87, which was higher than it had been on any day ſince we came upon this coaſt.</p>
                        <p>Early the next morning, I ſent the maſter in the pinnace, out of the harbour, to ſound about the ſhoals in the offing, and look for a channel to the northward: at this time we had a breeze from the land, which continued till about 9 o'clock, and was the firſt we had had ſince our coming into the river. At low water we laſhed ſome empty caſks under the ſhip's bows, having ſome hopes that as the tides were riſing ſhe would float the next high water. We ſtill continued to fiſh with great ſucceſs, and at high water we again attempted to heave the ſhip off, but our utmoſt efforts were ſtill ineffectual.</p>
                        <p>The next day at noon, the maſter returned, and reported, that he had found a paſſage out to ſea between the ſhoals, and deſcribed its ſituation. The ſhoals, he ſaid, conſiſted of coral rocks, many of which were dry at low water, and upon one of which he had been aſhore. He found here ſome cockles of ſo enormous a ſize that one of them was more than two men could eat, and a great variety of other ſhell fiſh, of which he brought us a plentiful ſupply: in the evening, he had alſo landed in a bay about three leagues to the northward of our ſtation, where he diſturbed ſome of the natives who were at ſupper: they all fled with the greateſt precipitation at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, leaving ſome freſh ſea eggs, and a fire ready kindled behind them, but there was neither houſe nor hovel near the place. We obſerved, that although the ſhoals that lie juſt within ſight of the coaſt, abound with ſhell-fiſh, which may be eaſily caught at low water; yet we ſaw no ſuch ſhells about the fire-places on ſhore. This day an allegator was ſeen to ſwim about the ſhip for ſome time, and at high water we made an other effort to float her, which happily ſucceeded: we found however that by lying ſo long with her head a-ground, and her ſtern a-float, ſhe had ſprung a plank between decks, a-breaſt of the main chains, ſo that it was become neceſſary to lay her aſhore again.</p>
                        <p>The next morning was employed in trimming her upon an even keel, and in the afternoon, having warped her over, and waited for high water, we laid her aſhore on the ſand bank, on the ſouth ſide of the river, for the damage ſhe had received already from the great deſcent of the ground, made me afraid to lay her broad-ſide to the ſhore in the ſame place, from which we had juſt floated her. I was now very deſirous to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other trial to come at her bottom, where the ſheathing had been rubbed off, but though ſhe had ſcarcely four feet water under her, when the tide was out, yet that part was not dry.</p>

On the 5th, I got one of the carpenter's crew, a man in whom I could confide, to go down again to the ſhip's bottom, and examine the place. He reported, that three ſtreaks of the ſheathing, about eight feet long, were wanting, and that the main plank had been a little rubbed; this account per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agreed with the report of the maſter, and others, who had been under her bottom before: I had the comfort how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to find the carpenter of opinion that this would be of little conſequence, and therefore, the other damage being repaired, ſhe was again floated at high water, and moored along ſide the beach, where the ſtores had been depoſited; we then went to work to take the ſtores on board, and put her in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſea. This day, Mr. Banks croſſed to the other ſide of the harbour, where, as he walked along a ſandy beach, he found innumerable fruits, and many of them ſuch as no plants which he had diſcovered in this country produced: among others were ſome cocoa nuts, which Tupia ſaid had been open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a kind of crab, which from his deſcription we judged to be the ſame that the Dutch call <hi>Beurs Krabbe,</hi> and which we had not ſeen in theſe ſeas. All the vegetable ſubſtances which he found in this place, were encruſted with marine productions, and covered with barnacles; a ſure ſign that they muſt have come far by ſea, and, as the trade-wind blows right upon the ſhore, probably from Terra del Eſpirito Santo, which has been mentioned already.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, Mr. Banks, with Lieutenant Gore, and three men ſet out in a ſmall boat up the river, with a view to ſpend two or three days in an excurſion, to examine the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and kill ſome of the animals which had been ſo often ſeen at a diſtance.</p>
                        <p>On the 7th, I ſent the maſter again out to ſound about the ſhoals, the account which he had brought me of a channel being by no means ſatisfactory; and we ſpent the remainder of this day, and the morning of the next, in fiſhing, and other neceſſary occupations.</p>
                        <p>About four o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Banks and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty returned, and gave us an account of their expedition. Having proceeded about three leagues among the ſwamps and mangroves, they went up into the country, which they found to differ but little from what they had ſeen before: they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued their courſe therefore up the river, which at length was contracted into a narrow channel, and was bounded, not by ſwamps and mangroves, but by ſteep banks, that were covered with trees of a moſt beautiful verdure, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which was that which in the Weſt Indies is called <hi>Mohoe,</hi> or the bark tree, the <hi>hibiſcus tiliaceus;</hi> the land with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was in general low, and had a thick covering of long graſs: the ſoil ſeemed to be ſuch as promiſed great fertility, to any who ſhould plant and improve it. In the courſe of

the day, Tupia ſaw an animal, which, by his deſcription, Mr. Banks judged to be a wolf: they alſo ſaw three other animals, but could neither catch nor kill one of them, and a k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

At night, they took up their lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe to the banks of the river, and made a fire, but the muſquitos ſwarmed about them in ſuch numbers, that their quarters were almoſt untenable; they followed them into the ſmoke, and almoſt into the fire, which, hot as the climate was, they could better e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The fire, the flies, and the want of a better bed than the ground, rendered the night extremely uncomfortable, ſo that they paſſed it not in ſleep, but in reſtleſs wiſhes for the return of day. With the firſt dawn they ſet out in ſearch of game, and in a walk of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miles, they ſaw four animals of the ſame kind, two of which Mr. Banks's greyhound fairly chaſed, but they threw him out at a great diſtance, by leaping over the long thick graſs, which prevented his running: this animal was obſerved not to run upon four legs, but to bound or hop forward upon two, like the <hi>Jerbua,</hi> or <hi>Mus Jaculus.</hi> About noon, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the boat, and again proceeded up the river, which was ſoon contracted into a freſh water brook, where, however, the tide roſe to a conſiderable height: as evening approached, it became low water, and it was then ſo ſhallow that they were obliged to get out of the boat and drag her along, till they could find a place in which they might, with ſome hope of reſt, paſs the night. Such a place at length offered, and while they were getting the things out of the boat, they obſerved a ſmoke at the diſtance of about a furlong: as they did not doubt but that ſome of the natives, with whom they had ſo long and earneſtly deſired to become perſonally acquainted, were about the fire, three of the party went immediately towards it, hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſo ſmall a number would not put them to flight: when they came up to the place, however, they found it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and therefore they conjectured that before they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Indians, the Indians had diſcovered them. They found the fire ſtill burning, in the hollow of an old tree that was become touch-wood, and ſeveral branches of trees newly broken down, with which children appeared to have been playing: they obſerved alſo many foot-ſteps upon the ſand, below high water mark, which were certain indications that the Indians had been recently upon the ſpot. Several houſes were found at a little d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

their diſappointment, they repaired to their quarters, which was a broad ſand bank, under the ſhelter of a buſh. Their beds were plantain leaves, which they ſpread upon the ſand, and which were as ſoft as a mattreſs; their cloaks ſerved them for bed-clothes, and ſome bunches of graſs for pillows: with theſe accommodations they hoped to paſs a better night than the laſt, eſpecially as, to their great comfort, not a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quito was to be ſeen. Here then they lay down, and, ſuch is the force of habit, they reſigned themſelves to ſleep, without once reflecting upon the probability and danger of being found by the Indians in that ſituation. If this appears ſtrange, let us for a moment reflect, that every danger, and every cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, after a time becomes familiar, and loſes its effect upon the mind. If it were poſſible that a man ſhould firſt be made acquainted with his mortality, or even with the inevitable debility and infirmities of old age, when his underſtanding had arrived at its full ſtrength, and life was endeared by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of youth, and vigour, and health, with what an ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of terror and diſtreſs would the intelligence be received! yet, being gradually acquainted with theſe mournful truths, by inſenſible degrees, we ſcarce know when they loſe all their force, and we think no more of the approach of old age and death, than theſe wanderers of an unknown deſart did of a leſs obvious and certain evil, the approach of the native ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, at a time when they muſt have fallen an eaſy prey to their malice or their fears. And it is remarkable that the greater part of thoſe who have been condemned to ſuffer a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death, have ſlept the night immediately preceeding their execution, though there is perhaps no inſtance of a perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of a capital crime having ſlept the firſt night of his confinement. Thus is the evil of life in ſome degree a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for itſelf, and though every man at twenty deprecates four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore, almoſt every man is as tenacious of life at fourſcore as at twenty; and if he does not ſuffer under any painful diſorder, loſes as little of the comforts that remain by reflecting that he is upon the brink of the grave, where the earth already crumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les under his feet, as he did of the pleaſures of his better days, when his diſſolution, though certain, was ſuppoſed to be at a diſtance.</p>
                        <p>Our travellers having ſlept, without once awaking, till the morning, examined the river, and finding the tide favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their return, and the country promiſed nothing worthy of a farther ſearch, they reimbarked in their boat, and made the beſt of their way to the ſhip.</p>
                        <p>Soon after the arrival of this party, the maſter alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, having been ſeven leagues out to ſea, and he was now of opinion, that there was no getting out where before he thought there had been a paſſage; his expedition however was
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:013324_0393_0F90F2220BC100B0"/>
by no means without its advantage, for having been a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time upon the rock where he had ſeen the large cockles, he met with a great number of turtle, three of which he caught, that together weighed ſeven hundred and ninety-one pounds, though he had no better inſtrument than a boat-hook.</p>
                        <p>The next morning therefore, I ſent him out again, with proper inſtruments for taking them, and Mr. Banks went with him, but the ſucceſs did not at all anſwer our expectations, for, by the unaccountable conduct of the officer, not a ſingle turtle was taken, nor could he be perſuaded to return: Mr. Banks, however, went aſhore upon the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ef, where he ſaw ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the large cockles, and having collected many ſhells, and marine productions, he returned at eleven o'clock at night, in his own ſmall boat, the maſter ſtill continuing with the large one upon the rock. In the afternoon, ſeven or eight of the natives had appeared on the ſouth ſide of the river, and two of them came down to the ſandy point, oppoſite to the ſhip; but upon ſeeing me put off in a boat, to ſpeak with them, they all ran away with the greateſt precipitation.</p>
                        <p>As the the maſter continued abſent with the boat all night, I was forced to ſend the ſecond lieutenant for him, early the next morning in the yawl; and ſoon after four of the natives appeared upon the ſandy point, on the north ſide of the river, having with them a ſmall wooden canoe, with out-riggers: they ſeemed for ſome time to be buſily employed in ſtriking fiſh: ſome of our people were for going over to them in a boat, but this I would by no means permit, repeated experience having convinced me that it was more likely to prevent, than procure an interview. I was determined to try what could be done by a contrary method, and accordingly let them alone, without appearing to take the leaſt notice of them: this ſucceeded ſo well, that at length two of them came in the canoe within a muſket ſhot of the ſhip, and there talked a great deal in a very loud tone: we underſtood nothing that they ſaid, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could anſwer their harangue only by ſhouting, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the ſigns of invitation and kindneſs that we could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe. During this conference, they came, inſenſibly, nearer and nearer, holding up their lances, not in a threatning man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but as if to intimate that if we offered them any injury, they had weapons to revenge it. When they were almoſt along-ſide of us, we threw them ſome cloth, nails, beads, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſome other trifles, which they received without the leaſt appearance of ſatisfaction: at laſt, one of the people hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to throw them a ſmall fiſh; at this they expreſſed the greateſt joy imaginable, and intimating, by ſigns, that they would fetch their companions, immediately paddled away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſhore. In the mean time ſome of our people, and among them Tupia, landed on the oppoſite ſide of the river:
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:013324_0394_0F90F223871B65A0"/>
the canoe, with all the four Indians, very ſoon returned to the ſhip, and came quite along-ſide, without expreſſing any fear or diſtruſt. We diſtributed ſome more preſents among them, and ſoon after they left us, and landed on the ſame ſide of the river where our people had gone aſhore: every man carried in his hand two lances, and a ſtick, which is uſed in throwing them, and advanced to the place where Tupia and the reſt of our people were ſitting; Tupia ſoon prevailed upon them to lay down their arms, and come forward without them: he then made ſigns that they ſhould ſit down by him, with which they complied, and ſeemed to be under no apprehenſion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint: ſeveral more of us then going aſhore, they expreſſed ſome jealouſy leſt we ſhould get between them and their arms; we took care however to ſhew them that we had no ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and having joined them, we made them ſome more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, as a farther teſtimony of our good-will, and our deſire to obtain theirs. We continued together, with the utmoſt cordiality, till dinner time, and then giving them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that we were going to eat, we invited them, by ſigns, to go with us: this however they declined, and as ſoon as we leſt them, they went away in their canoe. One of theſe men was ſomewhat above the middle age, the other three were young; they were in general of the common ſtature, but their limbs were remarkably ſmall; their ſkin was of the colour of wood ſoot, or what would be called a dark chocolate colour; their hair was black, but not woolly; it was ſhort cropped, in ſome lank, and in others curled. Dampier ſays, that the people whom he ſaw on the weſtern coaſt of this country, wanted two of their fore-teeth, but theſe had no ſuch defect: ſome part of their bodies had been painted red, and the upper lip and breaſt of one of them was painted with ſtreaks of white; which he called <hi>Carbanda;</hi> their features were far from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable, their eyes were lively, and their teeth even and white, their voices were ſoft and tuneable, and they repeated many words after us with great facility. In the night, Mr. Gore and the maſter returned with the long-boat, and brought one turtle and a few ſhell-fiſh. The yawl had been left upon the ſhoal with fix men, to make a farther trial for turtle.</p>
                        <p>The next morning we had another viſit from four of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; three of them had been with us before, but the fourth was a ſtranger, whoſe name, as we learnt from his companions, who introduced him, was YAPARICO. This gentleman was diſtinguiſhed by an ornament of a very ſtriking appearance; it was the bone of a bird, nearly as thick as a man's finger, and five or ſix inches long, which he had thruſt into a hole, made in the griſtle that divides the noſtrils; of this we had ſeen one inſtance, and only one, in New Zealand; but upon examination, we found that among all theſe people this part
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:013324_0395_0F90F223B808CD88"/>
of the noſe was perforated, to receive an ornament of the ſame kind: they had alſo holes in their ears, though nothing was then hanging to them, and had bracelets upon the upper part of their arms, made of plaited hair, ſo that, like the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Terra del Fuego, they ſeem to be fond of ornament, though they are abſolutely without apparel; and one of them, to whom I had given part of an old ſhirt, inſtead of throwing it over any part of his body, tied it as a fillet round his head. They brought with them a fiſh, which they gave us, as we ſuppoſed, in return for the fiſh we had given them the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. They ſeemed to be much pleaſed, and in no haſte to leave us, but ſeeing ſome of our gentlemen examine their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe with great curioſity and attention, they were alarmed, and jumping immediately into it, paddled away without ſpeaking a word.</p>
                        <p>About two the next morning, the yawl, which had been left upon the ſhoal, returned with three turtles and a large ſkeat. As it ſeemed now probable that this fiſhery might be proſecuted with advantage, I ſent her out again, after break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, for a further ſupply. Soon after, three Indians ventured down to Tupia's tent, and were ſo well pleaſed with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that one of them went with the canoe to fetch two others whom we had never ſeen: when he returned he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the ſtrangers by name, a ceremony which, upon ſuch occaſions, was never omitted. As they had received the fiſh that was thrown into their canoe, when they firſt approached the ſhip, with ſo much pleaſure, ſome fiſh was offered to them now, and we were greatly ſurprized to ſee that it was received with the greateſt indifference: they made ſigns, however, to ſome of the people, that they ſhould dreſs it for them, which was immediately done, but after eating a little of it, they threw the reſt to Mr. Banks's dog. They ſtaid with us all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, but would never venture above twenty yards from their canoe. We now perceived that the colour of their ſkin was not ſo dark as it appeared, what we had taken for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, being the effects of dirt and ſmoke, in which, we imagined, they contrived to ſleep, notwithſtanding the heat of the climate, as the only means in their power to keep off the muſquitos. Among other things that we had given them when we firſt ſaw them, were ſome medals, which he had hung round their necks by a riband; and theſe ribands were ſo changed by ſmoke, that we could not eaſily diſtinguiſh of what colour they had been: this incident led us more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to examine the colour of their ſkin. While theſe people were with us, we ſaw two others on the point of land that lay on the oppoſite ſide of the river, at the diſtance of about two hundred yards, and by our glaſſes diſcovered them to be a woman and a boy; the woman, like the reſt, being ſtark
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:013324_0396_0F90F225324260F8"/>
naked. We obſerved, that all of them were remarkably clean limbed, and exceedingly active and nimble. One of theſe ſtrangers had a necklace of ſhells, very prettily made, and a bracelet upon his arm, formed of ſeveral ſtrings, ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble what in England is called gymp: both of them had a piece of bark tied over the forehead, and were disfigured by the bone in the noſe. We thought their language more harſh than that of the iſlanders in the South Sea, and they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually repeating the word <hi>chercau,</hi> which we imagined to be a term expreſſing admiration, by the manner in which it was uttered: they alſo cried out, when they ſaw any thing new, <hi>cher, tut, tut, tut, tut!</hi> which probably had a ſimilar ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Their canoe was not above ten feet long, and very narrow, but it was fitted with an outrigger, much like thoſe of the iſlands, tho' in every reſpect very much inferior: when it was in ſhallow water, they ſet it on with poles, and when in deep, they worked it with paddles about four feet long: it contained juſt four people, ſo that the people who viſited us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day went away at two turns. Their lances were like thoſe that we had ſeen in Botany Bay, except that they had but a ſingle point, which in ſome of them was the ſting of the ray, and barbed with two or three ſharp bones of the ſame fiſh: it was indeed a moſt terrible weapon, and the inſtrument which they uſed in throwing it, ſeemed to be formed with more art than any we had ſeen before. About twelve o'clock next day, the yawl returned, with another turtle: and a large ſting-ray, and in the evening was ſent out again.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, two of the Indians came on board, but after a ſhort ſtay, went along the ſhore, and applied themſelves with great diligence to the ſtriking of fiſh. Mr. Gore, who went out this day with his gun, had the good fortune to kill one of the animals which had been ſo much the ſubject of our ſpeculation: In form, it is moſt like the gerbua, which it alſo reſembles in its motion, as has been obſerved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, but it greatly differs in ſize, the gerbua not being lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than a common rat, and this animal, when full grown, being as big as a ſheep: this individual was a young one, much under its full growth, weighing only thirty-eight pounds. The head, neck, and ſhoulders, are very ſmall in proportion to the other parts of the body; the tail is nearly as long as the body, thick near the rump, and tapering towards the end: the fore-legs of this individual were only eight inches long, and the hind-legs two and twenty: its progreſs is by ſucceſſive leaps or hops, of a great length, in an erect poſture; the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legs are kept bent cloſe to the breaſt, and ſeemed to be of uſe only for digging: the ſkin is covered with a ſhort fur, of a dark mouſe or grey colour, excepting the head and ears, which
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:013324_0397_0F90F2255AB17B18"/>
bear a ſlight reſemblance to thoſe of a hare. This animal is called by the natives <hi>Kanguroo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The next day, our Kanguroo was dreſſed for dinner, and proved moſt excellent meat; we might now indeed be ſaid to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>re ſumptuouſly every day, for we had turtle in great plenty, and we all agreed that they were much better than any we had taſted in England, which we imputed to their being eaten freſh from the ſea, before their natural fat had been waſted, or their juices changed by a diet and ſituation ſo different from what the ſea affords them, as garbage and a tub. Moſt of thoſe that we caught here, were of the kind called green turtle, and weighed from two to three hundred weight, and when theſe were killed, they were always found to be full of turtle graſs, which our naturaliſts took to be a kind of <hi>conferva:</hi> two of them were loggerheads, the fleſh of which was much leſs delicious, and in their ſtomachs nothing was to be found but ſhells.</p>
                        <p>In the morning of the 16th, while the people were employed as uſual in getting the ſhip ready for the ſea, I climbed one of the hills on the north ſide of the river, from which I had an extenſive view of the inland country, and found it agreeably diverſified by hills, vallies, and large plains, which in many places were richly covered with wood. This evening we obſerved an emerſion of Jupiter's firſt ſatellite, which gave 214° 53′ 45″ of longitude. The obſervation which was made on the 29th of June gave 214° 42′ 30′; the mean is 214° 48′ 7½″, the longitude of this place weſt of Greenwich.</p>
                        <p>On the 17th, I ſent the Maſter and one of the mates in the pinnace, to look for a channel to the northward; and I went myſelf with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander into the woods, on the other ſide of the water. Tupia, who had been thither by himſelf, reported, that he had ſeen three Indians who had given him ſome roots, about as thick as a man's finger, in ſhape not much unlike a rhadiſh, and of a very agreeable taſte. This induced us to go over, hoping that we ſhould be able to improve our acquaintance with the natives: in a very little time we diſcovered four of them in a canoe, who, as ſoon as they ſaw us, came aſhore, and, though they were all ſtrangers, walked up to us, without any ſigns of ſuſpicion or fear. Two of theſe had necklaces of ſhells, which we could not perſuade them to part with for any thing we could give them: we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them however with ſome beads, and after a ſhort ſtay they departed. We attempted to follow them, hoping that they would conduct us to ſome place where we ſhould find more of them, and have an opportunity of ſeeing their woman; but they made us underſtand, by ſigns, that they did not deſire our company. At eight o'clock next morning, we were viſited by ſeveral of the natives, who were now become quite familiar.
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:013324_0398_0F8FFB68491FC508"/>
One of them, at our deſire, threw his lance, which was about eight feet long: it flew with a ſwiftneſs and ſteadineſs that ſurpriſed us, and though it was never more than four feet from the ground, it entered deeply into a tree at fifty paces diſtance. After this they ventnred on board, where I left them, to all appearance much entertained, and went again with Mr. Banks to take a view of the country; but chiefly to indulge an anxious curioſity, by looking round us upon the ſea, of which our wiſhes almoſt perſuaded us we had formed an idea more diſadvantageous than the truth. After having walked about ſeven or eight miles along the ſhore to the northward, we aſcended a very high hill, and were ſoon convinced that the danger of our ſituation was at leaſt equal to our apprehenſions; for in whatever direction we turned our eyes, we ſaw rocks and ſhoals without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and no paſſage out to ſea, but through the winding channels between them, which could not be navigated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the laſt degree of difficulty and danger. We returned therefore to the ſhip, not in better ſpirits than when we left it; we found ſeveral natives ſtill on board, and we were told that the turtles, of which we had then no leſs than twelve upon the deck, had fixed their attention more than any thing elſe in the ſhip.</p>
                        <p>On the 19th in the morning, we were viſited by ten of the natives, the greater part from the other ſide of the river, where we ſaw ſix or ſeven more, moſt of them women, and like all the reſt of the people we had ſeen in this country, they were ſtark naked. Our gueſts brought with them a greater number of lances than they had ever done before, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid them up in a tree, they ſet a man and a boy to watch them: the reſt then came on board, and we ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that they had determined to get one of our turtle, which was probably as great a dainty to them as to us.

which being equally diſappointed, they ſuddenly leaped into their canoe in a rage, and began to paddle towards the ſhore. At the ſame time, I went into the boat with Mr. Banks, and five or ſix of the ſhip's crew, and we got aſhore before them, where many more of our people were already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in various employments; as ſoon as they landed, they ſeized their arms, and, before we were aware of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, they ſnatched a brand from under a pitch kettle which was boiling, and maki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Banks leaped into a boat, and fetched ſome people from on board, juſt time enough to ſave his tent, by hauling it down upon the beach; but the ſmith's forge, at leaſt ſuch part of it as would burn, was conſumed. While this was doing, the Indians went to a place at ſome diſtance, where ſeveral of our people were waſhing, and where our nets, among which was the ſeine, and a great quantity of linen, were laid out to dry; here they again ſet fire to the graſs, entirely diſregarding both threats and entreaties. We were therefore obliged to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a muſquet, loaded with ſmall ſhot, at one of them, which drew blood at the diſtance of about forty yards, and this putting them to flight, we extinguiſhed the fire at this place before it had made much progreſs; but where the graſs had been firſt kindled, it ſpread into the woods to a great diſtance. As the Indians were ſtill in ſight, I fired a muſquet, charged with ball, abreaſt of them among the mangroves, to convince them that they were not yet out of our reach: upon hearing the ball they quickened their pace, and we ſoon loſt ſight of them. We thought they would now give us no more trouble; but ſoon after we heard their voices in the woods, and perceived they came nearer and nearer. I ſet out, therefore, with Mr. Banks and 3 or 4 more, to meet them: when our parties came in ſight of each other, they halted; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one old man who came forward to meet us: at length he ſtopped, and having uttered ſome words, which we were very ſorry we could not underſtand, he went back to his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and the whole body ſlowly retreated. We found means however to ſeize ſome of their darts, and continued to follow them about a mile: we then ſat down upon ſome rock, from which we could obſerve their motions, and they alſo ſat down at about an hundred yards diſtance. After a ſhort time, the old man again advanced towards us, carrying in his hand a
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:013324_0400_0F90F226B8771FB8"/>
lance without a point: he ſtopped ſeveral times, at different diſtances, and ſpoke; we anſwered by beckoning and making ſuch ſigns of amity as we could deviſe; upon which the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of peace, as we ſuppoſed him to be, turned and ſpoke aloud to his companions, who then ſet up their lances againſt a tree, and advanced to us in a friendly manner: when they came up, we returned the darts or lances that we had taken from them, and we perceived with great ſatisfaction that this rendered the reconciliation complete. We found in this party four perſons whom we had never ſeen before, who as uſual were introduced to us by name; but the man who had been wounded in the attempt to burn our nets and linen, was not among them; we knew however that he could not be danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly hurt, by the diſtance at which the ſhot reached him. We made all of them preſents of ſuch trinkets as we had about us, and they walked back with us towards the ſhip: as we went along, they told us, by ſigns, that they would not ſet fire to the graſs any more; and we diſtributed among them ſome muſquet balls, and endeavoured to make them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their uſe and effect. When they came abreaſt of the ſhip, they ſat down, but could not be prevailed upon to come on board; we therefore left them, and in about two hours they went away, ſoon after which we perceived the woods on fire at about two miles diſtance. If this accident had happened a very little while ſooner, the conſequence might have been dreadful; for our powder had been aboard but a few days, and the ſtore tent, with many valuable things, which it contained, had not been removed many hours. We had no idea of the fury with which graſs would burn in this hot climate, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of the difficulty of extinguiſhing it; but we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that if it ſhould ever again be neceſſary for us to pitch our tents in ſuch a ſituation, our firſt meaſure ſhould be to clear the ground round us.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon we got every thing on board the ſhip, new birthed her, and let her ſwing with the tide; and at night the maſter returned, with the diſcouraging account that there was no paſſage for the ſhip to the northward.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, at low water, I went and ſounded, and bouyed the bar, the ſhip being now ready for the ſea. We ſaw no Indians this day, but all the hills round us for many miles were on fire, which at night made a moſt ſtriking and beautiful appearance.</p>
                        <p>The 21ſt paſſed without our getting ſight of any of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and indeed without a ſingle incident worth notice. On the 22d, we killed a turtle for the day's proviſion, upon opening which we found a wooden harpoon, or turtle peg, about as thick as as man's finger, near fifteen inches long, and bearded at the end, ſuch as we had ſeen among the natives,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:013324_0401_0F90F22778B46B20"/>
ſticking through both ſhoulders: it appeared to have been ſtruck a conſiderable time, for the wound had perfectly healed up over the weapon.</p>
                        <p>Early in the morning of the 23d, I ſent ſome people into the country, to gather a ſupply of the greens which have been before mentioned by the name of Indian Kale; and one of them having ſtraggled from the reſt, ſuddenly fell in with four Indians, three men and a boy, whom he did not ſee till, by turning ſhort in the wood, he found himſelf among them. They had kindled a fire, and were broiling a bird of ſome kind, and part of a Kanguroo, the remainder of which, and a cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too, hung at a little diſtance upon a tree: the man, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, was at firſt greatly terrified; but he had the preſence of mind not to run away, judging very rightly, that he was moſt likely to incur danger by appearing to apprehend it; on the contrary, he went and ſat down by them, and, with an air of chearfulneſs and good humour, offered them his knife, the only thing he had about him which he thought would be acceptable to them; they received it, and having handed it from one to the other, they gave it him again: he then made an offer to leave them; but this they ſeemed not diſpoſed to permit: ſtill however he diſſembled his fears, and ſat down again; they conſidered him with great attention and curioſity, particularly his clothes, and then felt his hands and face, and ſatisfied themſelves that his body was of the ſame texture with their own. They treated him with the greateſt civility, and having kept him about half an hour, they made ſigns that he might depart: he did not wait for a ſecond diſmiſſion, but when he left them, not taking the direct way to the ſhip, they came from their fire and directed him; ſo that they well knew whence he came.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, Mr. Banks, having made an excurſion on the other ſide of the river, to gather plants, found the greateſt part of the cloth that had been given to the Indians, lying in a heap together, probably as uſeleſs lumber, not worth carrying away; and perhaps, if he had ſought further, he might have found the other trinkets; for they ſeemed to ſet very little value upon any thing we had, except our turtle, which was a commodity that we were leaſt able to ſpare.</p>
                        <p>The blowing weather, which prevented our attempt to get out to ſea, ſtill continuing, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went again out on the 24th to ſee whether any new plant could be picked up: they traverſed the woods all day without ſucceſs; but as they were returning through a deep valley, the ſides of which, though almoſt as perpendicular as a wall, were covered with trees and buſhes; they found lying upon the ground ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral marking nuts, the <hi>Anacardium orientale;</hi> theſe put them upon a new ſcent, and they made a moſt diligent ſearch after
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:013324_0402_0F90F228571D6778"/>
the tree that bore them, which perhaps no European botaniſt ever ſaw; but to their great mortification they could not find it: ſo that, after ſpending much time, and cutting down four or five trees, they returned quite exhauſted with fatigue to the ſhip.</p>
                        <p>On the 25th, having made an excurſion up the river, I found a canoe belonging to our friends the Indians, whom we had not ſeen ſince the affair of the turtle; they had left it tied to ſome mangroves, about a mile diſtant from the ſhip, and I could ſee by their fires that they were retired at leaſt ſix miles directly inland.</p>
                        <p>As Mr. Banks was again gleaning the country for his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hiſtory on the 26th, he had the good fortune to take an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal of the <hi>Opoſſum</hi> tribe: it was a female, and with it he took two young ones: it was found much to reſemble the remarkable animal of the kind, which Mons. de Buffon has deſcribed in his natural hiſtory by the name of <hi>Phalanger,</hi> but it was not the ſame. Mons. Buffon ſuppoſes this tribe to be peculiar to America, but in this he is certainly miſtaken; and probably, as Pallas has obſerved in his Zoology, the Phalanger itſelf is a native of the Eaſt Indies, as the animal which was caught by Mr. Banks reſembled in the extraordinary conformation of the feet, in which it differs from animals of every other tribe.</p>
                        <p>On the 27th, Mr. Gore ſhot a Kanguroo, which, with the ſkin, entrails, and head, weighed eighty-four pounds. Upon examination, however, we found that this animal was not at its full growth, the innermoſt grinders not being yet formed. We dreſſed it for dinner the next day; but to our great diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, we found it had a much worſe flavour than that we had eaten before.</p>
                        <p>The wind continued in the ſame quarter, and with the ſame violence, till five o'clock in the morning of the 29th. when it fell calm; ſoon after a light breeze ſprung up from the land, and it being about two hours ebb, I ſent a boat to ſee what wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was upon the bar; in the mean time we got the anchor up, and made all ready to put to ſea. But when the boat came back, the officer reported that there was only thirteen feet water upon the bar, which was ſix inches leſs than the ſhip drew. We were therefore obliged to come to, and the ſea breeze ſetting in again about eight o'clock, we gave up all hope of ſailing that day.</p>
                        <p>We had freſh gales at S. E. with hazy weather and rain, till two in the morning of the 31ſt, when the weather being ſomething more moderate, I had thoughts of trying to warp the ſhip out of the harbour; but upon going out myſelf firſt in the boat, I found it ſtill blow too freſh for the attempt. During all this time the pinnace and yawl continued to ply the net and hook with tolerable ſucceſs; ſometimes taking a
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:013324_0403_0F90F228F6975B68"/>
turtle, and frequently bringing in from two to three hundred weight of fiſh.</p>
                        <p>On the firſt of Auguſt, the carpenter examined the pumps, and, to our great mortification, found them all in a ſtate of decay, owing, as he ſaid, to the ſaps having been left in the wood; one of them was ſo rotten as, when hoiſted up, to drop to pieces, and the reſt were little better; ſo that our chief truſt was now in the ſoundneſs of our veſſel, which happily did not admit more than one inch of water in an hour.</p>
                        <p>At ſix o'clock in the morning of Friday the third, we made another unſucceſsful attempt to warp the ſhip out of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but at five o'clock in the morning of the 4th, our ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts had a better effect, and about ſeven, we got once more under ſail, with a light air from the land, which ſoon died away, and was followed by the ſea-breezes from S. E. by S. with which we ſtood off to ſea E. by N. having the pinnace ahead, which was ordered to keep ſounding continually. The yawl had been ſent to the turtle bank, to take up the net which had been left there; but as the wind freſhened we got out before her. A little before noon we anchored in fifteen fathom water, with a ſandy bottom; for I did not think it ſafe to run in among the ſhoals, till I had well viewed them, at low-water, from the maſt-head, which might determine me which way to ſteer: for as yet I was in doubt whether I ſhould beat back to the ſouthward, round all the ſhoals, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When we were at anchor the harbour from which we ſailed bore S. 70 W. diſtant about five leagues; the northermoſt point of the main in ſight, which I named CAPE BEDFORD, and which lies in latitude 15° 16′ S., longitude 214° 45′ W., bore N. 20 W. diſtant three leagues and a half; but to the N. E. of this cape we could ſee land which had the appearance of two high iſlands: the turtle banks bore eaſt, diſtant one mile: our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude by obſervation was 15° 32′ S. and our depth of water in ſtanding off from the land was from three and an half to fifteen fathom.</p>

                        <p>TO the harbour which we now had left, I gave the name of ENDEAVOUR RIVER. It is only a ſmall bar har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:013324_0404_0F90F229B9A71820"/>
or creek, which runs in a winding channel, three or four leagues inland, and at the head of which there is a ſmall brook of freſh water: there is no depth of water for ſhipping above a mile within the bar, and at this diſtance only on the north ſide, where the bank is ſo ſteep for near a quarter of a mile, that a ſhip may lie afloat at low water, ſo near the ſhore as to reach it with a ſtage, and the ſituation is extremely convenient for heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down; but at low water, the depth upon the bar is not more than nine or ten feet, nor more than ſeventeen or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen at the height of the tide; the difference between high and low water, at ſpring tides, being about nine feet. At the new and full of the moon it is high water between nine and ten o'clock: it muſt alſo be remembered, that this part of the coaſt is ſo barricaded with ſhoals, as to make the harbour ſtill more difficult of acceſs; the ſafeſt approach is from the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, keeping the main land cloſe upon the board all the way. Its ſituation may always be found by the latitude, which has been very accurately laid down. Over the ſouth point is ſome high land, but the north point is formed by a low ſandy beach, which extends about three miles to the northward, where the land begins again to be high.</p>
                        <p>The chief refreſhment that we procured here, was turtle, but as they were not to be had without going five leagues out to ſea, and the weather was frequently tempeſtuous, we did not abound with this dainty: what we caught, as well as the fiſh, was always equally divided among us all by weight, the meaneſt perſon on board having the ſame ſhare as myſelf; and I think every commander, in ſuch a voyage as this, will find it his intereſt to follow the ſame rule. In ſeveral parts of the ſandy beaches, and ſand hills near the ſea, we found purſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and a kind of bean that grows upon a ſtalk, which creeps along the ground: the purſlain we found very good when it was boiled, and the beans are not to be deſpiſed, for we found them of great ſervice to our ſick: the beſt greens, however, that could be procured here, were the tops of the coccos, which have been mentioned already, as known in the Weſt-Indies by the name of <hi>Indian kale:</hi> theſe were, in our opinion, not much inferior to ſpinnage, which, in taſte, they ſomewhat reſemble; the roots indeed are not good, but they might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be meliorated by proper cultivation. They are found here chiefly in boggy ground. The few cabbage palms that we meet with, were in general ſmall, and yielded ſo little cabbage that they were not worth ſeeking.</p>
                        <p>Beſides the kanguroo, and the oppoſſum that have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, and a kind of polecat, there are wolves upon this part of the coaſt, if we were not deceived by the tracks upon the ground, and ſeveral ſpecies of ſerpents; ſome of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents are venemous, and ſome harmleſs; there are no tame
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:013324_0405_0F90F22B379A0A10"/>
animals here except dogs, and of theſe we ſaw but two or three, which frequently came about the tents, to pick up the ſcraps and bones that happened to lie ſcattered near them. There does not indeed ſeem to be many of any animal, except the kanguroo; we ſcarcely ſaw any other above once, but this we met with almoſt every time we went into the woods. Of land fowls we ſaw crows, kites, haws, cokatoos of two ſorts, one white and the other black, a very beautiful kind of loriquets, ſome parrots, pigeons of two or three ſorts, and ſeveral ſmall birds not known in Europe. The water fowls are herns, whiſtling ducks, which perch, and I believe, rooſt upon trees, wild geeſe, curlieus, and a few others, but theſe do not abound. The face of the country, which has been occaſionally men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, is agreeably diverſified by hill and valley, lawn and wood. The ſoil of the hills is hard, dry and ſtony, yet it produces coarſe graſs beſides wood: the ſoil of the plains and vallies is in ſome places ſand, and in ſome clay; in ſome alſo it is rocky and ſtony, like the hills; in general, however, it is well clothed, and has at leaſt the appearance of fertility. The whole country, both hill and valley, wood and plain, abounds with ant hills, ſome of which are ſix or eight feet high, and twice as much in circumference. The trees here are not of many ſorts; the gum tree, which we found on the ſouthern part of the coaſt, is the moſt common, but here it is not ſo large: on each ſide of the river, through its whole courſe, there are mangroves in great numbers, which, in ſome places, extend a mile within the coaſt. The country is in all parts well watered, there being ſeveral fine rivulets at a ſmall diſtance from each other, but none in the place where we lay, at leaſt not during the time we were there, which was the dry ſeaſon; we were however well ſupplied with water by ſprings, which were not far off.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon of the 4th, we had a gentle breeze at S. E. and clear weather, but as I did not intend to ſail till the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſent all the boats to the reef, to get what turtle and ſhell fiſh they could. At low water, I went up to the maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and took a view of the ſhoals, which made a very threatening appearance: I could ſee ſeveral at a remote diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and part of many of them was above water. The ſea appeared moſt open to the north eaſt of the turtle reef, and I came to a reſolution to ſtretch out that way, cloſe upon a wind, becauſe if we ſhould find no paſſage, we could always return the way we went. In the evening the boats brought in a turtle, a ſting-ray, and as many large cockles as came to about a pound and a half a man, for in each of them there was not leſs than two pounds of meat: in the night alſo we caught ſeveral ſharks, which, though not a dainty, were an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table increaſe of our freſh proviſion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="117" facs="unknown:013324_0406_0F90F22C1EB2D748"/>
In the morning I waited till half ebb before I weighed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at that time the ſhoals begin to appear, but the wind then blew ſo hard that I was obliged to remain at anchor: in the afternoon, however, the gale becoming more moderate, we got under ſail, and ſtood out upon a wind N. E. by E. leaving the turtle reef to windward, and having the pinnace ſounding ahead: we had not kept this courſe long, before we diſcovered ſhoals before us, and upon both the bows; and at half an hour after four, having run about eight miles, the pinnace made the ſignal for ſhoal water, where we little expected it: upon this we tacked, and ſtood on and off, while the pinnace ſtretched farther to the eaſtward, and night approaching, I came to an anchor in twenty fathom water, with a muddy bottom. Endeavour river then bore S. 52 W. Cape Bedford W. by N. ½ N. diſtant five leagues, the northermoſt land in ſight, which had the appearance of an iſland, N.; and a ſhoal, a ſmall ſandy part of which appeared above water, bore N. E. diſtant between 2 and 3 miles: in ſtanding off from turtle reef to this place, we had from fourteen to twenty fathom water, but when the pinnace was about a mile farther to the E. N. E. there was no more than four or five feet water, with rocky ground; and yet this did not appear to us in the ſhip. In the morning of the 6th, we had a ſtrong gale, ſo that inſtead of weighing, we were obliged to veer away more cable, and ſtrike our top-gallant yards. At low water, myſelf, with ſeveral of the officers, kept a look-out at the maſt-head, to ſee if any paſſage could be diſcovered between the ſhoals, but nothing was in view except breakers, extending from the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>

W. and out to ſea beyond the reach of our ſight; theſe breakers, however, did not appear to be cauſed by one continual ſhoal, but by ſeveral, which lay detached from each other: on that which lay fartheſt to the eaſtward, the ſea broke very high, which made me think it was the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermoſt, for upon many of thoſe within, the breakers were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, and from about half ebb to half flood, they were not to be ſeen at all, which makes ſailing among them ſtill more dangerous, eſpecially as the ſhoals here conſiſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally of coral rocks, which are as ſteep as a wall; upon ſome of them however, and generally at the north end, there are patches of ſand, which are covered only at high water, and which are to be diſcerned at ſome diſtance. Being now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that there was no paſſage to ſea, but through the laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth formed by theſe ſhoals, I was altogether at a loſs which way to ſteer, when the weather ſhould permit us to get under ſail. It was the Maſter's opinion, that we ſhould beat back the way we came, but this would have been an endleſs labour, as the wind blew ſtrongly from that quarter, almoſt without intermiſſion; on the other hand, if no paſſage could be found

to the northward, we ſhould be compelled to take that meaſure at laſt. Theſe anxious deliberations engaged us till eleven o'clock at night, when the ſhip drove, and obliged us to veer away to a cable and one third, which brought her up; but in the morning, the gale increaſing, ſhe drove again, and we therefore let go the ſmall bower, and veered away to a whole cable upon it, and two cables on the other anchors, yet ſhe ſtill drove though not ſo faſt; we then got down top-gallant maſts, and ſtruck the yards and top-maſts cloſe down, and at laſt had the ſatisfaction to find that ſhe rode. Cape Bedford now bore W. S. W. diſtant three leagues and an half, and in this ſituation we had ſhoals to the eaſtward, extending from the S. E. by S. to the N. N. W. the neareſt of which was about two miles diſtant. As the gale continued with little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, we rode till ſeven o'clock in the morning of the 10th, when, it being more moderate, we weighed, and ſtood in for the land, having at length determined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

N. E. ½ E. three leagues from Cape Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, which the maſter had viſited while we were in port. At nine o'clock we were abreaſt of them, und between them and the main: between us and the main there was another low iſland, which lies N. N. W. four miles from the three iſlands; and in this channel we had fourteen fathom water. The nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt point of land in ſight now bore N. N. W. ½ W. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant about two leagues. Four or five leagues to the north of this head land, we ſaw three iſlands, near which lay ſome that were ſtill ſmaller, and we could ſee the ſhoals and reefs without us, extending to the northward, as far as theſe iſlands: between theſe reefs and the head land, we directed our courſe, leaving to the eaſtward a ſmall iſland, which lies N. by E. diſtant four miles from the three iſlands. At noon, we were got between the head land and the three iſlands: from the head land we were diſtant two leagues, and from the iſlands four; our latitude, by obſervation, was 14° 51′. We now thought we ſaw a clear opening before us, and hoped that we were once more out of danger; in this hope, however, we ſoon found ourſelves diſappointed, and for that reaſon I called the head land CAPE FLATTERY. It lies in latitude 14° 56′ S. longitude 214° 43′ W. and is a lofty promontory, making next the ſea into two hills, which have a third behind them, with low ſandy ground on each ſide: it may however be ſtill better known by the three iſlands out at ſea: the northermoſt and largeſt lies about five leagues from the cape, in the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of N. N. E. From Cape Flattery the land trends away N. W. and N. W. by W. We ſteered along the ſhore N. W.

by W. till one o'clock, for what we thought the open channel, when the petty officer at the maſt-head cried out that he ſaw land ahead, extending quite round to the iſlands that lay without us, and a large reef between us and them: upon this I ran up to the maſt head myſelf, from whence I very plainly ſaw the reef, which was now ſo far to windward, that we could not weather it, but the land ahead, which he had ſuppoſed to be the main, appeared to me to be only a cluſter of ſmall iſlands. As ſoon as I got down from the maſt-head, the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſome others went up, who all inſiſted that the land ahead was not iſlands, but the main, and to make their report ſtill more alarming, they ſaid that they ſaw breakers all round us. In this dilemma, we hauled upon a wind in for the land, and made the ſignal for the boat, that was ſounding ahead, to come on board, but as ſhe was far to leward, we were obliged to edge away to take her up, and ſoon after we came to an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, under a point of the main, in ſomewhat leſs than five fathom, and about the diſtance of a mile from the ſhore. Cape Flattery now bore S. E. diſtant three leagues and an half. As ſoon as the ſhip was at anchor, I went aſhore upon the point, which is high, and afforded me a good view of the ſea coaſt, trending away N. W. by W. eight or ten leagues, which, the weather not being very clear, was as far as I could ſee. Nine or ten ſmall low iſlands, and ſome ſhoals, appeared off the coaſt; I ſaw alſo ſome large ſhoals between the main and the three high iſlands, without which, I was clearly of opinion there were more iſlands, and not any part of the main. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the point I was now upon, which I called POINT LOOK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUT, and Cape Flattery, the main land, to the northward of Cape Bedford, is low, and chequered with white ſand and green buſhes, for ten or twelve miles inland, beyond which it riſes to a conſiderable height. To the northward of Point Look-out, the coaſt appeared to be ſhoal and flat, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance, which did not encourage the hope that the channel we had hitherto found in with the land would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. Upon this point, which was narrow, and conſiſted of the fineſt white ſand we had ever ſeen, we diſcovered the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of people, and we ſaw alſo ſmoke and fire at a diſtance up the country.</p>
                        <p>In the evening I returned to the ſhip, and reſolved the next morning to viſit one of the high iſlands in the offing, from the top of which, as they lay five leagues out to ſea, I hoped to diſcover more diſtinctly the ſituation of the ſhoals, and the channel between them.</p>
                        <p>In the morning therefore, of the 11th, I ſet out in the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, accompanied by Mr. Banks whoſe fortitude and curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity made him a party in every expedition, for the northermoſt and largeſt of the three iſlands, and at the ſame time I ſent the
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:013324_0409_0F90EC97F1D606B0"/>
maſter in the yawl to leeward, to ſound between the low iſlands and the main. In my way, I paſſed over a reef of coral rock and ſand, which lies about two leagues from the iſland, and I left another to leeward, which lies about three miles from it: on the north part of the reef, to the leeward, there is a low ſandy iſland, with trees upon it; and upon the reef which we paſſed over, we ſaw ſeveral turtle: we chaſed one or two, but having little time to ſpare, and the wind blowing freſh, we did not take any.</p>
                        <p>About one o'clock we reached the iſland, and immediately aſcended the higheſt hill, with a mixture of hope and fear, proportioned to the importance of our buſineſs, and the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the event: when I looked round, I diſcovered a reef of rocks, lying between two and three leagues without the iſlands, and extending in a line N. W. and S. E. farther than I could ſee, upon which the ſea broke in a dreadful furl; this however made me think that there were no ſhoals beyond them, and I conceived hopes of getting without theſe, as I perceived ſeveral breaks, or openings, in the reef, and deep water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and the iſlands. I continued upon this hill till ſun ſet, but the weather was ſo hazy during the whole time that I came down much diſappointed. After reflecting upon what I had ſeen, and comparing the intelligence I had gained with what I expected, I determined to ſtay upon the iſland all night, hoping that the morning might be clearer, and afford me a more diſtinct and comprehenſive view. We therefore took up our lodging under the ſhelter of a buſh, which grew upon the beach, and at three in the morning, having ſent the pinnace with one of the mates, whom I had brought out with me, to ſound between the iſlands and the reefs, and examine what appeared to be a channel through them, I climbed the hill a ſecond time; but to my great diſappointment found the weather much more hazy than it had been the day before. About noon the pinnace returned, having been as far as the reef, and found between fifteen and twenty-eight fathom of water; but it blew ſo hard that the mate did not dare to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into one of the channels, which he ſaid appeared to him to be very narrow: this however did not diſcourage me, for I judged from his deſcription of the place he had been at, that he had ſeen it to diſadvantage. While I was buſy in my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, Mr. Banks was attentive to his favourite purſuit, and picked up ſeveral plants which he had not before ſeen. We found the iſland, which is viſible at twelve leagues diſtance, to be about eight leagues in circumference, and in general very rocky and barren. On the north weſt ſide, however, there are ſome ſandy bays, and ſome low land, which is covered with long thin graſs, and trees of the ſame kind with thoſe upon the main: this part alſo abounded with lizards of a very large
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:013324_0410_0F90F22E3410C410"/>
ſize, ſome of which we took. We found alſo freſh water in two places; one was a running ſtream, but that was a little brackiſh where I taſted it, which was cloſe to the ſea; the other was a ſtanding pool, cloſe behind the ſandy beach, and this was perfectly ſweet and good. Notwithſtanding the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this iſland from the main, we ſaw, to our great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, that it was ſometimes viſited by the natives; for we found ſeven or eight frames of their huts, and vaſt heaps of ſhells, the fiſh of which we ſuppoſed had been their food. We obſerved that all theſe huts were built upon eminences, and entirely expoſed to the S. E. contrary to thoſe which we had ſeen upon the main; for they were all built either upon the ſide of a hill, or under ſome buſhes which afforded them ſhelter from the wind. From theſe huts, and their ſituation, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that at ſome ſeaſons of the year the weather here is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably calm and fine; for the inhabitants have no boat which can navigate the ſea to ſo great a diſtance, in ſuch wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as we had from the time of our firſt coming upon the coaſt. As we ſaw no animals upon this place but lizards, I called it LIZARD ISLAND; the other two high iſlands, which lie at the diſtance of four or 5 miles from it, are comparatively ſmall; and near them lie three others ſmaller ſtill, and low, with ſeveral ſhoals or reefs, eſpecially to the S. E.: there is however a clear paſſage from Cape Flattery to theſe iſlands, and even quite to the outward reefs, leaving Lizard iſland to the north weſt, and the others to the ſouth eaſt.</p>
                        <p>At two in the afternoon, there being no hope of clear wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ſet out from Lizard Iſland to return to the ſhip, and in our way landed upon the low ſandy iſland with trees upon it, which we had remarked in our going out. Upon this iſland we ſaw an incredible number of birds, chiefly ſea-fowl: we found alſo the neſt of an eagle with young ones, which we kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and the neſt of ſome other bird, we knew not what, of a moſt enormous ſize; it was built with ſticks upon the ground, and was no leſs than ſix and twenty feet in circumference, and two feet eight inches high. We found alſo that this place had been viſited by the Indians, probably to eat turtle, many of which we ſaw upon the iſland, and a great number of their ſhells, piled one upon another in different places.</p>
                        <p>To this ſpot we gave the name of EAGLE ISLAND, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter leaving it, we ſteered S. W. directly for the ſhip, ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the way, and we had never leſs than eight fathom, nor more than fourteen; the ſame depth of water that I had found between this and Lizard Iſland.</p>
                        <p>When I got on board, the maſter informed me that he had been down to the low iſlands, between which and the main I had directed him to ſound; that he judged them to lie about three leagues from the main; that without them he found from
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:013324_0411_0F90F22F05BD8F08"/>
ten to fourteen fathom, and between them and the main ſeven: but that a flat, which ran two leagues out from the main, made this channel narrow. Upon one of theſe low iſlands he ſlept, and was aſhore upon others; and he reported, that he ſaw every where piles of turtle-ſhells, and fins hanging upon the trees in many places, with the fleſh upon them, ſo recent, that the boat's crew eat of them: he ſaw alſo two ſpots, clear of graſs, which appeared to have been lately dug up, and from the ſhape and ſize of them he conjectured they were graves.</p>
                        <p>After conſidering what I had ſeen myſelf, and the report of the Maſter, I was of opinion that the paſſage to leeward would be dangerous, and that, by keeping in with the main, we ſhould run the riſk of being locked in by the great reef, and at laſt be compelled to return back in ſearch of another paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, by which, or any other accident that ſhould cauſe the ſame delay, we ſhould infallible loſe our paſſage to the Eaſt-Indies, and endanger the ruin of the voyage, as we had now but little more than three months proviſions on board at ſhort allowance.</p>
                        <p>Having ſtated this opinion, and the facts and appearances upon which it was founded, to the officers, it was unanimouſly agreed, that the beſt thing we could do would be to quit the coaſt altogether, till we could approach it with leſs danger.</p>
                        <p>In the morning therefore, at break of day, we got under ſail, and ſtood out N. E. for the north weſt end of Lizard Iſland, leaving Eagle Iſland to windward, and ſome other iſlands and ſhoals to the leeward, and having the pinnace ahead to aſcertain the depth of water in every part of our courſe. In this channel we had from nine to fourteen fathom. At noon, the north weſt end of Lizard Iſland bore E. S. E. diſtant one mile; our latitude by obſervation was 14° 38′, and our depth of water fourteen fathom. We had a ſteady gale at S. E. and by two o'clock we juſt fetched to windward of one of the channels or openings in the outer reef, which I had ſeen from the iſland. We now tacked, and made a ſhort trip to the S. W. while the maſter in the pinnace examined the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel: he ſoon made the ſignal for the ſhip to follow, and in a ſhort time ſhe got ſafe out. As ſoon as we had got without the breakers, we had no ground with one hundred and fifty fathom, and found a large ſea rolling in from the S. E. a certain ſign that neither land nor ſhoals were near us in that direction.</p>

<pb n="123" facs="unknown:013324_0412_0F90F22FCB9827A8"/>
accident, to which an almoſt continual tempeſt expoſed us, they ſhould not hold, we muſt in a few minutes inevitably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. But now, after having ſailed no leſs than three hundred and ſixty leagues, without once having a man out of the chains, heaving the lead, even for a Minute, which perhaps never happened to any other veſſel, we found ourſelves in an open ſea, with deep water; and enjoyed a flow of ſpirits which was equally owing to our late dangers, and our preſent ſecurity: yet the very waves, which by their ſwell convinced us that we had no rocks or ſhoals to fear, convinced us alſo that we could not ſafely put the ſame confidence in our veſſel as before ſhe had ſtruck; for the blows ſhe received from them ſo widened her leaks, that ſhe admitted no leſs than nine inches water in an hour, which, conſidering the ſtate of our pumps, and the navigation that was ſtill before us, would have been a ſubject of more ſerious conſideration, to people whoſe danger had not ſo lately been ſo much more imminent.</p>
                        <p>The paſſage or channel, through which we paſſed into the open ſea beyond the reef, lies in latitude 14° 32′ S. and may always be known by the three high iſlands within it, which I have called the ISLANDS OF DIRECTION, becauſe by theſe a ſtranger may find a ſafe paſſage though the reef quite to the main. The channel lies from Lizard Iſland N. E. ½ N. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant three leagues, and is about one third of a mile broad, and not more in length. Lizard Iſland which is, as I have before obſerved, the largeſt and the northermoſt of the three, affords ſafe anchorage under the north weſt ſide, freſh water, and wood for fuel. The low iſlands and ſhoals alſo which lie between it and the main abound with turtle and fiſh, which may probably be caught in all ſeaſons of the year, except when the weather is very tempeſtuous; ſo that, all things conſidered, there is not perhaps a better place for ſhips to refreſh at upon the whole coaſt than this iſland. And before I diſmiſs it, I muſt obſerve, that we found upon it, as well as upon the beach, in and about Endeavour River, bamboos, cocoa nuts, pumice ſtone, and the ſeeds of plants which are not the produce of this country, and which it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe are brought from the eaſtward by the trade winds. The iſlands which were diſcovered by Quiros, and called Auſtralia del Eſpiritu Santa, lie in this parallel; but how far to the eaſtward cannot now be aſcertained: in moſt charts they are placed in the ſame longitude with this country, which, as appears by the account of his voyage that has been publiſhed, he never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>As ſoon as we were without the reef, we brought to, and having hoiſted in the boats, we ſtood off and on upon a wind

all night; for I was not willing to run to leeward till I had a whole day before me. In the morning, at day-break, Lizard Iſland bore S. 15 E. diſtant ten leagues; and we then made ſail and ſtood away N. N. W. ½ W. till 9 o'clock, when we ſtood N. W. ½ N. having the advantage of a freſh gale at S. E. At noon, our latitude by obſervation was 13° 46′ S. and at this time we had no land in ſight. At ſix in the evening we ſhortened ſail and brought the ſhip to, with her head to the N. E.; and at ſix in the morning made ſail and ſteered weſt, in order to get within ſight of the land, that I might be ſure not to overſhoot the paſſage, if a paſſage there was, between this land and New Guinea. At noon, our latitude by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was 13° 2′ S., longitude 216° W.; which was 1° 23′ W. of Lizard Iſland: at this time we had no land in ſight; but a little before one o'clock, we ſaw high land from the maſt head, bearing W. S. W. At two we ſaw no more land to the N. W. of that we had ſeen before: it appeared in hills, like iſlands; but we judged it to be a continuation of the main land. About three we diſcovered breakers between the land and the ſhip, extending to the ſouthward farther than we could ſee; but to the north we thought we ſaw them terminate abreaſt of us. What we took for the end of them in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, however, ſoon appeared to be only an opening in the reef; for we preſently ſaw them again, extending northward beyond the reach of our ſight. Upon this we hauled cloſe upon a wind, which was now at E. S. E. and we had ſcarcely trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med our ſails before it came to E. by N. which was right upon the reef, and conſequently made our clearing it doubtful. At ſunſet the northermoſt part of it that was in ſight bore from us N. by E. and was two or three leagues diſtant; this however being the beſt tack to clear it, we kept ſtanding to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with all the ſail we could ſet till midnight; when, being afraid of ſtanding too far in this direction, we tacked and ſtood to the ſouthward, our run from ſunſet to this time being ſix leagues N. and N. by E. When we had ſtood about two miles S. S. E. it fell calm; we had ſounded ſeveral times during the night, but had no bottom with one hundred and forty fathom, neither had we any ground now with the ſame length of line; yet, about four in the morning, we plainly heard the roaring of the ſurf, and at break of day ſaw it foaming to a vaſt height, at not more than a mile's diſtance. Our diſtreſs now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned upon us with double force; the waves which rolled in upon the reef, carried us towards it very faſt; we could reach no ground with an anchor, and had not a breath of wind for the ſail. In this dreadful ſituation, no reſource was left us but the boats; and to aggravate our misfortune the pinnace was under repair: the long boat and yawl however were put into the water, and ſent ahead to tow, which, by the help of
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:013324_0414_0F90F231EF6F6AD8"/>
our ſweeps abaft, got the ſhip's head round to the northward; which, if it could not prevent our deſtruction, might at leaſt delay it. But it was ſix o'clock before this was effected, and we were not then a hundred yards from the rock upon which the ſame billow which waſhed the ſide of the ſhip, broke to a tremendous height the very next time it roſe; ſo that between us and deſtruction there was only a dreary valley, no wider than the baſe of one wave, and even now the ſea under us was unfathomable, at leaſt no bottom was to be found with an hundred and twenty fathom. During this ſcene of diſtreſs the carpenter had found means to patch up the pinnace; ſo that ſhe was hoiſted out, and ſent ahead, in aid of the other boats, to tow; but all our efforts would have been ineffectual, if, juſt at this criſis of our fate, a light air of wind had not ſprung up, ſo light, that at any other time we ſhould not have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, but which was enough to turn the ſcale in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and, in conjunction with the aſſiſtance which was affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us by the boats, to give the ſhip a perceptible motion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely from the reef. Our hopes now revived; but in leſs than ten minutes it was again a dead calm, and the ſhip was again driven towards the breakers, which were not now two hundred yards diſtance. The ſame light breeze however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned before we had loſt all the ground it had enabled us to gain, and laſted about ten minutes more. During this time we diſcovered a ſmall opening in the reef, at about the diſtance of a quarter of a mile: I immediately ſent one of the mates to examine it, who reported that its breadth was not more than the length of the ſhip, but that within it there was ſmooth water: this diſcovery ſeemed to render our eſcape poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and that was all, by puſhing the ſhip through the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was immediately attempted. It was uncertain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed whether we could reach it; but if we ſhould ſucceed thus far, we made no doubt of being able to get through: in this however we were diſappointed, for having reached it by the joint aſſiſtance of our boats and the breeze, we found that in the mean time it had become high water, and to our great ſurprize we met the tide of ebb ruſhing out of it like a mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtream. We gained however ſome advantage, though in a manner directly contrary to our expectations; we found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to go through the opening, but the ſtream that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented us, carried us about a quarter of a mile: it was too narrow for us to keep in it longer; yet this tide of ebb ſo much aſſiſted the boats that by noon we got an offing of near two miles. We had, however, reaſon to deſpair of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, even if the breeze, which had now died away, ſhould revive, for we were ſtill embayed in the reef; and the tide of ebb being ſpent, the tide of flood, notwithſtanding our utmoſt efforts, again drove the ſhip into the bite. About this time,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:013324_0415_0F8FFB69138B95F8"/>
however, we ſaw another opening, near a mile to the weſt ward, which I immediately ſent the firſt Lieutenant, Mr. Hicks, in the ſmall boat to examine: in the mean time we ſtruggled hard with the flood, ſometimes gaining a little, and ſometimes loſing; but every man ſtill did his duty, with as much calmneſs and regularity as if no danger had been near. About two o'clock Mr. Hicks returned with an account that the opening was narrow and dangerous, but that it might be paſſed: the poſſibility of paſſing it was ſufficient encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make the attempt, for all danger was leſs imminent than that of our preſent ſituation. A light breeze now ſprung up at E. N. E. with which, by the help of our boats, and the very tide of flood that without an opening would have been our deſtruction, we entered it, and were hurried through with amazing rapidity, by a torrent that kept us from driving againſt either ſide of the channel, which was not more than a quarter of a mile in breadth. While we were ſhooting this gulph, our ſoundings were from thirty to ſeven fathom, very irregular, and the ground at bottom very foul.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as we had got within the reef we anchored in nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen fathom, over a bottom of coral and ſhells. And now, ſuch is the viciſſitude of life, we thought ourſelves happy in having regained a ſituation, which but two days before it was the utmoſt object of our hope to quit. Rocks and ſhoals are always dangerous to the mariner, even where their ſituation has been aſcertained; they are more dangerous in ſeas which have never before been navigated, and in this part of the globe they are more dangerous than in any other; for here they are reefs of coral rock, riſing like a wall almoſt perpendicularly out of the unfathomable deep, always overflowed at high wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and at low water dry in many places; and here the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous waves of the vaſt Southern Ocean, meeting with ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt a reſiſtance, break with inconceivable violence, in a ſurf which no rocks or ſtorms in the northern hemiſphere can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. The danger of navigating unknown parts of this ocean was now greatly increaſed by our having a crazy ſhip, and being ſhort of previſions and every other neceſſary; yet the diſtinction of a firſt diſcoverer made us cheerfully encounter every danger, and ſubmit to every inconvenience; and we choſe rather to incur the cenſure of imprudence and temerity, which the idle and voluptuous ſo liberally beſtow upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful fortitude and perſeverance, that leave a country which we had diſcovered unexplored, and give colour to a charge of timidity and irreſolution.</p>
                        <p>Having now congratulated ourſelves upon getting within the reef, notwithſtanding we had ſo lately congratulated our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon getting without it, I reſolved to keep the main land on board in my future route to the northward, whatever
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:013324_0416_0F8FFB6AAAFB5390"/>
the conſequence might be; for if we had now gone without the reef again, it might have carried us ſo far from the coaſt, as to prevent my being able to determine, whether this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try did, or did not, join to New-Guinea; a queſtion which I was determined to reſolve from my firſt coming within ſight of land. However, as I had experienced the diſadvantage of having a boat under repair, at a time when it was poſſible I might want to uſe her, I determined to remain faſt at anchor, till the pinnace was perfectly refitted. As I had no employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the other boats, I ſent them out in the morning to the reef, to ſee what refreſhments could be procured, and Mr. Banks in his little boat, accompanied by Dr. Solander, went with them. In this ſituation I ſound the variation by ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and azimuth to be 4° 9′ E.; and at noon, our latitude by obſervation was 12° 38′ S. and our longitude 216° 45′ W. The main land extended from N. 66 W. to S. W. by S. and the neareſt part of it was diſtant about 9 leagues. The open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through which we had paſſed, I called PROVIDENTIAL CHANNEL; and this bore E. N. E. diſtant ten or twelve miles: on the main land within us was a lofty promontory, which I called CAPE WEYMOUTH; on the north ſide of which is a bay, which I called WEYMOUTH BAY: they lie in latitude 12° 42′ S., longitude 127° 15′ W. At four o'clock in the afternoon the boats returned with two hundred and forty pound of the meat of ſhell fiſh, chiefly of cockles, ſome of which were as much as two men could move, and contained twenty pounds of good meat. Mr. Banks alſo brought back many curious ſhells, and <hi>Molluſca;</hi> beſides many ſpecies of coral, among which was that called the <hi>Tubipora Muſica.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At ſix o'clock in the morning we got under fail and ſtood away to the N. W. having two boats ahead to direct us; our ſoundings were very irregular, varying five or ſix fathom every caſt, between ten and twenty-ſeven. A little before noon, we paſſed a low ſandy iſland, which we left on our ſtarboard ſide, at the diſtance of two miles. At noon our latitude was 12° 28′, and our diſtance from the main about four leagues: it extended from S. by W. to N. 71 W. and ſome ſmall iſlands from N. 40 W. to 54 W. Between us and the main were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſhoals, and ſome without us, beſides the main or outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt reef, which we could ſee from the maſt-head, ſtretching away to the N. E. At two in the afternoon, as we were ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing N. W. by N. we ſaw a large ſhoal right ahead, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three or four points upon each bow; upon this we hauled up N. N. E. and N. E. by N. to get round the north point of it, which we reached by four, and then edged away to the weſtward, and ran between the north end of this ſhoal and another, which lies two miles to the northward of it, having a boat all the way ahead ſounding; our depth of water was ſtill
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:013324_0417_0F90F23214265340"/>
very irregular, from twenty-two to eight fathom. At half an hour after ſix, we anchored in thirteen fathom: the norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the ſmall iſlands ſeen at noon bore W. ½ S. diſtant three miles: theſe iſlands are diſtinguiſhed in the chart by the name of FORBES'S ISLANDS, and lie about five leagues from the main, which here forms a high point that we called BOLT HEAD, from which the land trends more weſterly, and is in that direction all low and ſandy; to the ſouthward it is high and hilly, even near the ſea.</p>
                        <p>At ſix in the morning we got again under ſail, and ſteered for an iſland which lay at a ſmall diſtance from the main, and at this time bore from us N. 40 W. diſtant about five leagues: our courſe was ſoon interrupted by ſhoals; however, by the help of the boats, and a good look-out from the top of the maſt, we got into a fair channel that led us down to the iſland, between a very large ſhoal on our ſtarboard ſide, and ſeveral ſmall ones towards the main: in this channel we had from twenty to thirty fathom water. Between eleven and twelve o'clock we hauled round the north eaſt ſide of the iſland, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it between us and the main, from which it is diſtant about ſeven or eight miles. This iſland is about a league in circuit, and we ſaw upon it five of the natives, two of whom had lances in their hands; they came down upon a point, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looked a little while at the ſhip, retired. To the N. W. of it are ſeveral low iſlands and quays, which lie not far from the main; and to the northward and eaſtward are ſeveral other iſlands and ſhoals; ſo that we were now encompaſſed on every ſide; but having lately been expoſed to much greater danger, and rocks and ſhoals being grown familiar, we looked at them comparatively with little concern. The main land appeared to be low and barren, interſperſed with large patches of very fine white ſand, which we had found upon Lizard Iſland and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of the main. The boats had ſeen many turtle upon the ſhoals which they paſſed, but it blew too hard for them to take any. At noon our latitude by obſervation was 12°, and our longitude 217° 25′: our depth of water was four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen fathom; and our courſe and diſtance, reduced to a ſtrait line, was, between this time and the preceeding noon N. 29 W. thirty-two miles.</p>
                        <p>The main land within the iſlands that have been juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned forms a point, which I dalled CAPE GRENVILLE: it lies in latitude 11° 58′, longitude 217° 38′; and between it and Bolt Head is a bay, which I called TEMPLE BAY. At the diſtance of nine leagues from Cape Grenville, in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of E. ½ N. lie ſome high iſlands, which I called SIR CHARLES HARDY'S ISLES; and thoſe which lie off the Cape I called COCKBURN'S ISLES. Having lain by for the boats, which had got out of their ſtation, till about one o'clock,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:013324_0418_0F8FFB6BD100AD28"/>
we then took the yawl in tow; and the pinnace having got ahead, we filled, and ſtood N. by W. for ſome ſmall iſlands which lay in that direction; ſuch at leaſt they were in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but upon approaching them we perceived that they were joined together by a large reef: upon this we edged away N. W. and left them on our ſtarboard hand; we ſteered between them and the iſlands that lay off the main, having a clear paſſage, and from fifteen to twenty-three fathom water. At four o'clock, we diſcovered ſome low iſlands and rocks, bearing W. N. W. and ſtood directly for them: at half an hour after ſix, we anchored on the north eaſt ſide of the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt of them, at one mile diſtance, and in ſixteen fathom. Theſe iſlands lie N. W. four leagues from Cape Grenville, and from the number of birds that I ſaw upon them, I called them BIRD ISLES. A little before ſun-ſet, we were in ſight of the main land, which appeared all very low and ſandy, extending as far to the northward as N. W. by N. ſome ſhoals, quays, and low ſandy iſles ſtretching away to the N. E.</p>
                        <p>At ſix o'clock in the morning, we got again under ſail, with a freſh breeze at E. and ſtood away N. N. W: for ſome low iſlands in that direction, but were ſoon obliged to haul cloſe upon a wind, to weather a ſhoal which we diſcovered upon our larboard bow, having at the ſame time others to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: by the time we had weathered this ſhoal to leeward, we had brought the iſlands well upon our lee bow, but ſeeing ſome ſhoals running off from them, and ſome rocks on our ſtarboard bow, which we did not diſcover till we were very near them, I was afraid to go to windward of the iſlands, and therefore brought to, and having made the ſignal for the pinnace, which was ahead, to come on board, I ſent her to leeward of the iſlands, with orders to keep along the edge of the ſhoal, which ran off from the ſouth ſide of the ſouthermoſt iſland, ſending the yawl at the ſame time, to run over the ſhoal in ſearch of turtle. As ſoon as the pinnace had got to a proper diſtance, we wore, and ſtood after her: as we ran to leeward of this iſland, we took the yawl in tow, ſhe having ſeen only one ſmall turtle, and therefore made but little ſtay upon the ſhoal. The iſland we found to be a ſmall ſpot of ſand, with ſome trees upon it, and we could diſcern many huts, or habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the natives, whom we ſuppoſed occaſionally to viſit theſe iſlands from the main, they being only five leagues diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, to catch turtle, when they come aſhore to lay their eggs. We continued to ſtand after the pinnace N. N. E. and N. by E. for two other low iſlands, having two ſhoals with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, and one between us and the main. At noon, we were about four leagues from the main, which we ſaw extending to the northward, as far as N. W. by N. all flat and ſandy. Our latitude by obſervation, was 11° 23′ S. and our longitude 217°
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:013324_0419_0F90F232B693D510"/>
46′ W. our ſoundings were from fourteen to twenty-three fathom; but theſe, as well as the ſhoals and iſlands, are too numerous to be particularly mentioned. By one o'clock, we had run nearly the length of the ſouthermoſt of the two iſlands in ſight, and finding that the going to windward of them would carry us too far from the main, we bore up and ran to leeward, where, finding a fair open paſſage, we ſteered N. by W. in a direction parallel to the main, leaving a ſmall iſland which lay between it and the ſhip, and ſome low ſandy iſles and ſhoals without us, of all which we loſt ſight by four o'clock, and ſaw no more before the ſun went down: at this time the fartheſt part of the land in ſight bore N. N. W. ½ W. and ſoon after we anchored in thirteen fathom, upon ſoft ground, at the diſtance of about five leagues from the land, where we lay till day-light.</p>
                        <p>Early in the morning, we made ſail again, and ſteered N. N. W. by compaſs, for the northermoſt land in ſight; and at this time we obſerved the variation of the needle to be 3° 6′ E. At 8 o'clock, we diſcovered ſhoals ahead, and on our larboard bow, and ſaw that the northermoſt land, which we had taken for the main, was detached from it, and that we might paſs between them, by running to leeward of the ſhoals on our larboard bow, which were now near us: we therefore wore and brought to, ſending away the pinnace and yawl to direct us, and then ſteered N. W. along the S. W. or inſide of the ſhoals, keeping a good look-out from the maſt-head, and having another ſhoal on our larboard ſide: we found however a good channel of a mile broad between them, in which we had from ten to fourteen fathom. At eleven o'clock we were nearly the length of the land detached from the main, and there appeared to be no obſtruction in the paſſage between them, yet having the long boat aſtern and rigged, we ſent her away to keep in ſhore upon our larboard bow, and at the ſame time diſpatched the pinnace a-ſtarboard; precautions which I thought neceſſary, as we had a ſtrong flood that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us an end very faſt, and it was near high water: as ſoon as the boats were ahead, we ſtood after them, and by noon got through the paſſage. Our latitude by obſervation, was then 10° 36′, and the neareſt part of the main, which we ſoon after found to be the northermoſt, bore W. 2 S. diſtant between three or four miles: we found the land which was detached from the main, to be a ſingle iſland, extending from N. to N. 75 E. diſtant between two and three miles; at the ſame time we ſaw other iſlands at a conſiderable diſtance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from N. by W. to W. N. W. and behind them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other chain of high land, which we judged alſo to be iſlands: there were ſtill other iſlands, extending as far as N. 71 W. which at this time we took for the main.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="131" facs="unknown:013324_0420_0F8FFB6C32BD6528"/>
The point of the main which forms the ſide of the channel, through which we had paſſed, oppoſite to the iſland, is the northern promontory of the country, and I called it YORK CAPE. Its longitude is 218° 24′ W. the latitude of the north point is 10° 37′, and of the eaſt point 10° 42′ S. The land over the eaſt point, and to the ſouthward of it, is rather low, and as far as the eye can reach, very flat, and of a barren ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. To the ſouthward of the cape the ſhore forms a large open bay, which I called NEWCASTLE BAY, and in which are ſome ſmall low iſlands and ſhoals; the land adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent is alſo very low, flat, and ſandy. The land of the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern part of the cape is more hilly, the vallies ſeem to be well clothed with wood, and the ſhore forms ſome ſmall bays, in which there appeared to be good anchorage. Cloſe to the eaſtern point of the cape are three ſmall iſlands, from one of which a ſmall ledge of rocks runs out into the ſea: there is alſo an iſland cloſe to the northern point. The iſland that forms the ſtreight or channel through which we had paſſed, lies about four miles without theſe, which, except two, are very ſmall: the ſouthermoſt is the largeſt, and much higher than any part of the main land. On the north weſt ſide of this iſland there appeared to be good anchorage, and on ſhore, val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that promiſed both wood and water. To the ſouthward and ſouth eaſt, and even to the eaſtward and northward of them, there are ſeveral other low iſlands, rocks, and ſhoals: our depth of water in ſailing between them and the main, was twelve, thirteen, and fourteen fathom.</p>
                        <p>We ſtood along the ſhore to the weſtward, with a gentle breeze at S. E. by S. and when we had advanced between three and four miles, we diſcovered the land ahead, which, when we firſt ſaw it, we took for the main, to be iſlands detached from it by ſeveral channels: upon this we ſent away the boats, with proper inſtructions, to lead us through that channel which was next the main; but ſoon after diſcovering rocks and ſhoals in this channel, I made a ſignal for the boats to go through the next channel to the northward, which lay between theſe iſlands, leaving ſome of them between us and the main: the ſhip followed, and had never leſs than five fathom water in the narroweſt part of the channel, where the diſtance from iſland to iſland was about one mile and an half.</p>
                        <p>At four o'clock in the afternoon we anchored, being about a mile and a half, or two miles within the entrance, in ſix fathom and a half, with clear ground: the channel here had begun to widen, and the iſlands on each ſide of us were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant about a mile: the main land ſtretched away to the S. W. the fartheſt point in view bore S. 48 W. and the ſouthermoſt point of the iſlands, on the north weſt ſide of the paſſage, bore S. 76 W. Between theſe two points we could ſee no land, ſo
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:013324_0421_0F90F2337A2AEE20"/>
that we conceived hopes of having, at laſt, found a paſſage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Indian ſea; however, that I might be able to determine with more certainty, I reſolved to land upon the iſland which lies at the ſouth eaſt point of the paſſage. Upon this iſland we had ſeen many of the inhabitants when we firſt came to an anchor, and when I went into the boat, with a party of men, accompanied by Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander, in order to go aſhore, we ſaw ten of them upon a hill: nine of them were armed with ſuch lances as we had been uſed to ſee, and the tenth had a bow, and a bundle of arrows, which we had never ſeen in the poſſeſſion of the natives of this country before: we alſo obſerved, that two of them had large ornaments of mother of pearl hanging round their necks. Three of theſe, one of whom was the bowman, placed themſelves upon the beach abreaſt of us, and we expected that they would have oppoſed our landing, but when we came within about a muſket's ſhot of the beach, they walked leiſurely away. We immediately climbed the higheſt hill, which was not more than three times as high as the maſt-head, and the moſt barren of any we had ſeen. From this hill, no land could be ſeen between the S. W. and W. S. W. ſo that I had no doubt of finding a channel through. The land to the north weſt of it conſiſted of a great number of iſlands of various extent, and different heights, ranged one behind another, as far to the northward and weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as I could ſee, which could not be leſs than thirteen leagues. As I was now about to quit the eaſtern coaſt of New-Holland, which I had coaſted from latitude 38 to this place, and which I am confident no European had ever ſeen before, I once more hoiſted Engliſh colours, and though I had already taken poſſeſſion of ſeveral particular parts, I now took poſſeſſion of the whole eaſtern coaſt, from latitude 38° to this place, latitude 10½ S. in right of his Majeſty King George the Third, by the name of NEW SOUTH WALES, with all the bays, harbours, rivers and iſlands ſituated upon it: we then fired three vollies of ſmall arms, which were anſwered by the ſame number from the ſhip. Having performed this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony upon the iſland, which we called POSSESSION ISLAND, we reimbarked in our boat, but a rapid ebb-tide ſetting N. E. made our return to the veſſel very difficult and tedious. From the time of our laſt coming among the ſhoals, we conſtantly found a moderate tide, the flood ſetting to the N. W. and the ebb to the S. E. At this place, it is high water at the full and change of the moon, about one or two o'clock, and the water riſes and falls perpendicularly about twelve feet. We ſaw ſmoke riſing in many places from the adjacent lands and iſlands, as we had done upon every part of the coaſt, after our laſt return to it through the reef.</p>
                        <p>We continued at anchor all night, and between ſeven and
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:013324_0422_0F90F23435646560"/>
eight o'clock in the morning, we ſaw three or four of the natives upon the beach gathering ſhell-fiſh; we diſcovered, by the help of our glaſſes, that they were women, and, like all the other inhabitants of this country, ſtark naked. At low water, which happened about ten o'clock, we got under ſail, and ſtood to the S. W. with a light breeze at E. which afterwards veered to N. by E.: our depth of water was from ſix to ten fathom, except in one place where we had but five. At noon, Poſſeſſion iſland bore N. 53 E. diſtant four leagues, the weſtern extremity of the main land in ſight bore S. 43 W. diſtant between four and five leagues, and appeared to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely low, the ſouth weſt point of the largeſt iſland on the northweſt ſide of the paſſage bore N. 71 W. diſtant eight miles, and this point I called CAPE CORNWALL. It lies in latitude 10° 43′ S., longitude 219° W.; and ſome low lands that lie about the middle of the paſſage, which I called WALLIS'S ISLES, bore W. by S. ½ S. diſtant about two leages: our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude by obſervation, was 10° 46′ S. We continued to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance with the tide of flood W. N. W. having little wind, and from eight to five fathom water. At half an hour after one, the pinnace, which was ahead, made the ſignal for ſhoal water, upon which we tacked, and ſent away the yawl to ſound alſo: we then tacked again, and ſtood after them: in about two hours, they both made the ſignal for ſhoal water, and the tide being nearly at its greateſt height, I was afraid to ſtand on, as running aground at that time might be fatal: I therefore came to an anchor in ſomewhat leſs that ſeven fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, ſandy ground. Wallis's iſland bore S. by W. ½ W. diſtant five or ſix miles, the iſlands to the northward extended from S. 73 E. to N. 10 E. and a ſmall iſland, which was juſt in ſight bore N. W. ½ W. Here we found the flood tide ſet to the weſtward, and the ebb to the eaſtward.</p>
                        <p>After we had come to an anchor, I ſent away the maſter in the long-boat, to ſound, who, upon his return in the evening, reported, that there was a bank ſtretching north and ſouth, upon which there were but three fathom, and that beyond it there were ſeven. About this time it fell calm, and continued ſo till nine the next morning, when we weighed, with a light breeze at S. S. E. and ſteered N. W. by W. for the ſmall iſland which was juſt in ſight, having firſt ſent the boats ahead to ſound: the depth of water was eight, ſeven, ſix, five, and four fathom, and three fatham upon the bank, it being now the laſt quarter ebb. At this time, the northermoſt iſland in ſight bore N. 9 E. Cape Cornwall E. diſtant three leagues. This bank, at leaſt ſo much as we have ſounded, extends nearly N. and S. but to what diſtance I do not know: Its breadth is not more than half a mile at the utmoſt. When we had got over the bank, we deepened our water to ſix fathom
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:013324_0423_0F8FFB7059C28738"/>
quarters, and had the ſame depth all the way to the ſmall iſland ahead, which we reached by noon, when it bore S. diſtant about half a mile. Our depth of water was now five fathom, and the northermoſt land in ſight, which is part of the ſame chain of iſlands that we had ſeen to the northward from the time of our firſt entering the ſtreight, bore N. 71 E. Our latitude by obſervation, was 10° 33′ S. and our longitude 219° 22′ W.: in this ſituation, no part of the main was in fight. As we were now near the iſland, and had but little wind, Mr. Banks and I landed upon it, and found it, except a few patches of wood, to be a barren rock, the haunt of birds, which had frequented it in ſuch numbers, as to make the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face almoſt uniformly white with their dung: of theſe birds, the greater part ſeemed to be boobies, and I therefore called the place BOOBY ISLAND. After a ſhort ſtay, we returned to the ſhip, and in the mean time the wind had got to the S. W.; it was but a gentle breeze, yet it was accompanied by a ſwell from the ſame quarter, which, with other circumſtances, confirmed my opinion, that we were got to the weſtward of Carpentaria, or the northern extremity of New-Holland, and had now an open ſea to the weſtward, which gave me great ſatisfaction, not only becauſe the dangers and fatigues of the voyage were drawing to an end, but becauſe it would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be a doubt whether New Holland and New Guinea were two ſeparate iſlands, or different parts of the ſame.</p>
                        <p>The north eaſt entrance of this paſſage, or ſtreight, lies in the latitude of 10° 39′ S. and in the longitude of 218° 36′ W. It is formed by the main, or the northern extremity of New-Holland, on the S. E. and by a congeries of iſlands, which I called the PRINCE OF WALES'S ISLANDS, to the N. W. and it is probable that theſe iſlands extend quite to New Guinea. They differ very much both in height and circuit, and many of them ſeemed to be well clothed with herbage and wood: Upon moſt, if not all of them, we ſaw ſmoke, and therefore there can be no doubt of their being inhabited: it is alſo probable, that among them there are at leaſt as good paſſages as that we came through, perhaps better, though better would not need to be deſired, if the acceſs to it from the eaſtward, were leſs dangerous: that a leſs dangerous acceſs may be diſcovered, I think there is little reaſon to doubt, and to find it little more ſeems to be neceſſary, than to determine how far the principal, or outer reef, which bounds the ſhoals to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, extends towards the north, which I would not have left to future navigators if I had been leſs haraſſed by danger and fatigue, and had had a ſhip in better condition for the purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>To this channel, or paſſage, I have given the name of the ſhip, and called it ENDEAVOUR STREIGHTS. Its length
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:013324_0424_0F90F2350CCE1768"/>
from N. E. to S. W. is ten leagues, and is about five leagues broad, except at the north eaſt entrance, where it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſs than two miles, being contracted by the iſlands which lie there. That which I called Poſſeſſion iſland is of a moderate height and circuit, and this we left between us and the main, paſſing between it and two ſmall round iſlands, which lie about two miles to the N. W. of it. The two ſmall iſlands, which I called Wallis's iſlands, lie in the middle of the ſouth weſt entrance, and theſe we left to the ſouthward. Our depth of water in the ſtreight, was from four to nine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, with every where good anchorage, except upon the bank, which lies two leagues to the northward of Wallis's Iſlands, where, at low water, there are but three fathom: for a more particular knowledge of this ſtreight, and of the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſeveral iſlands and ſhoals on the eaſtern coaſt of New Wales, I refer to the chart; yet with reſpect to the ſhoals, I cannot pretend that one half of them are laid down, nor can it be ſuppoſed poſſible that one half of them ſhould be diſcovered in the courſe of a ſingle na- vigation: many iſlands alſo muſt have eſcaped my pencil, eſpecially between latitude 20° and 22°, where we ſaw iſlands out at ſea as far as an iſland could be diſtinguiſhed; it muſt not therefore be ſuppoſed, by future navigators, that where no ſhoal or iſland is laid down in my chart, no ſhoal nor iſland will be found in theſe ſeas: it is enough that the ſituation of thoſe that appear in the chart is faithfully aſcertained, and, in general, I have the greateſt reaſon to hope that it will be found as free from error as any that has not been corrected by ſubſequent and ſucceſſive obſervations. The latitudes and longitudes of all, or moſt of the principal head lands and bays, may be confided in, for we ſeldom failed of getting an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation once at leaſt every day, by which to correct the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of our reckoning, and obſervations for ſettling the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude were equally numerous, no opportunity that was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the ſun and moon being ſuffered to eſcape. It would be injurious to the memory of Mr: Green, not to take this opportunity of atteſting that he was indefatigable both in making obſervations and calculating upon them; and that, by his inſtructions and aſſiſtance, many of the petty officers were enabled both to obſerve and calculate with great exactneſs. This method of finding the longitude at ſea, may be put into univerſal practice, and may always be depended upon within half a degree, which is ſufficient for all nautical pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. If, therefore, obſerving and calculating were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as neceſſary qualifications for every ſea officer, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the ſpeculative theoriſt to ſolve this problem might be remitted, without much injury to mankind: neither will it
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:013324_0425_0F8FFB726716E5A0"/>
be ſo difficult to acquire this qualification, or put it in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, as may at firſt appear; for, with the aſſiſtance of the nautical almanack, and aſtronomical ephemeris, the calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations for finding the longitude will take up little more time than the calculation of an azimuth, for finding the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of the compaſs.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. VIII. Departure from New South Wales; a particular Deſcription of the Country, its Products, and People: A Specimen of the Language, and ſome Obſervations upon the Currents and Tides.</head>
                        <p>OF this country, its products, and its people, many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars have already been related in the courſe of the narrative, being ſo interwoven with the events, as not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a ſeparation. I ſhall now give a more full and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial deſcription of each, in which, if ſome things ſhould happen to be repeated, the greater part will be found new.</p>
                        <p>New Holland, or, as I have now called the eaſtern coaſt, New South Wales, is of a larger extent than any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the known world that does bear the name of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: the length of coaſt along which we ſailed, reduced to a ſtreight line, is no leſs than twenty-ſeven degrees of lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, amounting to near 2000 miles, ſo that its ſquare ſurface muſt be much more than equal to all Europe. To the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of 33 or 34, the land in general is low and level; far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther northward it is hilly, but in no part can be called moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous, and the hills and mountains, taken together, make but a ſmall part of the ſurface, in compariſon with the vallies and plains. It is upon the whole rather barren than fertile, yet the riſing ground is chequered by woods and lawns, and the plains and vallies are in many places covered with herbage: the ſoil however is frequently ſandy, and many of the lawns, or ſavannahs, are rocky and barren, eſpecially to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, where, in the beſt ſpots, vegetation was leſs vigorous than in the ſouthern part of the country; the trees were not ſo tall, nor was the herbage ſo rich. The graſs in general is high, but thin, and the trees, where they are largeſt, are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom leſs than forty feet aſunder; nor is the country inland, as far as we could examine it, better clothed than the ſea coaſt. The banks of the bays are covered with mangroves, to the diſtance of a mile within the beach, under which the ſoil is a rank mud, that is always overflowed by a ſpring tide; far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the country we ſometimes met with a bog, upon which
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:013324_0426_0F90F235C393D138"/>
the graſs was very thick and luxurient, and ſometimes with a valley, that was clothed with underwood: the ſoil in ſome parts ſeemed to be capable of improvement, but the far greater part is ſuch as can admit of no cultivation. The coaſt, at leaſt that part of it which lies to the northward of 25° S. abounds with fine bays and harbours, where veſſels may lie in perfect ſecurity from all winds.</p>
                        <p>If we may judge by the appearance of the country while we were there, which was in the very height of the dry ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is well watered: we found innumerable ſmall brooks and ſprings, but no great rivers; theſe brooks, however, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably become large in the rainy ſeaſon. Thirſty ſound was the only place where freſh water was not to be procured for the ſhip, and even there one or two ſmall pools were found in the woods, though the face of the country was every where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſected by ſalt-creeks, and mangrove land.</p>
                        <p>Of trees there is no great variety. Of thoſe that could be called timber, there are but two ſorts; the largeſt is the gum tree, which grows all over the country, and has been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned already: it has narrow leaves, not much unlike a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and the gum, or rather reſin, which it yields, is of a deep red, and reſembles the <hi>ſanguis draconis;</hi> poſſibly it may be the ſame, for this ſubſtance is known to be the produce of more than one plant. It is mentioned by Dampier, and is perhaps the ſame that Taſman found upon Diemen's land, where he ſays he ſaw "gum of the trees, and gum lac of the ground." The other timber tree is that which grows ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like our pines, and has been particularly mentioned in the account of Botany Bay. The wood of both theſe trees, as I have before remarked, is extremely hard and heavy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, here are trees covered with a ſoft bark that is eaſily peeled off, and is the ſame that in the Eaſt-Indies is uſed for the caulking of ſhips.</p>
                        <p>We found here the palm of three different ſorts. The firſt, which grows in great plenty to the ſouthward, has leaves that are plaited like a fan: the cabbage of theſe is ſmall, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely ſweet; and the nuts, which it bears in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, are very good food for hogs. The ſecond ſort bore a much greater reſemblance to the true cabbage tree of the Weſt-Indies; its leaves were large and pinnated, like thoſe of the cocoa-nut; and theſe alſo produced a cabbage, which, though not ſo ſweet as the other, was much larger. The third ſort, which, like the ſecond, was found only in the northern parts, was ſeldom more than ten feet high, with ſmall pinnated leaves, reſembling thoſe of ſome kind of fern: it bore no cabbage, but a plentiful crop of nuts, about the ſize of a large cheſnut, but rounder: as we found the hulls of theſe ſcattered round the places where the Indians had made their fires, we
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:013324_0427_0F90F23689BC2C18"/>
took for granted that they were fit to eat; thoſe however, who made the experiment paid dear for their knowledge of the contrary, for they operated both as an emetic and cathartic with great violence. Still, however, we made no doubt but that they were eaten by the Indians; and judging that the conſtitution of the hogs might be as ſtrong as theirs, tho' our own had proved to be ſo much inferior, we carried them to the ſtye; the hogs eat them, indeed, and for ſome time we tho't without ſuffering any inconvenience; but in about a week they were ſo much diſordered that two of them died, and the reſt were recovered with great difficulty. It is probable, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the poiſonous quality of theſe nuts may lie in the juice, like that of the caſſada of the Weſt Indies; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> the pulp, when dried, may be not only wholeſome, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Beſides theſe ſpecies of the palm, and mangroves, there were ſeveral ſmall trees and ſhrubs, altogether unknown in Europe; particularly one which produced a very poor kind of fig; another that bore what we called a plum, which it reſembled in colour, but not in ſhape, being flat on the ſides like a little cheeſe; and a third that bore a kind of purple apple; which, after it had been kept a few days, became eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and taſted ſomewhat like a damaſcene.</p>
                        <p>Here is a great variety of plants to enrich the collection of a botaniſt, but very few of them are of the aeſculent kind. A ſmall plant, with long, narrow, graſſy leaves, reſembling that kind of bulruſh which in England is called the Cat's-tail, yields a reſin of a bright yellow colour, exactly reſembling gambouge, except that it does not ſtain; it has a ſweet ſmell, but its properties we had no opportunity to diſcover, any more than thoſe of many others with which the natives appear to be ac-quainted, as they have diſtinguiſhed them by names.</p>
                        <p>I have already mentioned the root and leaves of a plant reſembling the coccos of the Weſt Indies, and a kind of bean; to which may be added, a ſort of parſley and purſelain, and two kinds of yams; one ſhaped like a rhadiſh, and the other round, and covered with ſtringy fibres: both ſorts are very ſmall, but ſweet; and we never could find the plants that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them, though we often ſaw the places where they had been newly dug up; it is probable that the drought had deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the leaves, and we could not, like the Indians, diſcover them by the ſtalks.</p>
                        <p>Moſt of the fruits of this country, ſuch as they are, have been mentioned already. We found one in the ſouthern part of the country reſembling a cherry, except that the ſtone was ſoft; and another not unlike a pine-aple in appearance, but of a very diſagreeable taſte, which is well know in the Eaſt Indies, and is called by the Dutch <hi>Pyn Appel Boomen.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of the quadrupeds, I have already mentioned the dog, and
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:013324_0428_0F8FFB72D5B288F0"/>
particularly deſcribed the kanguroo, and the animal of the opoſſum kind, reſembling the phalanger of Buffon; to which I can add only one more, reſembling a polecat, which the natives call <hi>Quoll;</hi> the back is brown, ſpotted with white, and the belly white unmixed. Several of our people ſaid they had ſeen wolves; but perhaps, if we had not ſeen tracks that favoured the account, we might have thought them little more worthy of credit than he who reported that he had ſeen the devil.</p>
                        <p>Of batts, which hold a middle place between the beaſts and the birds, we ſaw many kinds, particularly one which, as I have obſerved already, was larger than a partridge; we were not fortunate enough to take one either alive or dead, but it was ſuppoſed to be the ſame as Buffon has deſcribed by the name of <hi>Rouſet</hi> or <hi>Rouget.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſea and other water-fowl of this country, are gulls, ſhaggs, ſoland geeſe, or gannets, of two ſorts; boobies, nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, curlieus, ducks, pelicans of an enormous ſize, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others. The land birds are crows, parrots, paroquets, cockatoos, and other birds of the ſame kind, of exquiſite beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; pigeons, doves, quails, buſtards, herons, cranes, hawks, and eagles. The pigeons flew in numerous flocks, ſo that, notwithſtanding their extreme ſhyneſs, our people frequently killed ten or twelve of them in a day: theſe birds are very beautiful, and creſted very differently from any we had ſeen before.</p>
                        <p>Among other reptiles, here are ſerpents of various kinds, ſome noxious, and ſome harmleſs; ſcorpions, centipieds, and lizards. The infects are but few. The principal are the muſquito, and the ant. Of the ant there are ſeveral ſorts; ſome are as green as a leaf, and live upon trees, where they build their neſts of various ſizes, between that of a man's head and his fiſt. Theſe neſts are of a very curious ſtructure: they are formed by bending down ſeveral of the leaves, each of which is as broad as a man's hand, and gluing the points of them together, ſo as to form a purſe; the viſcus uſed for this purpoſe, is an animal juice, which nature has enabled them to elaborate. Their method of firſt bending down the leaves, we had not an opportunity to obſerve; but we ſaw thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands uniting all their ſtrength to hold them in this poſition, while other buſy multitudes were employed within, in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gluten that was to prevent their returning back. To ſatisfy ourſelves that the leaves were bent, and held down by the effort of theſe diminutive artificers, we diſturbed them in their work, and as ſoon as they were driven from their ſtation, the leaves on which they were employed ſprung up with a force much greater than we could have thought them able to conquer by any combination of their ſtrength. But
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:013324_0429_0F90F2374727B210"/>
though we gratified our curioſity at their expence, the injury did not go unrevenged; for thouſands immediately threw themſelves upon us, and gave us intolerable pain with their ſtings, eſpecially thoſe which took poſſeſſion of our necks and our hair, from whence they were not eaſily driven: the ſting was ſcarcely leſs painful than that of a bee; but, except it was repeated, the pain did not laſt more than a minute.</p>
                        <p>Another ſort are quite black, and their operations and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life are not leſs extraordinary. Their habitations are the inſide of the branches of a tree, which they contrive to excavate by working out the pith almoſt to the extremity of the ſlendereſt twig; the tree at the ſame time flouriſhing as if it had no ſuch inmate. When we firſt found the tree, we gathered ſome of the branches, and were ſcarcely leſs aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed than we ſhould have been to find that we had prophaned a conſecrated grove, where every tree, upon being wounded, gave ſigns of life; for we were inſtantly covered with legions of theſe animals, ſwarming from every broken bough, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting their ſtings with inceſſant violence. They are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Rumphius in his <hi>Herbarium Amboinenſe,</hi> vol. 2. p. 257; but the tree in which he ſaw their dwelling, is very different from that in which we found them.</p>
                        <p>A third kind we found neſted in the root of a plant, which grows on the bark of trees in the manner of miſletoe, and which they had perforated for that uſe. This root is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as big as a large turnip, and ſometimes much bigger: when we cut it, we found it interſected by innumerable wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſages, all filled with theſe animals, by which however the vegetation of the plant did not appear to have ſuffered any injury. We never cut one of theſe roots that was not inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, though ſome were not bigger than a hazel-nut. The animals themſelves are very ſmall, not more than half as big as the common red ant in England. They had ſtings but ſcarcely force enough to make them felt; they had however a power of tormenting us in an equal, if not a greater degree; for the moment we handled the root, they ſwarmed from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable holes, and running about thoſe parts of the body that were uncovered, produced a titulation more intolerable than pain, except it is increaſed to great violence. Rumphius has alſo given an account of this bulb and its inhabitants, vol. 6. p. 120. where he mentions another ſort that are black.</p>
                        <p>We found a fourth kind, which are perfectly harmleſs, and almoſt exactly reſemble the white-ants of the Eaſt-Indies; the architecture of theſe is ſtill more curious than that of the others. They have houſes of two ſorts, one is ſuſpended on the branches of trees, and the other erected upon the ground: thoſe upon the trees are about tree or four times as big as a man's head, and are built of a brittle ſubſtance, which ſeems
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:013324_0430_0F8FFB739EF06CE8"/>
to conſiſt of ſmall parts of vegetables, kneaded together with a glutinous matter, which their bodies probably ſupply; upon breaking this cruſt, innumerable cells, ſwarming with inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, appear in a great variety of winding directions, all communicating with each other, and with ſeveral apertures that led to other neſts upon the ſame tree: they have alſo one large avenue, or covered way, leading to the ground, and carried on under it to the other neſt or houſe that is conſtructed there. This houſe is generally at the root of a tree, but not of that upon which their other dwellings are conſtructed: it is formed like an irregularly ſided cone, and ſometimes is more than ſix feet high, and nearly as much in diameter. Some are ſmaller, and theſe are generally flat ſided, and very much reſemble in figure the ſtones which are ſeen in many parts of England, and ſuppoſed to be the remains of druidical anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. The outſide of theſe is of well tempered clay, about two inches thick; and within are the cells, which have no opening outwards, but communicate only with the ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean way to the houſes on the tree, and to the tree near which they are conſtructed, where they aſcend up the root, and ſo up the trunk and branches, under covered ways of the ſame kind as thoſe by which they deſcended from their other dwellings. To theſe ſtructures on the ground they probably retire in the winter, or rainy ſeaſons, as they are proof againſt any wet that can fall; which thoſe in the tree, though generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed under ſome overhanging branch, from the nature and thinneſs of their cruſt or wall, cannot be.</p>
                        <p>The ſea in this country is much more liberal of food to the inhabitants than the land; and though fiſh is not quite ſo plenty here as they generally are in higher latitudes, yet we ſeldom hauled the ſeine without taking from fifty to two hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red weight. They are of various ſorts; but, except the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and ſome of the ſhell-fiſh, none of them are known in Europe: moſt of them are palatable, and ſome are very deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Upon the ſhoals and reef there are incredible numbers of the fineſt green turtle in the world, and oyſters of various kinds, particularly the rock oyſter and the pearl-oyſter. The gigantic cockles have been mentioned already; beſides which there are ſea-crayfiſh, or lobſters, and crabs; of theſe however we ſaw only the ſhells. In the rivers and ſalt creeks there are aligators.</p>
                        <p>The only perſon who has hitherto given any account of this country, or its inhabitants, is Dampier, and though he is, in general, a writer of credit, yet in many particulars he is miſtaken. The people whom he ſaw were indeed inhabitants of a part of the coaſt very diſtant from each other, and there being a perfect uniformity in perſon and cuſtoms among them
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:013324_0431_0F90F238C2C8A580"/>
all, it is reaſonable to conclude, that diſtance in another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection has not conſiderably broken it.</p>
                        <p>The number of inhabitants in this country appears to be very ſmall in proportion to its extent. We never ſaw ſo many as thirty of them together but once, and that was at Botany Bay, when men, women, and children, aſſembled upon a rock to ſee the ſhip paſs by: when they manifeſtly formed a reſolution to engage us, they never could muſter above fourteen or fifteen fighting men; and we never ſaw a number of their ſhed or houſes together that could accommodate a larger party. It is true, indeed, that we ſaw only the ſea-coaſt on the eaſtern ſide; and that, between this and the weſtern ſhore, there is an immenſe tract of country wholly unexplored: but there is great reaſon to believe that this immenſe tract is either wholly deſolate, or at leaſt ſtill more thinly inhabited than the parts we viſited. It is impoſſible that the inland country ſhould ſubſiſt inhabitants at all ſeaſons without cultivation; it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely improbable that the inhabitants of the coaſt ſhould be totally ignorant of arts of cultivation, which were practiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and it is equally improbable that, if they knew ſuch arts, there ſhould be no traces of them among them. It is certain that we did not ſee one foot of ground in a ſtate of cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation in the whole country; and therefore it may well be concluded that where the ſea does not contribute to feed the inhabitants, the country is not inhabited.</p>
                        <p>The only tribe with which we had any intercourſe, we found where the ſhip was careened; it conſiſted of one and twenty perſons; twelve men, ſeven women, one boy, and one girl: the women we never ſaw but at a diſtance; for when the men came over the river they were always left behind. The men here, and in other places, were of a middle ſize, and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral well made, clean limbed, and remarkably vigorous, active, and nimble: their countenances were not altogether without expreſſion, and their voices were remarkably ſoft and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate.</p>
                        <p>Their ſkins were ſo uniformely covered with dirt, that it was very difficult to aſcertain their true colour: we made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral attempts, by wetting our fingers and rubbing it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                              <desc>••••</desc>
                           </gap>ustations, but with very little effect. With the dirt they appear nearly as black as a negro; and according to our beſt diſcoveries, the ſkin is of the colour of wood foot, or what is commonly called a chocolate colour. Their features are far from being diſagreeable, their noſes are not flat, nor are their lips thick; their teeth are white and even, and their hair naturally long and black, it is however univerſally crop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſhort; in general it is ſtrait, but ſometimes it has a ſlight curl; we ſaw none that was not matted and filthy, though without oil or greaſe, and to our great aſtoniſhment free from
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:013324_0432_0F8FFB7456A98768"/>
lice. Their beards were of the ſame colour with their hair, and buſhy and thick: they are not however ſuffered to grow long. A man whom we had ſeen one day with his beard ſomewhat longer than his companions, we ſaw the next, with it ſomewhat ſhorter, and upon examination found the ends of the hair burnt: from this incident, and our having never ſeen any ſharp inſtrument among them, we concluded that both the hair and the beard were kept ſhort by ſinging them.</p>
                        <p>Both ſexes, as I have already obſerved, go ſtark naked, and ſeem to have no more ſenſe of indecency in diſcovering the whole body, than we have in diſcovering our hands and face. Their principal ornament is the bone which they thruſt thro' the cartilage that divides the noſtrils from each other: what perverſion of taſte could make them think this a decoration, or what could prompt them, before they had worn it, or ſeen it worn, to ſuffer the pain or inconvenience that muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity attend it, is perhaps beyond the power of human ſagacity to determine: as this bone is as thick as a man's finger, and between five and ſix inches long, it reaches quite acroſs the face, and ſo effectually ſtops up both the noſtrils that they are forced to keep their mouths wide open for breath, and ſnuffle ſo when they attempt to ſpeak, that they are ſcarcely intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible even to each other. Our ſeamen, with ſome humour, called it their ſprit-ſail-yard; and indeed it had ſo ludicrous an appearance, that till we were uſed to it, we found it diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to refrain from laughter. Beſide this noſe-jewel, they had necklaces made of ſhells, very neatly cut and ſtrung toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; bracelets of ſmall cord, wound two or three times about the upper part of their arm, and a ſtring of plaited human hair, about as thick as a thread of yarn, tied round the waiſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, ſome of them had gorgets of ſhells hanging round the neck, ſo as to reach croſs the breaſt. But though theſe people wear no clothes, their bodies have a covering beſides the dirt, for they paint them both white and red: the red is commonly laid on in broad patches upon the ſhoulders and breaſt; and the white in ſtripes, ſome narrow, and ſome broad: the narrow were drawn over the limbs, and the broad over the body, not without ſome degree of taſte. The white was alſo laid on in ſmall patches upon the face, and drawn in a circle round each eye. The red ſeemed to be ochre, but what the white was we could not diſcover; it was cloſe grained, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponaceous to the touch, and almoſt as heavy as white lead; poſſibly it might be a kind of <hi>Steatites,</hi> but to our great regret we could not procure a bit of it to examine. They have holes in their ears, but we never ſaw any thing worn in them. Upon ſuch ornaments as they had, they ſet ſo great a value, that they would never part with the leaſt article for any thing we could offer; which was the more extraordinary as our beads
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:013324_0433_0F90F23983C78780"/>
and ribbons were ornaments of the ſame kind, but of a more regular form, and more ſhowy materials. They had indeed no idea of traffic, nor could we communicate any to them: they received the things that we gave them; but never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to underſtand our ſigns when we required a return. The ſame indifference which prevented them from buying what we had, prevented them alſo from attempting to ſteal: If they had coveted more they would have been leſs honeſt; for when we refuſed to give them a turtle, they were enraged, and attempted to take it by force, and we had nothing elſe upon which they ſet the leaſt value; for, as I have before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, many of the things that we had given them, we found left negligently about in the woods, like the play-things of children, which pleaſe only while they are new. Upon their bodies we ſaw no marks of diſeaſe or ſores, but large ſcars in irregular lines, which appeared to be the remains of wounds which they had inflicted upon themſelves with ſome blunt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and which we underſtood by ſigns to have been me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of grief for the dead.</p>
                        <p>They appeared to have no fixed habitations, for we ſaw nothing like a town or village in the whole country. Their houſes (if houſes they may be called) ſeem to be formed with leſs art and induſtry than any we had ſeen, except the wretched hovels at Terra del Fuego, and in ſome reſpects they are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior even to them. At Botany Bay, where they were beſt, they where juſt high enough for a man to ſit upright in; but not large enough for him to extend himſelf in his whole length in any direction: they are built with pliable rods about as thick as a man's finger, in the form of an oven, by ſticking the two ends into the ground, and then covering them with palm leaves, and broad pieces of bark: the door is nothing but a large hole at one end, oppoſite to which the fire is made, as we perceived by the aſhes. Under theſe houſes, or ſheds, they ſleep, coiled up with their heels to their head; and in this poſition one of them will hold three or four perſons. As we advanced northward, and the climate became warmer, we found theſe ſheds ſtill more ſlight: they were built, like the others, of twigs, and covered with bark; but none of them were more than four feet deep, and one ſide was intirely open: the cloſe ſide was always oppoſed to the courſe of the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wind, and oppoſite to the open ſide was the fire, probably more as a defence from the muſquitos than the cold. Under theſe hovels it is probable, that they thruſt only their heads, and the upper part of their bodies, extending their feet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the fire. They were ſet up occaſionally by a wandering hord, in any place that would furniſh them for a time with ſubſiſtence, and left behind them when (after it was exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) they went away: but in places where they remained only
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:013324_0434_0F90F23A398C1610"/>
a night or two, they ſlept without any ſhelter, except the buſhes or graſs, which is here near two feet high. We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, however, that though the ſleeping huts which we found upon the main, were always turned from the prevailing wind, thoſe upon the iſlands were turned towards it; which ſeems to be a proof that they have a mild ſeaſon here, during which the ſea is calm, and that the ſame weather which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables them to viſit the iſlands, makes the air welcome even while they ſleep.</p>
                        <p>The only furniture belonging to theſe houſes that fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our obſervation, is a kind of oblong veſſel made of bark, by the ſimple contrivance of tying up the two ends with a withy, which not being cut off ſerves for a handle; theſe we imagined were uſed as buckets to fetch water from the ſpring, which may be ſuppoſed ſometimes to be at a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance. They have however a ſmall bag, about the ſize of a moderate cabbage-net, which is made by laying threads loop within loop, ſomewhat in the manner of knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed by our ladies to make purſes. This bag the man carries looſe upon his back, by a ſmall ſtring which paſſes over his head; it generally contains a lump or two of paint and reſin, ſome fiſh-hooks and lines, a ſhell or two, out of which their hooks are made, a few points of darts, and their uſual ornaments, which includes the whole worldly treaſure of the richeſt man among them.</p>
                        <p>Their fiſh-hooks are very neatly made, and ſome of them are exceedingly ſmall. For ſtriking turtle they have a peg of wood which is about a foot long, and very well bearded; this fits into a ſocket at the end of a ſtaff of light wood, about as thick as a man's wriſt, and about ſeven or eight feet long: to the ſtaff is tied one end of a looſe line, about three or four fathom long, the other end of which is faſtened to the peg. To ſtrike the turtle, the peg is fixed into the ſocket, and when it has entered his body, and is retained there by the barb, the ſtaff flies off and ſerves for a float to trace their victim in the water; it aſſiſts alſo to tire him, till they can overtake him with their canoes, and haul him aſhore. One of theſe pegs, as I have mentioned already, we found buried in the body of a turtle, which had healed up over it. Their lines are from the thickneſs of a half inch rope to the fineneſs of a hair, and are made of ſome vegetable ſubſtance, but what in particular we had no opportunity to learn.</p>
                        <p>Their food is chiefly fiſh, though they ſometimes contrive to kill the kangaroo, and even birds of various kinds; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they are ſo ſhy that we found it difficult to get within reach of them with a fowling-piece. The only vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table that can be conſidered as an article of food is the yam; yet doubtleſs they eat the ſeveral fruits which have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:013324_0435_0F905011C578A668"/>
among other productions of the country; and indeed we ſaw the ſhells and hulls of ſeveral of them lying about the places where they had kindled their fire.</p>
                        <p>They do not appear to eat any animal food raw; but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no veſſel in which water can be boiled, they either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> it upon the coals, or bake it in a hole by the help of hot ſtones, in the ſame manner as is practiſed by the inhabitants of the iſlands in the South Seas.</p>
                        <p>Whether they are acquainted with any plant that has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicating quality, we do not know; but we obſerved that ſeveral of them held leaves of ſome ſort conſtantly in their mouths, as an European does tobacco, and an Eaſt Indian betele, but whatever it was, it had no effect upon the teeth or the lips.</p>
                        <p>As they have no nets, they catch fiſh only by ſtriking, or with a hook and line, except ſuch as they find in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the rocks and ſhoals, which are dry at half ebb.</p>
                        <p>Their manner of hunting we had no opportunity to ſee; but we conjectured by the notches which they had every where cut in large trees in order to climb them, that they took their ſtations near the tops of them, and there watched for ſuch ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals as might happen to paſs near enough to be reached by their lances: it is poſſible alſo, that in this ſituation they might take birds when they came to rooſt.</p>
                        <p>I have obſerved that when they went from our tents upon the banks of Endeavour river, we could trace them by the fires which they kindled in their way; and we imagined that theſe fires were intended ſome way for the taking the kangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roo, which we obſerved to be ſo much afraid of fire, that our dogs could ſcarcely force it over places which had been newly burnt, though the fire was extinguiſhed.</p>
                        <p>They produce fire with great facility, and ſpread it in a wonderful manner. To produce it they take two pieces of dry ſoft wood, one is a ſtick about eight or nine inches long, the other piece is flat: the ſtick they ſhape into an obtuſe point at one end, and preſſing it upon the other, turn it nimb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by holding it between both their hands as we do a chocolate mill, often ſhifting their hands up, and then moving them down upon it, to increaſe the preſſure as much as poſſible. By this method they get fire in leſs than two minutes, and from the ſmalleſt ſpark they increaſe it with great ſpeed and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. We have often ſeen one of them run along the ſhore, to all appearance with nothing in his hand, who ſtooping down for a moment, at the diſtance of every fifty or a hundred yards, left fire behind him, as we could ſee firſt by the ſmoke, and then by the flame among the drift wood, and other litter which was ſcattered along the place. We had the curioſity to examine one of theſe planters of fire, when he ſett off, and we
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:013324_0436_0F90EC98B1E8A838"/>
ſaw him wrap up a ſmall ſpark in dry graſs, which, when he had run a little way, having been fanned by the air that his motion produced, began to blaze; he then laid it down in a place convenient for his purpoſe, incloſing a ſpark of it in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other quantity of graſs, and ſo continued his courſe.</p>
                        <p>There are perhaps few things in the hiſtory of mankind more extraordinary than the diſcovery and application of fire: it will ſcarcely be diſputed that the manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it, whether by colliſion or attrition, was diſcovered by chance: but its firſt effects would naturally ſtrike thoſe to whom it was a new object, with conſternation and terror: it would appear to be an enemy to life and nature, and to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and deſtroy whatever was capable of being deſtroyed or tormented; and therefore it ſeems not eaſy to conceive what ſhould incline thoſe who firſt ſaw it receive a tranſient exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from chance, to produce it by deſign. It is by no means probable that thoſe who firſt ſaw ſire, approached it with the ſame caution, as thoſe who are familiar with its effects, ſo as to be warmed only and not burnt; and it is reaſonable to think that the intolerable pain which, at its firſt appearance, it muſt produce upon ignorant curioſity, would ſow perpetual enmity between this element and mankind; and that the ſame principle which incites them to cruſh a ſerpent, would incite them to deſtroy fire, and avoid all means by which it would be produced, as ſoon as they were known. Theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſidered, how men became ſufficiently familiar with it to render it uſeful, ſeems to be a problem very difficult to ſolve: nor is it eaſy to account for the firſt application of it to culinary purpoſes, as the eating both animal and vegetable food raw, muſt have become a habit, before there was fire to dreſs it, and thoſe who have conſidered the force of habit will readily believe, that to men who had always eaten the fleſh of animals raw, it would be as diſagreeable dreſſed, as to thoſe who have always eaten it dreſſed, it would be raw. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable that the inhabitants of Terra del Fuego produce fire from a ſpark by colliſion, and that the happier natives of this country, New Zealand and Otaheite, produce it by the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one combuſtible ſubſtance againſt another: is there not then the ſame reaſon to ſuppoſe that theſe different operations correſpond with the manner in which chance produced fire in the neighbourhood of the torrid and frigid zones? Among the rude inhabitants of a cold country, neither any operation of art, or concurrence of accident, could be ſuppoſed ſo eaſily to produce fire by attrition, as in a climate where every thing is hot, dry, and aduſt, teeming with a latent fire which a ſlight degree of motion was ſufficient to call forth; in a cold country therefore, it is natural to ſuppoſe that fire was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the accidental colliſion of two metallic ſubſtances,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:013324_0437_0F90F23B159D7A50"/>
and in a cold country for that reaſon, the ſame expedient was uſed to produce it by deſign: but in hot countries, where two combuſtible ſubſtances eaſily kindle by attrition, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the attrition of ſuch ſubſtances firſt produced fire, and here it was therefore natural for art to adopt the ſame ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, with a view to produce the ſame effect. It may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be true that fire is now produced in many cold countries by attrition, and in many hot by a ſtroke; but perhaps upon enquiry there may appear reaſon to conclude that this has ariſen from the communication of one country with another, and that with reſpect to the original production of fire in hot and cold countries, the diſtinction is well founded.</p>
                        <p>There may perhaps be ſome reaſon to ſuppoſe that men became gradually acquainted with the nature and effects of fire, by its permanent exiſtence in a volcano, there being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of volcanoes, or veſtiges of their effects, in almoſt every part of the world: by a volcano, however, no method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing fire, otherwiſe than by contact, could be learnt; the production and application of fire therefore, ſtill ſeem to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford abundant ſubject of ſpeculation to the curious.</p>
                        <p>The weapons of theſe people are ſpears or lances, and theſe are of different kinds: ſome that we ſaw upon the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern part of the coaſt had four prongs, pointed with bone, and barbed; the points were alſo ſmeared with a hard reſin, which gave them a poliſh, and made them enter deeper into what they ſtruck. To the northward, the lance has but one point: the ſhaft is made of cane, or the ſtalk of a plant ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a bulruſh, very ſtreight and light, and from eight to fourteen feet long, conſiſting of ſeveral joints, where the pieces are let into each other, and bound together; to this are fitted points of different kinds; ſome are of hard heavy wood, and ſome are the bones of fiſh: we ſaw ſeveral that were point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſtings of the ſting-ray, the largeſt that they could procure, and barbed with ſeveral that were ſmaller, faſtened on in a contrary direction; the points of wood were alſo ſometimes armed with ſharp pieces of broken ſhells, which were ſtuck in, and at the junctures covered with reſin: the lances that are thus barbed, are indeed dreadful weapons, for when once they have taken place, they can never be drawn back without tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the fleſh, or leaving the ſharp ragged ſplinters of the bone or ſhell, which forms the beard, behind them in the wound. Theſe weapons are thrown with great force and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity; if intended to wound at a ſhort diſtance, between ten and twenty yards, ſimply with the hand, but if at the diſtance of forty or fifty, with an inſtrument which we called a throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtick. This is a plain ſmooth piece of a hard reddiſh wood, very highly poliſhed, about two inches broad, half an inch thick, and three feet long, with a ſmall knob, or hook
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:013324_0438_0F90F23BBA153B70"/>
at one end, and a croſs piece about three or four inches long at the others the knob at one end is received in a ſmall dent or hollow, which is made for that purpoſe in the ſhaft of the lance, near the point, but from which it eaſily ſlips, upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impelled forward: when the lance is laid along upon this machine, and ſecured in a proper poſition by the knob, the perſon that is to throw it holds it over his ſhoulder, and after ſhaking it, delivers both the throwing ſtick and lance with all his force, but the ſtick being ſtopped by the croſs piece which comes againſt the ſhoulder, with a ſudden jerk, the lance flies forward with incredible ſwiftneſs, and with ſo good an aim, that at the diſtance of fifty yards theſe Indians were more ſure of their mark than we could be with a ſingle bullet. Beſides theſe lances we ſaw no offenſive weapon upon this coaſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when we took our laſt view of it with our glaſſes, and then we thought we ſaw a man with a bow and arrows, in which it is poſſible we might be miſtaken. We ſaw, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at Botany Bay, a ſhield or target, of an oblong ſhape, about three feet long, and eighteen inches broad, which was made of the bark of a tree: this was fetched out of a but by one of the men that oppoſed our landing, who, when he ran away, left it behind him, and upon taking it up, we found that it had been pierced through with a ſingle pointed lance near the center. Theſe ſhields are certainly in frequent uſe among the people here, for though this was the only one that we ſaw in their poſſeſſion, we frequently found trees from which they appeared manifeſtly to have been cut, the marks being eaſily diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that were made by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting buckets: ſometimes alſo we found the ſhields cut out, but not yet taken off from the tree, the edges of the bark on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being a little raiſed by wedges, ſo that theſe people appear to have diſcovered that the bark of a tree becomes thicker and ſtronger by being ſuffered to remain upon the trunk after it has been cut round.</p>
                        <p>The canoes of New Holland are as mean and rude as the houſes. Thoſe on the ſouthern part of the coaſt are nothing more than a piece of bark, about twelve feet long, tied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the ends, and kept open in the middle by ſmall bows of wood: yet in a veſſel of this conſtruction we once ſaw three people. In ſhallow water they are ſet forward by a pole, and in deeper by paddles, about eighteen inches long, one of which the boatman holds in each hand; mean as they are, they have many conveniences, they draw but little water, and they are very light, ſo that they go upon mud banks to pick up ſhell fiſh, the moſt important uſe to which they can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, better perhaps than veſſels of any other conſtruction. We obſerved, that in the middle of theſe canoes there was a
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:013324_0439_0F90F23C79D1D970"/>
heap of ſea-weed, and upon that a ſmall fire; probably that the fiſh may be broiled and eaten the moment it is caught.</p>
                        <p>The canoes that we ſaw when we advanced farther to the northward, are not made of bark, but of the trunk of a tree hollowed, perhaps by fire. They are about fourteen feet long, and, being very narrow, are fitted with an outrigger, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their overſetting. Theſe are worked with paddles, that are ſo large as to require both hands to manage one of them: the outſide is wholly unmarked by any tool, but at each end the wood is left longer at the top than at the bottom, ſo that there is a projection beyond the hollow part, reſembling the end of a plank; the ſides are tolerably thin, but how the tree is felled and faſhioned, we had no opportunity to learn. The only tools that we ſaw among them are an adze, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly made of ſtone, ſome ſmall pieces of the ſame ſubſtance in form of a wedge, a wooden mallet, and ſome ſhells and fragments of coral. For poliſhing their throwing ſticks, and the points of their lances, they uſe the leaves of a kind of wild fig-tree, which bites upon wood almoſt as keenly as the ſhave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs of Europe, which is uſed by our joiners: with ſuch tools, the making even ſuch a canoe as I have deſcribed, muſt be a moſt difficult and tedious labour: to thoſe who have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the uſe of metal, it appears altogether imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable; but there are few difficulties that will not yield to patient perſeverance, and he who does all he can, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly produce effects that greatly exceed his apparent power.</p>
                        <p>The utmoſt freight of theſe canoes is four people, and if more at any time wanted to come over the river, one of thoſe who came firſt was obliged to go back for the reſt: from this circumſtance we conjectured that the boat we ſaw, when we were lying in Endeavour River, was the only one in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood: we have however ſome reaſon to believe that the bark canoes are alſo uſed where the wooden ones are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, for upon one of the ſmall iſlands where the natives had been fiſhing for turtle, we found one of the little paddles, which had belonged to ſuch a boat, and would have been uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs on board any other.</p>
                        <p>By what means the inhabitants of this country are reduced to ſuch a number as it can ſubſiſt, is not perhaps very eaſy to gueſs; whether, like the inhabitants of New Zealand, they are deſtroyed by the hands of each other in conteſts for food; whether they are ſwept off by accidental famine, or whether there is any cauſe which prevents the increaſe of the ſpecies, muſt be left to future adventurers to determine. That they have wars, appears by their weapons; for ſuppoſing the lances to ſerve merely for the ſtriking of fiſh, the ſhield could be intended for nothing but a defence againſt men; the only mark of hoſtility, however, which we ſaw among them, was
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:013324_0440_0F90F23D3ABBFED8"/>
the perforation of the ſhield by a ſpear which has been juſt mentioned, for none of them appeared to have been wounded by an enemy. Neither can we determine whether they are puſilanimous or brave; the reſolution with which two of them attempted to prevent our landing, when we had two boats full of men, in Botany Bay, even after one of them was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſmall ſhot, gave us reaſon to conclude that they were not only naturally courageous, but that they had acquired a familiarity with the dangers of hoſtility, and were, by habit as well as nature, a daring and warlike people; but their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate flight from every other place that we approached, without even a menace, while they were out of our reach, was an indication of uncommon tameneſs and timidity, ſuch as thoſe who had only been occaſionally warriors muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have ſhaken off, whatever might have been their natural diſpoſition. I have faithfully related facts, the reader muſt judge of the people for himſelf.</p>
                        <p>From the account that has been given of our commerce with them, it cannot be ſuppoſed that we ſhould know much of their language; yet as this is an object of great curioſity, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to the learned, and of great importance in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches into the origin of the various nations that have been diſcovered, we took ſome pains to bring away ſuch a ſpecimen of it as might, in a certain degree, anſwer the purpoſe, and I ſhall now give an account how it was procured. If we want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know the name of a ſtone, we took a ſtone up into our hands, and as well as we could, intimated by ſigns that we wiſhed they ſhould name it: the word that they pronounced upon the occaſion, we immediately wrote down. This me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, though it was the beſt we could contrive, might cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly lead us into many miſtakes; for if an Indian was to take up a ſtone, and aſk us the name of it, we might anſwer a pebble or a flint; ſo when we took up a ſtone, and aſked an Indian the name of it, he might pronounce a word that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed the ſpecies and not the genus, or that, inſtead of ſignifying ſtone ſimply, might ſignify a rough ſtone, or a ſmooth ſtone; however, as much as poſſible to avoid miſtakes of this kind, ſeveral of us contrived, at different times, to get from them as many words as we could, and having noted them down, compared our liſts: thoſe which were the ſame in and which, according to every one's account, ſignified the ſame thing, we ventured to record, with a very few others, which, from the ſimplicity of the ſubject, and the eaſe of expreſſing our queſtion with plainneſs and preciſion by a ſign, have acquired equal authority.</p>

                        <p>I ſhall now quit this country, with a few obſervations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the currents and tides upon the coaſt. From lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 32°, and ſomewhat higher, down to Sandy Cape, in latitude 24° 46′, we conſtantly found a current ſetting to the ſouthward, at the rate of about ten or fifteen miles a day, being more or leſs, according to our diſtance from the land, for it always ran with more force in ſhore than in the offing; but I could never ſatisfy myſelf whether the flood-tide came from the ſouthward, the eaſtward, or the northward: I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the opinion that it came from the ſouth-eaſt, but the firſt time we anchored off the coaſt, which was in latitude 24° 30′, about ten leagues to the ſouth eaſt of Buſtard Bay, I found it come from the north weſt; on the contrary, thirty leagues farther to the north weſt, on the ſouth ſide of Keppel Bay, I found that it came from the eaſt, and at the northern part of that bay it came from the northward, but with a much ſlower motion than it had come from the eaſt: on the eaſt ſide of the Bay of Inlets, it ſet ſtrongly to the weſtward, as far as the opening of Broad Sound; but on the north ſide of that ſound, it came with a very ſlow motion from the north weſt; and when we lay at anchor before Repulſe Bay, it came from the northward: to account for its courſe in all this variety of directions, we need only admit that the flood-tide comes from the eaſt or ſouth eaſt. It is well-known, that where there are deep inlets, and large creeks into low lands, running up from the ſea, and not occaſioned by rivers of freſh water, there will always be a great indraught of the flood-tide, the direction of which will be determined by the poſition or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the coaſt which forms the entrance of ſuch inlet, whatever be its courſe at ſea; and where the tides are weak, which upon this coaſt is generally the caſe, a large inlet will, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, attract the flood-tide for many leagues.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="154" facs="unknown:013324_0443_0F90F240431F31C0"/>
To the the northward of Whitſunday's Paſſage there is no large inlet, conſequently the flood ſets to the northward, or north weſtward, according to the direction of the coaſt, and the ebb to the ſouth, or ſouth eaſtward, at leaſt ſuch is their courſe at a little diſtance from the land, for very near it they will be influenced by ſmall inlets. I alſo obſerved, that we had only one high tide in twenty-four hours, which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the night. The difference between the perpendicular riſe of the water in the day and the night, when there is a ſpring-tide, is no leſs than three feet, which, where the tides are ſo inconſiderable as they are here, is a great proportion of the whole difference between high and low water. This ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity of the tides, which is worthy of notice, we did not diſcover till we were run aſhore, and perhaps farther to the northward it is ſtill greater: after we got within the reef the ſecond time, we found the tides more conſiderable than we had ever done before, except in the Bay of Inlets, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly this may be owing to the water being more confined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſhoals; here alſo the flood ſets to the north weſt, and continues in the ſame direction to the extremity of New Wales, from whence its direction is weſt, and ſouth weſt, into the Indian ſea.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. IX. The Paſſage from New South Wales to New Guinea, with an Account of what happened upon Landing there.</head>
                        <p>IN the afternoon of Thurſday Auguſt the 23d, after leaving Booby Iſland, we ſteered W. N. W. with light airs from the S. S. W. till five o'clock, when it fell calm, and the tide of ebb ſoon after ſetting to the N. E. we came to an anchor in eight fathom water, with a ſoft ſandy bottom. Booby Iſland bore S. 50 E. diſtant five miles, and the Prince of Wales's Iſles extended from the N. E. by N. to S. 55 E.; between theſe there appeared to be a clear open paſſage, extending from N. 46 E. to E. by N.</p>
                        <p>At half an hour after five, in the morning of the 24th, as we were purchaſing the anchor, the cable parted at about eight or ten fathom from the ring: the ſhip then began to drive, but I immediately dropped another anchor, which brought her up before ſhe got more than a cable's length from the buoy; the boats were then ſent to ſweep for the anchor, but could not ſucceed. At noon, our latitude, by obſervation, was 10° 30′ S. As I was reſolved not to leave the anchor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, while their remained a poſſibility of recovering it, I ſent
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:013324_0444_0F90F240F22203D0"/>
the boats again after dinner, with a ſmall line, to diſcover where it lay; this being happily effected, we ſwept for it with a hawſer, and by the ſame hawſer hove the ſhip up to it: we proceeded to weigh it, but juſt as we were about to ſhip it, the hawſer ſlipped, and we had all our labour to repeat: by this time it was dark, and we were obliged to ſuſpend our operations till the morning.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as it was light, we ſweeped it again, and heaved it to the bows: by eight o'clock, we weighed the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, got under ſail, and, with a fine breeze at E. N. E. ſtood to the north weſt. At noon, our latitude, by obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was 10° 18′ S. longitude 219° 39′ W. At this time, we had no land in ſight, but about two miles to the ſouthward of us lay a large ſhoal, upon which the ſea broke with great violence, and part of which, I believe, is dry at low water, It extends N. W. and S. E. and is about five leagues in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit. Our depth of water, from the time we weighed till now, was nine fathom, but it ſoon ſhallowed to ſeven fathom; and at half an hour after one, having run eleven miles between noon and that time, the boat which was a-head made the ſignal for ſhoal water; we immediately let go an anchor, and brought the ſhip up with all her ſails ſtanding, for the boat having juſt been relieved, was at but a little diſtance: upon looking out from the ſhip, we ſaw ſhoal water almoſt all round us, both wind and tide at the ſame time ſetting upon it. The ſhip was in ſix fathom, but upon ſounding round her, at the diſtance of half a cable's length, we found ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two. This ſhoal reached from the eaſt, round by the north and weſt, as far as the ſouth weſt, ſo that there was no way for us to get clear, but that which we came. This was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other hair's-breadth eſcape, for it was near high water, and there run a ſhort cockling ſea, which muſt very ſoon have bulged the ſhip if ſhe had ſtruck; and if her direction had been half a cable's length more either to the right or left, ſhe muſt have ſtruck before the ſignal for the ſhoal was made. The ſhoals which, like theſe, lie a fathom or two under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are the moſt dangerous of any, for they do not diſcover themſelves till the veſſel is juſt upon them, and then indeed the water looks brown, as if it reflected a dark cloud. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween three and four o'clock the tide of ebb began to make, and I ſent the Maſter to ſound to the ſouthward and ſouth-weſtward, and in the mean time, as the ſhip <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, I weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anchor, and with a little ſail ſtood firſt to the ſouthward, and afterwards edging away to the weſtward, got once more out of danger. At ſunſet we anchored in ten fathom, with a ſandy bottom, having a freſh gale at E. S. E.</p>
                        <p>At ſix in the morning we weighed again and ſtood weſt, having, as uſual, firſt ſent a boat ahead to ſound. I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:013324_0445_0F90F241B2761B28"/>
to ſteer N. W. till I had made the ſouth coaſt of New Guinea, deſigning, if poſſible, to touch upon it; but upon meeting with theſe ſhoals, I altered my courſe, in hopes of finding a clearer channel, and deeper water. In this I ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, for by noon our depth of water was gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to ſeventeen fathom. Our latitude was now by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation 10° 10′ S.; and our longitude 220° 12′ W. No land was in ſight. We continued to ſteer weſt till ſun-ſet, our depth of water being from twenty-ſeven to twenty-three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom: we then ſhortened fail, and kept upon a wind all night: four hours on one tack, and four on another. At day-light, we made all the ſail we could, and ſteered W. N. W. till eight o'clock, and then N. W. At noon, our lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude by obſervation was 9° 56′ S.; longitude 221° W.; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation 2° 30′ E. We continued our N. W. courſe till ſunſet, when we again ſhortened ſail, and hauled cloſe upon a wind to the northward: our depth of water was twenty-one fathom. At eight, we tacked and ſtood to the ſouthward till twelve; then ſtood to the northward with little ſail till day-light: our ſoundings were from twenty-five to ſeventeen fathom, the water growing gradually ſhallow as we ſtood to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. At this time we made ſail and ſtood to the north, in order to make the land of New Guinea: from the time of our making ſail till noon, the depth of water gradually decreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſeventeen to twelve fathom, with a ſtoney and ſhelly bottom. Our latitude by obſervation was now 8° 52′ S. which is in the ſame parallel as that in which the ſouthern parts of New Guinea are laid down in the charts; but there are only two points ſo far to the ſouth, and I reckoned that we were a degree to the weſtward of them both, and therefore did not ſee the land which trends more to the northward. We found the ſea here to be in many parts covered with a brown ſcum, ſuch as ſailors generally call ſpawn. When I firſt ſaw it, I was alarmed, fearing that we were among ſhoals; but upon ſounding, we found the ſame depth of water as in other places. This ſcum was examined both by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, but they could not determine what it was: it was formed of innumerable ſmall particles, not more than half a line in length, each of which in the microſcope appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſiſt of thirty or forty tubes; and each tube was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided through its whole length by ſmall partitions into many cells, like the tubes of the conferva: they were ſuppoſed to belong to the vegetable kingdom, becauſe upon burning them they produced no ſmell like that of an animal ſubſtance. The ſame appearance had been obſerved upon the coaſt of Brazil and New Holland, but never at any conſiderable diſtance from the ſhore. In the evening a ſmall bird hovered about the ſhip, and at night, ſettling among the rigging, was taken,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:013324_0446_0F90F24274B38FD8"/>
It proved to be exactly the ſame bird which Dampier has deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, and of which he has given a rude figure, by the name of a Noddy from New Holland. [See his Voyages, vol. iii. p. 98. Tab. of Birds, Fig. 5.]</p>
                        <p>We continued ſtanding to the northward with a freſh gale at E. by E. and S. E. till ſix in the evening, having very irregular ſoundings, the depth changing at once from twenty-four fathom to ſeven. At four, we had ſeen the land from the maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, bearing N. W. by N.; it appeared to be very low, and to ſtretch from W. N. W. to N. N. E. diſtant four or five leagues. We now hauled cloſe upon a wind till ſeven, then tacked and ſtood to the ſouthward till twelve, at which time we wore and ſtood to the northward till four in the morning, then laid the head of the veſſel off till day-light, when we again ſaw the land, and ſtood in N. N. W. directly for it, with a freſh gale at E. by S. Our ſoundings during the night were very irregular from ſeven to five fathom, ſuddenly chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from deep to ſhallow, and from ſhallow to deep, without in the leaſt correſponding with our diſtance from the land. At half an hour after ſix in the morning a ſmall low iſland which lay at the diſtance of about a league from the main, bore N. by W. diſtant five miles: this iſland lies in latitude 8° 13′ S. longitude 221° 25′ W.; and I find it laid down in the chart by the names of Bartholomew and Whermoyſen. We now ſteered N. W. by W. W. N. W. W. by N. W. by S. and S. W. by W. as we found the land lie, with from 5 to 9 fathom, and though we reckoned we were not more than four leagues from it, yet it was ſo low and level that we could but juſt ſee it from the deck. It appeared however to be well covered with wood, and among other trees, we thought we could diſtinguiſh the cocoa-nut. We ſaw ſmoke in ſeveral places, and therefore knew there were inhabitants. At noon we were about three leagues from the land; the weſtermoſt part of which that was in ſight bore S. 79° W. Our latitude by obſervation was 8° 19′ S. and longitude 221° 44′ W. The iſland of St. Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew bore N. 74 E. diſtant 20 miles.</p>
                        <p>After ſteering S. W. by W. ſix miles, we had ſhoal water on our ſtarboard bow, which I ſent the yawl to found, and at the ſame time hauled off upon a wind till four o'clock, and though during that time we had run ſix miles, we had not deepened our water an inch. I then edged away S. W. four miles more; but finding it ſtill ſhoal water, I brought to and called the boats aboard. At this time, being between three and four leagues from the ſhore, and the yawl having found only three fathom water in the place to which I had ſent her to ſound, I hauled off cloſe upon a wind, and weathered the ſhoal about half a mile.</p>
                        <p>Between one and two o'clock, we paſſed a bay or inlet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:013324_0447_0F90F24350C13EE0"/>
which lies a ſmall iſland that ſeems to ſhelter it from the ſoutherly winds; but I very much doubt whether there is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient depth of water behind it for ſhipping. I could not attempt to determine the queſtion, becauſe the S. E, trade wind blows right into the bay, and we had not as yet had any breeze from the land.</p>
                        <p>We ſtretched off to ſea till twelve o'clock, when we were about eleven leagues from the land, and had deepened our water to twenty-nine fathom. We now tacked and ſtood in till five in the morning; when, being in ſix fathom and an half, we tacked and laid the head of the veſſel off till day-light, when we ſaw the land, bearing N. W. by W. at about the diſtance of four leagues. We now made ſail, and ſteered firſt W. S. W. then W. by S.; but coming into five fathom and an a half, we hauled off S. W. till we deepened our water to eight fathom, and then kept away W. by S. and W. having nine fathom, and the land juſt in ſight from the deck; we judged it to be about four leagues diſtant, and it was ſtill very low and woody. Great quantities of the brown ſcum continued to appear upon the water, and the ſailors, having given up the notion of its being ſwamp, found a new name for it, and called it Sea-ſaw-duſt. At noon, our latitude by obſervation was 8° 30′ S.; our longitude 222° 34′ W.; and Saint Bartholomew's iſle bore N. 69 E. diſtant ſeventy-four miles.</p>
                        <p>As all this coaſt appears to have been very minutely examined by the Dutch, it is ſufficient to ſay, that we continued our courſe to the northward with very ſhallow water, upon a bank of mud, at ſuch a diſtance from the ſhore as that it could ſcarcely be ſeen from the ſhip, till the 3d of September. During this time we made many attempts to get near enough to go on ſhore, but without ſucceſs; and having now loſt ſix days of fair wind, at a time when we knew the ſouth eaſt monſoon to be nearly at an end, we began to be impatient of farther delay, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to run the ſhip in as near to the ſhore as poſſible, and then land with the pinnace, while ſhe kept plying off and on, to examine the produce of the country, and the diſpoſition of the inhabitants. For the two laſt days we had early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a light breeze from the ſhore, which was ſtrongly impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the fragrance of the trees, ſhrubs, and herbage, that covered it, the ſmell being ſomething like that of Gum Benjamin. On the 3d of September, at day-break, we ſaw the land extending from N. by E. to S. E. at about four leagues diſtance, and we then kept ſtanding in for it with a freſh gale at E. S. E. and E. by S. till nine o'clock, when being within about three or four miles of it, and in three fathom water, we brought to. The pinnace being hoiſted out, I ſet off from the ſhip with the boat's crew, accompanied by Mr. Banks, who alſo took his ſervants, and Dr. Solander, being in all twelve

                           </gap>; we rowed directly towards to the ſhore, but the water was ſo ſhallow that we could not reach it by about two hundred yards: we waded however the reſt of the way, having left two of the ſeamen to take care of the boat. Hitherto we had ſeen no ſigns of inhabitants at this place; but as ſoon as we got aſhore we diſcovered the prints of human feet, which could not long have been impreſſed upon the ſand, as they were below high-water mark: we therefore concluded that the people were at no great diſtance, and, as a thick wood came down within a hundred yards of the water, we thought it neceſſary to proceed with caution, leſt we ſhould fall into an ambuſcade and our retreat to the boat be cut off. We walked along the ſkirts of the wood, and at the diſtance of about two hundred yards from the place where we landed, we came to a grove of cocoa-nut trees, which ſtood upon the banks of a little brook of brackiſh water. The trees were of a ſmall growth, but well hung with fruit; and near them was a ſhed or hut, which had been covered with their leaves, though moſt of them were now fallen off: about the hut lay a great number of the ſhells of the fruit, ſome of which appeared to be juſt freſh from the tree. We looked at the fruit very wiſhfully, but not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſafe to climb, we were obliged to leave it without taſting a ſingle nut. At a little diſtance from this place we found plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and a bread-fruit tree, but it had nothing upon it; and having now advanced about a quarter of a mile from the boat, three Indians ruſhed out of the wood with a hideous ſhout, at about the diſtance of a hundred yards; and as they ran towards us, the foremoſt threw ſomething out of his hand, which flew on one ſide of him, and burnt exactly like gunpowder, but made no report: the other two inſtantly threw their lances at us; and, as no time was now to be loſt, we diſcharged our pieces, which were loaded with ſmall ſhot. It is probable that they did not feel the ſhot, for though they halted a moment, they did not retreat; and a third dart was thrown at us. As we thought their farther approach might be prevented with leſs riſk of life, than it would coſt to defend ourſelves againſt their attack if they ſhould come nearer, we loaded our pieces with ball, and fired a ſecond time: by this diſcharge it is probable that ſome of them were wounded; yet we had the ſatisfaction to ſee that they all ran away with great agility. As I was not diſpoſed forcibly to invade this country, either to gratify our appetites or our curioſity, and perceived that nothing was to be done upon friendly terms, we improved this interval, in which the deſtruction of the natives was no longer neceſſary to our own defence, and with all expedition returned towards our boat. As we were advancing along the ſhore, we perceived that the two men on board made ſignals that more Indians were
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:013324_0449_0F9050132F0D6518"/>
coming down; and before we got into the water we ſaw ſeveral of them coming round a point at the diſtance of about five hundred yards; it is probable that they had met with the three who firſt attacked us; for as ſoon as they ſaw us they halted, and ſeemed to wait till their main body ſhould come up. We entered the water, and waded towards the boat; and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at their ſtation, without giving us any interruption. As ſoon as we were aboard we rowed abreaſt of them, and their number then appeared to be between ſixty and a hundred. We now took a view of them at our leiſure; they made much the ſame appearance as the New Hollanders, being nearly of the ſame ſtature, and having their hair ſhort cropped: like them alſo they were all ſtark naked, but we thought the colour of their ſkin was not quite ſo dark; this however might perhaps be merely the effect of their not being quite ſo dirty. All this while they were ſhouting defiance, and letting off their fires by four or five at a time. What theſe fires were, or for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe intended, we could not imagine: thoſe who diſcharged them had in their hands a ſhort piece of ſtick, poſſibly a hollow cane, which they ſwung ſideways from them, and we imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſaw fire and ſmoke, exactly reſembling thoſe of a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and of no longer duration. This wonderful phaenomenon was obſerved from the ſhip, and the deception was ſo great that the people on board thought they had fire-arms; and in the boat, if we had not been ſo near as that we muſt have heard the report, we ſhould have thought they had been firing volleys. After we had looked at them attentively ſome time, without taking any notice of their flaſhing and vociferation, we fired ſome muſquets over their heads: upon hearing the balls rattle among the trees, they walked leiſurely away, and we returned to the ſhip. Upon examining the weapons they had thrown at us, we found them to be light darts, about four feet long, very ill made, of a reed or bamboo cane, and pointed with hard wood, in which there were many barbs. They were diſcharged with great force; for though we were at ſixty yards diſtance, they went beyond us, but in what manner we could not exactly ſee: poſſibly they might be ſhot with a bow; but we ſaw no bows among them when we ſurveyed them from the boat, and we were in general of opinion that they were thrown with a ſtick, in the manner practiſed by the New Hollanders.</p>
                        <p>This place lies in the latitude of 6° 15′ S. and about ſixty-five leagues to the N. E. of Port Saint Auguſtine, or Walche Caep, and is near what is called C. de la Colta de St. Bonaventura. The land here, like that in every other part of the coaſt is very low, but covered with a luxuriance of wood and herbage that can ſcarcely be conceived. We ſaw the cocoa-nut, the bread-fruit, and the plantain tree, all flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a ſtate of the higheſt perfection, though the cocoa-nuts
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:013324_0450_0F90EC996EF08678"/>
were green, and the bread-fruit not in ſeaſon; beſides moſt of the trees, ſhrubs, and plants that are common to the South Sea iſlands, New Zealand, and New Holland.</p>
                        <p>Soon after our return to the ſhip, we hoiſted in the boat and made ſail to the weſtward, being reſolved to ſpend no more time upon this coaſt, to the great ſatisfaction of a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable majority of the ſhip's company. But I am ſorry to ſay that I was ſtrongly urged by ſome of the officers to ſend a party of men aſhore, and cut down the cocoa-nut trees for the ſake of the fruit. This I peremptorily refuſed, as equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and cruel. The natives had attacked us merely for landing upon their coaſt, when we attempted to take nothing away, and it was therefore morally certain that they would have made a vigorous effort to defend their property if it had been invaded, in which caſe many of them muſt have fallen a ſacrifice to our attempt, and perhaps alſo ſome of our own people. I ſhould have regretted the neceſſity of ſuch a meaſure, if I had been in want of the neceſſaries of life; and certainly it would have been highly criminal when nothing was to be obtained but two or three hundred of green cocoa-nuts, which would at moſt have procured us a mere tranſient gratification. I might indeed have proceeded farther along the coaſt to the northward and weſtward, in ſearch of a place where the ſhip might have lain ſo near the ſhore as to cover the people with her guns when they landed; but this would have obviated only part of the miſchief, and though it might have ſecured us, it would probab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the very act have been fatal to the natives. Beſides, we had reaſon to think that before ſuch a place would have been found, we ſhould have been carried ſo far to the weſtward as to have been obliged to go to Batavia, on the north ſide of Java; which I did not think ſo ſafe a paſſage as to the ſouth of Java, through the Streights of Sunday: the ſhip alſo was ſo leaky that I doubted whether it would not be neceſſary to heave her down at Batavia, which was another reaſon for making the beſt of our way to that place; eſpecially as no diſcovery could be expected in ſeas which had already been navigated, and where every coaſt had been laid down by the Dutch geographers. The Spaniards indeed, as well as the Dutch, ſeem to have circum-navigated all the iſlands in New Guinea, as almoſt every place that is diſtinguiſhed in the chart has a name in both lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages. The charts with which I compared ſuch part of this coaſt as I viſited, are bound up with a French work, intitled, "Hiſtoire des Navigationes aux Terres Auſtrales," which was publiſhed in 1756, and I found them tolerably exact; yet I know not by whom, nor when they were taken: and though New Holland and New Guinea are in them repreſented as two diſtinct countries, the very hiſtory in which they are bound up, leaves it in doubt. I pretend however to no more merit
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:013324_0451_0F90F244B0983368"/>
in this part of the voyage, than to have eſtabliſhed the fact beyond all controverſy.</p>
                        <p>As the two countries lie very near each other, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſpace is full of iſlands, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that they were both peopled from one common ſtock: yet no intercourſe appears to have been kept up between them; for if there had, the cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, plantains, &amp; other fruits of New Guinea, which are equally neceſſary for the ſupport of life, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have been tranſplanted to New Holland, whare no traces of them are to be found. The Author of the "Hiſtoire des Navigationes aux Terres Auſtrales," in his account of La Maire's voyage, has given a vocabulary of the language that is ſpoken in an iſland near New Britain, and we find, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring that vocabulary with the words which we learnt in New Holland, that the languages are not the ſame. If therefore it ſhould appear, that the languages of New Britain and New Guinea are the ſame, there will be reaſon to ſuppoſe that New Britain and New Guinea were peopled from a common ſtock; but that the inhabitants of New Holland had a different origin, notwithſtanding the proximity of the countries.</p>

                        <p>WE made ſail, from noon on Monday the 3d to noon on Tueſday the 4th, ſtanding to the weſtward, and all the time kept in ſoundings, having from fourteen to thirty fathom; not regular, but ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs. At noon on the 4th, we were in fourteen fathom, and latitude 6° 44′ S., longitude 223° 51′ W.; our courſe and diſtance ſince the 3d at noon, were S. 76 W. one hundred and twenty miles to the weſtward. At noon on the 5th of September, we were in lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 7° 25′ S., longitude 225° 41′ W.; having been in ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the whole time from ten to twenty fathom.</p>
                        <p>At half an hour after one in the morning of the next day, we paſſed a ſmall iſland which bore from us N. N. W. diſtant between three and four miles; and at day-light we diſcovered another low iſland, extending from N. N. W. to N. N. E. diſtant about two or three leagues. Upon this iſland, which did not appear to be very ſmall, I believe I ſhould have landed to examine its produce, if the wind had not blown too freſh to admit of it. When we paſſed this iſland we had only ten fathom water, with a rocky bottom; and therefore I was afraid of running down to leeward, leſt I ſhould meet with ſhoal water
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:013324_0452_0F90F2465C672DE0"/>
and foul ground. Theſe iſlands have no place in the charts except they are the Arrou iſlands; and if theſe, they are laid down much too far from New Guinea. I found the ſouth part of them to lie in latitude 7° 6′ S., longitude 225° W.</p>
                        <p>We continued to ſteer W. S. W. at the rate of four miles and an half an hour, till ten o'clock at night, when we had forty-two fathom, at eleven we thirty-ſeven, at twelve forty-five, at one in the morning forty-nine, and at three 120, after which we had no ground. At day-light, we made all the ſail we could, and at ten o'clock, ſaw land, extending from N. N. W. to W. by N. diſtant between five and ſix leagues: at noon, it bore from N. to W. and at about the ſame diſtance: it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be level, and of a moderate height: by our diſtance from New Guinea, it ought to have been part of the Arrou Iſlands, but it lies a degree farther to the ſouth than any of theſe iſlands are laid down in the charts; and by the latitude ſhould be Timor Laoet: we ſounded, but had no ground with fifty fathom.</p>
                        <p>As I was not able to ſatisfy myſelf from any chart, what land it was that I ſaw to leeward, and fearing that it might trend away more ſoutherly, the weather alſo being ſo hazy that we could not ſee far, I ſteered S. W. and by four had loſt ſight of the iſland. I was now ſure that no part of it lay to the ſouthward of 8° 15′ S. and continued ſtanding to the S. W. with an eaſy ſail, and a freſh breeze at S. E. by E. and E. S. E.: we ſounded every hour, but had no bottom with 120 fathom.</p>
                        <p>At day-break in the morning, we ſteered W. S. W. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards W. by S. which by noon brought us into the latitude of 9° 30′ S. longitude 229° 34′ W. and by our run from New Guinea, we ought to have been within ſight of Weaſel Iſles, which in the charts are laid down at the diſtance of twenty or twenty-five leagues from the coaſt of New Holland; we how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſaw nothing, and therefore they muſt have been placed erroneouſly; nor can this be thought ſtrange, when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that not only theſe iſlands, but the coaſt which bounds this ſea, have been diſcovered and explored by different people, and at different times, and the charts upon which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated, put together by others, perhaps at the diſtance of more than a century after the diſcoveries had been made; not to mention that the diſcoverers themſelves had not all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites for keeping an accurate journal, of which thoſe of the preſent age are poſſeſſed.</p>
                        <p>We continued onr courſe, ſteering W. till the evening of the 8th, when the variation of the compaſs, by ſeveral azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muths, was 12′ W. and by the amplitude 5′ W. At noon, on the 9th, our latitude, by obſervation, was 9° 46′ S., longitude 232° 7′ W. For the laſt two days we had ſteered due W. yet, by obſervation, we made ſixteen miles ſouthing, ſix miles from
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:013324_0453_0F90F24A88A2E060"/>
noon on the 6th to noon on the 7th, and ten miles from noon on the 7th to noon on the 8th, by which it appeared that there was a current ſetting to the ſouthward. At ſunſet, we found the variation to be 2 W. and at the ſame time, ſaw an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of very high land bearing N. W.</p>
                        <p>In the morning of the 10th, we ſaw clearly that what had appeared to be land the night before, was Timor. At noon, our latitude, by obſervation, was 10° 1′ S. which was fifteen miles to the ſouthward of that given by the log; our longitude, by obſervation, was 233° 27′ W. We ſteered N. W. in order to obtain a more diſtinct view of the land in ſight, till four o'clock in the morning of the 11th, when the wind came to the N. W. and W. with which we ſtood to the ſouthward till nine, when we tacked and ſtood N. W. having the wind now at W. S. W. At ſun-riſe, the land had appeared to extend from W. N. W. to N. E. and at noon, we could ſee it extend to the weſtward as far as W. by S. ½ S. but no farther to the eaſtward than N. by E. We were now well aſſured, that as the firſt land we had ſeen was Timor, the laſt iſland we had paſſed was Timor Laoet, or Laut. Laoet, is a word in the language of Malaca, ſignifying Sea, and this iſland was named by the inhabitants of that country. The ſouth part of it lies in latitude 8° 15′ S. longitude 228° 10′ W. but in the charts the ſouth point is laid down in various latitudes, from 8° 30′ to 9° 30′: it is indeed poſſible that the land we ſaw might be ſome other iſland, but the preſumption to the contrary is very ſtrong, for if Timor Laut had lain where it is placed in the charts, we muſt have ſeen it there. We were now in latitude 9° 37′ S., longitude, by an obſervation of the ſun and moon, 233° 54′ W. we were the day before in 233° 27′; the difference is 27, exactly the ſame that was given by the log: this, however, is a degree of accuracy in obſervation that is ſeldom to be expected. In the afternoon, we ſtood in ſhore till eight in the evening, when we tacked and ſtood off, being at the diſtance of about three leagues from the land, which at ſun-ſet extended from S. W. ½ W. to N. E.: at this time we ſounded, and had no ground with 140 fathom. At midnight, having but little wind, we tacked and ſtood in, and at noon the next day, our latitude, by obſervation, was 9° 36′ S. This day, we ſaw ſmoke on ſhore in ſeveral places, and had ſeen many fires during the night. The land appeared to be very high, riſing in gradual ſlopes one above another: the hills were in general covered with thick woods, but among them we could diſtinguiſh naked ſpots of a conſiderable extent, which had the appearance of having been cleared by art. At five o'clock in the afternoon, we were within a mile and an half of the ſhore, in ſixteen fathom water, and abreaſt of a ſmall inlet into the low land, which lies in latitude 9° 34′ S. and probably is the ſame that
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:013324_0454_0F90F24B70F43230"/>
Dampier entered with his boat, for it did not ſeem to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient depth of water for a ſhip. The land here anſwered well to the deſcription that he has given of it: cloſe to the beach it was covered with high ſpiry trees, which he mentions as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the appearance of pines; behind theſe there ſeemed to be ſalt water creeks, and many mangroves, interſperſed however with cocoa-nut trees: the flat land at the beach appeared in ſome places to extend inward two or three miles before the riſe of the firſt hill; in this part, however, we ſaw no appearance of plantations or houſes, but great fertility, and from the number of fires, we judged that the place muſt be well peopled.</p>
                        <p>When we had approached within a mile and an half of the ſhore, we tacked and ſtood off, and the extreams of the coaſt then extended from N. E. by E. to W. by S. ½ S. The ſouth weſterly extremity was a low point, diſtant from us about three leagues. While we were ſtanding in for the ſhore, we ſounded ſeveral times, but had no ground till we came within about two miles and a half, and then we had five and twenty fathom, with a ſoft bottom. After we had tacked, we ſtood off till midnight, with the wind at S.; we then tacked and ſtood two hours to the weſtward, when the wind veered to S. W. and W. S. W. and we then ſtood to the ſouthward again. In the morning, we found the variation to be 1° 10′ W. by the amplitude, and by the azimuth 1° 27′. At noon, our latitude was, by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 9° 45′ S. our longitude 234° 12′ W.; we were then about ſeven leagues diſtant from the land, which extended from N. 31 E. to W. S. W. ½ W.</p>
                        <p>With light land breezes from W. by N. for a few hours in a morning, and ſea breezes from S. S. W. and S. we advanced to the weſtward but ſlowly. At noon on the 14th, we were between ſix and ſeven leagues from the land, which extended from N. by E. to S. 78 W.; we ſtill ſaw ſmoke in many places by day, and fire by night, both upon the low land and the mountains beyond it. We continued ſteering along the ſhore, till the morning of the 15th, the land ſtill appearing hilly, but not ſo high as it had been: the hills in general came quite down to the ſea, and where they did not, we ſaw inſtead of flats and mangrove land, immenſe groves of cocoa-nut trees, reaching about a mile up from the beach: there the plantations and houſes commenced, and appeared to be innumerable. The houſes were ſhaded by groves of the fan palm, or <hi>boraſſus,</hi> and the plantations, which were incloſed by a fence, reached almoſt to the tops of the higheſt hills. We ſaw however neither people nor cattle, though our glaſſes were continually employed, at which we were not a little ſurpriſed.</p>
                        <p>We continued our courſe, with little variation, till nine o'clock in the morning of the 16th, when we ſaw the ſmall iſland called ROTTE; and at noon, the iſland SEMAU, lying off the ſouth end of Timor, bore N. W.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="166" facs="unknown:013324_0455_0F90F24D1287A318"/>
Dampier, who has given a large deſcription of the iſland of Timor, ſays, that it is ſeventy leagues long, and ſixteen broad, and that it lies nearly N. E. and S. W. I found the eaſt ſide of it to lie neareſt N. E. by E. and S. W. by W. and the ſouth end to lie in latitude 10° 23′ S. longitude 236° 5′ W. We ran about forty-five leagues along the eaſt ſide, and found the navigation altogether free from danger. The land which is bounded by the ſea, except near the ſouth end, is low for two or three miles within the beach, and in general interſected by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>lt creeks: behind the low land are mountains, which riſe one above another to a conſiderable height. We ſteered W. N. W. till two in the afternoon, when, being within a ſmall diſtance of the north end of Rotte, we hauled up N. N. W. in order to go between it and Semau: after ſteering three leagues upon this courſe, we edged away N. W. and W. and by ſix we were clear of all the iſlands. At this time, the ſouth part of Semau, which lies in latitude 10° 15′ S. bore N. E. diſtant four leagues, and the iſland of Rotte extended as far to the ſouthward as S. 36 W. The north end of this iſland, and the ſouth end of Timor, lie N. ½ E. and S. ½ W. and are about three or four leagues diſtant from each other. At the weſt end of the paſſage between Rotte and Semau, are two ſmall iſlands, one of which lies near the Rotte ſhore, and the other off the ſouth weſt point of Semau: there is a good channel between them, about ſix miles broad, through which we paſſed. The iſle of Rotte has not ſo lofty and mountainous an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as Timor, though it is agreeably diverſified by hill and valley: on the north ſide, there are many ſandy beaches, near which grew ſome trees of the fan palm, but the far greater part was covered with a kind of bruſhy wood, that was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaves. The appearance of Semau was nearly the ſame with that of Timor, but not quite ſo high. About ten o'clock at night, we obſerved a phaenomenon in the heavens, which in many particulars reſembled the aurora borealis, and in others was very different: it conſiſted of a dull reddiſh light, and reached about twenty degrees above the horizon: its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was very different at different times, but it was never leſs than eight or ten points of the compaſs: through, and out of this, paſſed rays of light of a brighter colour, which vaniſhed, and were renewed nearly in the ſame time as thoſe of the auro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra borealis, but had no degree of the tremulous or vibratory motion which is obſerved in that phaenomenon: the body of it bore S. S. E. from the ſhip, and it continued, without any diminution of its brightneſs, till twelve o'clock, when we retired to ſleep, but how long afterwards, I cannot tell.</p>
                        <p>Being clear of all the iſlands, which are laid down in the maps we had on board, between Timor and Java, we ſteered a weſt courſe till ſix o'clock the next morning, when we
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:013324_0456_0F90501352200F78"/>
unexpectedly ſaw an iſland bearing weſt ſouth weſt, and at firſt I thought we had made a new diſcovery. We ſteered directly for it, and by ten o'clock were cloſe in with the north ſide of it, where we ſaw houſes, cocoa-nut trees, and, to our very agreeable ſurpriſe, numerous flocks of ſheep. This was a temptation not to be reſiſted by people in our ſituation, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as many of us were in a bad ſtate of health, and many ſtill repining at my not having touched at Timor: it was therefore ſoon determined to attempt a commerce with people who appeared to be ſo well able to ſupply our many neceſſities, and remove at once the ſickneſs and diſcontent that had got footing among us. The pinnace was hoiſted out, and Mr. Gore, the Second Lieutenant, ſent to ſee if there was any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place to land, taking with him ſome trifles, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the natives, if any of them ſhould appear. While he was gone, we ſaw from the ſhip two men on horſeback, who ſeemed to be riding upon the hills for their amuſement, and often ſtopped to look at the ſhip. By this we knew that the place had been ſettled by Europeans, and hoped, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſagreeable circumſtances which always attend the firſt eſtabliſhment of commerce with ſavages, would be avoided. In the mean time, Mr. Gore landed in a ſmall ſandy cove, near ſome houſes, and was met by eight or ten of the natives, who, as well in their dreſs as their perſons, very much reſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Malays: they were without arms, except the knives which it is their cuſtom to wear in their girdles, and one of them had a jack aſs with him: they courteouſly invited him aſhore, and converſed with him by ſigns, but very little of the meaning of either party could be underſtood by the other. In a ſhort time he returned with this report, and, to our great mortification, added, that there was no anchorage for the ſhip. I ſent him however a ſecond time, with both money and goods, that he might, if poſſible, purchaſe ſome refreſhments, at leaſt for the ſick; and Dr. Solander went in the boat with him. In the mean time I kept ſtanding on and off with the ſhip, which at this time was within about a mile of the ſhore. Before the boat could land, we ſaw two other horſemen, one of whom was in a compleat European dreſs, confiding of a blue coat, a white waiſtcoat, and a laced hat: theſe people, when the boat came to the ſhore, took little notice of her, but ſauntered about, and ſeemed to look with great curioſity at the ſhip. We ſaw however other horſemen, and a great number of perſons on foot, gather round our people, and, to our great ſatisfaction, perceived ſeveral cocoa-nuts carried into the boat, from which we concluded that peace and commerce were eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed between us.</p>
                        <p>After the boat had been aſhore about an hour and a half, ſhe made the ſignal for having intelligence that there was a bay to leeward where we might anchor: we ſtood away di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:013324_0457_0F90501414449170"/>
for it, and the boat following, ſoon came on board. The Lieutenant told us, that he had ſeen ſome of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal people, who were dreſſed in fine linen, and had chains of gold round their necks: he ſaid, that he had not been able to trade, becauſe the owner of the cocoa-nuts was abſent, but that about two dozen had been ſent to the boat as a preſent, and that ſome linen had been accepted in return. The people, to give him the information that he wanted, drew a map upon the ſand, in which they made a rude repreſentation of a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to leeward, and a town near it: they alſo gave him to underſtand, that ſheep, hogs, fowls, and fruit might there be procured in great plenty. Some of them frequently pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the word Portugueſe, and ſaid ſomething of Larntuca, upon the iſland of Ende: from this circumſtance, we conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured that there were Portugueſe ſomewhere upon the iſland, and a Portugueſe who was in our boat, attempted to converſe with the Indians in that language, but ſoon found that they knew only a word or two of it by rote: one of them however, when they were giving our people to underſtand that there was a town near the harbour to which they had directed us, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that as a token of going right, we ſhould ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, which he expreſſed by croſſing his fingers, and the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe inſtantly conceived that he meant to expreſs a croſs. Juſt as our people were putting off, the horſeman in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean dreſs came up, but the officer not having his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion about him, thought it beſt to decline a conference.</p>
                        <p>At ſeven o'clock in the evening, we came to an anchor in the bay to which we had been directed, at about the diſtance of a mile from the ſhore, in thirty-eight fathom water, with a clear ſandy bottom. The north point of the bay bore N. 30 E. diſtant two miles and an half, and the ſouth point, or weſt end of the iſland, bore S. 63 W. Juſt as we got round the north point, and entered the bay, we diſcovered a large In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian town or village, upon which we ſtood on, hoiſting a jack on the fore top-maſt head: ſoon after, to our great ſurprize, Dutch colours were hoiſted in the town, and 3 guns fired; we ſtood on, however, till we had ſoundings, and then anchored.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as it was light in the morning, we ſaw the ſame colours hoiſted upon the beach, abreaſt of the ſhip; ſuppoſing therefore that the Dutch had a ſettlement here, I ſent Lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Gore aſhore, to wait upon the Governor, or the chief perſon reſiding upon the ſpot, and acquaint him who we were, and for what purpoſe we had touched upon the coaſt. As ſoon as he came aſhore, he was received by a guard of between twenty and thirty Indians, armed with muſkets, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to the town, where the colours had been hoiſted the night before, carrying with them thoſe that had been hoiſted upon the beach, and marching without any military re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. As ſoon as he arrived, he was introduced to the
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:013324_0458_0F90F24DB05AFF70"/>
or King of the iſland, and by a Portugueſe interpreter, told him, that the ſhip was a man of war belonging to the King of Grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>-Britain, and that ſhe had many ſick on board, for whom he wanted to purchaſe ſuch refreſhments as the iſland afforded. His Majeſty replied, that he was willing to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply us with whatever we wanted, but, that being in alliance with the Dutch Eaſt India Company, he was not at liberty to trade with any other people, without having firſt procured their conſent, for which however, he ſaid he would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately apply to a Dutchman, who belonged to the company, and who was the only white man upon the iſland. To this man, who reſided at ſome diſtance, a letter was immediately diſpatched, acquainting him with our arrival and requeſt: in the mean time, Mr. Gore diſpatched a meſſenger to me, with an account of his ſituation, and the ſtate of the treaty. In about three hours the Dutch reſident anſwered the letter that had been ſent him, in perſon: he proved to be a native of Saxony, and his name is Johan Chriſtopher Lange, and the ſame perſon whom we had ſeen on horſeback in a European dreſs: he behaved with great civility to Mr. Gore, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him, that we were at liberty to purchaſe of the natives whatever we pleaſed. After a ſhort time he expreſſed a deſire of coming on board, ſo did the King alſo, and ſeveral of his attendants: Mr. Gore intimated that he was ready to attend them, but they deſired that two of our people might be left aſhore as hoſtages, and in this alſo they were indulged.</p>
                        <p>About two o'clock, they all came aboard the ſhip, and our dinner being ready, they accepted our invitation to partake of it: I expected them immediately to ſit down, but the King ſeemed to heſitate, and at laſt, with ſome confuſion, ſaid he did not imagine that we, who were white men, would ſuffer him, who was of a different colour, to ſit down in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; a compliment ſoon removed his ſcruples, and we all ſat down together with great cheerfulneſs and cordiality: hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily we were at no loſs for interpreters, both Dr. Solander and Mr. Spo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Our dinner happened to be mutton, and the King expreſſed a deſire of having an Engliſh ſheep; we had but one left, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that was preſented to him: the facility with which this was procured, encouraged him to aſk for an Engliſh dog, and Mr. Banks politely gave up his greyhound: Mr. Lange then intimated that a ſpying-glaſs would be acceptable, and one was immediately put into his hand. Our gueſts then told us that the iſland abounded with buffaloes, ſheep, hogs, and fowls, plenty of which ſhould be driven down to the beach the next day, that we might purchaſe as many of them as we
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:013324_0459_0F90EC9A2F609210"/>
ſhould think fit: this put us all into high ſpirits, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor circulated rather faſter than either the Indians or the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xon could bear; they intimated their deſire to go away, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, before they were quite drunk, and were received upon deck, as they had been when they came on board, by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines under arms. The King expreſſed a curioſity to ſee them exerciſe, in which he was gratified, and they fired three rounds: he looked at them with great attention, and was much ſurpriſed at their regularity and expedition, eſpecially in cocking their pieces; the firſt time they did it, he ſtruck the ſide of the ſhip with a ſtick that he had in his hand, and cried out with great vehemence, that all the locks made but one click. They were diſmiſſed with many preſents, and when they went away ſaluted with nine guns: Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went aſhore with them; and as ſoon as they put off they gave us three cheers.</p>
                        <p>Our Gentlemen, when they came aſhore, walked up with them to the town, which conſiſts of many houſes, and ſome of them are large; they are however nothing more than a thatched roof, ſupported over a boarded floor, by pillars about four feet high. They produced ſome of their palm-wine, which was the freſh, unfermented juice of the tree; it had a ſweet, but not a diſagreeable taſte; and hopes were conceived that it might contribute to recover our ſick from the ſcurvy. Soon after it was dark, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander returned on board.</p>
                        <p>In the morning of the 19th, I went aſhore with Mr. Banks, and ſeveral of the officers and gentlemen, to return the king's viſit; but my chief buſineſs was to procure ſome of the buffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes, ſheep and fowls, which we had been told ſhould be driven down to the beach. We were greatly mortified to find that no ſteps had been taken to fulfill this promiſe; however, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the houſe of aſſembly, which with two or three more had been erected by the Dutch Eaſt India company, and are diſtinguiſhed from the reſt by two pieces of wood reſembling a pair of cow's horns, one of which is ſet up at each end of the ridge that terminates the roof; and theſe were certainly what the Indian intended to repreſent by croſſing his fingers, though our Portugueſe, who was a good Catholic, conſtrued the ſign into a croſs, which had perſuaded us that the ſettlement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his countrymen. In this place we met Mr. Lange, and the King, whoſe name was A Mado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ho Lomi Djara, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by many of the principal people. We told them that we had in the boat goods of various kinds, which we propoſed to barter for ſuch refreſhments as they would give us in exchange, and deſired leave to bring them on ſhore; which being granted, they were brought aſhore accordingly. We then attempted to ſettle the price of the buffaloes, ſheep, hogs, and other
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:013324_0460_0F90F2534E7BDAF0"/>
commodities which we propoſed to purchaſe, and for which we were to pay in money; but as ſoon as this was mentioned Mr. Lange left us, telling us that theſe preliminaries muſt be ſettled with the natives: he ſaid, however, that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a letter from the Governor of Concordia in Timor, the purport of which he would communicate to us when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
                        <p>As the morning was now far advanced, and we were very unwilling to return on board and eat ſalt proviſions, when ſo many delicacies ſurrounded us aſhore, we petitioned his Majeſty for liberty to purchaſe a ſmall hog and ſome rice, and to employ his ſubjects to dreſs them for us. He anſwered very graciouſly, that if we could eat victuals dreſſed by his ſubjects, which he could ſcarcely ſuppoſe, he would do himſelf the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of entertaining us. We expreſſed our gratitude, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent on board for liquors.</p>
                        <p>About five o'clock, dinner was ready; it was ſerved in ſix and thirty diſhes, or rather baſkets, containing alternately rice and pork; and three bowls of earthen ware, filled with the liquor in which the pork had been boiled: theſe were ranged upon the floor, and mats laid round them for us to ſit upon. We were then conducted by turns to a hole in the floor, near which ſtood a man with water in a veſſel, made of the leaves of the fan-palm, who aſſiſted us in waſhing our hands. When this was done, we placed ourſelves round the victuals, and waited for the King. As he did not come, we enquired for him, and were told that the cuſtom of the country did not permit the perſon who gave the entertainment to ſit down with his gueſts; but that, if we ſuſpected the victuals to be poiſoned, he would come and taſte it. We immediately declared that we had no ſuch ſuſpicion, and deſired that none of the rituals of hoſpitality might be violated on our account. The prime miniſter and Mr. Lange were of our party, and we made a moſt luxurious meal: we thought the pork and rice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and the broth not to be deſpiſed; but the ſpoons, which were made of leaves, were ſo ſmall that few of us had patience to uſe them. After dinner, our wine paſſed briſkly about, and we again enquired for our royal hoſt, thinking that though the cuſtom of this country would not allow him to eat with us, he might at leaſt ſhare in the jollity of our bottle; but he again excuſed himſelf, ſaying, that the maſter of a feaſt ſhould never be drunk, which there was no certain way to avoid but by not taſting the liquor. We did not however drink our wine where we had eaten our victuals; but as ſoon as we had dined made room for the ſeamen and ſervants, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately took our places: they could not diſpatch all that we had left, but the women who came to clear away the bowls and baſkets, obliged them to carry away with them what they
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:013324_0461_0F90F2583890C238"/>
had not eaten. As wine generally warms and opens the heart, we took an opportunity, when we thought its influence began to be felt, to revive the ſubject of the buffaloes and ſheep, of which we had not in all this time heard a ſyllable, though they were to have been brought down early in the morning. But our Saxon Dutchman, with great phlegm, began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to us the contents of the letter which he pretended to have received from the Governor of Concordia. He ſaid, that after acquainting him that a veſſel had ſteered from thence towards the iſland where we were now aſhore, it required him, if ſuch ſhip ſhould apply for proviſion in diſtreſs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her; but not to ſuffer her to ſtay longer than was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, nor to make any large preſents to the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior people, or to leave any with thoſe of ſuperior rank to be afterwards diſtributed among them: but he was graciouſly pleaſed to add, that we were at liberty to give beads and other trifles in exchange for petty civilities, and palm-wine.</p>
                        <p>It was the general opinion that this letter was a fiction; that the prohibitory orders were feigned with a view to get money from us for breaking them; and that by precluding our liberality to the natives, this man hoped more eaſily to turn it into another channel.</p>
                        <p>In the evening, we receiv'd intelligence from our trading-place that no buffaloes or hogs had been brought down, and only a few ſheep, which had been taken away before our people, who had ſent for money, could procure it. Some fowls however had been bought, and a large quantity of a kind of ſyrup made of the juice of the palm tree, which, though infinitely ſuperior to molaſſes or treacle, ſold at a very low price. We complained of our diſappointment to Mr. Lange, who had now another ſubterfuge; he ſaid, that if we had gone down to the beach ourſelves, we might have purchaſed what we pleaſed; but that the natives were afraid to take money of our people, left it ſhould be counterfeit. We could not but feel ſome indignation againſt a man who had concealed this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true; or alledged it, being falſe. I ſtarted up, however, and went immediately to the beach. but no cattle or ſheep were to be ſeen, nor were any at hand to be produced. While I was gone, Lange, who knew well enough that I ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no better than my people, told Mr. Banks that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were diſpleaſed at our not having offered gold for their ſtock; and that if gold was not offered, nothing would be bought. Mr. Banks did not think it worth his while to reply, but ſoon after roſe up, and we all returned on board, very much diſſatisfied with the iſſue of our negociations. During the courſe of the day, the King had promiſed that ſome cattle and ſheep ſhould be brought down in the morning, and had given a reaſon for our diſappointment ſomewhat more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:013324_0462_0F90F259C0C9D7E0"/>
he ſaid that the buffaloes were far up the country, and that there had not been time to bring them down to the beach.</p>
                        <p>The next morning we went aſhore again: Dr. Solander went up to the town to ſpeak to Lange, and I remained upon the beach, to ſee what could be done in the purchaſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. I found here an old Indian, who, as he appeared to have ſome authority, we had among ourſelves called the Prime Miniſter; to engage this man in our intereſt I preſented him with a ſpying-glaſs, but I ſaw nothing at market except one ſmall buffalo. I enquired the price of it, and was told five guineas: this was twice as much as it was worth; however, I offered three, which I could perceive the man who treated with me thought a good price; but he ſaid that he muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the King with what I had offered before he could take it. A meſſenger was immediately diſpatched to his Majeſty, who ſoon returned, and ſaid, that the buffalo would not be ſold for anything leſs than five guineas. This price I abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed to give; and another meſſenger was ſent away with an account of my refuſal: this meſſenger was longer ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent than the other, and while I was waiting for his return, I ſaw, to my great aſtoniſhment, Dr. Solander coming from the town, followed by above an hundred men, ſome armed with muſquets, and ſome with lances. When I enquired the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this hoſtile appearance, the Doctor told me, that Mr. Lange had interpreted to him a meſſage from the King, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that the people would not trade with us, becauſe we had refuſed to give them more than half the value of what they had to ſell; and that we ſhould not be permitted to trade upon any terms longer than this day. Beſides the officers who commanded the party, there came with it a man who was born at Timor, of Portugueſe parents, and who, as we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſcovered, was a kind of colleague to the Dutch fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; by this man what they pretended to be the King's order was delivered to me, of the ſame purport with that which Dr. Solander had received from Lange. We were all clearly of opinion that this was a mere artifice of the factors to extort money from us, for which we had been prepared by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a letter from Concordia; and while we were heſitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſtep to take, the Portugueſe, that he might the ſooner accompliſh his purpoſe, began to drive away the people who had brought down poultry and ſyrup, and others that were now coming in with buffaloes and ſheep. At this time, I glanced my eye upon the old man whom I had compliment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the morning with the ſpying-glaſs, and I thought, by his looks, that he did not heartily approve of what was doing; I therefore took him by the hand, and preſented him with an old broad ſword. This inſtantly turned the ſcale in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; he received the ſword with a tranſport of joy, and
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:013324_0463_0F905014A88E2FD8"/>
flouriſhing it over the buſy Portugueſe, who crouched like a fox to a lion, he made him, and the officer who commanded the party, ſit down upon the ground behind him: the people, who, whatever were the crafty pretences of theſe iniquitous factors for a Dutch company, were eager to ſupply us with whatever we wanted, and ſeemed alſo to be more deſirous of goods than money, inſtantly improved the advantage that had been procured them, and the market was ſtocked almoſt in an inſtant. To eſtabliſh a trade for buffaloes, however, which I moſt wanted, I found it neceſſary to give ten guineas for two, one of which weighed no more than a hundred and ſixty pounds; but I bought ſeven more much cheaper, and might afterwards have purchaſed as many as I pleaſed almoſt upon my own terms, for they were now driven down to the water-ſide in herds. In the firſt two that I bought ſo dear, Lange had certainly a ſhare, and it was in hopes to obtain part of the price of others, that he had pretended we muſt pay for them in gold. The natives however ſold what they afterwards brought down much to their ſatisfaction, without paying part of the price to him as a reward for exacting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from us. Moſt of the buffaloes that we bought, after our friend, the Prime Miniſter, had procured us a fair market, were ſold for a muſquet a piece, and at this price we might have bought as many as would have freighted our ſhip.</p>
                        <p>The refreſhments which we procured here, conſiſted of nine buffaloes, ſix ſheep, three hogs, thirty dozen of fowls, a few limes, and ſome cocoa-nuts; many dozen of eggs, half of which however proved to be rotten; a little garlic, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hundred gallons of palm-ſyrup.</p>

                        <p>THIS iſland is called by the natives SAVU; the middle of it lies in about the latitude 10° 35′ S., longitude 237° 30′ W.; and has in general been ſo little known that I never ſaw a map or chart in which it is clearly or accurately laid down. I have ſeen a very old one, in which it is called Sou, and confounded with Sandel Boſch. Rumphius mentions an iſland by the name of Saow; and he alſo ſays that it is the ſame which the Dutch call Sandel Boſch; but neither is this iſland, nor Timor, nor Rotte, nor indeed any one of the iſlands that we have ſeen in theſe ſeas, placed within a reaſonable diſtance of its true ſituation. It is about eight leagues long
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:013324_0464_0F90F25A7AF48780"/>
from eaſt to weſt; but what is its breadth, I do not know, as I ſaw only the north ſide. The harbour in which we lay is called Seba, from the diſtrict in which it lies: it is on the north weſt ſide of the iſland, and well ſheltered from the ſouth weſt trade wind, but it lies open to the north weſt. We were told, that there were two other bays where ſhips might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor; that the beſt, called Timo, was on the ſouth weſt ſide of the ſouth eaſt point: of the third we learnt neither the name nor ſituation. The ſea-coaſt, in general, is low; but in the middle of the iſland there are hills of a conſiderable height. We were upon the coaſt at the latter end of the dry ſeaſon, when there had been no rain for ſeven months; and we were told that when the dry ſeaſon continues ſo long, there is no running ſtream of freſh water upon the whole iſland, but only ſmall ſprings, which are at a conſiderable diſtance from the ſea-ſide: yet nothing can be imagined ſo beautiful as the proſpect of the country from the ſhip. The level ground next to the ſea-ſide was covered with cocoa-nut trees, and a kind of palm called <hi>Arecas;</hi> and beyond them the hills, which roſe in a gentle and regular aſcent, were richly clothed, quite to the ſummit, with plantations of the fan-palm, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an almoſt impenetrable grove. How much even this proſpect muſt be improved, when every foot of ground between the trees is covered with verdure, by maize, and millet and indico, can ſcarcely be conceived but by a powerful imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not unacquainted with the ſtatelineſs and beauty of the trees that adorn this part of the earth. The dry ſeaſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences in March or April, and ends in October or November.</p>
                        <p>The principal trees of this iſland, are the fan-palm, the cocoa-nut, tamarind, limes, oranges, and mangoes; the other vegetable productions are maize, Guinea corn, rice, millet, callevances, and water-melons. We ſaw alſo one ſugar-cane, and a few kinds of European garden-ſtuff; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly cellery, marjoram, fennel, and garlic. For the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of luxury, it has betele, areca, tobacco, cotton, indico, and a ſmall quantity of cinnamon, which ſeems to be planted here only for curioſity; and indeed we doubted whether it was the genuine plant, knowing that the Dutch are very careful not to truſt the ſpices out of their proper iſlands. There are however ſeveral kinds of fruit, beſides thoſe which have been already mentioned; particularly the ſweet ſop, which is well known to the Weſt Indians, and a ſmall oval fruit, called the <hi>Blimbi,</hi> both of which grow upon trees. The Blimbi is about three or four inches long, and in the middle about as thick as a man's finger, tapering towards each end: it is covered with a very think ſkin of a light green colour, and in the inſide are a few ſeeds diſpoſed in the form of a ſtar: its flavour is a light, clean, pleaſant acid, but it cannot be eaten raw; it is ſaid to

be excellent as a pickle; and ſtewed, it made a moſt agreeable four ſauce to our boiled diſhes.</p>
                        <p>The tame animals are buffaloes, ſheep, goats, hogs, fowls, pigeons, horſes, aſſes, dogs and cats; and of all theſe there is great plenty. The buffaloes differ very conſiderably from the horned cattle of Europe in ſeveral particulars; their ears are much larger, their ſkins are almoſt without hair, their horns are curved towards each other, but together <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>end di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly backwards, and they have no dewlaps. We ſaw ſeveral that were as big as a well grown European ox, and there muſt be ſome much larger; for Mr. Banks ſaw a pair of horns which meaſured from tip to tip three feet nine inches and an half, acroſs their wideſt diameter four feet one inch and an half, and in the whole ſweep of their ſemi-circle in front ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven feet ſix inches and a half. It muſt however be obſerved, that a buffalo here of any given ſize, does not weigh above half as much as an ox of the ſame ſize in England: thoſe that we gueſſed to weigh four hundred weight did not weigh more than two hundred and fifty; the reaſon is, that ſo late in the dry ſeaſon the bones are very thinly covered with fleſh: there is not an ounce of fat in a whole carcaſs, and the flanks are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally nothing but ſkin and bone: the fleſh however is well taſted and juicy, and I ſuppoſe better than the fleſh of an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ox would be if he was to ſtarve in this ſun-burnt country.</p>
                        <p>The horſes are from eleven to twelve hands high, but though they are ſmall, they are ſpirited and nimble, eſpecially in pacing, which is their common ſtep: the inhabitants ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ride them without a ſaddle, and with no better bridle than a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>. The ſheep are of the kind which in England are called Bengal ſheep, and differ from ours in many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. They are covered with hair inſtead of wool, their ears are very large, and hang down under their horns, and their noſes are arched; they are thought to have a general reſemblance to a goat, and for that reaſon are frequently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>cabritos:</hi> their fleſh we thought the worſt mutton we had ever eaten, being as lean as that of the buffaloes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flavour. The hogs, however, were ſome of the faſteſt that we had ever ſeen, though, as we were told, their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal food is the outſide huſks of rice, and the palm ſyrup diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in water. The fowls are chiefly of the game breed, and large, but the eggs are remarkably ſmall.</p>
                        <p>Of the fiſh which the ſea produces here, we know but little: turtles are ſometimes found upon the coaſt, and are by theſe people, as well as all others, conſidered as a dainty.</p>
                        <p>The people are rather under, than over the middling ſize; the women eſpecially are remarkably ſhort and ſquat built: their complexion is a dark brown, and their hair univerſally black and lank. We ſaw no difference in the colour of rich

and poor, though in the South Sea iſlands thoſe that were expoſed to the weather were almoſt as brown as the New Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, and the better ſort nearly as fair as the natives of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. The men are in general well-made, vigorous, and active, and have a greater variety in the make and diſpoſition of their features than uſual; the countenances of the women, on the contrary, are all alike.</p>
                        <p>The men faſten their hair up to the top of their heads with a comb, the women tie it behind in a club, which is very very far from becoming. Both ſexes eradicate the hair from under the arm, and the men do the ſame by their beards, for which purpoſe the better ſort always carry a pair of ſilver pincers hanging by a ſtring round their necks; ſome however ſuffer a very little hair to remain upon their upper lips, but this is always kept ſhort.</p>
                        <p>The dreſs of both ſexes conſiſts of cotton cloth, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing died blue in the yarn, and not uniformly of the ſame ſhade, is in clouds or waves of that colour, and even in our eye had not an inelegant appearance. This cloth they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture themſelves, and two pieces, each about two yards long, and a yard and a half wide, make a dreſs: one of them is worn round the middle, and the other covers the upper part of the body: the lower edge of the piece that goes round the middle, the men draw pretty tight juſt below the fork, the upper edge of it is left looſe, ſo as to form a kind of hollow belt, which ſerves them as a pocket to carry their knives, and other little implements which it is convenient to have about them. The other piece of cloth is paſſed through this girdle behind, and one end of it being brought over the left ſhoulder, and the other over the right, they fall down over the breaſt, and are tucked into the girdle before, ſo that by opening or cloſing the plaits, they can cover more or leſs of their bodies as they pleaſe; the arms, legs, and feet are always naked. The difference between the dreſs of the two ſexes conſiſts prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in the manner of wearing the waiſt-piece, for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, inſtead of drawing the lower edge tight, and leaving the upper edge looſe for a pocket, draw the upper edge tight, and let the lower edge fall as low as the knees, ſo as to form a petticoat; the body-piece, inſtead of being paſſed through the girdle, is faſtened under the arms, and croſs the breaſt, with the utmoſt decency. I have already obſerved, that the men faſten the hair upon the top of the head, and the women tie it in a club behind, but there is another difference in the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, by which the ſexes are diſtinguiſhed: the women wear nothing as a ſuccedaneum for a cap, but the men conſtantly wrap ſomething round their heads in the manner of a fillet; it is ſmall, but generally of the fineſt materials that can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured: we ſaw ſome who applied ſilk handkerchiefs to this

purpoſe, and others that wore fine cotton, or muſlin, in the manner of a ſmall turban.</p>
                        <p>Theſe people bore their teſtimony that the love of finery is a univerſal paſſion, for their ornaments were very numerous. Some of the better ſort wore chains of gold round their necks, but they were made of plaited wire, and conſequently were light and of little value; others had rings, which were ſo much worn that they ſeemed to have deſcended through many generations; and one perſon had a ſilver-headed cane, marked with a kind of cypher, conſiſting of the Roman letters V. O. C. and therefore probably a preſent from the Dutch Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia Company, whoſe mark it is: they have alſo ornaments made of beads, which ſome wear round their necks as a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire, and others, as bracelets, upon their wriſts: theſe are common to both ſexes, but the women have beſides, ſtrings or girdles of beads, which they wear round their waiſts, and which ſerve to keep up their petticoat. Both ſexes had their ears bored, nor was there a ſingle exception that fell under our notice, yet we never ſaw an ornament in any of them; we never indeed ſaw either man or woman in any thing but what appeared to be their ordinary dreſs, except the King and his Miniſter, who in general wore a kind of night-gown of coarſe chintz, and one of whom once received us in a black robe, which appeared to be made of what is called prince's ſtuff. We ſaw ſome boys, about twelve or fourteen years old, who had ſpiral circles of thick braſs wire paſſed three or four times round their arms, above the elbow, and ſome men wore rings of ivory, two inches in breadth, and above an inch in thickneſs, upon the ſame part of the arm: theſe, we were told, were the ſons of the Rajas, or Chiefs, who wore theſe cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous ornaments as badges of their high birth.</p>
                        <p>Almoſt all the men had their names traced upon their arms, in indelible characters of a black colour, and the women had a ſquare ornament of flouriſhed lines, impreſſed in the ſame manner, juſt under the bend of the elbow. We were ſtruck with the ſimilitude between theſe marks, and thoſe made by tattowing in the South Sea iſlands, and upon enquiring into its origin, we learnt that it had been practiſed by the natives long before any Europeans came among them; and that in the neighbouring iſlands the inhabitants were marked with circles upon their necks and breaſts. The univerſality of this practice, which prevails among ſavages in all parts of the world, from the remoteſt limits of North America, to the iſlands in the South Seas, and which probably differs but little from the method of ſtaining the body that was in uſe among the ancient inhabitants of Britain, is a curious ſubject for ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation<note n="†" place="bottom">In the account which Mr. Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Upon this floor are placed other poſts or pillars, that ſupport a roof of ſloping ſides, which meet in a ridge at the top, like thoſe of our barns: the caves of this roof, which is thatched with palm leaves, reach within two feet of the floor, and over-hang it as much: the ſpace within is generally divided lengthwiſe into three equal parts; the middle part, or center, is incloſed by a partition of four floes, reaching about ſix feet above the floor, and one or two ſmall rooms are alſo ſometimes taken off from the ſides, the reſt of the ſpace under the roof is open, ſo as freely to admit the air and the light: the particular uſes of theſe different apartments, our ſhort ſtay would not permit us to learn, except that the cloſe room in the center was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the women.</p>
                        <p>The food of theſe people conſiſts of every tame animal in the country, of which the hog holds the firſt place in their eſtimation, and the horſe the ſecond; next to the horſe is the buffalo, next to the buffalo their poultry, and they prefer dogs and cats to ſheep and goats. They are not fond of fiſh, and, I believe, it is never eaten but by the poor people, nor by them, except when their duty or buſineſs requires them to be upon the beach, and then every man is furniſhed with a light caſting net, which is girt round him, and makes part of his dreſs; and with this he takes any ſmall fiſh which happen to come in his way.</p>
                        <p>The eſculent vegetables and fruits have been mentioned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, but the fan-palm requires more particular notice, for at certain times it is a ſuccedaneum for all other food both to man and beaſt. A kind of wine, called toddy, is procured from this tree, by cutting the buds which are to produce flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſoon after their appearance, and tying under them ſmall baſkets, made of the leaves, which are ſo cloſe as to hold li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quids

The liquor is called <hi>dua,</hi> or <hi>duac,</hi> and both the ſyrup and ſugar <hi>gula.</hi> The ſyrup is prepared by boiling the liquor down in pots of ear hen ware, till it is ſufficiently inſpiſſated; it is not unlike treacle in appearance, but is ſomewhat thicker, and has a much more agreeable taſte: the ſugar is of a reddiſh brown, perhaps the ſame with the Jugata ſugar upon the continent of India, and it was more agreeable to our palates than any cane ſugar unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, that we had ever taſted. We were at firſt afraid that the ſyrup, of which ſome of our people eat very great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, would have brought on fluxes, but its aperient quality was ſo very ſlight, that what effect it produced was rather ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary than hurtful. I have already obſerved, that it is given with the huſks of rice to the hogs, and that they grow enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly fat without taking any other food: we were told alſo, that this ſyrup is uſed to fatten their dogs and their fowls, and that the inhabitants themſelves have ſubſiſted upon this alone for ſeveral months, when other crops have failed, and animal food has been ſcarce. The leaves of this tree are alſo put to various uſes, they thatch houſes, and make baſkets, cups, umbrellas, and tobacco-pipes. The fruit is leaſt eſteemed, and as the bloſſoms are wounded for the tuac or toddy, there is not much of it: it is about as big as a large turnip, and covered like the cocoa-nut, with a fibrous coat, under which are three kernels, that muſt be eaten before they are ripe, for afterwards they become ſo hard that they cannot be chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; in their eatable ſtate they taſte not unlike a green cocoa-nut, and, like them, probably they yield a nutriment that is watry and unſubſtantial.</p>
                        <p>The common method of dreſſing food here is by boiling, and as fire-wood is very ſcarce, and the inhabitants have no other fuel, they make uſe of a contrivance to ſave it, that is not wholly unknown in Europe, but is ſeldom practiſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in camps. They dig a hollow under ground, in a hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal direction, like a rabbit burrow, about two yards long, and opening into a hole at each end, one of which is large and the other ſmall: by the large hole the fire is put in, and the ſmall one ſerves for a draught. The earth over this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is perforated by circular holes, which communicate with the cavity below; and in theſe holes are ſet earthen pots, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally about three to each fire, which are large in the middle, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>per towards the bottom, ſo that the fire acts upon a large part of their ſurface. Each of theſe pots generally contains
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:013324_0470_0F90F25D782AE418"/>
about eight or ten gallons, and it is ſurpriſing to ſee with how ſmall a quantity of fire they may be kept boiling; a palm leaf, or a dry ſtalk, thruſt in now and then, is ſufficient: in this manner they boil all their victuals, and make all their ſyrup and ſugar. It appears by Frazier's account of his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the South Sea, that the Peruvian Indians have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the ſame kind, and perhaps it might be adopted with advantage by the poor people even of this country, where fuel is very dear.</p>
                        <p>Both ſexes are enſlaved by the hateful and pernicious habit of chewing betele and areca, which they contract even while they are children, and practiſe inceſſantly from morning till night. With theſe they always mix a kind of white lime, made of coral ſtone and ſhells, and frequently a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of tobacco, ſo that their mouths are diſguſtful in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree both to the ſmell and the ſight: the tobacco taints their breath, and the beetle and lime make the teeth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as black as charcoal, but as rotten too. I have ſeen men between twenty and thirty, whoſe fore-teeth have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed almoſt down to the gums, tho' no 2 of them were exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the ſame length or thickneſs, but irregularly corroded like iron by ruſt. This loſs of teeth is, I think, by all who have written upon the ſubject, imputed to the tough and ſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy coat of the areca nut; but I impute it wholly to the lime: they are not looſened, or broken, or forced out, as might be expected if they were injured by the continual chewing of hard and rough ſubſtances, but they are gradually waſted like me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals that are expoſed to the action of powerful acids; the ſtumps always adhering firmly to the ſocket in the jaw, when there is no part of the tooth above the gums: and poſſibly thoſe who ſuppoſe that ſugar has a bad effect upon the teeth of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, may not be miſtaken, for it is well known that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined loaf ſugar contains a conſiderable quantity of lime; and he that doubts whether lime will deſtroy bone of any kind, may eaſily aſcertain the fact by experiment.</p>
                        <p>If the people here are at any time without this odious mouthful, they are ſmoaking. This operation they perform by rolling up a ſmall quantity of tobacco, and putting it into one end of a tube about ſix inches long, and as thick as a gooſe quill, which they make of a palm leaf. As the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of tobacco in theſe pipes is very ſmall, the effect of it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, eſpecially among the women, by ſwallowing the ſmoke.</p>
                        <p>When the natives of this iſland were firſt formed into a civil ſociety, is not certainly known, but at preſent it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into five principalities or nigrees: LAAI, SEBA, RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OEEUA, TIMO, and MASSARA, each of which is governed by its reſpective Raja or King. The Raja of Seba, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:013324_0471_0F90501986A35F10"/>
in which we were aſhore, ſeemed to have great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, without much external parade or ſhow, or much appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of perſonal reſpect. He was about five and thirty years of age, and the fatteſt man we ſaw upon the whole iſland: he appeared to be of a dull phlegmatic diſpoſition, and to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected almoſt implicitly by the old man who, upon my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him with a ſword, had procured us a fair market, in ſpight of the craft and avarice of the Dutch factors. The name of this perſon was MANNU DJARME, and it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed that he was a man of uncommon integrity and abilities, as, notwithſtanding his poſſeſſion of power in the character of a favourite, he was beloved by the whole princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality. If any difference ariſes among the people, it is ſettled by the Raja and his counſellors, without delay or appeal, and, as we were told, with the moſt ſolemn deliberation and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial juſtice.</p>
                        <p>We were informed by Mr. Lange, that the chiefs who had ſucceſſively preſided over the five principalities of this iſland, had lived for time immemorial in the ſtricteſt alliance and moſt cordial friendſhip with each other; yet he ſaid the people were of a warlike diſpoſition, and had always courageouſly defended themſelves againſt foreign invaders. We were told alſo, that the iſland was able to raiſe, upon very ſhort notice, 7300 fighting men, armed with muſkets, ſpears, lances, and targets. Of this force, Laai was ſaid to furniſh 2600, Seba 2000, Regeeua 1500, Timo 800, and Maſſara 400. Beſides the arms that have been already mentioned, each man is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a large pole-ax, reſembling a wood-bill, except that it has a ſtrait edge, and is much heavier: this, in the hands of people who have courage to come to cloſe quarters with an enemy, muſt be a dreadful weapon; and we were told that they were ſo dextrous with their lances, that at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſixty feet they would throw them with ſuch exactneſs as to pierce a man's heart, and ſuch force as to go quite through his body.</p>
                        <p>How far this account of the martial proweſs of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Savu may be true, we cannot take upon us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, but during our ſtay, we ſaw no appearance of it. We ſaw indeed in the town-houſe, or houſe of aſſembly, about one hundred ſpears and targets, which ſerved to arm the people who were ſent down to intimidate us at the trading place; but they ſeemed to be the refuſe of old armories, no two being of the ſame make or length, for ſome were ſix, and ſome ſixteen feet long: we ſaw no lance among them, and as to the muſkets, though they were clean on the outſide, they were eaten into holes by the ruſt within; and the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves appeared to be ſo little acquainted with military diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, that they marched like a diſorderly rabble, every one
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:013324_0472_0F90F25E501E4C08"/>
having, inſtead of his target, a cock, ſome tobacco, or other merchandiſe of the like kind, which he took that opportunity to bring down to ſell, and a few or none of their cartridge boxes were furniſhed with either powder or ball, though a piece of paper was thruſt into the whole to ſave appearances. We ſaw a few ſwivel guns, and pateraroes at the town-houſe, and a great gun before it; but the ſwivels and pateraros lay out of their carriages, and the great gun lay upon a heap of ſtones, almoſt conſumed with ruſt, with the touch-hole down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, poſſibly to conceal its ſize, which might perhaps be little leſs than that of the bore.</p>
                        <p>We could not diſcover that among theſe people there was any rank of diſtinction between the Raja and the land-owners: the land-owners were reſpectable in proportion to their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions; the inferior ranks conſiſt of manufacturers, labouring poor, and ſlaves. The ſlaves, like the peaſants in ſome parts of Europe, are connected with the eſtate, and both deſcend together: but though the land-owner can ſell his ſlave, he has no other power over his perſon, not even to correct him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the privity and approbation of the Raja. Some have five hundred of theſe ſlaves, and ſome not half a dozen: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon price of them is a fat hog. When a great man goes out, he is conſtantly attended by two or more of them: one of them carries a ſword or hanger, the hilt of which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſilver, and adorned with large taſſels of horſe hair; and another carries a bag which contains betel, areca, lime and tobacco. In theſe attendants conſiſts all their magnificence, for the Raja himſelf has no other mark of diſtinction.</p>
                        <p>The chief object of pride among theſe people, like that of a Welchman, is a long pedigree of reſpectable anceſtors, and indeed a veneration for antiquity ſeems to be carried farther here than in any other country: even a houſe that has been well inhabited for many generations, becomes almoſt ſacred, and few articles either of uſe or luxury bear ſo high a price as ſtones, which having been long ſat upon, are become even and ſmooth: thoſe who can purchaſe ſuch ſtones, or are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of them by inheritance, place them round their houſes, where they ſerve as ſeats for their dependants.</p>
                        <p>Every Raja ſets up in the principal town of his province, or nigree, a large ſtone, which ſerves as a memorial of his reign. In the principal town of Seba, where we lay, there are thirteen ſuch ſtones, beſides many fragments of others, which had been ſet up in earlier times, and are now moulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away: theſe monuments ſeem to prove that ſome kind of civil eſtabliſhment here is of conſiderable antiquity. The laſt thirteen reigns in England make ſomething more than 276 years.</p>
                        <p>Many of theſe ſtones are ſo large, that it is difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:013324_0473_0F90501AE19F1228"/>
by what means they were brought to their preſent ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially as it is the ſummit of a hill; but the world is full of memorials of human ſtrength, in which the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical powers that have been ſince added by mathematical ſcience, ſeem to be ſurpaſſed; and of ſuch monuments there are not a few among the remains of barbarous antiquity in our own country, beſides thoſe upon Saliſbury plain.</p>
                        <p>Theſe ſtones not only record the reigns of ſucceſſive princes, but ſerve for a purpoſe much more extraordinary, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably altogether peculiar to this country. When a Raja dies, a general feaſt is proclaimed throughout his dominions, and all his ſubjects aſſemble round theſe ſtones; almoſt every liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creature that can be caught is then killed, and the feaſt laſts for a leſs or greater number of weeks or months, as the kingdom happens to be more or leſs furniſhed with live ſtock at the time; the ſtones ſerve for tables. When this madneſs is over, a faſt muſt neceſſarily enſue, and the whole kingdom is obliged to ſubſiſt upon ſyrup and water, if it happens in the dry ſeaſon, when no vegetables can be procured, till a new ſtock of animals can be raiſed from the few that have eſcaped by chance, or been preſerved by policy from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral maſſacre, or can be procured from the neighbouring kingdoms. Such, however, is the account we received from Mr. Lange.</p>
                        <p>We had no opportunity to examine any of their manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, except that of their cloth, which they ſpin, weave, and dye; we did not indeed ſee them employed, but many of the inſtruments which they uſe fell in our way. We ſaw their machine for clearing cotton of its ſeed, which is make upon the ſame principles as thoſe in Europe, but is ſo ſmall that it might be taken for a model, or a toy: it conſiſts of two cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linders, like our round rulers, ſomewhat leſs than an inch in diameter, one of which being turned round by a plain winch, turns the other by means of an endleſs worm; and the whole machine is not more than fourteen inches long, and ſeven high: that which we ſaw had been much uſed, and many pieces of cotton were hanging about it, ſo that there is no reaſon to doubt its being a fair ſpecimen of the reſt. We alſo once ſaw their apparatus for ſpinning; it conſiſted of a bob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, on which was wound a ſmall quantity of thread, and a kind of diſtaff filled with cotton; we conjectured therefore that they ſpin by hand, as the women of Europe did before the introduction of wheels; and I am told that they have not yet found their way into ſome parts of it. Their loom ſeemed to be in one reſpect preferable to ours, for the web was not ſtretched upon a frame, but extended by a piece of wood at each end, round one of which the cloth was rolled, and round the other the threads: the webb was about half a yard broad,
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:013324_0474_0F90501B747D4568"/>
and the length of the ſhuttle was equal to the breadth of the webb, ſo that probably their work goes on but ſlowly. That they dyed this cloth we firſt gueſſed from its colour, and from the indigo which we ſaw in their plantations; and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture was afterwards confirmed by Mr. Lange's account. I have already obſerved, that it is dyed in the yarn, and we once ſaw them dying what was ſaid to be girdles for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of a dirty red, but with what drug we did not think it worth while to enquire.</p>
                        <p>The religion of theſe people, according to Mr. Lange's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, is an abſurd kind of paganiſm, every man chuſing his own god; and determining for himſelf how he ſhould be worſhipped; ſo that there are almoſt as many gods and modes of worſhip as people. In their morals, however, they are ſaid to be irreproachable, even upon the principles of Chriſtianity: no man is allowed more than one wife; yet an illicit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between the ſexes is in a manner unknown among them: inſtances of theft are very rare; and they are ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging a ſuppoſed injury by murder, that if any difference ariſes between them, they will not ſo much as make it the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of debate, leſt they ſhould be provoked to reſentment and ill-will, but immediately and implicitly refer it to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of their King.</p>
                        <p>They appeared to be a healthy and long-lived people; yet ſome of them were marked with the ſmall-pox, which Mr. Lange told us had ſeveral times made its appearance among them, and was treated with the ſame precautions as the plague. As ſoon as a perſon was ſeized with the diſtemper, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to ſome ſolitary place, very remote from any habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where the diſeaſe was left to take its courſe, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſupplied with daily food by reaching it to him at the end of a long pole.</p>
                        <p>Of their domeſtic oeconomy we could learn but little: in one inſtance however their delicacy and cleanlineſs are very remarkable. Many of us were aſhore here three ſucceſſive days, from a very early hour in the morning till it was dark; yet we never ſaw the leaſt trace of an offering to Cloacina, nor could we ſo much as gueſs where they were made. In a country ſo populous this is very difficult to be accounted for, and perhaps there is no other country in the world where the ſecret is ſo effectually kept.</p>
                        <p>The boats in uſe here are a kind of proa.</p>
                        <p>This iſland was ſettled by the Portugueſe almoſt as ſoon as they firſt found their way into this part of the ocean; but they were in a ſhort time ſupplanted by the Dutch. The Dutch however did not take poſſeſſion of it, but only ſent ſloops to trade with the natives, probably for proviſions to ſupport the inhabitants of their ſpice iſlands, who applying themſelves
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:013324_0475_0F90F25F011CD210"/>
wholly to the cultivation of that important article of trade, and laying out all their ground in plantations, can breed few ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals: poſſibly their ſupplies by this occaſional traffic were precarious; poſſibly they were jealous of being ſupplanted in their turn; but however that be, their Eaſt India Company, about ten years ago, entered into a treaty with the Rajas, by which the Company ſtipulated to furniſh each of them with a certain quantity of ſilk, fine linen, cutlery ware, arrack and other articles, every year; and the Rajas engaged that neither they nor their ſubjects ſhould trade with any perſon except the Company, without having firſt obtained their conſent, and that they would admit a reſident on behalf of the Company, to reſide upon the iſland, and ſee that their part of the treaty was fulfilled; they alſo engaged to ſupply annually a certain quantity of rice, maize, and calevances. Their maize and calevances are ſent to Timor in ſloops, which are kept there for that purpoſe, each of which is navigated by ten Indians; and the rice is fetched away annually by a ſhip which brings the Company's returns, and anchors alternately in each of the three bays. Theſe returns are delivered to the Rajas in the form of a preſent, and the caſk of arrack they and their principal people never ceaſe to drink, as long as a drop of it remains.</p>
                        <p>In conſequence of this treaty, the Dutch placed three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon the iſland: Mr. Lange, his colleague, the native of Timor, the ſon of an Indian woman by a Portugueſe, and one Frederick Craig, the ſon of an Indian woman, by a Dutchman. Lange viſits each of the Rajas in two months, when he makes the tour of the iſland, attended by fifty ſlaves on horſeback. He exhorts theſe Chiefs to plant, if it appears that they have been remiſs, and obſerves where the crops are got in, that he may order ſloops to fetch it; ſo that it paſſes immediately from the ground to the Dutch ſtorehouſes at Timor. In theſe excurſions he always carries with him ſome bottles of arrack, which he finds of great uſe in opening the hearts of the Rajas with whom he is to deal.</p>
                        <p>During the ten years that he had reſided upon this iſland he had never ſeen a European beſides ourſelves, except at the arrival of the Dutch ſhip, which had ſailed about two months before we arrived; and he is now to be diſtinguiſhed from the natives only by his colour and his dreſs, for he fits upon the ground, chews his betele, and in every reſpect has adopted their character and manners: he has married an Indian woman of the iſland of Timor, who keeps his houſe after the faſhion of her country; and he gave that as a reaſon for not inviting us to viſit him, ſaying, that he could entertain us in no other manner than the Indians had done, and he ſpoke no language readily but that of the country.</p>
                        <p>The office of Mr. Frederic Craig is to inſtruct the youth of
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:013324_0476_0F90F25FC8B64D08"/>
the country in reading and writing, and the principles of the Chriſtian religion; the Dutch having printed verſions of the New Teſtament, a catechiſm, and ſeveral other tracts, in the language of this and the neighbouring iſlands. Dr. Solan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who was at his houſe, ſaw the books, and the copy books alſo, of his ſcholars, many of whom wrote a very fair hand. He boaſted that there were no leſs than ſix hundred Chriſtians in the townſhip of Seba; but what the Dutch Chriſtianity of theſe Indians may be, it is not perhaps very eaſy to gueſs for there is not a church, nor even a prieſt, in the whole iſland.</p>
                        <p>While we were at this place, we made ſeveral enquiries concerning the neighbouring iſlands, and the intelligence which we received, is to the following effect:</p>
                        <p>A ſmall iſland to the weſtward of Savu, the name of which we did not learn, produces nothing of any conſequence but areca-nuts, of which the Dutch receive annually the freight of two ſloops, in return for preſents that they make to the iſlanders.</p>
                        <p>Timor is the chief, and the Dutch reſidents on the other iſlands go thither once a year to paſs their accounts. The place is nearly in the ſame ſtate as in Dampier's time, the Dutch having there a fort and ſtore-houſes; and, by Lange's account, we might there have been ſupplied with every neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that we expected to procure at Batavia, ſalt proviſions and arrack not excepted. But the Portugueſe are ſtill in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of ſeveral towns on the north ſide of the iſland, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Laphoa and Seſial.</p>
                        <p>About two years before our arrival, a French ſhip was wrecked upon the eaſt coaſt of Timor; and after ſhe had lain ſome days upon the ſhoal, a ſudden gale broke her up at once, and drowned the Captain, with the greateſt part of the crew: thoſe who got aſhore, among whom was one of the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, made the beſt of their way to Concordia; they were four days upon the road, where they were obliged to leave part of their company through fatigue, and the reſt to the number of about eighty, arrived at the town. They were ſupplied with every neceſſary, and ſent back to the wreck, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per aſſiſtance, for recovering what could be fiſhed up; they fortunately got up all their bullion, which was in cheſts, and ſeveral of their guns which were very large. They then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the town, but their companions who had been left upon the road were miſſing, having, as it was ſuppoſed, been kept among the Indians, either by perſuaſion or force; for they are very deſirous of having Europeans among them, to inſtruct them in the art of war. After a ſtay of more than two months at Concordia, their number was diminiſhed near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one half by ſickneſs, in conſequence of the fatigue and
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:013324_0477_0F90F260ACC2FFE8"/>
hardſhip which they had ſuffered by the ſhipwreck, and the ſurvivors were ſent in a ſmall veſſel to Europe.</p>
                        <p>Rotte is in much the ſame ſituation as Savu; a Dutch fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor reſides upon it to manage the natives, and look after its produce, which conſiſts among other articles, of ſugar. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly it was made only by bruiſing the canes, and boiling the juice to a ſyrup, in the ſame manner as Toddy; but great improvements have lately been made in preparing this valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able commodity. The three little iſlands called the Solars are alſo under the influence of the Dutch ſettlement at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia: they are flat and low, but abound with proviſions of every kind, and the middlemoſt is ſaid to have a good har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for ſhipping. Ende, another little iſland to the weſtward of the Solars, is ſtill in the hands of the Portugueſe, who have a good town and harbour on the north eaſt corner of it, called Larntuca: they had formerly an harbour on the ſouth ſide of it, but that being much inferior to Larntuca, has for ſome time been altogether neglected.</p>
                        <p>The inhabitants of each of theſe little iſlands ſpeak a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage peculiar to themſelves, and it is an object of Dutch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to prevent as much as poſſible, their learning the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of each other. If they ſpoke a common language, they would learn, by mutual intercourſe with each other, to plant ſuch things as would be of more value to themſelves than their preſent produce, though of leſs advantage to the Dutch; but their languages being different, they can communicate no ſuch knowlege to each other, and the Dutch ſecure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the benefit of ſupplying their ſeveral neceſſities upon their own terms, which it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe are not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moderate. It is probable with a view to this advantage that the Dutch never teach their own language to the natives of theſe iſlands, and have been at the expence of tranſlating the Teſtament and catechiſms into the different languages of each; for in proportion as Dutch had become the language of their religion, it would have become the common language of them all.</p>
                        <p>To this account of Savu, I ſhall only add a ſmall ſpecimen of its language, by which it will appear to have ſome affinity with that of the South Sea iſlands, many of the words being exactly the ſame, and the numbers manifeſtly derived from the ſame ſource.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XII. The Run from the Iſland of Savu to Batavia, and an Account of the Tranſactions there, while the Ship was refitting.</head>
                        <p>IN the morning of Friday the 21ſt of September, 1770, we got under ſail, and ſtood away to the weſtward, along the north ſide of the iſland of Savu, and of the ſmaller that lies to the weſtward of it, which at noon bore from us S. S. E. diſtant two leagues. At four o'clock in the afternoon, we diſcovered a ſmall low iſland, bearing S. S. W. diſtant three leagues, which has no place in any chart now extant, at leaſt in none that I have been able to procure: it lies in lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 10° 47′ S., longitude 238° 28′ W.</p>
                        <p>At noon on the 22d, we were in latitude 11° 10′ S., longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 240° 38′ W. In the evening of the 23d, we found the variation of the needle to be 2° 44′ W.; as ſoon as we got clear of the iſlands we had conſtantly a ſwell from the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which I imagined was not cauſed by a wind blowing from that quarter, but by the ſea being ſo determined by the poſition of the coaſt of New Holland.</p>
                        <p>At noon on the 26th, being in latitude 10° 47′ S., longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 249° 52′ W. we found the variation to be 3° 10′ W. and our ſituation to be twenty-five miles to the northward of the log; for which I know not how to account. At noon on the 27th, our latitude by obſervation was 10° 51′ S. which was
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:013324_0480_0F90F262C490EA30"/>
agreeable to the log; and our longitude was 252° 11′ W. We ſteered N. W. all day on the 28th, in order to make the land of Java; and at noon on the 29th, our latitude by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation was 9° 31′ S., longitude 254° 10′ W.; and in the morning of the 30th, I took into my poſſeſſion the log-book and journals, at leaſt all I could find, of the officers, petty officers, and ſeamen, and enjoined them ſecrecy with reſpect to where they had been.</p>
                        <p>At ſeven in the evening, being in the latitude of Java Head, and not ſeeing any land, I concluded that we were too far to the weſtward: I therefore hauled up E. N. E. having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſteered N. by E. In the night we had thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and about twelve o'clock, by the light of the flaſhes, we ſaw the land bearing eaſt. I then tacked and ſtood to the S. W. till four o'clock in the morning of the firſt of October; and at ſix, Java Head, or the weſt end of Java, bore S. E. by E. diſtant five leagues: ſoon after we ſaw Prince's Iſland, bearing E. ½ S.; and at ten, the iſland of Cracatoa, bearing N. E. Cracatoa is a remarkably high-peaked iſland, and at noon it bore N. 40 E. diſtant ſeven leagues.</p>
                        <p>I muſt now obſerve that, during our run from Savu, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed twenty minutes a day for the weſterly current, which I concluded muſt run ſtrong at this time, eſpecially off the coaſt of Java, and I found that this allowance was juſt equivalent to the effect of the current upon the ſhip.</p>
                        <p>At four o'clock in the morning of the 2d, we fetched cloſe in with the coaſt of Java, in fifteen fathom; we then ſtood, along the coaſt, and early in the forenoon, I ſent the boat aſhore to try if ſhe could procure ſome fruit for Tupia, who was very ill, and ſome graſs for the buffaloes that were ſtill alive. In an hour or two ſhe returned with four cocoa-nuts, and a ſmall bunch of plantains, which had been purchaſed for a ſhilling, and ſome herbage for the cattle, which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians not only gave us, but aſſiſted our people to cut. The country looked like one continued wood, and had a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant appearance.</p>
                        <p>About eleven o'clock, we ſaw two Dutch ſhips lying off Anger point, and I ſent Mr. Hicks on board one of them, to enquire news of our country, from which we had been abſent ſo long. In the mean time it fell calm, and about noon I anchored in eighteen fathom with a muddy bottom. When Mr. Hicks returned, he reported that the ſhips were Dutch Eaſt Indiamen from Batavia, one of which was bound to Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and the other to the coaſt of Malabar; and that there was alſo a flyboat or packet, which was ſaid to be ſtationed here to carry letters from the Dutch ſhips that came hither to Batavia, but which I rather think was appointed to examine all ſhips that paſs the ſtreight: from theſe ſhips we heard
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:013324_0481_0F90F26376830C30"/>
with great pleaſure, that the Swallow had been at Batavia about two years before.</p>
                        <p>At ſeven o'clock a breeze ſprung up at S. S. W. with which having weighed, we ſtood to the N. E. between Thwart-the-way-Iſland and the Cap, ſounding from eighteen to twenty-eight fathom: we had but little wind all night, and having a ſtrong current againſt us, we got no further by eight in the morning than Bantam Point. At this time the wind came to the N. E. and obliged us to anchor in two and twenty fathom, at about the diſtance of two miles from the ſhore; the point bore N. E. by E. diſtant one league, and here we found a ſtrong current ſetting to the N. W. In the morning we had ſeen the Dutch packet ſtanding after us, but when the wind ſhifted to the N. E. ſhe bore away.</p>
                        <p>At ſix o'clock in the evening, the wind having obliged us to continue at anchor, one of the country boats came along ſide of us, on board of which was the maſter of the packet. He ſeemed to have two motives for his viſit, one to take an account of the ſhip, and the other to ſell us refreſhments; for in the boat were turtle, fowls, ducks, parrots, paroq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ets, rice-birds, monkies, and other articles, which they held at a very high price, and brought to a bad market, for our Savu ſtock was not yet expended: however, I gave a Spaniſh dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar for a ſmall turtle, which weighed about ſix and thirty pounds; I gave alſo a dollar for ten large fowls, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bought fifteen more at the ſame price; for a dollar we might alſo have bought two monkies, or a whole cage of rice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds. The Maſter of the ſloop brought with him two books, in one of which he deſired that any of our officers would write down the name of the ſhip and its commander, with that of the place from which ſhe ſailed, and of the port to which ſhe was bound, with ſuch other particulars relating to themſelves, as they might think proper, for the information of any of our friends that ſhould come after us: and in the other he entered the names of the ſhip and the Commander himſelf, in order to tranſmit them to the Governor and Council of the Indies. We perceived that in the firſt book many ſhips, particularly Portugueſe, had made entries of the ſame kind with that for which it was preſented to us. Mr. Hicks, however, having written the name of the ſhip, only added "from Europe." He took notice of this, but ſaid, that he was ſatisfied with any thing we thought fit to write, it being intended merely for the information of thoſe who ſhould enquire after us from motives of friendſhip.</p>
                        <p>Having made ſeveral attempts to ſail with a wind that would not ſtem the current, and as often come to an anchor, a proa came along ſide of us in the morning of the 5th, in which was a Dutch officer, who ſent me down a printed paper

                        <p>Of theſe queſtions I anſwered only the firſt and the fourth; which when the officer ſaw, he ſaid anſwers to the reſt were of no conſequence: yet he immediately added, that he muſt ſend that very paper away to Batavia, and that it would be there the next day at noon. I have particularly related this incident, becauſe I have been credibly informed that it is but of late years that the Dutch have taken upon them to examine ſhips that paſs through this Streight.</p>
                        <p>At ten o'clock the ſame morning, we weighed, with a light breeze at S. W.; but did little more than ſtem the current, and about two o'clock anchored again under Bantam Point, where we lay till nine; a light breeze then ſpringing up at S. E. we weighed and ſtood to the eaſtward till ten o'clock the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the current obliged us again to anchor in twenty-two fathom, Pulababi bearing E. by S. ½ S. diſtant between three and four miles. Having alternately weighed and anchored ſeveral times, till four in the afternoon of the 7th, we then ſtood to the eaſtward, with a very faint breeze at N. E. and paſſed Wapping Iſland, and the firſt iſland to the eaſtward of it; when the wind dying away, we were carried by the current between the firſt and ſecond of the iſlands that lie to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Wapping Iſland, where we were obliged to anchor in thirty fathom, being very near a ledge of rocks that run out from one of the iſlands. At two the next morning we weighed
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:013324_0483_0F90F26442FDF208"/>
with the land wind at ſouth, and ſtood out clear of the ſhoal; but before noon were obliged to come to again in twenty-eight fathom, near a ſmall iſland among thoſe that are called the Thouſand Iſlands, which we did not find laid down in any chart.

                           </gap>o Pare at this time bore E. N. E. diſtance between ſix and ſeven miles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went aſhore upon the iſland, which they found not to be more than five hundred yards long, and one hundred broad; yet there was a houſe upon it, and a ſmall plantation, where among other things was the <hi>Palma Chriſti,</hi> from which the caſtor oil is made in the Weſt Indies: they made a ſmall addition to their collection of plants, and ſhot a bat, whoſe wings when extended meaſured three feet from point to point: they ſhot alſo four plovers, which exactly reſembled the golden plover of England. Soon after they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, a ſmall Indian boat came alongſide with two Malaya on board, who brought three turtles, ſome dried fiſh, and a few pumpkins: we bought the turtle, which altogether weighed a hundred and forty-ſix pounds, for a dollar, and conſidering that we had lately paid the Dutchman a dollar for one that weighed only ſix and thirty pounds, we thought we had a good bargain. The ſeller appeared equally ſatisfied, and we then treated with him for his pumpkins, for which he was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to take any money but a dollar; we ſaid that a whole dollar was greatly too much; to which he readily aſſented, but deſired that we would cut one and give him a part: at laſt, however, a fine ſhining Portugueſe petacka tempted him, and for that he ſold us his whole ſtock of pumpkins, being in number twenty-ſix. At parting, he made ſigns that we ſhould not tell at Batavia that any boat had been aboard us.</p>
                        <p>We were not able to weather Pulo Pare this day, but getting the land wind at ſouth about ten o'clock at night, we weighed and ſtood to the E. S. E. all night. At ten in the morning, we anchored again, to wait for the ſea breeze; and at noon it ſprung up at N. N. E. with which we ſtood in for Batavia road, where at four o'clock in the afternoon we came to an anchor.</p>
                        <p>We found here the Harcourt Indiaman from England, two Engliſh private traders of that country, thirteen ſail of large Dutch ſhips, and a conſiderable number of ſmall veſſels. A boat came immediately on board, from a ſhip which had a broad pendant flying, and the officer who commanded having enquired who we were, and whence we came, immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with ſuch anſwers as we thought fit to give him: both he and his people were as pale as ſpectres, a ſad preſage of our ſufferings in ſo unhealthy a country; but our people, who, except Tupia, were all roſy and plump, ſeemed to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo ſeaſoned by various climates that nothing could hurt them. In the mean time, I ſent a Lieutenant aſhore to acquaint
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:013324_0484_0F90F2652B389B10"/>
the Governor of our arrival, and to make an excuſe for our not ſaluting; for as I could ſalute with only three guns, except the ſwivels, which I was of opinion would not be heard, I thought it was better to let it alone. As ſoon as the boat was diſpatched the carpenter delivered me an account of the defects of the ſhip, of which the following is a copy:</p>

                              <p>The ſhip very leaky, as ſhe makes from twelve to ſix inches water an hour, occaſioned by her main keel being wounded in many places, and the ſcarfs of her ſtern being very open: the falſe keel gone beyond the midſhips from forward, and perhaps farther; as I had no opportunity of ſeeing for the water when hauled aſhore for repairing: wounded on the larboard ſide under the main channel, where I imagine the greateſt leak is, but could not come at it for the water: one pump on the larboard ſide uſeleſs; the others decayed within an inch and a half of the bore. Otherwiſe maſts, yards, boats, and hull, in pretty good condition.</p>

                        <p>As it was the univerſal opinion that the ſhip could not ſafely proceed to Europe without an examination of her bottom, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to apply for leave to heave her down at this place; and as I underſtood that it would be neceſſary to make this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in writing, I drew up a requeſt, and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, having got it tranſlated into Dutch, we all went aſhore.</p>
                        <p>We repaired immediately to the houſe of Mr. Leith, the only Engliſhman of any credit who is reſident at this place, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us with great politeneſs, and engaged us to dinner: to this gentleman we applied for inſtructions how to provide our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with lodgings and neceſſaries while we ſhould ſtay aſhore, and he told us, that there was a hotel, or kind of inn, kept by the order of government, where all merchants and ſtrangers were obliged to reſide, paying half per cent upon the value of their goods for warehouſe room, which the maſter of the houſe was obliged to provide; but that as we came in a King's ſhip, we ſhould be at liberty to live where we pleaſed, upon aſking the Governor's permiſſion, which would be granted of courſe. He ſaid, that it would be cheaper for us to take a houſe in the town, and bring our own ſervants aſhore, if we had any body upon whom we could depend to buy in our proviſions; but as this was not the caſe, having no perſon among us who could ſpeak the Malay language, our gentlemen determined to go to the hotel. At the hotel, therefore, beds were immediately hired, and word was ſent that we ſhould ſleep there at night.</p>
                        <p>At five o'clock in the afternoon, I was introduced to the Governor-General, who received my very courteouſly; he told me, that I ſhould have every thing I wanted, and that in the morning my requeſt ſhould be laid before the council, which I was deſired to attend.</p>

About nine o'clock, we had a dreadful ſtorm of thunder, lightning, and rain, during which the main-maſt of one of the Dutch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

This ſhip lay not more than the diſtance of two cables length from ours, and in all probability we ſhould have ſhared the ſame fate, but for the electrical chain which we had but juſt got up, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the lightning over the ſide of the ſhip; but though we eſcaped the lightning, the exploſion ſhook us like an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, the chain at the ſame time appearing like a line of fire: a centinel was in the action of charging his piece, and the ſhock forced the muſquet out of his hand, and broke the rammer rod. Upon this occaſion, I cannot but earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend chains of the ſame kind to every ſhip, whatever be her deſtination, and I hope that the fate of the Dutchman will be a warning to all who ſhall read this narrative, againſt hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an iron ſpindle at the maſt-head.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, I attended at the council-chamber, and was told that I ſhould have every thing I wanted. In the mean time, the gentlemen aſhore agreed with the keeper of the hotel for their lodging and board, at the rate of two rix-dollars, or nine ſhillings ſterling a day for each; and as there were five of them, and they would probably have many viſitors from the ſhip, he agreed to keep them a ſeparate table, upon condition that they ſhould pay one rix-dollar for the dinner of every ſtranger, and another for his ſupper and bed, if he ſhould ſleep aſhore. Under this ſtipulation they were to be furniſhed with tea, coffee, punch, pipes and tobacco, for themſelves and their friends, as much as they could conſume; they were alſo to pay half a rupee, or one ſhilling and three pence a day for each of their ſervants.</p>
                        <p>They ſoon learnt that theſe rates were more than double the common charges of board and lodging in the town, and their table, though it had the appearance of magnificence, was wretchedly ſerved. Their dinner conſiſted of one courſe of fifteen diſhes, and then ſupper of one courſe of thirteen, but nine or ten of them conſiſted of bad poultry, variouſly dreſſed, and often ſerved up the ſecond, third, and even the fourth time: the ſame duck having appeared more than once roaſted, found his way again to the table as a fricaſee, and a fourth time in the form of forced meat. It was not long, however, before they learnt that this treatment was only by way of eſſay, and that it was the invariable cuſtom of the houſe, to ſupply all ſtrangers, at their firſt coming, with ſuch fare as could be procured for the leaſt money, and conſequently would produce the moſt gain: that if either through indolence or good-nature they
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:013324_0486_0F8FFB57CCF36630"/>
wore content, it was continued for the benefit of the hoſt, but that if they complained, it was gradually amended till they were ſatisfied, which ſometimes happened before they had the worth of their money. After this diſcovery, they remonſtrated, and their fare became better; however, after a few days, Mr. Banks hired a little houſe, the next door on the left hand to the hotel, for himſelf and his party, for which he paid after the rate of ten rix-dollars, or two pounds five ſhillings ſterling a month; but here they were very far from having either the convenience or the privacy which they expected; no perſon was permitted to ſleep in this private houſe occaſionally, as a gueſt to the perſon who hired it, under a penalty, but almoſt every Dutchman that went by ran in without any ceremony, to aſk what they ſold, there having been very ſeldom any private perſons at Batavia who had not ſomething to ſell. Every body here hires a carriage, and Mr. Banks hired two. They are open chaiſes, made to hold two people, and driven by a man ſitting on a coach-box; for each of theſe he paid two rix-dollars a day.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as he was ſettled in his new habitation, he ſent for Tupia, who till now had continued on board upon account of his illneſs, which was of the bilious kind, and for which he had obſtinately refuſed to take any medicine. He ſoon came aſhore, with his boy Tayeto, and though while he was on board, and after he came into the boat, he was exceedingly liſtleſs and dejected, he no ſooner entered the town than h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> ſeemed to animated with a new ſoul. The houſes, carriages, ſtreets, people, and a multiplicity of other objects, all new, which ruſhed upon him at once, produced an effect like the ſudden and ſecret power that is imagined of faſcination. Tayeto expreſſed his wonder and delight with ſtill leſs reſtraint, and danced along the ſtreet in a kind of extaſy, examining every object with a reſtleſs and eager curioſity, which was every moment excited and gratified. One of the firſt things that Tupia remarked, was the various dreſſes of the paſſing multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, concerning which he made many enquiries; and when he was told that in this place, where people of many different nations were aſſembled, every one wore the habit of his country, he deſired that he might conform to the cuſtom, and appear in that of Otaheite. South Sea cloth was therefore ſent for from the ſhip, and he equipped himſelf with great expedition and dexterity. The people who had ſeen Otourou, the Indian who had been brought hither by M. Bougainville, enquired whether Tupia was not the ſame perſon; from theſe enquiries, we learnt who it was that we had ſuppoſed to be Spaniards, from the accounts that had been given of two ſhips by the Iſlanders.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, I procured an order to the ſuperintendant
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:013324_0487_0F90F1C1FAAAD450"/>
of the iſland of Ouruſt, where the ſhip was to be repaired, to receive her there; and ſent by one of the ſhips that ſailed for Holland, an account of our arrival here, to Mr. Stephens, the Secretary to the Admiralty.</p>
                        <p>The expences that would be incurred by repairing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting the ſhip, rendered it neceſſary for me to take up money in this place, which I imagined might be done without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but I found myſelf miſtaken; for after the moſt diligent enquiry, I could not find any private perſon that had ability and inclination to advance the ſum that I wanted. In this difficulty I applied to the Governor himſelf, by a written requeſt, in conſequence of which, the Shebander had orders to ſupply me with what money I ſhould require out of the Company's Treaſury.</p>
                        <p>On the 18th, as ſoon as it was light, having by ſeveral acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and miſtakes ſuffered a delay of many days, I took up the anchor, and ran down to Ouruſt: a few days afterwards, we went along-ſide of the wharf, on Cooper's Iſland, which lies cloſe to Ouruſt, in order to take out our ſtores.</p>
                        <p>By this time, having been here only nine days, we began to feel the fatal effects of the climate and ſituation. Tupia, after the flow of ſpirits which the novelties of the place produced upon his firſt landing, ſunk on a ſudden, and grew every day worſe and worſe. Tayeto was ſeized with an inflammation upon his lungs, Mr. Banks's two ſervants became very ill, and himſelf and Dr. Solander were attacked by fevers: in a few days, almoſt every perſon both on board and aſhore was ſick; affected, no doubt, by the low ſwampy ſituation of the place, and the numberleſs dirty canals which interſect the town in all directions. On the 26th, I ſet up the tent for the reception of the ſhip's company, of whom there was but a ſmall number able to do duty. Poor Tupia, of whoſe life we now began to deſpair, and who till this time had continued aſhore with Mr. Banks, deſired to be removed to the ſhip, where, he ſaid, he ſhould breathe a freer air than among the numerous houſes which obſtructed it aſhore: on board the ſhip, however, he could not go, for ſhe was unrigged, and preparing to be laid down at the careening place; but on the 28th, Mr. Banks went with him to Cooper's Iſland, or, as it is called here, Kuypor, where ſhe lay, and as he ſeemed pleaſed with the ſpot, a tent was there pitched for him: at this place, both the ſea breeze and the land breeze blew directly over him, and he expreſſed great ſatisfaction in his ſituation. Mr. Banks, whoſe huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity kept him two days with this poor Indian, returned to the town on the 30th, and the fits of his intermittent, which was now become a regular tertian, were ſo violent as to deprive him of his ſenſes while they laſted, and leave him ſo weak that he was ſcarcely able to crawl down ſtairs: at this time, Dr.

Solander's diſorder alſo increaſed, and Mr. Monkhouſe, the Surgeon, was confined to his bed.</p>
                        <p>On the fifth of November, after many delays in conſequence of the Dutch ſhips coming along-ſide the wharfs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> load pepper, the ſhip was laid down, and the ſame day, Mr. Monkhouſe, our Surgeon, a ſenſible, ſkillful man, fell the firſt ſacrifice to this fatal country, a loſs which was greatly aggravated by our ſituation. Dr. Solander was juſt able to attend his funeral, but Mr. Banks was confined to his bed. Our diſtreſs was now very great, and the proſpect before us diſcouraging in the higheſt degree: our danger was not ſuch as we could ſurmount by any efforts of our own; courage, ſkill, and diligence were all equally ineffectual, and death was every day making ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances upon us, where we could neither reſiſt nor fly. Malay ſervants were hired to attend the ſick, but they had ſo little ſenſe either of duty or humanity, that they could not be kept within call, and the patient was frequently obliged to get out of bed to ſeek them. On the 9th, we loſt our poor Indian boy Tayeto, and Tupia was ſo much affected, that it was doubted whether he would ſurvive till the next day.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, the bottom of the ſhip being examined, was found to be in a worſe condition than we apprehended: the falſe keel was all gone to within twenty feet of the ſtern poſt; the main keel was conſiderably injured in many places; a great quantity of the ſheating was torn off, and ſeveral planks were much damaged; two of them, and the half of a third, under the main channel near the keel, were, for the length of ſix feet, ſo worn, that they were not above an eight part of an inch thick, and here the worms had made their way quite into the timbers; yet in this condition ſhe had ſailed many hundred leagues, where navigation is as dangerous as in any part of the world: how much miſery did we eſcape, by being ignorant that ſo conſiderable a part of the bottom of the veſſel was thinner than the ſole of a ſhoe, and that every life on board depended upon ſo ſlight and fragile a barrier between us and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable ocean! It ſeemed, however, that we had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved only to periſh here; Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were ſo bad that the phyſician declared they had no chance for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery but by removing into the country; a houſe was therefore hired for them, at the diſtance of about two miles from the town, which belonged to the maſter of the hotel, who engaged to furniſh them with proviſions, and the uſe of ſlaves. As they had already experienced their want of influence over ſlaves that had other maſters, and the unfeeling inattention of theſe fellows to the ſick, they bought each of them a Mallay woman, which removed both the cauſes of their being ſo ill ſerved; the women were their own property, and the tenderneſs of the ſex, even here, made them good nurſes. While theſe preparations were
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:013324_0489_0F90F1C450CDDD58"/>
making, they received an account of the death of Tupia, who ſunk at once after the loſs of the boy, whom he loved with the tenderneſs of a parent.</p>
                        <p>By the 14th, the bottom of the ſhip was thorougly repaired, and very much to my ſatisfaction: it would, indeed, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to the officers and workmen of this yard, not to declare that, in my opinion, there is not a marine yard in the world, where a ſhip can be laid down with more convenience, ſafety, and diſpatch, nor repaired with more diligence and ſkill. At this place they heave down by two maſts, a method which we do not now practiſe; it is, however, unqueſtionably more ſafe and expeditious to heave down with two maſts than one, and he muſt have a good ſhare of bigotry to old cuſtoms, and an equal want of common ſenſe, who will not allow this, after ſeeing with what facility the Dutch heave down their largeſt ſhips at this place.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander recovered ſlowly at their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-houſe, which was not only open to the ſea breeze, but ſituated upon a running ſtream, which greatly contributed to the circulation of the air: but I was now taken ill myſelf; Mr. Sporing, and a ſeaman who had attended Mr. Banks, were alſo ſeized with intermittents; and indeed there was not more than ten of the whole ſhip's company that were able to do duty.</p>
                        <p>We proceeded however in rigging the ſhip, and getting water and ſtores aboard: the water we were obliged to procure from Batavia, at the rate of ſix ſhillings and eight pence a leager, or one hundred and fifty gallons.</p>

                        <p>The wet ſeaſon was now ſet in, though we had ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of fair weather. The frogs in the ditches, which croak ten times louder than any frogs in Europe, gave notice of rain by an inceſſant noiſe that was almoſt intolerable, and the gnats and muſquitos, which had been very troubleſome even during the dry weather, were now become innumerable, ſwarming from every plaſh of water like bees from a hive; they did not, however, much incommode us in the day, and the ſtings, however troubleſome at firſt, never continued to itch above half an hour, ſo that none of us felt in the day, the effects of the wounds they had received in the night.</p>

On the 8th of December, the ſhip being perfectly refitted, and having taken in moſt of her water and ſtores, and received her ſick on board, we ran up to Batavia Road, and anchored in four fathom and an half water.</p>
                        <p>From this time, to the 24th, we were employed in getting on board the remainder of our water and proviſions, with ſome new pumps, and in ſeveral other operations that were neceſſary to fit the ſhip for the ſea, all which would have been effected much ſooner, if ſickneſs and death had not diſabled or carried off a great number of our men.</p>
                        <p>While we lay here, the Earl of Elgin, Captain Cook, a ſhip belonging to the Engliſh Eaſt India Company, came to an anchor in the Road. She was bound from Madrafs to China, but having loſt her paſſage, put in here to wait for the next ſeaſon. The Phoenix, Captain Black, an Engliſh country ſhip, from Bencoolen, alſo came to an anchor at this place.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon of Chriſtmas eve, the 24th, I took leave of the Governor, and ſeveral of the principal gentlemen of the place, with whom I had formed connections, and from whom I received every poſſible civility and aſſiſtance; but in the mean time an accident happened, which might have produced diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable conſequences. A ſeaman had run away from one of the Dutch ſhips in the Road, and entered on board of mine: the Captain had applied to the Governor, to reclaim him as a ſubject of Holland, and an order for that purpoſe was procured: this order was brought to me ſoon after I returned from my laſt viſit, and I ſaid, that if the man appeared to be a Dutchman, he ſhould certainly be delivered up. Mr. Hicks commanded on board, and I gave the Dutch officer an order to him, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the man up under that condition; I ſlept myſelf this night on ſhore, and in the morning, the Captain of the Dutch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore came and told me that he had carried my order on board, but that the officer had refuſed to deliver up the man, alleging, not only that he was not a Dutchman, but that he was a ſubject of Great Britain, born in Ireland; I replied, that the officer had perfectly executed my orders, and that if the man was an Engliſh ſubject, it could not be expected that I ſhould deliver him up. The Captain then ſaid, that he was juſt come from the Governor, to demand the man of me in his name, as a ſubject of Denmark, alleging, that he ſtood in the ſhip's books as born at Elſineur. The claim of this man as a ſubject of Holland, being now given up, I obſerved to the Captain, that there appeared to be ſome miſtake in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's meſſage, for that he would certainly never demand a Daniſh ſeaman from me, who had committed no other crime than preferring the ſervice of the Engliſh to that of the Dutch. I added, however, to convince him of my ſincere deſire to avoid diſputes, that if the man was a Dane he ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:013324_0491_0F8FFB594B3727A0"/>
up as a courteſy, though he could not be demanded as a right; but that if I found he was an Engliſh ſubject, I would keep him at all events. Upon theſe terms we parted, and ſoon after I received a letter from Mr. Hicks, containing indutiable proof that the ſeaman in queſtion was a ſubject of his Britannic Majeſty. This letter I immediately carried to the Shebander, with a requeſt that it might be ſhewn to the Governor, and that his Excellency might at the ſame time be told, I would not upon any terms part with the man. This had the deſired effect, and I heard no more of the affair.</p>
                        <p>In the evening, I went on board, accompanied by Mr. Banks, and the reſt of the gentlemen who had conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided on ſhore, and who, though better, were not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly recovered.</p>
                        <p>At ſix in the morning, of the 26th, we weighed and ſet ſail, with a light breeze at S. W. The Elgin Indiaman ſaluted us with three cheers and thirteen g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>At this time, the number of ſick on board amounted to forty, and the reſt of the ſhip's company were in a very feeble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Every individual had been ſick except the ſail-maker, an old man between ſeventy and eighty years of age, and it is very remarkable that this old man, during our ſtay at this place, was conſtantly drunk every day: we had burried ſeven, the ſurgeon, three ſeamen, Mr. Green's ſervant, Tupia, and Tayeto his boy. All but Tupia fell a ſacrifice to the unwholeſome, ſtagnant, putrid air of the country, and he who from his birth had been uſed to ſubſiſt chiefly upon vegetable food, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ripe fruit, ſoon contracted all the diſorders that are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene to a ſea life, and would probably have ſunk under them before we could have completed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>BATAVIA, the capital of the Dutch dominions in India, and generally ſuppoſed to have no equal among all the poſſeſſions of the Europeans in Aſia, is ſituated on the north ſide of the iſland of Java, in a low fenny plain, where ſeveral ſmall rivers, which take their riſe in the mountains called Blaeuwen Berg, about forty miles up the country, empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:013324_0492_0F904FD1A7672498"/>
into the ſea, and where the coaſt forms a large bay, called the Bay of Batavia, at the diſtance of about eight leagues from the ſtreight of Sunda. It lies in latitude 6° 10′ S. and longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 106° 50′ E. from the meridian of Greenwich, as appears from aſtronomical obſervations made upon the ſpot, by the Reverend Mr. Mohr, who has built an elegant obſervatory, which is as well furniſhed with inſtruments as moſt in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Dutch ſeem to have pitched upon this ſpot for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of water-carriage, and in that it is indeed a ſecond Holland, and ſuperior to every other place in the world. There are very few ſtreets that have not a canal of conſiderable breadth running through them, or rather ſtagnating in them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſeveral miles in almoſt every direction beyond the town, which is alſo interſected by five or ſix rivers, ſome of which are navigable thirty or forty miles up the country. As the houſes are large, and the ſtreets wide, it takes up a much greater extent, in proportion to the number of houſes it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, than any city in Europe. Valentyn, who wrote an account of it about the year 1726, ſays, that in his time there were, within the walls, 1242 Dutch houſes, and 1200 Chineſe, and without the walls 1066 Dutch and 1240 Chineſe, beſides 12 arrack houſes, making in all 4760: but this account appeared to us to be greatly exaggerated, eſpecially with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the number of houſes within the walls.</p>
                        <p>The ſtreets are ſpacious and handſome, and the banks of the canals are planted with rows of trees, that make a very pleaſing appearance; but the trees concur with the canals to make the ſituation unwholeſome. The ſtagnant canals in the dry ſeaſon exhale an intolerable ſtench, and the trees impede the courſe of the air, by which in ſome degree the putrid effluvia would be diſſipated. In the wet ſeaſon the inconvenience is equal, for then theſe reſervoirs of corrupted water overflow their banks in the lower part of the town, eſpecially in the neighbourhood of the hotel, and fill the lower ſtories of the houſes, where they leave behind them an inconceivable quantity of ſlime and filth: yet theſe canals are ſometimes cleaned; but the cleaning them is ſo managed as to become as great a nuiſance as the foulneſs of the water; for the black mud that is taken from the bottom is ſuffered to lie upon the banks, that is, in the middle of the ſtreet, till it has acquired a ſufficient degree of hardneſs to be made the lading of a boat, and carried away. As this mud conſiſts chiefly of human ordure, which is regularly thrown into the canals every morning, there not being a neceſſary-houſe in the whole town, it poiſons the air while it is drying to a conſiderable extent. Even the running ſtreams become nuiſances in their turn, by the naſtineſs or negligence of the people; for every now and then a dead hog, or a dead horſe, is ſtranded upon the ſhallow parts, and it being the buſineſs of no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:013324_0493_0F8FFB5A0BF10D78"/>
perſon to remove the nuiſance, it is negligently left to time and accident. While we were here, a dead buffalo lay upon the ſhoal of a river that ran through one of the principal ſtreets above a week, and at laſt was carried away by a flood.</p>
                        <p>The houſes are in general well adapted to the climate; they conſiſt of one very large room or hall on the ground floor, with a door at each end, both which generally ſtand open: at one end a room is taken off by a partition, where the maſter of the houſe tranſacts his buſineſs; and in the middle between each end there is a court, which gives light to the hall, and at the ſame time increaſes the draught of air. From one corner of the hall the ſtairs go up to the floor above, where alſo the rooms are ſpacious and airy. In the alcove, which is formed by the court, the family dine; and at other times it is occupied by the female ſlaves, who are not allowed to ſit down any where elſe.</p>
                        <p>The public buildings are, moſt of them, old, heavy, and ungraceful; but the new church is not inelegant; it is built with a dome, that is ſeen from a great diſtance at ſea, and though the outſide has rather a heavy appearance, the inſide forms a very fine room: it is furniſhed with an organ of a proper ſize, being very large, and is moſt magnificently illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by chandeliers.</p>
                        <p>The town is incloſed by a ſtone wall, of a moderate height; but the whole of it is old, and many parts are much out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. This wall itſelf is ſurrounded by a river, which in ſome places is fifty, and in ſome a hundred yards wide: the ſtream is rapid, but the water is ſhallow. The wall is alſo lined within by a canal, which in different parts is of different breadths; ſo that, in paſſing either out or in through the gates, it is neceſſary to croſs two draw-bridges; and there is no acceſs for idle people or ſtrangers to walk upon the ramparts, which ſeem to be but ill provided with guns.</p>
                        <p>In the north eaſt corner of the town ſtands the caſtle or cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, the walls of which are both higher and thicker than thoſe of the town, eſpecially near the landing-place, where there is depth of water only for boats, which it completely commands, with ſeveral large guns that make a very good appearance.</p>
                        <p>Within this caſtle are apartments for the Governor General, and all the Council of India, to which they are enjoined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair in caſe of a ſiege. Here are alſo large ſtorehouſes, where great quantities of the Company's goods are kept, eſpecially thoſe that are brought from Europe, and where almoſt all their writers tranſact their buſineſs. In this place alſo are laid up a great number of cannon, whether to mount upon the walls or furniſh ſhipping, we could not learn; and the Company is ſaid to be well ſupplied with powder, which is diſperſed in various magazines, that if ſome ſhould be deſtroyed by light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which in this place is very frequent, the reſt may eſcape.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="205" facs="unknown:013324_0494_0F8FFB5B2E159F68"/>
Beſides the fortifications of the town, numerous forts are diſperſed about the country to the diſtance of twenty or thirty miles; theſe ſeem to have been intended merely to keep the natives in awe, and indeed they are fit for nothing elſe. For the ſame purpoſe a kind of houſes, each of which mounts about eight guns, are placed in ſuch ſituations as command the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of three or four canals, and conſequently the roads upon their banks: ſome of theſe are in the town itſelf, and it was from one of theſe that all the beſt houſes belonging to the Chineſe were levelled with the ground, in the Chineſe rebellion of 1740, Theſe defences are ſcattered over all parts of Java, and the other iſlands of which the Dutch have got poſſeſſion in theſe ſeas. Of one of theſe ſingular forts, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified houſes, we ſhould have procured a drawing, if our Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen had not been confined by ſickneſs, almoſt all the time they were upon the iſland.</p>
                        <p>If the Dutch fortifications here are not formidable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they become ſo by their ſituation; for they are among moraſſes where the roads, which are nothing more than a bank thrown up between a canal and a ditch, may eaſily be deſtroyed, and conſequently the approach of heavy artillery either totally prevented or greatly retarded: for it would be exceedingly difficult, if not impoſſible to tranſport them in boats, as they all muſter every night under the guns of the caſtle, a ſituation from which it would be impoſſible for an enemy to take them. Beſides, in this country, delay is death; ſo that whatever retards an enemy, will deſtroy him. In leſs than a week we were ſenſible of the unhealthineſs of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; and in leſs than a month half the ſhip's company were unable to do their duty. We were told, that of a hundred ſoldiers who arrive here from Europe, it was a rare thing for fifty to ſurvive the firſt year; that of thoſe fifty, half would then be in the hoſpital, and not ten of the reſt in perfect health: poſſibly this account may be exaggerated; but the pale and feeble wretches whom we ſaw crawling about with a muſquet, which they were ſcarcely able to carry, inclined us to believe that it was true. Every white inhabitant of the town indeed is a ſoldier; the younger are conſtantly muſtered, and thoſe who have ſerved five years are liable to be called out, when their aſſiſtance is thought neceſſary; but as neither of them are ever exerciſed, or do any kind of duty, much cannot be expected from them. The Portugueſe, indeed, are in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good markſmen, becauſe they employ themſelves much in ſhooting wild hogs and deer: neither the Mardykers, nor the Chineſe know the uſe of fire-arms; but as they are ſaid to be brave they might do much execution with their own wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, ſwords, lances, and daggers. The Mardykers are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of all nations, who are deſcended from free anceſtors, or have themſelves been made free.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="206" facs="unknown:013324_0495_0F90F1C47252D7D0"/>
But if it is difficult to attack Batavia by land, it is utterly impoſſible to attack it by ſea: for the water is ſo ſhallow, that it will ſcarcely admit a long boat to come within cannon ſhot of the walls, except in a narrow channel, called the river, that is walled on both ſides by ſtrong piers, and runs about half a mile into the harbour. At the other end, it terminates under the fire of the ſtrongeſt part of the caſtle; and here its communication with the canals that interſect the town is out off by a large wooden boom, which is ſhut every night at ſix o'clock, and upon no pretence opened till the next morning. The harbour of Batavia is accounted the fineſt in India, and to all appearance with good reaſon; it is large enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any number of ſhips, and the ground is ſo good that one anchor will hold till the cable decays: it never admits any ſea that is troubleſome, and its only inconvenience is the ſhoal water between the road and the river. When the ſea breeze blows freſh, it makes a cockling ſea that is dangerous to boats: our long boat once ſtruck two or three times, as ſhe was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to come out, and regained the river's mouth with ſome difficulty. A Dutch boat, laden with ſails and rigging for one of the Indiamen, was entirely loſt.</p>
                        <p>Round the harbour, on the outſide lie many iſlands, which the Dutch have taken poſſeſſion of, and apply to different uſes. To one of them, called Edam, they tranſport all Europeans who have been guilty of crimes that are not worthy of death: ſome are ſentenced to remain there ninety-nine years, ſome forty, ſame twenty, ſome leſs, down to five, in proportion to their offence; and during their baniſhment, they are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſlaves in making ropes, and other drudgery. In another iſland, called Purmerent, they have an hoſpital, where people are ſaid to recover much faſter than at Batavia. In a third, called Kuyper, they have warehouſes belonging to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, chiefly for rice, and other merchandize of ſmall value; and here the foreign ſhips, that are to be laid down at Ouruſt, another of theſe iſlands, which with Kuyper has been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, diſcharge their cargoes at wharfs which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry convenient for the purpoſe. Here the guns, ſails, and other ſtores of the Falmouth, a man of war, which was condemned at this place, when ſhe was returning from Manilla, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited, and the ſhip herſelf remained into the harbour with the only warrant officers on board for many years. Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances were regularly made them from home; but no notice was ever taken of the many memorials they ſent, deſiring to be recalled. Happily for them, the Dutch thought fit, about ſix months before our arrival, to ſell the veſſel and all her ſtores, by public auction, and ſend the officers home in their own ſhips. At Ouruſt, they repair all their own ſhipping, and keep a large quantity of naval ſtores.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="207" facs="unknown:013324_0496_0F90F1CA279E0378"/>
The country round Batavia is for ſome miles a continued range of country houſes and gardens. Many of the gardens are very large, and, by ſome ſtrange fatality, all are planted with trees almoſt as thick as they can ſtand; ſo that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try derives no advantage from its being cleared of the wood that originally covered it, except the fruit of that which has been planted in its room. Theſe impenetrable foreſts ſtand in a dead ſlat, which extends ſome miles beyond them, and is interſected in many directions by rivers, and more ſtill by canals, which are navigable for ſmall veſſels. Nor is this the worſt, for the fence of every field and garden is a ditch; and interſperſed among the cultivated ground there are many fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy fens, bogs and moraſſes, as well freſh as ſalt.</p>
                        <p>It is not ſtrange that the inhabitants of ſuch a country ſhould be familiar with diſeaſe and death: preventive medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are taken almoſt as regularly as food; and every body expects the returns of ſickneſs, as we do the ſeaſons of the year. We did not ſee a ſingle face in Batavia that indicated perfect health, for there is not the leaſt tint of colour in the cheeks either of men or women: the women indeed are moſt delicately fair; but with the appearance of diſeaſe there never can be perfect beauty. People talk of death with as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference as they do in a camp; and when an acquaintance is ſaid to be dead, the common reply is, <q>Well, he owed me nothing; or, I muſt yet my money of his executors.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this deſcription of the environs of Batavia there are but two exceptions. The Governor's country houſe is ſituated upon a riſing ground; but its aſcent is ſo inconſiderable, that it is known to be above the common level only by the canals being left behind, and the appearance of a few bad hedges: his Excellency, however, who is a native of this place, has, with ſome trouble and expence, contrived to incloſe his own garden with a ditch; ſuch is the influence of habit both upon the taſte and the underſtanding. A famous market alſo, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Paſſar Tanabank, is held upon an eminence that riſes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly about thirty feet above the plain; and except theſe ſituations, the ground, for an extent of between thirty and forty miles round Batavia, is exactly parallel to the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon. At the diſtance of about forty miles inland there are hills of a conſiderable height, where, as we were informed, the air is healthy, and comparatively cool. Here the vegetables of Europe flouriſh in great perfection, particularly ſtrawberries, which can but ill bear heat; and the inhabitants are vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ruddy. Upon theſe hills ſome of the principal people have country houſes, which they viſit once a year; and one was begun for the Governor upon the plan of Blenheim, the famous ſeat of the Duke of Marlborough, in Oxfordſhire, but it has never been finiſhed. To theſe hills alſo people are ſent
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:013324_0497_0F90F1CB95A653F0"/>
by the phyſicians, for the recovery of their health, and the effects of the air are ſaid to be almoſt miraculous: the patient grows well in a ſhort time, but conſtantly relapſes ſoon after his return to Batavia.</p>
                        <p>But the ſame ſituation and circumſtances which render Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia and the country round it unwholeſome, render it the beſt gardener's ground in the world. The ſoil is fruitful beyond imagination, and the conveniencies and luxuries of life that it produces are almoſt without number.</p>
                        <p>Rice, which is well known to be the corn of theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and to ſerve the inhabitants inſtead of bread, grows in great plenty: and I muſt here obſerve, that in the hilly parts of Java, and in many of the eaſtern iſlands, a ſpecies of this grain is planted, which in the weſtern parts of India is intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unknown. It is called by the natives PADDY GUNUNG, or Mountain rice; this, contrary to the other ſort which muſt be under water three parts in four of the time of its growth, is planted upon the ſides of hills, where no water but rain can come: it is however planted at the beginning of the rainy ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and reaped in the beginning of ſhe dry. How far this kind of rice might be uſeful in our Weſt Indian iſlands, where no bread corn is grown, it may perhaps be worth while to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                        <p>Indian corn, or maize, is alſo produced here, which the inhabitants gather when young, and toaſt in the ear. Here is alſo a great variety of kidney beans, and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Sugar is alſo produced here in immenſe quantities: very great crops of the fineſt and largeſt canes that can be imagined are produced with very little care, and yield a much larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of ſugar than the canes of the Weſt Indies. White ſugar is ſold here at two pence half-penny a pound; and the molaſſes makes the arrack, of which, as of rum, it is the chief ingredient; a ſmall quantity of rice, and ſome cocoa-nut wine being added, chiefly, I ſuppoſe, to give it flavour. A ſmall quantity of indigo is alſo produced here, not as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of trade, but merely for home conſumption.</p>
                        <p>But the moſt abundant article of vegetable luxury here, is
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:013324_0498_0F90F1D119804648"/>
the fruit; of which there is no leſs than ſix and thirty diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds, and I ſhall give a very brief account of each.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The pine apple; <hi>Bromelia Ananas.</hi> This fruit, which is here called <hi>Nanas,</hi> grows very large, and in ſuch plenty that they may ſometimes be bought at the firſt hand for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a piece; and at the common fruit ſhops we got three of them for two pence half-penny. They are very juicy and well flavoured; but we all agreed we had eaten as good from a hot-houſe in England: they are however ſo luxuriant in their growth that moſt of them have two or three crowns, and a great number of ſuckers from the bottom of the fruit; of theſe Mr. Banks once counted nine, and they are ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that very often while they ſtill adhered to the parent plant they ſhot out their fruit, which, by the time the large one became ripe, were of no inconſiderable ſize. We ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times ſaw three upon one apple, and were told that a plant once produced a cluſter of nine, beſides the principal: this indeed was conſidered as ſo great a curioſity, that it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in ſugar, and ſent to the Prince of Orange.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Sweet Oranges. Theſe are very good, but while we were here ſold for ſix pence a piece.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Pumplemoeſes, which in the Weſt Indies are called Shaddocks. Theſe were well flavoured, but not juicy! their want of juice however was an accidental effect of the ſeaſon.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Lemons. Theſe were very ſcarce; but the want of them was amply compenſated by the plenty of limes.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Limes. Theſe were excellent, and to be bought at about twelve pence a hundred. We ſaw only two or three Seville oranges, which were almoſt all rind; and there are many ſorts both of oranges and lemons, which I ſhall not particularly mention, becauſe they are neither eſteemed by Europeans, nor the natives themſelves.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Mangos. This fruit during our ſtay was ſo infeſted with maggots, which bred in the inſide of them, that ſcarcely one in three was eatable; and the beſt of them were much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to thoſe of Brazil; they are generally compared by Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans to a melting peach, which, indeed, they reſemble in ſoftneſs and ſweetneſs, but certainly fall much ſhort in flavour. The climate here, we were told, is too hot and damp for them; but there are as many ſorts of them as there are of apples in England, and ſome are much ſuperior to others. One ſort which is called <hi>Mangha Cowani,</hi> has ſo ſtrong a ſmell that a European can ſcarcely bear one in the room; theſe, however, the natives are fond of. The three ſorts which are generally preferred, are the <hi>Mangha Doodool,</hi> the <hi>Mangha San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                              </gap>ock,</hi> and the <hi>Mangha Gure.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. Bananes. Of theſe alſo there are innumerable ſorts, but three are only good; the <hi>Piſſang Mas,</hi> the <hi>Piſſang Radja,</hi>
                           <pb n="210" facs="unknown:013324_0499_0F90F1D2A4B93EC0"/>
and the <hi>Piſſang Ambou:</hi> all theſe have a pleaſant vinous taſte, and the reſt are uſeful in different ways; ſome are fried in batter, and others are boiled and eaten as bread. There is one which deſerves the particular notice of the botaniſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe contrary to the nature of its tribe, it is full of ſeeds, and is therefore called <hi>Piſſang Batu,</hi> or <hi>Piſſang Bidjie;</hi> it has how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever no excellence to recommend it to the taſte, but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays uſe it as a remedy for the flux.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Grapes. Theſe are not in great perfection, but they are very dear; for we could not buy a moderate bunch for leſs than a ſhilling or eighteen pence.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Tamarinds. Theſe are in great plenty, and very cheap: The people however do not put them up in the manner prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by the Weſt-Indians, but cure them with ſalt, by which means they become a black maſs, ſo diſagreeable to the ſight and taſte, that few Europeans chuſe to meddle with them.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Water melons. Theſe are in great plenty, and very good.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Pumpkins. Theſe are beyond compariſon the moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fruit that can be carried to ſea; for they will keep without any care ſeveral months, and with ſugar and lemon juice, make a pye that can ſcarcely be diſtinguiſhed from one made of the beſt apples; and with pepper and ſalt, they are a ſubſtitute for turneps not to be deſpiſed.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Papaws. This fruit when it is ripe is full of ſeeds, and almoſt without flavour; but if when it is green it is pared, and the core taken out, it is better than the beſt turnep.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Guava. This fruit is much commended by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of our iſlands in the Weſt Indies, who probably have a better ſort than we met with here, where the ſmell of them was ſo diſagreeably ſtrong that it made ſome of us ſick; thoſe who taſted them, ſaid, that the flavour was equally rank.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Sweet ſop. The <hi>Annona ſquammoſa</hi> of Linaeus. This is alſo a Weſt Indian fruit; it conſiſts only of a maſs of large kernels, from which a ſmall proportion of pulp may be ſucked, which is very ſweet, but has little flavour.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. Cuſtard apple. The <hi>Annona reticulata</hi> of Linaeus. The quality of this fruit is well expreſſed by its Engliſh name, which it acquired in the Weſt Indies; for it is as like a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard, and a good one too, as can be imagined.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. The caſhew apple. This is ſeldom eaten on account of its aſtringency. The nut that grows upon the top of it is well known in Europe.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. The cocoa-nut. This is alſo well known in Europe: there are ſeveral ſorts, but the beſt of thoſe we found here is called <hi>Calappi Edjou,</hi> and is eaſily known by the redneſs of the fleſh between the ſkin and the ſhell.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Mangoſtan. The <hi>Garci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ia Mangoſtana</hi> of Linaeus. This
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:013324_0500_0F90F1D2C8B3DC08"/>
fruit, which is peculiar to the Eaſt-Indies, is about the ſize of the crab apple, and of a deep red wine-colour: on the top of it is the figure of five or ſix ſmall triangles joined in a circle, and at the bottom ſeveral hollow green leaves, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the bloſſom. When they are to be eaten, the ſkin, or rather fleſh, muſt be taken off, under which are found ſix or ſeven white kernels, placed in a circular order, and the pulp with which theſe are inveloped, is the fruit, than which nothing can be more delicious: it is a happy mixture of the tart and the ſweet, which is no leſs wholeſome than pleaſant; and with the ſweet orange, this fruit is allowed in any quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to thoſe who are afflicted with fevers, either of the putrid or inflammatory kind.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. The jamboo. The <hi>Eugenia Mallaccenſis</hi> of Linnaeus. This fruit is of a deep red colour, and an oval ſhape; the largeſt, which are always the beſt, are not bigger than a ſmall apple; they are pleaſant and cooling, though they have not much flavour.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. The jambu-eyer. A ſpecies of the <hi>Eugenia</hi> of Linnaeus. Of this fruit there are two ſorts of a ſimilar ſhape, reſembling a bell, but differing in colour; one being red, the other white. They ſomewhat exceed a large cherry in ſize, and in taſte have neither flavour nor even ſweetneſs, containing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a watry juice, ſlightly acidulated; yet their cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs recommends them in this hot country.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. Jambu-eyer mauwar. The <hi>Eugenia jambos</hi> of Linnaeus. This is more grateful to the ſmell than the taſte; in taſte it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the conſerve of roſes, and in ſmell the freſh ſcent of thoſe flowers.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. The pomgranate. This is the ſame fruit that is known by the ſame name all over Europe.</p>
                        <p n="23">23. Durion. A fruit that in ſhape reſembles a ſmall melon, but the ſkin is covered with ſharp conical ſpines, whence its name; for <hi>dure,</hi> in the Malay language, ſignifies prickle. When it is ripe, it divides longitudinally into ſeven or eight compartments, each of which contains ſix or ſeven nuts, not quite ſo large as cheſnuts, which are covered with a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that in colour and conſiſtence very much reſembles thick cream: this is the part that is eaten, and the natives are fond of it to exceſs. To Europeans it is generally diſagreeable at firſt; for in taſte, it ſomewhat reſembles a mixture of cream, ſugar, and onions; and in the ſmell the onions predominate.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. Nanca. This fruit, which in ſome parts of India is called Jack, has, like the Durion, a ſmell very diſagreeable to ſtrangers, and ſomewhat reſembling that of mellow apples mixed with garlic: the flavour is not more adapted to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral taſte. In ſome countries that are favourable to it, it is ſaid to grow to an immenſe ſize. Rumphius relates, that it
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:013324_0501_0F90F1D39F160DB8"/>
is ſometimes ſo large that a man cannot eaſily lift it; and we were told by a Malay, that at Madura it is ſometimes ſo large as not to be carried but by the united efforts of two men. At Batavia, however, they never exceed the ſize of a large melon, which in ſhape they very much reſemble: they are covered with angular prickles, like the ſhootings of ſome chryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, which however are not hard enough to wound thoſe who handle them.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. Champada. This differs from the Nanca in little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſize, it not being ſo big.</p>
                        <p n="26">26. Rambutan. This is a fruit little known to Europeans; in appearance it very much reſembles a cheſnut with the huſk on, and like that, is covered with ſmall points, which are ſoft and of a deep red colour: under this ſkin is the fruit, and within the fruit a ſtone; the eatable part therefore is ſmall in quantity, but its acid is perhaps more agreeable than any other in the whole vegetable kingdom.</p>
                        <p n="27">27. Jambolan. This in ſize and appearance is not unlike a damaſcene; but in taſte is ſtill more aſtringent, and therefore leſs agreeable.</p>
                        <p n="28">28. The Boa Bidarra; or <hi>Rhamnus Juj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ba</hi> of Linnaeus. This is a round yellow fruit, about the ſize of a gooſeberry; its flavour is like that of an apple, but it has the aſtringency of a crab.</p>
                        <p n="29">29. Nam nam. The <hi>Cynometra Cauliflora</hi> of Linnaeus. This fruit in ſhape ſomewhat reſembles a kidney; it is about three inches long, and the outſide is very rough: it is ſeldom eaten raw, but fried with batter it makes a good fritter.</p>
                        <p n="30, 31">30, 31. The Catappa, or <hi>Terminalia Catappa,</hi> and the Canare, the <hi>Canarium commune</hi> of Linaeus; are both nuts, with kernels ſomewhat reſembling an almond; but the difficulty of breaking the ſhell is ſo great, that they are no where publicly ſold. Thoſe which we taſted were gathered for curioſity by Mr. Banks, from the tree upon which they grew.</p>
                        <p n="32">32. The Madja; or <hi>Limonia</hi> of Linnaeus; contains, under a hard brittle ſhell, a lightly acid pulp, which cannot be eaten without ſugar; and with it, is not generally thought pleaſant.</p>
                        <p n="33">33. Suntul. The <hi>Trichilia</hi> of Linnaeus. This is the worſt of all the fruits that I ſhall particularly mention: in ſize and ſhape it reſembles the Madja; and within a thick ſkin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains kernels like thoſe of the Mangoſtan, the taſte of which is both acid and aſtringent, and ſo diſagreeable that we were ſurpriſed to ſee it expoſed upon the fruit-ſtalls.</p>
                        <p n="34, 35, 36">34, 35, 36. The Blimbing, or <hi>Averrhoa Belimbi;</hi> the Blimbing Beſſe, or <hi>Averrhoa Carambola;</hi> and the Cherrema, or <hi>Averhoa acida</hi> of Linnaeus, are three ſpecies of one genus; and though they differ in ſhape, are nearly of the ſame taſte. The Blimbing Beſſe is the ſweeteſt: the other two are ſo auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terely
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:013324_0502_0F90F1D436D6B240"/>
acid, that they cannot be uſed without dreſſing; they make however excellent pickles and ſour ſauce.</p>
                        <p n="37">37. The Salack; or <hi>Calamus Rotang Zalacca</hi> of Linnaeus. This is the fruit of a prickly buſh; it is about as big as a wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut, and covered with ſcales, like thoſe of a lizard: below the ſcales are two or three yellow kernels, in flavour ſomewhat reſembling a ſtrawberry.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe, the iſland of Java, and particularly the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try round Batavia, produces many kinds of fruit which were not in ſeaſon during our ſtay; we were alſo told that apples, ſtrawberries, and many other fruits from Europe, had been planted up in the mountains, and flouriſhed there in great lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xuriance. We ſaw ſeveral fruits preſerved in ſugar, that we did not ſee recent from the tree, one of which is called <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kit,</hi> and another <hi>Boa A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ap:</hi> and here are ſeveral others which are eaten only by the natives, particularly the <hi>Kellor,</hi> the <hi>Guilin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina,</hi> the <hi>Moringa,</hi> and the <hi>Soccum.</hi> The Soccum is of the ſame kind with the bread-fruit in the South Sea iſlands, but ſo much inferior, that if it had not been for the ſimilitude in the outward appearance both of the fruit and the tree, we ſhould not have referred it to that claſs. Theſe and ſome others do not merit to be particularly mentioned.</p>
                        <p>The quantity of fruit that is conſumed at Batavia is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; but that which is publicly expoſed to ſale is generally over-ripe. A ſtranger however may get good fruit in a ſtreet called Paſſar Piſſang, which lies north from the great church, and very near it. This ſtreet is inhabited by none but Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe fruit-ſellers, who are ſupplied from the gardens of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the neighbourhood of the town, with ſuch as is freſh, and excellent in its kind, for which however they muſt be paid more than four times the market price.</p>
                        <p>The town in general is ſupplied from a conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, where great quantities of land are cultivated merely for the production of fruit. The country people, to whom theſe lands belong, meet the people of the town at two great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; one on Monday, called Paſſar Sineen; and the other on Saturday, called Paſſar Tanabank. Theſe fairs are held at places conſiderably diſtant from each other, for the convenience of different diſtricts; neither of them however are more than five miles diſtant from Batavia. At theſe fairs, the beſt fruit may be bought at the cheapeſt rate; and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> loads of the fineſt pine apples, packed as careleſsly as turneps in England, are common, and other fruit in the ſame profuſion. The days however on which theſe markets are held are ill contrived; the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Saturday and Monday is too ſhort, and that between Monday and Saturday too long: great part of what is bought
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:013324_0503_0F90F1D5CA64FAF0"/>
on Monday is always much the worſe for keeping before a new ſtock can be bought, either by the retailer or conſumer; ſo that for ſeveral days in every week there is no good fruit in the hands of any people but the Chineſe in Paſſar Piſſang.</p>
                        <p>The inhabitants of this part of India practiſe a luxury which ſeems to be but little attended to in other countries; they are continually burning aromatic woods and reſins, and ſcatter odours round them in a profuſion of flowers, poſſibly as an antidote to the noiſome effluvia of their ditches and canals. Of ſweet ſmelling flowers they have a great variety, altogether unknown in Europe, the chief of which I ſhall briefly deſcribe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Champaka</hi> or <hi>Michelia Champacca.</hi> This grows upon a tree as large as an apple tree, and conſiſts of fifteen long narrow petala, which give it the appearance of being double, though in reality it is not ſo: its colour is yellow, and much deeper than that of a jonquil, to which it has ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in ſmell.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Cananga</hi> or <hi>Uvaria Cananga,</hi> is a green flower, not at all reſembling the bloſſom of any tree or plant in Europe: It has indeed more the appearance of a bunch of leaves than a flower; its ſcent is agreeable, but altogether peculiar to itſelf.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Mulatti,</hi> or <hi>Nyctanthes Sambac.</hi> This is well known in Engliſh hot-houſes by the name of Arabian jeſſamine: it grows here in the greateſt profuſion, and its fragrance, like that of all other Indian flowers, though exquiſitely pleaſing, has not that over-powering ſtrength which diſtinguiſhes ſome of the ſame ſorts in Europe.</p>
                        <p n="4, 5">4, 5. The <hi>Combang Caracnaſſi,</hi> and <hi>Combang Tonquin, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularia Gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>bro.</hi> Theſe are ſmall flowers, of the dog's-bane kind, very much reſembling each other in ſhape and ſmell, highly fragrant, but very different from every product of an Engliſh garden.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The <hi>Bonga Tanjong,</hi> or <hi>Mimouſops El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ngi</hi> of Linnaeus. This flower is ſhaped like a ſtar of ſeven or eight rays, and is about half an inch in diameter; it is of a yellowiſh colour, and has an agreeable ſmell.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe, there is the <hi>Sundal Malam,</hi> or <hi>Polianthes Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beroſa.</hi> This flower, being the ſame with our own tuberoſe, can have no place among thoſe that are unknown in Europe, but I mention it for its Malay name, which ſignifies <q>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguer of the Night,</q> and is not inelegantly conceived. The heat of this climate is ſo great, that few flowers exhale their ſweets in the day; and this in particular, from its total want of ſcent at that time, and the modeſty of its colour, which is white, ſeems negligent of attracting admirers, but as ſoon as night comes on, it diffuſes its fragrance, and at once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels the attention, and excites the complacency of all who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="215" facs="unknown:013324_0504_0F90F1D6857DA7A8"/>
Theſe are all ſold about the ſtreets every evening at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, either ſtrung upon a thread, in wreaths of about two feet long, or made up into noſegays of different forms, either of which may be purchaſed for about a halfpenny. Beſides theſe, there are in private gardens, many other ſweet flowers, which are not produced in a ſufficient quantity to be brought to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. With a mixture of theſe flowers, and the leaves of a plant called <hi>pandang,</hi> cut into ſmall pieces, perſons of both ſexes fill their hair and their clothes, and with the ſame mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indulge a much higher luxury by ſtrewing it on their beds, ſo that the chamber in which they ſleep, breathes the richeſt and pureſt of all odours, unallayed by the fumes which cannot but ariſe where the ſleeper lies under two or three blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets and a quilt, for the bed covering here is nothing more than a ſingle piece of fine chintz.</p>
                        <p>Before I cloſe my account of the vegetable productions of this part of India, I muſt take ſome notice of the ſpices. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va originally produced none but pepper. This is now ſent from hence into Europe to a great value, but the quantity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed here is very ſmall: the inhabitants uſe <hi>Capſicum,</hi> or, as it is called in Europe, Cayan pepper, almoſt univerſally in its ſtead. Cloves and nutmegs, having been monopolized by the Dutch, are become too dear to be plentifully uſed by the other inhabitants of this country, who are very fond of them. Cloves, although they are ſaid originally to have been the produce of Machian, or Bachian, a ſmall iſland far to the eaſtward, and only fifteen miles to the northward of the line, and to have been from thence diſſeminated by the Dutch, at their firſt coming into theſe parts, over all the eaſtern iſlands, are now confined to Amboina, and the ſmall iſles that lie in its neighbourhood; the Dutch having, by different treaties of peace between them and the conquered kings of all the other iſlands, ſtipulated, that they ſhould have only a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of trees in their dominions, and in future quarrels, as a puniſhment for diſobedience and rebellion leſſened the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, till at laſt they left them no claim to any. Nutmegs have in a manner been extirpated in all the iſlands except their firſt native ſoil, Banda, which eaſily ſupplies every nation upon earth, and would as eaſily ſupply every nation upon earth, and would as eaſily ſupply every nation in another globe of the ſame dimenſions, if there was any ſuch to which the induſtrious Hollander could tranſport the commodity; it is, however, certain, that there are a few trees of this ſpice upon the coaſt of New Guinea. There may perhaps be both cloves and nutmegs upon the other iſlands to the eaſtward; for thoſe, neither the Dutch, nor any other European, ſeem to think it worth while to examine.</p>
                        <p>The principal tame quadrupeds of this county are horſes,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:013324_0505_0F90F1D7431100F0"/>
cattle, buffalos, ſheep, goats, and hogs. The horſes are ſmall, never exceeding in ſize what we call a ſtout galloway, but they are nimble and ſpirited, and are reported to have been found here when the Europeans firſt came round the Cape of Good Hope. The horned cattle are ſaid to be the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as thoſe in Europe, but they differ ſo much in appearance, that we were inclined to doubt it: they have indeed the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learia</hi> or <hi>dewlap,</hi> which naturaliſts make the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic of the European ſpecies, but they certainly are found wild, not only in Java but ſeveral of the eaſtern iſlands. The fleſh of thoſe that we eat at Batavia, had a finer grain than European beef, but it was leſs juicy, and miſerably lean. Buffaloes are plenty, but the Dutch never eat them, nor will they drink their milk, being prepoſſeſſed with a notion that both are unwholeſome, and tend to produce fevers; though the natives and Chineſe eat both, without any injury to their health. The ſheep are of the kind which have long ears that hang down, and hair inſtead of wool: the fleſh of theſe is hard and tough, and in every reſpect the worſt mutton we ever ſaw: we found here, however, a few Cape ſheep, which are excellent, but ſo dear that we gave five and forty ſhilling a piece for four of them, the heavieſt of which weighed only five and forty pounds. The goats are not better than the ſheep, but the hogs, eſpecially the Chineſe breed, are incomparable, and ſo far, that the purchaſer agrees for the lean ſeperately. The butcher, who is always a Chineſe, without the leaſt ſcruple cuts off as much of the fa as he is deſired, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſells it to his countrymen, who melt it down, and eat it inſtead of butter with their rice: but notwithſtanding the excellence of this pork, the Dutch are ſo ſtrongly prejudiced in favour of every thing that comes from their native country, that they eat only of the Dutch breed, which are here ſold as much dearer than the Chineſe, as the Chineſe are ſold dearer than the Dutch in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe animals, which are tame, they have dogs and cats, and there are among the diſtant mountains ſome wild horſes and cattle: buffalos are not found wild in any part of Java, though they abound in Maccaſſar, and ſeveral other eaſtern iſland. The neighbourhood of Batavia, however, is plentifully ſupplied with two kinds of deer, and wild hogs, which are ſold at a reaſonable price by the Portugueſe, who ſhoot them, and are very good food.</p>
                        <p>Among the mountains, and in the deſart parts of the iſland, there are tygers, it is ſaid, in great abundance, and ſome rhinoceroſes; in theſe parts alſo there are monkies, and there are a few of them even in the neighbourhood of Batavia.</p>
                        <p>Of fiſh, here is an amazing plenty; many ſorts are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and all are very cheap, except the few that are ſcarce.
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:013324_0506_0F90F1D805A93FD0"/>
It happens here, as in other places, that vanity gets the better even of appetite: the cheap fiſh, moſt of which is of the beſt kind, is the food only of ſlaves, and that which is dear, only becauſe it is ſcarce, and very much inferior in every reſpect, is placed upon the tables of the rich. A ſenſible houſe-keeper once ſpoke to us freely upon the ſubject. I know, ſaid he, as well as you, that I could purchaſe a better diſh of fiſh for a ſhilling, than what now coſts me ten; but if I ſhould make ſo good uſe of my money, I ſhould here be as much deſpiſed, as you would be in Europe, if you were to cover your table with offals, fit only for beggars or dogs.</p>
                        <p>Turtle is alſo found here, but it is neither ſo ſweet, nor ſo fat as the Weſt Indian turtle, even in London; ſuch as it is, however, we ſhould conſider it as a dainty; but the Dutch, among other ſingularities, do not eat it. We ſaw ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, or Inguanas, here of a very large ſize; we were told that ſome were as thick as man's thigh, and Mr. Banks ſhot one that was five feet long: the fleſh of this animal proved to be very good food.</p>
                        <p>Poultry is very good here, and in great plenty: fowls of a very large ſize, ducks, and geeſe are very cheap; pigeons are dear, and the price of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>rkies extravagant. We ſometimes found the fleſh of theſe animals lean and dry, but this was merely the effect of their being ill fed, for thoſe that we fed ourſelves were as good as any of the ſame kind that we had taſted in Europe, and we ſometimes thought them even better.</p>
                        <p>Wild fowl in general is ſcarce. We once ſaw a wild duck in the fields, but never any that were to be ſold. We fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſaw ſnipes of two kinds, one of them exactly the ſame as that in Europe, and a kind of thruſh was always to be had in great plenty of the Portugueſe, who, for I know not what reaſon, ſeem to have monopolized the wild fowl and game. Of ſnipes it is remarkable that they are found in more parts of the world than any other bird, being common almoſt all over Europe, Aſia, Africa, and America.</p>
                        <p>With reſpect to drink, Nature has not been quite ſo liberal to the inhabitants of Java as to ſome whom ſhe has placed in the leſs fruitful regions of the north. The native Javaneſe, and moſt of the other Indians who inhabit this iſland, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Mahometans, and therefore have no reaſon to regret the want of wine; but, as if the prohibition of their law reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only the manner of becoming drunk, and not drunkenneſs itſelf, they chew opium, to the total ſubverſion not only of their underſtanding but their health.</p>
                        <p>The arrack that is made here, is too well known to need a deſcription: beſides which, the palm yields a wine of the ſame kind with that which has already been deſcribed in the account of the iſland of Savu; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The firſt, in which it is called <hi>Tuac maniſe,</hi> differs little from that in which it comes from the tree; yet even this has received ſome preparation altogether unknown to us, in conſequence of which it will keep eight and forty hours, though otherwiſe it would ſpoil in twelve: in this ſtate it has an agreeable ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and will not intoxicate. In the other two ſtates it has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone a fermentation, and received an infuſion of certain herbs and roots, by which it looſes its ſweetneſs, and acquires a taſte very auſtere and diſagreeable. In one of theſe ſtates it is called <hi>Tuac cras,</hi> and in the other <hi>Tuac cunning,</hi> but the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific difference I do not know; in both, however, it intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates very powerfully. A liquor called Tuac is alſo made from the cocoa-nut tree, but this is uſed chiefly to put into the arrack, for in that which is good it is an eſſential ingredient.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XIV. Some Account of the Inhabitants of Batavia, and the adjacent Country, their Manners, Cuſtoms, and Manner of Life.</head>
                        <p>THE town of Batavia, although, as I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, it is the capital of the Dutch dominions in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, is ſo far from being peopled with Dutchmen, that not one fifth part, even of the European inhabitants of the town, and its environs, are natives of Holland, or of Dutch extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the greater part are Portugueſe, and beſides Europeans, there are Indians of various nations, and Chineſe, beſides a great number of negro ſlaves. In the troops, there are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of almoſt every country in Europe, but the Germans are more than all the reſt put together; there are ſome Engliſh and French, but the Dutch, though other Europeans are permitted to get money here, keep all the power in their own hands, and conſequently poſſeſs all public employments. No man, of whatever nation, can come hither to ſettle, in any other character than that of a ſoldier in the Company's ſervice, in which, before they are accepted, they muſt covenant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main five years. As ſoon however, as this form has been complied with, they are allowed, upon application to the council, to abſent themſelves from their corps, and enter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into any branch of trade, which their money or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit will enable them to carry on; and by this means it is that all the white inhabitants of the place are ſoldiers.</p>
                        <p>Women, however, of all nations, are permitted to ſettle here, without coming under any reſtrictions; yet we were told that there were not, when when we were at Batavia, twenty
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:013324_0508_0F90F1D9928C1BA0"/>
women in the place that were born in Europe but that the white women, who were by no means ſcarce, were deſcendants from European parents of the third and fourth generation, the gleanings of many families who had ſucceſſively come hither, and in the male line become extinct; for it is certain that, whatever be the cauſe, this climate is not ſo fatal to the ladies as to the other ſex.</p>
                        <p>Theſe women imitate the Indians in every particular; their dreſs is made of the ſame materials, their hair is worn in the ſame manner, and they are equally enſlaved by the habit of chewing betele.</p>
                        <p>The merchants carry on their buſineſs here with leſs trouble perhaps than in any other part of the world: every manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is managed by the Chineſe, who ſell the produce of their labour to the merchant, reſident here, for they are permitted to ſell it to no one elſe; ſo that when a ſhip comes in, and beſpeaks perhaps an hundred leagers of arrack, or any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of other commodities, the merchant has nothing to do but to ſend orders to his Chineſe, to ſee them delivered on board: he obeys the command, brings a receipt ſigned by the maſter of the ſhip for the goods to his employer, who receives the money, and having deducted his profit, pays the Chineſe his demand. With goods that are imported, however, the merchant has a little more trouble, for theſe he muſt examine, receive, and lay up in his warehouſe, according to the practice of other countries.</p>
                        <p>The Portugueſe are called by the natives <hi>Oranſerane,</hi> or Nazareen men, (Oran, being Man in the language of the country) to diſtinguiſh them from other Europeans; yet they are included in the general appellation of <hi>Caper,</hi> or <hi>Caf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>r,</hi> an opprobrious term, applied by Mahometans to all who do not profeſs their faith. Theſe people, however, are Portugueſe only in name; they have renounced the religion of Rome, and become Lutherans: neither have they the leaſt communication with the country of their forefathers, or even knowledge of it: they ſpeak indeed a corrupt dialect of the Portugueſe language, but much more frequently uſe the Malay: they are never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to employ themſelves in any but mean occupations: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them live by hunting, many by waſhing linen, and ſome are handycraftſmen and artificers. They have adopted all the cuſtoms of the Indians, from whom they are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chiefly by their features and complexion, their ſkin being conſiderably darker, and their noſes more ſharp; their dreſs is exactly the ſame, except in the manner of wearing their hair.</p>
                        <p>The Indians, who are mixed with the Dutch and Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe in the town of Batavia, and the country adjacent, are not, as might be ſuppoſed, Javaneſe, the original natives of
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:013324_0509_0F90EC9676758B28"/>
the iſland, but natives of the various iſlands from which the Dutch import ſlaves, and are either ſuch as have themſelves been manumized, or the deſcendants of thoſe who formerly received manumiſſion; and they are all comprehended under the general name of <hi>Oranſlam,</hi> or <hi>Iſalam,</hi> ſignifying Believers of the true Faith. The natives of every country, however, in other reſpects keep themſelves diſtinct from the reſt, and are not leſs ſtrongly marked than the ſlaves by the vices or virtues of their reſpective nations. Many of theſe employ themſelves in the cultivation of gardens, and in ſelling fruit and flowers. The betele and areca, which are here called <hi>Siri</hi> and <hi>Pinang,</hi> and chewed by both ſexes and every rank in amazing quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are all grown by theſe Indians: lime is alſo mixed with theſe roots here as it is in Savu, but it is leſs pernicious to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eeth, becauſe it is firſt ſlaked, and, beſides the lime, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance called <hi>gambir,</hi> which is brought from the continent of India; the better ſort of women alſo add cardamum, and many other aromatics, to give the breath an agreeable ſmell. Some of the Indians, however, are employed in fiſhing, and as lighter-men, to carry goods from place to place by water; and ſome are rich, and live with much of the ſplendour of their country, which chiefly conſiſts in the number of their ſlaves.</p>
                        <p>In the article of food theſe Iſalams are remarkably temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate: it conſiſts chiefly of boiled rice, with a ſmall proportion of buffalo, fiſh, or fowl, and ſometimes of dried fiſh, and dried ſhrimps, which are brought hither from China; every diſh, however, is highly ſeaſoned with Cayan pepper, and they have many kinds of paſtry made of rice flower, and other things to which I am a ſtranger; they eat alſo a great deal of fruit, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly plantanes.</p>
                        <p>But notwithſtanding their general temperance, their feaſts are plentiful, and, according to their manner, magnificent. As they are Mahometans, wine and ſtrong liquors profeſſedly make no part of their entertainment, neither do they often indulge with them privately, contenting themſelves with their betele and opium.</p>
                        <p>The principal ſolemnity among them is a wedding, upon which occaſion both the families borrow as many ornaments of gold and ſilver as they can, to adorn the bride and bridegroom, ſo that their dreſſes are very ſhowy and magnificent. The feaſts that are given upon theſe occaſions among the rich, laſt ſometimes a fortnight, and ſometimes longer; and during this time, the man, although married on the firſt day, is by the women, kept from his wife.</p>
                        <p>The language that is ſpoken among all theſe people, from what place ſoever they originally came, is the Malay; at leaſt it is a language ſo called, and probably it is a very corrupt dialect of that ſpoken at Malacca. Every little iſland indeed has a
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:013324_0510_0F90F1DB27F994E0"/>
language of its own, and Java has two or three, but this lingua franca is the only language that is now ſpoken here, and, as I am told, it prevails over a great part of the Eaſt Indies. A dictionary of Malay and Engliſh was publiſhed in London by Thomas Bowrey, in the year 1701.</p>
                        <p>Their women wear as much hair as can grow upon the head, and to increaſe the quantity, they uſe oils, and other prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratious of various kinds. Of this ornament Nature has been very liberal; it is univerſally black, and is formed into a kind of circular wreath upon the top of the head, where it is faſtened with a bodkin, in a taſte which we thought inexpreſſibly elegant: the wreath of hair is ſurrounded by another of flowers, in which the Arabian jeſſamine is beautifully intermixed with the golden ſtars of the <hi>Bonger Tanjong.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Both ſexes conſtantly bathe themſelves in the river at leaſt once a day, a practice which, in this hot country, is equally neceſſary both to perſonal delicacy and health. The teeth of theſe people alſo, whatever they may ſuffer in their colour by chewing betele, are an object of great attention: the ends of them, both in the upper and under jaw, are rubbed with a kind of whetſtone, by a very troubleſome and painful operation, till they are perfectly even and flat, ſo that they cannot loſe leſs than half a line in their length. A deep groove is then made croſs the teeth of the upper jaw, parallel with the gums, and in the middle between them and the extremity of the teeth; the depth of its groove is at leaſt equal to one-fourth of the thickneſs of the teeth, ſo that it penetrates far beyond what is called the enamel, the leaſt injury to which, according to the dentiſts of Europe, is fatal; yet among theſe people, where the practice of thus wounding the enamel is univerſal, we never ſaw a rotten tooth; nor is the blackneſs a ſtain, but a covering, which may be waſhed off at pleaſure, and the teeth then appear as white as ivory, which however is not an excellence in the eſtimation of the belles and beaus of theſe nations.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the people among whom the practice that is called <hi>a mock,</hi> or running a muck, has prevailed for time immemorial. It is well known, that to run a muck in the original ſenſe of the word, is to get intoxicated with opium, and then ruſh into the ſtreet with a drawn weapon, and kill whoever comes in the way, till the party is himſelf either killed or taken priſoner; of this ſeveral inſtances happened while we were at Batavia, and one of the officers, whoſe buſineſs it is, among other things, to apprehend ſuch people, told us, that there was ſcarcely a week in which he, or ſome of his brethren, were not called upon to take one of them into cuſtody. In one of the inſtances that came to our knowledge, the party had been ſeverely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by the perfidy of women, and was mad with jealouſy before he made himſelf drunk with opium; and we were told,
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:013324_0511_0F8FFB5B95C43460"/>
that the Indian who runs a muck is always firſt driven to deſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation by ſome outrage, and always firſt revenges himſelf upon thoſe who have done him wrong: we were alſo told, that though theſe unhappy wretches afterwards run into the ſtreet with a weapon in their hand, frantic and foaming at the mouth, yet they never kill any but thoſe who attempt to apprehend them, or thoſe whom they ſuſpect of ſuch an intention, and that whoever gives them way is ſafe. They are generally ſlaves, who indeed are more ſubject to inſults, and leaſt able to obtain legal redreſs: freemen, however, are ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked into this extravagance, and one of the perſons who run a muck while we were at Batavia, was free and in eaſy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. He was jealous of his own brother, whom he firſt killed, and afterwards two others, who attempted to oppoſe him: he did not, however, come out of his houſe, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to defend himſelf in it, though the opium had ſo far deprived him of his ſenſes, that of three muſquets, which he attempted to uſe againſt the officers of juſtice, not one was either loaded or primed. If the officer takes one of theſe amocks, or mohawks, as they have been called by an eaſy corruption, alive, his reward is very conſiderable, but if he kills them, nothing is added to his uſual pay; yet ſuch is the fury of their deſperation, that three out of four are of neceſſity deſtroyed in the attempt to ſecure them, though the officers are provided with inſtruments like large tongs, or pincers, to lay hold of them without coming within the reach of their weapon. Thoſe who happen to be taken alive are generally wounded, but they are always broken alive upon the wheel, and if the phyſician who is appointed to examine their wounds, thinks them likely to be mortal, the puniſhment is inflicted immediately, and the place of execution is generally the ſpot where the firſt murder was committed.</p>
                        <p>Among theſe people, there are many abſurd practices and opinions which they derive from their Pagan anceſtors: they believe that the devil, whom they call Satan, is the cauſe of all ſickneſs and adverſity, and for this reaſon, when they are ſick, or in diſtreſs, they conſecrate meat, money, and other things to him as a propitiation. If any one among them is reſtleſs, and dreams for two or three nights ſucceſſively, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that Satan has taken that method of laying his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon him, which if he neglects to fulfil, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuffer ſickneſs or death, though they are not revealed with ſufficient perſpicuity to aſcertain their meaning: to interpret his dream, therefore, he taxes his wits to the uttermoſt, and if, by taking it literally or figuratively, directly or by contraries, he can put no explanation upon it that perfectly ſatisfies him, he has recourſe to the cawin or prieſt, who aſſiſts him with a comment and illuſtrations, and perfectly reveals the myſterious
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:013324_0512_0F90F1DBB79D2AD8"/>
ſuggeſtions of the night. It generally appears that the devil wants victuals or money, which are always allotted him, and being placed on a little plate of cocoa-nut leaves, are hung upon the branch of a tree near the river, ſo that it ſeems not to be the opinion of theſe people, that in prowling the earth the devil "walketh through dry places." Mr. Banks once aſked, whether they thought Satan ſpent the money, or eat the victuals; he was anſwered, that as to the money it was conſidered rather as a mulct upon an offender, than a gift to him who had enjoined it, and that therefore if it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted by the dreamer, it mattered not into whoſe hands it came, and they ſuppoſed that it was generally the prize of ſome ſtranger who wandered that way; but as to the meat they were clearly of opinion that, although the devil did not eat the groſs parts, yet, by bringing his mouth near it, he ſucked out all its favour without changing its poſition, ſo that afterwards it was as taſteleſs as water.</p>
                        <p>But they have another ſuperſtitious opinion that is ſtill more unaccountable. They believe that women, when they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of children, are frequently at the ſame time delivered of a young crocodile, as a twin to the infant: they believe that theſe creatures are received moſt carefully by the midwife, and immediately carried down to the river, and put into the water. The family in which ſuch a birth is ſuppoſed to have happened, conſtantly put victuals into the river for their amphibious rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eſpecially the twin, who, as long as he lives, goes down to the river at ſtated ſeaſons, to fulfil this fraternal duty, for the neglect of which it is the univerſal opinion that he will be viſited with ſickneſs or death. What could at firſt produce a notion ſo extravagant and abſurd, it is not eaſy to gueſs, eſpecially as it ſeems to be totally unconnected with any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious myſtery, and how a fact which never happened, ſhould be pretended to happen every day, by thoſe who cannot be deceived into a belief of it by appearances, nor have any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent intereſt in the fraud, is a problem ſtill more difficult to ſolve. Nothing however can be more certain than the firm believe of this ſtrange abſurdity among them, for we had the concurrent teſtimony of every Indian who was queſtioned about it, in its favour. It ſeems to have taken its riſe in the iſlands of Celebes and Bouto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Theſe crocodile twins are called <hi>Sudaras,</hi> and I ſhall relate one of the innumerable ſtories that were told us, in proof of their exiſtence, from ocular demonſtration.</p>

Engliſh at Bencoolen, and had learnt a little of the language, told Mr. Banks that her father, when he was dying, acquainted her that he had a crocodile for his <hi>ſudara,</hi> and ſolemnly charged her to give him meat when he ſhould be dead, telling her in what part of the river he was to be found, and by what name he was to be called up. That in purſuance of her father's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and command, ſhe went to the river, and ſtanding upon the bank, called out <hi>Radja Pouti,</hi> white king, upon which a crocodile came to her out of the water, and eat from her hand the proviſions that ſhe had brought him. When ſhe was deſired to deſcribe this paternal uncle, who in ſo ſtrange a ſhape had taken up his dwelling in the water, ſhe ſaid, that he was not like other crocodiles, but much handſomer; that his body was ſpotted and his noſe red; that he had bracelets of gold upon his feet, and earrings of the ſame metal in his ears. Mr. Banks heard this tale of ridiculous falſehood patiently to the end, and then diſmiſſed the girl, without reminding her, that a crocodile with ears was as ſtrange a monſter as a dog with a cloven foot. Some time after this a ſervant whom Mr. Banks had hired at Batavia, and who was the ſon of a Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by a Javaneſe woman, thought fit to acquaint his maſter that he had ſeen a crocodile of the ſame kind, which had alſo been ſeen by many others, both Dutchmen and Malays: that being very young, it was but two feet long, and had bracelets of gold upon its feet. There is no giving credit to theſe ſtories, ſaid Mr. Banks, for I was told the other day that a crocodile had earrings; and you know that could not be true, becauſe crocodiles have no ears. Ah Sir, ſaid the man, theſe Sudara Oran are not like other crocodiles; they have five toes upon each foot, a large tongue that fills their mouth, and ears alſo, although they are indeed very ſmall.</p>
                        <p>How much of what theſe people related they believed, cannot be known; for there are no bounds to the credulity of ignorance and folly. In the girl's relation, however, there are ſome things in which ſhe could not be deceived; and therefore muſt have been guilty of wilful falſehood. Her father might perhaps give her a charge to feed a crocodile, in conſequence of his believing that it was his Sudara; but its coming to her out of the river, when ſhe called it by the name of White King, and taking the food ſhe had brought it, muſt have been a fable of her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; for this being falſe, it was impoſſible that ſhe ſhould believe it to be true. The girl's ſtory, however, as well as that of the man, is a ſtrong proof that they both firmly believed the exiſtence of crocodiles that are Sudaras to men; and the girl's fiction will be eaſily accounted for, if we recollect, that the earneſt deſire which every one feels to make others believe what he believes himſelf, is a ſtrong temptation to ſupport it by unjuſtifiable evidence. And the averring what is known to
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:013324_0514_0F90F1DC78AC4148"/>
be falſe, in order to produce in others the belief of what is thought to be true, muſt, upon the moſt charitable principles, be imputed to many, otherwiſe venerable characters, through whoſe hands the doctrines of Chriſtianity paſſed for many ages in their way to us, as the ſource of all the ſilly fables related of the Romiſh ſaints, many of them not leſs extravagant and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd than this ſtory of the White King, and all of them the invention of the firſt relater.</p>
                        <p>The Bougis, Macaſſars, and Boetons, are ſo firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that they have relations of the crocodile ſpecies in the rivers of their own country, that they perform a periodical cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in remembrance of them. Large parties of them go out in a boat, furniſhed with great plenty of proviſions, and all kinds of muſic, and row backwards and forwards, in places where crocodiles and allegators are moſt common, ſinging and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by turns, each invoking his kindred, till a crocodile ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, when the muſic inſtantly ſtops, and proviſions, betele, and tobacco are thrown into the water. By this civility to the ſpecies, they hope to recommend themſelves to their relations at home; and that it will be accepted inſtead of offerings immediately to themſelves, which it is not in their power to pay.</p>
                        <p>In the next rank to the Indians ſtand the Chineſe, who in this place are numerous, but poſſeſs very little property; many of them live within the walls, and keep ſhops. The fruit-ſellers of Paſſar Piſſang have been mentioned already; but others have a rich ſhow of European and Chineſe goods: the far greater part however live in a quarter by themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the walls, called Campang China. Many of them are carpenters, joiners, ſmiths, taylors, ſlipper makers, dyers of cotton, and embroiderers; maintaining the character of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry that is univerſally given of them: and ſome are ſcattered about the country, where they cultivate gardens, ſow rice and ſugar, or keep cattle and buffaloes, whoſe milk they bring daily to town.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing clean or dirty, honeſt or diſhoneſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided there is not too much danger of a halter, that the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe will not readily do for money. But though they work with great diligence, and patiently undergo any degree of labour; yet no ſooner have they laid down their tools than they begin to game, either at cards or dice, or ſome other play among the multitude that they have invented, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unknown in Europe: to this they apply with ſuch eagerneſs, as ſcarcely to allow time for the neceſſary refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of food and ſleep; ſo that it is rare to ſee a Chineſe idle, as it is to ſee a Dutchman or an Indian employed.</p>
                        <p>In manners they are always civil, or rather obſequious; and in dreſs they are remarkably neat and clean, to whatever rank
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:013324_0515_0F8FFB5D1DF23AB0"/>
of live they belong. I ſhall not attempt a deſcription either of their perſons or habits, for the better kind of China paper, which is now common in England, exhibits a perfect repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of both, though perhaps with ſome ſlight exaggerations approaching towards the caricatura.</p>
                        <p>In eating they are eaſily ſatisfied, though the few that are rich have many ſavory diſhes. Rice, with a ſmall proportion of fleſh or fiſh, is the food of the poor; and they have greatly the advantage of the Mahometan Indians, whoſe religion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids them to eat of many things which they could moſt eaſily procure. The Chineſe, on the contrary, being under no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, eat, beſides pork, dogs, cats, frogs, lizards, ſerpents of many kinds, and a great variety of ſea animals, which the other inhabitants of this country do not conſider as food: they eat alſo many vegetables, which an European, except he was periſhing with hunger, would never touch.</p>
                        <p>The Chineſe have a ſingular ſuperſtition with regard to the burial of their dead; for they will upon no occaſion open the ground a ſecond time, where a body has been interred. Their burying grounds, therefore, in the neighbourhood of Batavia, cover many hundred acres, and the Dutch, grudging the waſte of ſo much land, will not ſell any for this purpoſe but at the moſt exorbitant price. The Chineſe, however, contrive to raiſe the purchaſe money, and afford another inſtance of the folly and weakneſs of human nature, in transferring a regard for the living to the dead, and making that the object of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude and expence, which cannot receive the leaſt benefit from either. Under the influence of this univerſal prejudice, they take an uncommon method to preſerve the body intire, and prevent the remains of it from being mixed with the earth that ſurrounds it. They incloſe it in a large thick coffin of wood, not made of planks joined together, but hollowed out of the ſolid timber, like a canoe; this being covered, and let down into the grave, is ſurrounded with a coat of their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, called Chinam, about eight or ten inches thick, which in a ſhort time becomes as hard as a ſtone. The relations of the deceaſed attend the funeral ceremony, with a conſiderable number of women that are hired to weep; it might reaſonably be ſuppoſed that the hired appearance of ſorrow could no more flatter the living than benefit the dead; yet the appearance of ſorrow is known to be hired among people more reflective and enlightened than the Chineſe. In Batavia, the law requires that every man ſhould be buried according to his rank, which is in no caſe diſpenſed with; ſo that if the deceaſed has not left ſufficient to pay his debts, an officer takes an inventory of what was in his poſſeſſion when he died, and out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce buries him in the manner preſcribed, leaving only the overplus to his creditors. Thus in many inſtances are the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:013324_0516_0F90F1DD4D7C54E0"/>
ſacrificed to the dead, and money that ſhould diſcharge a debt, or feed an orphan, laviſhed in idle proceſſions, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials that are depoſited in the earth to rot.</p>
                        <p>Another numerous claſs among the inhabitants of this country is the ſlaves; for by ſlaves the Dutch, Portugueſe, and Indians, however different in their rank or ſituation, are conſtantly attended: they are purchaſed from Sumatra, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca, and almoſt all the eaſtern iſlands. The natives of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, very few of whom, as I have before obſerved, live in the neighbourhood of Batavia, have an exemption from ſlavery under the ſanction of very ſevere penal laws, which I believe are ſeldom violated. The price of theſe ſlaves is from ten to twenty pounds ſterling; but girls, if they have beauty, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fetch a hundred. They are a very lazy ſet of people; but as they will do but little work, they are content with a little victuals, ſubſiſting altogether upon boiled rice, and a ſmall quantity of the cheapeſt fiſh. As they are natives of different countries, they differ from each other extremely, both in perſon and diſpoſition. The African negroes, called here <hi>Papua,</hi> are the worſt, and conſequently may be purchaſed for the leaſt money: they are all thieves, and all incorrigible. Next to theſe are the Bougis and Macaſſars, both from the iſland of Celebes; theſe are lazy in the higheſt degree, and though not ſo much addicted to theft as the negroes, have a cruel and vindictive ſpirit, which renders them extremely dangerous; eſpecially as, to gratify their reſentment, they will make no ſcruple of ſacrificing life. The beſt ſlaves, and conſequently the deareſt, are procured from the iſland of Bali: the moſt beautiful women from Nias, a ſmall iſland on the coaſt of Sumatra; but they are of a tender and delicate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and ſoon fall a ſacrifice to the unwholeſome air of Batavia. Beſides theſe, there are Malays, and ſlaves of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other denominations, whoſe particular characteriſtic I do not remember.</p>
                        <p>Theſe ſlaves are wholly in the power of their maſters with reſpect to any puniſhment that does not take away life; but if a ſlave dies in conſequence of puniſhment, though his death ſhould not appear to have been intended, the maſter is called to a ſevere account, and he is generally condemned to ſuffer capitally. For this reaſon the maſter ſeldom inflicts puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the ſlave himſelf, but applies to an officer called a Marineu, one of whom is ſtationed in every diſtrict. The du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Marineu is to quell riots, and take offenders into cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tody; but more particularly to apprehend runaway ſlaves, and puniſh them for ſuch crimes as the maſter, ſupported by proper evidence, lays to their charge: the puniſhment how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not inflicted by the Marineu in perſon, but by ſlaves who are bred up to the buſineſs. Men are puniſhed publicly,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:013324_0517_0F8FFB5E470B0A20"/>
before the door of their maſter's houſe; but women within it. The puniſhment is by ſtripes, the number being proportioned to the offence; and they are given with rods made of ratans, which are ſplit into ſlender twigs for the purpoſe, and fetch blood at every ſtroke. A common puniſhment coſts the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a rixdollar, and a ſevere one a ducatoon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, about ſix ſhillings and eight pence. The maſter is alſo obliged to allow the ſlave three dubblecheys, equal to about ſeven pence half-pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a week, as an encouragement, and to prevent his being under temptations to ſteal too ſtrong not to be reſiſted.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the government of this place I can ſay but little. We obſerved however a remarkable ſubordination among the people. Every man who is able to keep houſe has a certain ſpecific rank acquired by the length of his ſervices to the company; the different ranks which are thus acquired are diſtinguiſhed by the ornaments of the coaches and the dreſſes of the coachmen: ſome are obliged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o ride in plain coaches, ſome are allowed to paint them in different manners and degrees, and ſome to gild them. The coachman alſo appears in clothes that are quite plain, or more or leſs adorned with lace.</p>
                        <p>The officer who preſides here has the title of Governor Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Indies, and the Dutch Governors of all the other ſettlements are ſubordinate to him, and obliged to repair to Batavia that he may paſs their accounts. If they appear to have been criminal, or even negligent, he puniſhes them by delay, and detains them during pleaſure, ſometimes one year, ſometimes two years, and ſometimes three; for they cannot quit the place till he gives them a diſmiſſion. Next to the Governor are the members of the council, called here <hi>Ed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>le Heeren,</hi> and by the corruption of the Engliſh <hi>Idoleers.</hi> Theſe Idoleers take upon them ſo much ſtate that whoever meets them in a carriage, is expected to riſe up and bow, then to drive on one ſide of the road, and there ſtop till they are paſt: the ſame homage is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired alſo to their wives and even their children; and it is commonly paid them by the inhabitants. But ſome of our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains have thought ſo ſlaviſh a mark of reſpect beneath the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which they derived from the ſervice of his Britannic Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and have refuſed to pay it; yet, if they were in a hired carriage, nothing could deter the coachman from honouring the Dutch Grandee at their expence, but the moſt peremptory menace of immediate death.</p>
                        <p>Juſtice is adminiſtered here by a body of lawyers, who have ranks of diſtinction among themſelves. Concerning their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in queſtions of property, I know nothing; but their deciſions in criminal caſes ſeem to be ſevere with reſpect to the natives, and lenient with reſpect to their own people, in a criminal degree. A Chriſtian always is indulged with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of eſcaping before he is brought to a trial, whatever
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:013324_0518_0F8FFB5EB43B4EB0"/>
may have been his offence; and if he is brought to a trial and convicted, he is ſeldom puniſhed with death: while the poor Indians on the contrary are hanged, and broken upon the wheel, and even impaled alive without mercy.</p>
                        <p>The Malays and Chineſe have judicial officers of their own, under the denominations of Captains and Lieutenants, who determine in civil caſes, ſubject to an appeal to the Dutch court.</p>
                        <p>The taxes paid by theſe people to the Company are very conſiderable; and that which is exacted of them for liberty to wear their hair, is by no means the leaſt. They are paid monthly, and to ſave the trouble and charge of collecting them, a flag is hoiſted upon the top of a houſe, in the middle of the town, when a payment is due; and the Chineſe have experienced it their intereſt to repair thither, with their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, without delay.</p>
                        <p>The money current here conſiſts of ducats, worth a hundred and thirty-two ſtivers; ducatoons, eighty ſtivers; imperial rixdollars, ſixty; rupees of Batavia, thirty; ſchellings, ſix; double cheys, two ſtivers and a half; and doits, one fourth of a ſtiver. Spaniſh dollars, when we were here, were at five ſhillings and five pence; and we were told, that they were never lower than five ſhillings and four pence, even at the Company's ware-houſe. For Engliſh Guineas we could never get more than nineteen ſhillings upon an average; for though the Chineſe would give twenty ſhillings for ſome of the brighteſt, they would give no more than ſeventeen ſhillings for thoſe that were much worn.</p>
                        <p>It may perhaps be of ſome advantage to ſtrangers to be told that there are two kinds of coin here, of the ſame denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, milled and unmilled, and that the milled is of moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. A milled ducatoon is worth eighty ſtivers; but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milled ducatoon is worth no more than ſeventy-two. All ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts are kept in rix-dollars and ſtivers, which, here at leaſt, are mere nominal coins, like our pound ſterling. The rix-dollar is equal to forty-eight ſtivers, about four ſhillings and ſix pence Engliſh currency.</p>

                        <p>ON Thurſday the 27th of December at ſix o'clock in the morning, we weighed again and ſtood out to ſea.
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:013324_0519_0F90F1DDFB78CEC8"/>
After much delay by contrary winds, we weathered Pulo Pare on the 29th, and ſtood in for the main; ſoon after we fetched a ſmall iſland under the main, in the midway between Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia and Bantam, called Maneater's Iſland. The next day, we weathered firſt Wapping iſla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d, and then Pulo Babi. On the 31ſt, we ſtood over to the Sumatra ſhore; and on the morning of New Year's day, 1771, we ſtood over for the Java ſhore.</p>
                        <p>We continued our courſe as the wind permitted us till three o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th, when we anchored under the ſouth eaſt ſide of Prince's Iſland in eighteen fathom, in order to recruit our wood and water, and procure refreſhments for the ſick, many of whom were now become much worſe than they were when we left Batavia. As ſoon as the ſhip was ſecured, I went aſhore, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and we were met upon the beach by ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, who carried us immediately to a man, who, they ſaid, was their King. After we had exchanged a few compliments with his Majeſty, we proceeded to buſineſs; but in ſettling the price of turtle we could not agree: this however did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us, as we made no doubt but that we ſhould buy them at our own price in the morning. As ſoon as we parted, the Indians diſperſed, and we proceeded along the ſhore in ſearch of a watering-place. In this we were more ſucceſsful; we found water very conveniently ſituated, and, if a little care was taken in filling it, we had reaſon to believe that it would prove good. Juſt as we were going off, ſome Indians, who remained with a canoe upon the beach, ſold us three turtle; but exacted a promiſe of us that we ſhould not tell the King.</p>
                        <p>The next morning, while a party was employed in filling water, we renewed our traffic for turtle: at firſt, the Indians dropped their demands ſlowly, but about noon, they agreed to take the price that we offered, ſo that before night we had turtle in plenty: the three that we had purchaſed the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, were in the mean time ſerved to the ſhip's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who, till the day before, had not once been ſerved with ſalt proviſions from the time of our arrival at Savu, which was now near four months. In the evening Mr. Banks went to pay his reſpects to the King, at his palace, in the middle of a rice-field, and though his Majeſty was buſily employed in dreſſing his own ſupper, he received the ſtranger very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly.</p>
                        <p>The next day, the natives came down to the trading-place, with fowls, fiſh, monkies, ſmall beer, and ſome vegetables, but no turtle, for they ſaid that we had bought them all the day before. The next day, however, more turtle appeared at market, and ſome were brought down every day afterwards,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:013324_0520_0F90F1DEC9D5F990"/>
during our ſtay, though the whole, together, was not equal to the quantity that we bought the day after our arrival.</p>
                        <p>On the 11th, Mr. Banks having learnt from the ſervant whom he had hired at Batavia, that the Indians of this iſland had a town upon the ſhore, at ſome diſtance to the weſtward, he determined to ſee it: with this view he ſet out in the morning, accompanied by the ſecond lieutenant, and as he had ſome reaſon to think that his viſit would not be agreeable to the inhabitants, he told the people whom he met, as he was advancing along the ſhore, that he was in ſearch of plants, which indeed was alſo true. In about two hours they arrived at a place where there were four or five houſes, and meeting with an old man, they ventured to make ſome enquiries concerning the town. He ſaid that it was far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; but they were not to be diſcouraged in their enterpriſe, and he, ſeeing them proceed in their journey, joined company and went on with them. He attempted ſeveral times to lead them out the way, but without ſucceſs; and at length they came within ſight of the houſes. The old man then entered cordially into their party, and conducted them into the town. The name of it is Samodang, it conſiſts of about four hundred houſes, and is divided by a river of brackiſh water into two parts, one of which is called the old town, and the other the new. As ſoon as they entered the old town, they met ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Indians whom they had ſeen at the trading-place, and one of them undertook to carry them over to the new town, at the rate of two pence a head. When the bargain was made, two very ſmall canoes were produced, in which they embarked; the canoes being placed along ſide of each other, and held together, a precaution which was abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to prevent their overſetting, the navigation was at length ſafely performed, though not without ſome difficulty; and when they landed in the new town, the people received them with great friendſhip, and ſhowed them the houſes of their Kings and principal people, which are in this diſtrict: few of them however were open, for at this time the people had taken up their reſidence in the rice-grounds, to defend the crop againſt the birds and monkies, by which it would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have been deſtroyed. When their curioſity was ſatisfied, they hired a large ſailing boat for two roupees, four ſhillings, which brought them back to the ſhip time enough to dine upon one of the ſmall deer, weighing only forty pounds, which had been bought the day before, and proved to be very good and ſavory meat.</p>
                        <p>We went on ſhore in the evening, to ſee how the people who were employed in wooding and watering went on, and were informed that an ax had been ſtolen. As the paſſing over this fault might encourage the commiſſion of others of the
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:013324_0521_0F8FFB5F4CE13DC0"/>
ſame kind, application was immediately made to the King, who after ſome altercation promiſed that the ax ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored in the morning; and kept his word, for it was brought to us by a man who pretended that the thief, being afraid of a diſcovery, had privately brought it, and left it at his houſe in the night.</p>
                        <p>We continued to purchaſe between two and three hundred weight of turtle in a day, beſides fowls and other neceſſaries; and in the evening of the 13th, having nearly completed our wood and water, Mr. Banks went aſhore to take leave of his Majeſty, to whom he had made ſeveral trifling preſents, and at parting gave him two quires of paper, which he graciouſly received. They had much converſation, in the courſe of which his Majeſty enquired, why the Engliſh did not touch there as they had been uſed to do. Mr. Banks replied, that he ſuppoſed it was becauſe they found a deficiency of turtle, of which there not being enough to ſupply one ſhip, many could not be expected. To ſupply this defect, he adviſed his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to breed cattle, buffaloes, and ſheep, a meaſure which he did not ſeem much inclined to adopt.</p>
                        <p>On the 14th we made ready to ſail, having on board a good ſtock of refreſhments, which we purchaſed of the natives, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of turtle, fowl, fiſh, two ſpecies of deer, one as big as a ſheep, the other not larger than a rabit; with cocoa-nuts, plantains, limes, and other vegetables. The deer however ſerved only for preſent uſe, for we could ſeldom keep one of them alive more than four and twenty hours after it was on board. On our part the trade was carried on chiefly with Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh dollars, the natives ſeeming to ſet little value upon any thing elſe; ſo that our people, who had a general permiſſion to trade, parted with old ſhirts and other articles, which they were obliged to ſubſtitute for money to great diſadvantage. In the morning of the 15th we weighed, with a light breeze at N. E. and ſtood out to ſea. Java Head, from which I took my departure, lies in latitude 6° 49′ S., longitude 253° 12′ W.</p>
                        <p>Prince's Iſland, where we lay about ten days, is, in the Malay language called <hi>Pulo Selan;</hi> and in the language of the inhabitants, <hi>Pulo Paneitan.</hi> It is a ſmall iſland, ſituated in the weſtern mouth of the Streight of Sunda. It is woody, and a very ſmall part of it only has been cleared: there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable hill upon it, yet the Engliſh call the ſmall eminence which is juſt over the landing-place the pike. It was formerly much frequented by the India ſhips of many nations, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of England, which of late have forſaken it, as it is ſaid, becauſe the water is bad; and touch either at North Iſland, a ſmall iſland that lies on the coaſt of Sumatra, without the eaſt entrance of the Streight, or at New Bay, which lies
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:013324_0522_0F90F1E040DFC140"/>
only a few leagues from Prince's Iſland, at neither of which places any conſiderable quantity of other refreſhments can be procured. Prince's Iſland is, upon the whole, certainly more eligible than either of them; and though the water is brackiſh, if it is filled at the lower part of the brook, yet higher up it will be found excellent.</p>
                        <p>The firſt and ſecond, and perhaps the third ſhip that comes in the ſeaſon may be tolerably ſupplied with turtle; but thoſe that come afterwards muſt be content with ſmall ones. Thoſe that we bought were of the green kind, and at an average coſt us about a half-penny or three farthings a pound. We were much diſappointed to find them neither fat nor well flavoured; and we imputed it to their having been long kept in crawls or pens of brackiſh water, without food. The fowls are large, and we bought a dozen of them for a Spaniſh dollar, which is about five pence a piece: the ſmall deer coſt us two pence a piece, and the larger, of which two only were brought down, a rupee. Many kinds of fiſh are to be had here, which the natives ſell by hand, and we found them tolerably cheap. Cocoa-nuts we bought at the rate of a hundred for a dollar, if they were picked; and if they were taken promiſcuouſly, one hundred and thirty. Plantains we found in great plenty; we procured alſo ſome pine apples, water melons, jaccas, and pumpkins; beſides rice, the greater part of which was of the mountain kind, that grows in dry land; yams, and ſeveral other vegetables, at a very reaſonable rate.</p>
                        <p>The inhabitants are Javaneſe, whoſe Raja is ſubject to the Sultan of Bantam. Their cuſtoms are very ſimilar to thoſe of the Indians about Batavia; but they ſeem to be more jealous of their women, for we never ſaw any of them during all the time that we were there, except one by chance in the woods, as ſhe was running away to hide herſelf. They profeſs the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan religion, but I believe there is not a moſque in the whole iſland: we were among them during the faſt, which the Turks call <hi>Ramadan,</hi> which they ſeemed to keep with great rigour, for not one of them would touch a morſel of victuals, or even chew their betele till ſun-ſet.</p>
                        <p>Their food is nearly the ſame as that of the Batavian Indians, except the addition of the nuts of the palm, called <hi>Cyca circi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis,</hi> with which, upon the coaſt of New Holland, ſome of our people were made ſick, and ſome of our hogs poiſoned.</p>
                        <p>Upon obſerving theſe nuts to be part of their food, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by what means they deprived them of their deleterious quality; and they told us, that they firſt cut them into thin ſlices, and dried them in the ſun, then ſteeped them in freſh water for three months, and afterwards, preſſing out the water, dried them in the ſun a ſecond time; but we learnt that, after all, they are eaten only in times of ſcarcity, when they mix them with their rice to make it go farther.</p>

The houſes of their town are built upon piles, or pillars, four or five feet above the ground: upon theſe is laid a floor of bamboo canes, which are placed at ſome diſtance from each other, ſo as to leave a free paſſage for the air from below: the walls alſo are of bamboo, which are interwoven, hurdlewiſe, with ſmall ſticks, that are faſtened perpendicularly to the beams which form the frame of the building: it has a ſloping roof, which is ſo well thatched with palm leaves, that neither the ſun nor the rain can find entrance. The ground over which this building is erected, is an oblong ſquare. In the middle of one ſide is the door, and in the middle between that and the end of the houſe, towards the left hand, is a window: a partition runs out from each end towards the middle, which, if conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, would divide the whole floor into two equal parts, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudinally, but they do not meet in the middle, ſo that an opening is left over-againſt the door; each end of the houſe therefore, to the right and left of the door, is divided into two rooms, like ſtalls in a ſtable, all open towards the paſſage from the door to the wall on the oppoſite ſide: in that next the door, to the left hand, the children ſleep; that oppoſite to it, on the right hand, is allotted to ſtrangers; the maſter and his wife ſleep in the inner room on the left hand, and that oppoſite to it is the kitchen. There is no difference between the houſes of the poor and the rich, but in the ſize; except that the royal palace, and the houſe of a man, whoſe name is <hi>Gundang,</hi> the next in riches and influence to the King, is walled with boards inſtead of being wattled with ſticks and bamboo.</p>
                        <p>As the people are obliged to abandon the town, and live in the rice-fields at certain ſeaſons, to ſecure their crops from the birds and the monkies, they have occaſional houſes there for their accommodation. They are exactly the ſame as the houſes in the town, except that they are ſmaller, and are elevated eight or ten feet above the ground inſtead of four.</p>
                        <p>The diſpoſition of the people, as far as we could diſcover it, is good. They dealt with us very honeſtly, except, like all other Indians, and the itinerant retailers of fiſh in London, they aſked ſometimes twice, and ſometimes thrice as much for their commodities as they would take. As what they brought to market, belonged, in different proportions, to a conſiderable number of the natives, and it would have been difficult to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it in ſeperate lots, they found out a very eaſy expedient with which every one was ſatisfied: they put all that was bought of one kind, as plantains, or cocoa-nuts, together, and when we had agreed for the heap, they divided the money that was paid for it, among thoſe of whoſe ſeparate property it conſiſted, in a proportion correſponding with their contributions. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, indeed, they changed our money, giving us 240 doits, amounting to five ſhillings, for a Spaniſh dollar, and ninety-ſix, amounting to two ſhillings, for a Bengal roupee.</p>

They all ſpeak the Malay language, though they have a lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage of their own, different both from the Malay and the Javaneſe. Their own language they call <hi>Catta Gunung,</hi> the language of the mountains; and they ſay that it is ſpoken upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Java, whence their tribe originally migrated, firſt to New Bay, and then to their preſent ſtation, being driven from their firſt ſettlement by tygers, which they found too numerous to ſubdue. I have already obſerved, that ſeveral languages are ſpoken by the native Javaneſe, in different parts of their iſland; but when I ſay that the language of theſe people is different from the Javaneſe, I mean that it is different from the language which is ſpoken at Samarang, a place that is diſtant only one day's journey from the reſidence of the emperor of Java. The following is a liſt of correſponding words in the languages of Prince's Iſland, Java, and Malacca.</p>

It is very remarkable that the Malay, the Javaneſe, and the Prince's Iſland language, have words, which, if not exactly ſimilar to the correſponding words in the language of the iſlands in the South Seas, are manifeſtly derived from the ſame ſource, as will appear from the following table:

But the names of numbers in the iſland of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagaſcar, are, in ſome inſtances, ſimilar to all theſe, which is a problem ſtill more difficult to ſolve. That the names of numbers, in particular, are in a manner common to all theſe countries, will appear from the following comparative table, which Mr. Banks drew up, with the aſſiſtance of a negro ſlave, born at Madagaſcar, who was on board an Engliſh ſhip at Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia, and ſent to him to gratify his curioſity on this ſubject.</p>

Indies, and the iſlands of the South Sea, conjectures may be formed with reſpect to the peopling thoſe countries, which cannot eaſily be referred to Madagaſcar. The inhabitants of Java and Madagaſcar appear to be a different race; the Javaneſe is of an olive complexion, and has long hair; the native of Madagaſcar is black, and his head is not covered with hair, but wool; and yet perhaps this will not conclude againſt their having common anceſtors ſo ſtrongly as at firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. It does not ſeem leſs difficult to account for the perſonal difference between a native of England and France, as an effect of mere local ſituation, than for the difference between the natives of Java and Madagaſcar; yet it has never been ſuppoſed, that England and France were not peopled from common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. If two natives of England marry in their own country, and afterwards remove to our ſettlements in the Weſt Indies, the children that are conceived and born there will have the complexion and caſt of countenance that diſtinguiſh the Creole; if they return, the children conceived and born afterwards, will have no ſuch characteriſtics. If it be ſaid that the mother's mind being impreſſed with different external obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We know that people within the ſmall circle of Great Britain and Ireland, who are born at the diſtance of two or three hundred miles from each other, will be diſtinguiſhed by the Scotch face, the Welſh face, and the Iriſh face; may we not then reaſonably ſuppoſe, that there are in nature qualities which act powerfully as efficient cauſes, and yet are not cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizable by any of the five modes of perception which we call ſenſes? A deaf man, who ſees the ſtring of a harpſichord vibrate, when a correſponding tone is produced by blowing into a flute at a diſtance, will ſee an effect of which he can no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the cauſe to exiſt in the blowing air into the flute, than we can conceive the cauſe of the perſonal difference of the various inhabitants of the globe to exiſt in mere local ſituation; nor can he any more form an idea of the cauſe itſelf, in one caſe, than we can in the other: what happens to him then, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of having but four ſenſes inſtead of five, may, with reſpect to many phaenomena of nature, happen to us, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of having but five ſenſes inſtead of ſix, or any greater number.</p>
                        <p>Poſſibly, however, the learning of ancient AEgypt might run in two courſes, one through Africa, and the other through Aſia, diſſeminating the ſame words in each, eſpecially terms

of number, which might thus become part of the language of people who never had any communication with each other.</p>
                        <p>We now made the beſt of our way for the Cape of Good Hope, but the ſeeds of diſeaſe which we had received at Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via began to appear with the moſt threatning ſymptons in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteries and ſlow fevers. Leſt the water which we had taken in at Prince's Iſland ſhould have had any ſhare in our ſickneſs, we purified it with lime, and we waſhed all parts of the ſhip between decks with vinegar, as a remedy againſt infection. Mr. Banks was among the ſick, and for ſome time there was no hope of his life. We were very ſoon in a moſt deplorable ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; the ſhip was nothing better than an hoſpital, in which thoſe that were able to go about, were too few to attend the ſick, who were confined to their hammocks; and we had almoſt every night a dead body to commit to the ſea. In the courſe of about ſix weeks, we buried Mr. Sporing, a gentleman who was in Mr. Banks's retinue, Mr. Parkinſon, his natural hiſtory painter, Mr. Green the aſtronomer, the boatſwain, the carp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter and his mate, Mr. Monkhouſe the midſhipman, who had fothered the ſhip after ſhe had been ſtranded on the coaſt of New Holland, our old jolly ſail-maker and his aſſiſtant, the ſhip's cook, the corporal of the marines, two of the carpenter's crew, a midſhipman, and nine ſeamen; in all three and twenty perſons, beſides the ſeven that we buried at Batavia.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XVI. Our Arrival at the Cape of Good Hope; ſome Remarks on the Run from Java Head to that Place; a Deſcription of the Cape, and of Saint Helena: With ſome Account of the Hottentots, and the Return of the Ship to England.</head>
                        <p>ON Friday the 15th of March, about ten o'clock in the morning, we anchored off the Cape of Good Hope, in ſeven fathom with an ouzey bottom. The weſt point of the bay, called the Lion's Tail, bore W. N. W. and the caſtle S. W. diſtant about a mile and a half. I immediately waited upon the Governor, who told me that I ſhould have every thing the country afforded. My firſt care was to provide a proper place aſhore for the ſick, which were not a few; and a houſe was ſoon found, where it was agreed they ſhould be lodged and boarded at the rate of two ſhillings a head per day.</p>
                        <p>Our run from Java head, to this place, afforded very few ſubjects of remark that can be of uſe to future navigators; ſuch as occurred, however, I ſhall ſet down. We had left Java Head eleven days before we got the general ſouth eaſt trade-wind, during which time, we did not advance above 5° to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:013324_0528_0F90F1E335F86800"/>
and 3° to the weſt, having variable light airs, interrupted by calms, with ſultry weather, and an unwholeſome air, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned probably by the load of vapours which the eaſtern trade-wind, and weſterly monſoons, bring into theſe latitudes, both which blow in theſe ſeas at the time of year when we happened to be there. The eaſterly wind prevails as far as 10 or 12° S. and the weſterly as far as 6 or 8°; in the intermediate ſpace the winds are variable, and the air, I believe, always unwholeſome; it certainly aggravated the diſeaſes which we brought with us from Batavia, and particularly the flux, which was not in the leaſt degree checked by any medicine, ſo that whoever was ſeized with it, conſidered himſelf as a dead man; but we had no ſooner got into the trade-wind, than we began to feel its ſalutary effects: we buried indeed ſeveral of our people afterwards, but they were ſuch as had been taken on board in a ſtate ſo low and feeble that there was ſcarcely a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their recovery. At firſt we ſuſpected that this dreadful diſorder might have been brought upon us by the water that we took on board at Prince's Iſland, or even the turtle that we bought there; but there is not the leaſt reaſon to believe that this ſuſpicion was well grounded, for all the ſhips that came from Batavia at the ſame ſeaſon, ſuffered in the ſame degree, and ſome of them even more ſeverely, though none of them touched at Prince's Iſland in their way.</p>
                        <p>A few days after we left Java, we ſaw boobies about the ſhip for ſeveral nights ſucceſſively, and as theſe birds are known to rooſt every night on ſhore, we thought them an indication that ſome iſland was not far diſtant; perhaps it might be the iſland of Selam, which, in different charts, is very differently laid down both in name and ſituation.</p>
                        <p>The variation of the compaſs off the weſt coaſt of Java is about 3° W, and ſo it continued without any ſenſible variation, in the common track of ſhips to the longitude of 288° W. lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 22 S. after which it increaſed apace, ſo that in longitude 295°, latitude 23°, the variation was 10° 20′ W. in ſeven degrees more of longitude, and one of latitude, it increaſed two degrees; in the ſame ſpace, farther to the weſt, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed five degrees: in latitude 28°, longitude 314°, it was 24° 20′, in latitude 29° longitude 317°, it was 26° 10′, and was then ſtationary for the ſpace of about ten degrees farther to the weſt; but in latitude 34°, longitude 333°, we obſerved it twice to be 28° ¼ W. and this was its greateſt variation, for in latitude 35° ½, longitude 337°, it was 24°, and continued gradually to decreaſe; ſo that off Cape Anguillas it was 22° 30′, and in Table Bay 20° 30′ W.</p>
                        <p>As to currents it did not appear that they were at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, till we came within a little diſtance of the meridian of Madagaſcar; for after we had made 52° of longitude from
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:013324_0529_0F8FFB61D0E783C0"/>
Java Head, we found, by obſervation, that our error in longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude was only two degrees, and it was the ſame when we had made only nineteen. This error might be owing partly to a current ſetting to the weſtward, partly to our not making proper allowances for the ſetting of the ſea before which we run, and perhaps to an error in the aſſumed longitude of Java Head. If that longitude is erroneous, the error muſt be imputed to the imperfection of the charts of which I made uſe in reducing the longitude from Batavia, to that place, for there can be no doubt but that the longitude of Batavia is well determined. After we had paſſed the longitude of 307°, the effects of the weſterly currents began to be conſiderable; for in three days, our error in longitude was 1° 5: the velocity of the current kept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, as we proceeded to the weſtward, in ſo much that for five days ſucceſſively after we made the land, we were driven to the S. W. or S. W. by W. not leſs than twenty leagues a day; and this continued till we were within ſixty or ſeventy leagues of the Cape, where the current ſet ſometimes one way, and ſometimes the other, though inclining rather to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                        <p>After the boobies had left us, we ſaw no more birds till we got nearly a breaſt of Madagaſcar, where, in latitude 27° ¾ S. we ſaw an albatroſs, and after that time we ſaw them every day in great numbers, with birds of ſeveral other ſorts, particularly one about as big as a duck, of a very dark brown colour, with a yellowiſh bill. Theſe birds became more numerous as we approached the ſhore, and as ſoon as we got into ſoundings we ſaw gannets, which we continued to ſee as long as we were upon the bank which ſtretches off Anguillas to the diſtance of forty leagues, and extends along the ſhore to the eaſtward, from Cape Falſe, according to ſome charts, one hundred and ſixty leagues. The real extent of this bank is not exactly known; it is however uſeful as a direction to ſhipping when to haul in, in order to make the land.</p>
                        <p>While we lay here, the Houghton Indiaman ſailed for England, who, during her ſtay in India, loſt by ſickneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thirty and forty men; and when ſhe left the Cape had many in a helpleſs condition with the ſcurvy. Other ſhips ſuffered in the ſame proportion, who had been little more than twelve months abſent from England; our ſufferings therefore were comparatively light, conſidering that we had been abſent near three times as long.</p>
                        <p>Having lain here to recover the ſick, procure ſtores, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſeveral neceſſary operations upon the ſhip and rigging, till the 13th of April, I then got all the ſick on board, ſeveral of whom were ſtill in a dangerous ſtate, and having taken leave of the Governor, I unmoored the next morning, and got ready to ſail.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="241" facs="unknown:013324_0530_0F8FFB6291F398A8"/>
The Cape of Good Hope has been ſo often deſcribed, and is ſo well known in Europe, that I ſhall mention only a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which in other relations are omitted or miſrepreſented.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding all that has been ſaid to the contrary, no country that we ſaw during the voyage makes a more forlorn appearance, or is in reality a more ſterile deſart. The land over the cape, which conſtitutes the peninſula formed by Table Bay on the north, and Falſe Bay on the ſouth, conſiſts of high mountains, altogether naked and deſolate: the land behind theſe to the eaſt, which may be conſidered as the iſthmus, is a plain of vaſt extent, conſiſting almoſt wholly of a light kind of ſea ſand, which produces nothing but heath, and is utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of cultivation. All the ſpots that will admit of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, which together bear about the ſame proportion to the whole as one to one thouſand, are laid out in vineyards, orchards, and kitchen grounds; and moſt of theſe little ſpots lie at a conſiderable diſtance from each other. There is alſo the greateſt reaſon to believe, that in the interior parts of this country, that which is capable of cultivation does not bear a greater proportion to that which is incorrigibly barren; for the Dutch told us, that they had ſettlements eight and twenty days journey up the country, a diſtance equal to at leaſt nine hundred miles, from which they bring proviſions to the Cape by land; ſo that it ſeems reaſonable to conclude that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are not to be had within a leſs compaſs. While we were at the Cape, a farmer came thither from the country, at the diſtance of fifteen days journey, and brought his young child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren with him. We were ſurpriſed at this, and aſked him, if it would not have been better to have left them with his next neighbour: Neighbour! ſaid the man, I have no neighbour within leſs than five days journey of me. Surely the country muſt be deplorably barren in which thoſe who ſettle only to raiſe proviſions for a market, are diſperſed at ſuch diſtances from each other. That the country is every where deſtitute of wood appears to demonſtration; for timber and planks are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from Batavia, and fuel is almoſt as dear as food. We ſaw no tree, except in plantations near the town, that was ſix feet high; and the ſtems that were not thicker than a man's thumb, had roots as thick as an arm or leg; ſuch is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of winds here to the diſadvantage of vegetation, ſetting the ſterility of the ſoil out of the queſtion.</p>
                        <p>The only town which the Dutch have built here is, from its ſituation, called Cape Town, and conſiſts of about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand houſes, neatly built of brick, and in general whited on the outſide; they are however covered only with thatch, for the violence of the ſouth eaſt winds would render any other roof inconvenient and dangerous. The ſtreets are broad and commodious, all croſſing each other at right angles. In the
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:013324_0531_0F90F1E3F99FD8A8"/>
principal ſtreet there is a canal, on each ſide of which is plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a row of oaks, that have flouriſhed tolerably well, and yield an agreeable ſhade: there is a canal alſo in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>A much greater proportion of the inhabitants are Dutch in this place than in Batavia; and as the town is ſupported prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by entertaining ſtrangers, and ſupplying them with neceſſaries, every man, to a certain degree, imitates the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and cuſtoms of the nation with which he is chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. The ladies however are ſo faithful to the mode of their country, that not one of them will ſtir without a chaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied or chauffet, which is carried by a ſervant, that it may be ready to place under her feet whenever ſhe ſhall ſit down. This practice is the more remarkable, as very few of theſe chauffets have fire in them, which indeed the climate renders unneceſſary.</p>
                        <p>The women in general are very handſome; they have fine clear ſkins, and a bloom of colour that indicates a purity of conſtitution, and high health. They make the beſt wives in the world, both as miſtreſſes of a family and mothers; and there is ſcarcely a houſe that does not ſwarm with children.</p>
                        <p>The air is ſalutary in a high degree; ſo that thoſe who bring diſeaſes hither from Europe, generally recover perfect health in a ſhort time; but the diſeaſes that are brought from India are not ſo certainly cured.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding the natural ſterility of the climate, induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try has ſupplied this place with all the neceſſaries, and even the luxuries of life in the greateſt profuſion. The beef and mutton are excellent, though the cattle and ſheep are natives of the country; the cattle are lighter than ours, more neatly made, and have horns that ſpread to a much wider extent. The ſheep are cloathed with a ſubſtance between wool &amp; hair, and have tails of an enormous ſize; we ſaw ſome that weighed twelve pounds, and were told that there were many much larger. Good butter is made of the milk of the cows, but the cheeſe is very much inferior to our own. Here are goats, but they are never eaten, hogs, and a variety of poultry. Hares are alſo found here, exactly like thoſe of Europe; antelopes of many kinds, quails of two ſorts, and buſtards, which are well flavoured, but not juicy. The fields produce European wheat and barley, and the gardens European vegetables, and fruit of all kinds, beſides plantains, guavas, jambu, and ſome other Indian fruits, but theſe are not in perfection; the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in particular, are very bad, and the guavas no larger than gooſeberries. The vineyards alſo produce wine of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſorts, but not equal to thoſe of Europe, except the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia,
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:013324_0532_0F90F1E4D24E14B8"/>
which is made genuine only at one vineyard, about ten miles diſtant from the town. There is another vineyard near it, where wine is made that is called by the ſame name, but it is greatly inferior.</p>
                        <p>The common method in which ſtrangers live here, is to lodge and board with ſome of the inhabitants, many of whoſe houſes are always open for their reception: the rates are from five ſhillings to two ſhillings a day, for which all neceſſaries are found. Coaches may be hired at four and twenty ſhillings a day, and horſes at ſix ſhillings; but the country affords very little temptation to uſe them. There are no public entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and thoſe that are private, to which ſtrangers, of the rank of Gentlemen are always admitted, were ſuſpended while we were there by the breaking out of the meaſles.</p>
                        <p>At the farther end of the high ſtreet, the Company have a garden, which is about two thirds of an Engliſh mile long; the whole is divided by walks that interſect each other at right angles, and are planted with oaks that are clipt into wall hedges, except in the center walk, where they are ſuffered to grow to their full ſize, and afford an agreeable ſhade, which is the more welcome, as, except the plantations by the ſides of the two canals, there is not a ſingle tree that would ſerve even for a ſhepherd's buſh, within many miles of the town. The greater part of this garden is kitchen ground; but two ſmall ſquares are allotted to botanical plants, which did not appear to be ſo numerous by one half as they were when Oldenland wrote his catalogue. At the farther end of the garden is a menagerie, in which there are many birds and beaſts that are never ſeen in Europe; particularly a beaſt called by the Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentots <hi>Coe Doe,</hi> which is as large as a horſe, and has the fine ſpiral horns which are ſometimes ſeen in private and public collections of curioſities.</p>
                        <p>Of the natives of this country, we could learn but little, except from report; for there were none of their habitations, where alone they retain their original cuſtoms, within leſs than four days journey from the town; thoſe that we ſaw at the Cape were all ſervants to Dutch farmers, whoſe cattle they take care of, and are employed in other drudgery of the meaneſt kind. Theſe are in general of a ſlim make, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lean than plump, but remarkably ſtrong, nimble, and active. Their ſize is nearly the ſame with that of Europeans, and we ſaw ſome that were ſix feet high: their eyes are dull and without expreſſion: their ſkins are of the colour of ſoot, but that is in a great meaſure cauſed by dirt, which is ſo wrought into the grain that it cannot be diſtinguiſhed from complexion; for I believe they never waſh any part of their bodies. Their hair curls ſtrongly, not like a negroe's, but falls in ringlets about ſeven or eight inches long. Their
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:013324_0533_0F90F1E58401C5A8"/>
clothing conſiſts of a ſkin, generally that of a ſheep, thrown over their ſhoulders; beſides which, the men wear a ſmall pouch in the middle of the waiſt, and the women, a broad leather flap, both which hang from a girdle, or belt, that is adorned with beads, and ſmall pieces of copper. Both men and women wear necklaces, and ſometimes bracelets, of beads; and the women wear rings of hard leather round their ancles, to defend them from the thorns, with which their country every where abounds: ſome of them have a ſandal, made of wood or bark; but the greater part of them are unſhed.</p>
                        <p>To a European, their language appears to be ſcarcely arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate; beſides which it is diſtinguiſhed by a very remarkable ſingularity. At very frequent intervals, while they are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they cluck with their tongue againſt the roof of the mouth: theſe clucks do not appear to have any meaning, but rather to divide what they ſay into ſentences. Moſt of theſe Hottentots ſpeak Dutch, without any peculiarity of pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation.</p>
                        <p>They are all modeſt, even to ſheepiſhneſs; for it was not without the greateſt difficulty that we could perſuade any of them to dance, or even to ſpeak in their own language to each other, in our preſence. We did however both ſee them dance, and hear them ſing; their dances are by turns active and ſluggiſh to exceſs; ſometimes conſiſting of quick and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent motions, with ſtrange diſtortions of the body, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural leaps backwards and forwards, with the legs croſſing each other; and being ſometimes ſo ſpiritleſs that the dancer only ſtrikes the ground firſt with one foot, and then with the other, neither changing place, nor moving any other part of his body: the ſongs alſo are alternately to quick and ſlow movements, in the ſame extremes as the dance.</p>
                        <p>We made many enquiries concerning theſe people of ſhe Dutch, and the following particulars are related upon the credit of their report.</p>
                        <p>Within the boundaries of the Dutch ſettlements there are ſeveral nations of theſe people, who very much differ from each other in their cuſtoms and manner of life: all however are friendly and peaceable, except one clan that is ſettled to the eaſtward, which the Dutch call <hi>Boſch men,</hi> and theſe live entirely by plunder, or rather by cheſt; for they never attack their neighbours openly, but ſteal the cattle privately in the night. They are armed however to defend themſelves, if they happen to be detected, with lances or aſſagays, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, which they know how to poiſon by various ways, ſome with the juice of herbs, and ſome with the venom of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent called <hi>Cobra di Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>lo;</hi> in the hands of theſe people a ſtone alſo is a very formidable weapon, for they can throw it
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:013324_0534_0F90F1E638582DD8"/>
with ſuch force and exactneſs as repeatedly to hit a dollar at the diſtance of a hundred paces. As a defence againſt theſe free-booters, the other Indians train up balls, which they place round their towns in the night, and which, upon the approach of either man or beaſt, will aſſemble and oppoſe them, till they hear the voice of their maſters encouraging them to fight, or calling them off, which they obey with the ſame docility as a dog.</p>
                        <p>Some nations have the art of melting and preparing copper, which is found among them, probably native; and of this they make broad plates, which they wear as ornaments upon their foreheads. Some of them alſo know how to harden bits of iron, which they procure from the Dutch, and form into knives, ſo as to give them a temper ſuperior to that of any they can buy.</p>
                        <p>The Chiefs, many of whom are poſſeſſors of very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous herds of cattle, are generally clad in the ſkins of lions, tygers, or zebras, to which they add fringes, and other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments in a very good taſte. Both ſexes frequently anoint the body with greaſe, but never uſe any that is rancid or foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid, if freſh can be had. Mutton ſuet and butter are generally uſed for this purpoſe; butter is preferred, which they make by ſhaking the milk in a bag made of the ſkin of ſome beaſt.</p>
                        <p>We were told that the prieſt certainly gives the nuptial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction by ſprinkling the bride and bridegroom with his urine. But the Dutch univerſally declared that the women never wrapped the entrails of ſheep round heir legs, as they have been ſaid to do, and afterwards make them part of their food. Semicaſtration was alſo abſolutely denied to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; but it was acknowledged that ſome among the particular nation which knew how to melt copper had ſuffered that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, who were ſaid to be the beſt warriors, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to excel in the art of throwing ſtones.</p>
                        <p>We were very deſirous to determine the great queſtion among natural hiſtorians, whether the women of this country have or have not that fleſhy flap or apron which has been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Sinus pudoris;</hi> and what we learnt I ſhall relate. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Dutch and Malays', who ſaid they had received fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from Hottentots women, poſitively denied its exiſtence; but a phyſician of the place declared that he had cured many hundred of venereal complaints, and never ſaw one without two fleſhy, or rather ſkinny appendages, proceeding from the upper part of the <hi>Labia,</hi> in appearance ſomewhat reſembling the te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

the bottom of the abdomen, of ſufficient extent to render an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial covering of the neighbouring parts unneceſſary.</p>
                        <p>Thus much for the country, its productions, and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. The bay is large, ſafe, and commodious; it lies open indeed to the north weſt winds, but they ſeldom blow hand; yet as they ſometimes ſend in a great ſea, the ſhips moor N. E. and S. W. ſo as to have an open hawſer with north weſt winds: the ſouth eaſt winds blow frequently with great violence, but as this direction is right out of the bay, they are not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. Near the town a wharf of wood is run out to a proper diſtance, for the convenience of landing and ſhipping goods. To this wharf water is conveyed in pipes, from which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral boats may fill water at the ſame time; and ſeveral large boats or hoys are kept by the Company to carry ſtores and proviſions to and from the ſhipping in the harbour. The bay is defended by a ſquare ſort, ſituated cloſe to the beach on the eaſt ſide of the town, and by ſeveral outworks and batteries extending along the ſhore, as well on this ſide of the town as the other; but they are ſo ſituated as to be cannonaded by ſhipping, and are in a manner defenceleſs againſt an enemy of any force by land. The garriſon conſiſts of eight hundred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular troops, beſides militia of the country, in which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended every man able to bear arms. They have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances to alarm the whole country by ſignals in a very ſhort time, and the militia is then to repair immediately to the town.</p>
                        <p>The French, at Mauritins, are ſupplied from this place with ſalted beef, biſcuit, flour, and wine: the proviſions for which the French contracted this year were 500,000 lb. weight of ſale beef, 400,000 lb. of flour, 400,000 lb. of biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, and 1,200 leagers of wine.</p>
                        <p>In the morning of the 14, we weighed and ſtood out of the bay; and at five in the evening anchored under Penquin, or Robin Iſland: we lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But as ſoon as the boat came near the ſhore, the Dutch hailed her, and warned the people not to land at their peril, bringing down at the ſame time fix armed men with Muſquets, who paraded upon the beach. The officer who commanded the boat, not thinking it worth while to riſk the lives of the people on board for the ſake of a few cabbages, which were all we wanted, returned to the ſhip. At firſt we were at a loſs to account for our repulſe, but we afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected, that to this iſland the Dutch at the Cape baniſh ſuch criminals as are not thought worthy of death, for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of years, proportioned to the offence; and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them as ſlaves in digging line-ſtone, which though
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:013324_0536_0F90F1E9398E0DF8"/>
ſcarce upon the continent is plenty here: and that a Daniſh ſhip, which by ſickneſs had loſt great part of her crew, and had been refuſed aſſiſtance at the Cape, came down to this iſland, and ſending her boat aſhore, ſecured the guard, and took on board as many of the criminals as ſhe thought proper to navigate her home: we concluded therefore that the Dutch, to prevent the reſcue of their criminals in time to come, had given order to their people here to ſuffer no boat of any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nation to come aſhore.</p>
                        <p>On the 25th, at three o'clock in the afternoon, we weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a light breeze at S. E. and put to ſea. About an hour afterwards, we loſt our Maſter, Mr. Robert Mollineux, a young man of good parts, but unhappily given to intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, which brought on diſorders that put an end to his life.</p>
                        <p>We proceeded in our voyage homeward without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable incident; and in the morning of the 29th, we croſſed our firſt meridian, having circumnavigated the globe in the direction from eaſt to weſt, and conſequently loſt a day, for which we made an allowance at Batavia.</p>
                        <p>At day-break, on the 1ſt of May, we ſaw the iſland of St. Helena; and at noon, we anchored in the road before James's Fort.</p>
                        <p>We ſtaid here till the 4th, to refreſh, and Mr. Banks im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the time in making the complete circuit of the iſland, and viſiting the moſt remarkable places upon it.</p>

The bottom of it is ſlightly covered with herbage, but the ſides are as naked as the cliffs that are next the ſea.
