            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THE Reader muſt not expect in the following Sheets, a particular and minute Relation of every Formality, Queſtion and Anſwer that paſs'd upon the Trials, it may ſuffice, if he be aſſured he has the Subſtance; for indeed more cannot be expected, when it is conſidered, that we have no One here, as in our Mother Country, who make it a Buſineſs to take Notes upon ſuch Occaſions; or any others, that we know of, who are ſo dexterous at Short-Hand, as to be ſufficiently qualified for ſuch a Purpoſe; but he will be ſure to have all that could be collected from the Notes that were taken by the Court, and Gentlemen at the Bar; with all which the Compiler has been furniſhed.</hi>

               <hi>Upon a Review of the Proceedings, in order for this Undertaking, the Bulk of them, which was the Product of about</hi> Six Months Enquiry, <hi>ſeem'd ſomewhat diſcouraging: No doubt, they might have been conracted, if this Work had been proceeded upon in the Method of an Hiſtorical Relation only, wherein the Compiler would have been more at Liberty to abſtract the ſeveral Originals; but it was concluded,</hi> a Journal <hi>would give more Satisfaction, inaſmuch as in ſuch a kind of Proceſs, the Depoſitions and Examinations themſelves, which were the Ground-work of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, would appear at large; which moſt probably would afford Conviction, to ſuch as have a Diſpoſition to be convinc'd, and have</hi> in Reality <hi>doubted, whether any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Convicts had Juſtice done them or not, notwithſtanding they had the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of</hi> ſeeing <hi>and</hi> hearing <hi>a great deal concerning them; and others, who had not ſuch Opportunities, who were prejudiced at a Diſtance in their Disfavour, by frivolous Reports, might the readier be undeceiv'd: For as the Proceedings are ſet forth in the Order of Time they were produced, the Reader will thereby be furniſhed with the moſt natural View of the Whole; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus far, however, the Compiler thinks proper to premiſe, that as he found it convenient to divide the Originals into number'd Sections, for the more ready Reference to the ſeveral Parts of them, as Occaſion ſhould offer; he took the Liberty alſo of lopping off from them, what, in print, he thought would be a ſuperfluous Formality, ſuch as</hi> The Deponent further ſaith, <hi>and ſuch like, which he thought would have been a needleſs Incumbrance to the Book.</hi>

               </gap> Beginning, <hi>if the Judges had not found it expedient to examine the Perſons accuſed, upon their firſt taking into Cuſtody, whereby it ſeemed moſt likely the Truth would bolt out, before they had Time to cool, or Opportunity of diſcourſing in the Jail with their Confederates who were before committed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Examinations thus taken by the Judges, were ſoon after laid before the Grand Jury, who interrogated the Parties therefrom in ſuch manner, as generally produced from them the Subſtance of the ſame Matter, and often ſomething more, by which Means there accrued no ſmall Advantage; for though where the laſt Examination brought to light new Diſcovery, yet it will be ſeldom found, there is any Thing in ſuch further Examinations contradictory to the former, but generally a Confirmation of them; and in ſuch Caſe, the ſetting forth the ſame at large, may not be thought a uſeleſs Tautology; not that this will happen often, and where it does, 'twill be chiefly found in the Examinations and Confeſſions of Negroes, who, in ordinary Caſes, are ſeldom found to hold twice in the ſame Story; which, for its Rarety therefore, if it carried not with it the additional Weight of the greater Appearance of Truth, may make this Particular the more excuſable; and further, this is</hi> a Diary <hi>of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that is to be exhibited; therefore, in Conformity to that Plan, Nothing ſhould be omitted, which may be of any Uſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All proper Precautions were taken by the Judges, that the Criminals ſhould be kept ſeparate; and they were ſo as much as the ſcanty Room in the Jail would admit of; and new Appartments were accordingly fitted up for their Reception: But more particular Care was taken, that ſuch Negroes as had made Confeſſion and Diſcovery, and were to be made Uſe of as Witneſſes, ſhould be kept a-part from the reſt, and as much from each other, as the Accommodations would allow of, in order to prevent their caballing together; and the Witneſſes were always examined a-part from each other firſt, as well upon the Trials, as otherwiſe, and then generally confronted with the Perſons they accuſed, who were uſually ſent for and taken into Cuſtody upon ſuch Examinations, if they were to be met with; which was the Means of bringing many others to a Confeſſion, as well ſuch as were newly taken up, as thoſe who had long before been committed, perhaps upon ſlighter Grounds, and had inſiſted upon their Innocence; for they had generally the Cunning not to own their Guilt, 'til they knew their Accuſers: But notwithſtanding this was the ordinary Method taken, both by the Judges and Grand Jury, to ſend for the Parties as ſoon as impeached, (which however might ſometimes through Hurry be omitted) yet ſeveral who happen'd

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Trouble of examining Criminals in general, may be eaſily gueſs'd at; but the Fatigue in that of Negroes, is not to be conceived, but by thoſe that have undergone the Drudgery: The Difficulty of bringing, and holding them to the Truth, if by Chance it ſtarts from them, is not to be ſurmounted but by the cloſeſt Attention; many of them have a great deal of Craft; their unintelligible Jargon ſtands them in great Stead, to conceal their Meaning; ſo that an Examiner muſt expect to encounter with much Perplexity; grope through a Maze of Obſcurity; be obliged to lay hold of broken Hints, lay them carefully together, and thoroughly weigh and compare them with each other, before he can be able to ſee the Light, or fix thoſe Creatures to any certain determinate Meaning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Though for the Reaſons before mentioned, all the Trials could not be ſet forth at large; yet on the principal Trials, ſuch as,</hi> The Hughſons, Ury the Prieſt, Quack and Cuffee, <hi>(the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>'Tis moſt likely they did not, (nor could it be expected they ſhould) deliver themſelves preciſely in the ſame Words: But Abſtracts were taken of thoſe Evidences, and Briefs prepared for the Council concern'd in each Trial, pointing out the ſeveral Articles affecting each Criminal; whereby the Council were readily led to aſk a Witneſs ſuch Queſtions as would naturally draw out the Subſtance of the ſame Matter in Anſwer, if it were the Truth; and it was obſerved by thoſe more immediately concerned in theſe Affairs, and whoſe Province it was to give cloſe Attention to them, that the Witneſſes both Whites and Blacks, generally kept cloſe to the Text, and delivered in Court the Subſtance of the Evidence they had before given in their Depoſitions, Examinations, and Confeſſions.</hi>

               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:005413_0005_1017392BB1333ED0"/>
Secondly, <hi>That what the Witneſſes did actualy declare in Court upon the Trials, was ſufficient to convince</hi> twelve <hi>honeſt Men upon their Oaths, that the Accuſed were guilty; and there is no other Way left to furniſh the Reader with the Grounds which gave ſuch Conviction to the Juries.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>On Saturday Night the 28th <hi>February,</hi> 1740-1, a Robbery was committed at the Houſe of Mr. ROBERT HOGG, in the City of <hi>New-York,</hi> Merchant, from whence were taken diverſe Pieces of Linnen and other Goods, and ſeveral Silver Coins, chiefly Spaniſh, and Medals, and wrought Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Value in the Whole of <hi>Sixty Pounds</hi> and upwards.</p>
            <p>The Occaſion of this Robbery, as was diſcovered, and will appear more fully hereafter, was one <hi>Wilſon,</hi> a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <q>The Thurſday before this Robbery was committed, <hi>Wilſon</hi> came to Mr. <hi>Hogg'</hi>s Shop with one of the Man-of-War's People, to buy ſome checqued Linnen; and having bargained for ſome, Part of the Money offered in Payment was of Spaniſh Coin; and Mrs. <hi>Hogg</hi> opening her Bureau to change the Money, pulled out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Mrs. <hi>Hogg'</hi>s Apprehenſions happened to be right; for this Boy having a Sight of the Money, was charmed with it, and, as it ſeems, wanted to be fingering of it; he told his Comrades of the Black-Guard, the before named <hi>Caeſar, Prince</hi> and <hi>Cuffee,</hi> where they might have a fine Booty, if they could manage cleverly to come at it; he ſaid, it was at <hi>Hogg'</hi>s Houſe in the Broad-Street; his Wife kept a Shop of Goods, and ſold Candles, Rum and Molaſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Negroes catched at the Propoſal, and the Scheme was communicated by them to <hi>John Hughſon,</hi> who kept a Publick Houſe by the North River in this City, a Place where Numbers of Negroes uſed to reſort, and be entertained privately (in Defiance of the Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Boy <hi>(Wilſon)</hi> told them the Situation of the Houſe and Shop; that the Front was towards Broad-Street; that there was a Side Door out of the Shop into a little Lane, commonly called the Jews-Alley, and if they could contrive an Errand thither to buy Rum, they might take an

            <p>With this <hi>Peggy,</hi> as ſhe will be hereafter commonly called, <hi>Caeſar</hi> uſed frequently to ſleep at <hi>Hughſon'</hi>s, with the Knowledge and Permiſſion of the Family; and <hi>Caeſar</hi> bargained with and paid <hi>Hughſon</hi> for her Board: She came there to lodge a ſecond Time in the Fall, not long before <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> 1740, big with Child by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and was brought to Bed there, not many Days before the Robbery at <hi>Hogg'</hi>s, of a Babe largely partaking of a motley Complexion.</p>
            <p>Here is laid the Foundation of the Characters of <hi>Hugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and his Family, <hi>Peggy</hi> and <hi>John Romme;</hi> which will afford frequent Occaſion of enlarging upon: And from ſuch an hopeful Earneſt, the Reader may well expect a plentiful Harveſt.</p>

               <p>ABOUT One o'Clock this Day a Fire broke out of the Roof of his Majeſty's Houſe at <hi>Fort George,</hi> within this City, near the Chappel: When the Alarm of a Fire was firſt given, it was obſerved from the Town, that the Middle of the Roof was in a great Smoke, but not a Spark of Fire appeared on the Out-ſide for a conſiderable Time; and when it firſt broke out, it was on the Eaſt Side, about Twenty Feet from the End next the Chappel, and in a ſhort Time afterwards, it made it's Way through the Roof in ſeveral Places, at a Diſtance from the Firſt, and each other. Upon the Chappel Bell's ringing, great Numbers of People, Gentlemen and others, came to the Aſſiſtance of the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Governor and his Family; and as the People of this City, to do them Juſtice, are very active and diligent upon theſe Occaſions, moſt of the Houſhold Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were removed out and ſaved, and the Fire Engines were in a little Time brought thither; but the Wind blowing a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Gale at S. E. as ſoon as the Fire appeared in different Places of the Roof, it was judged impoſſible to ſave the Houſe and Chappel; ſo that Endeavours were uſed to ſave the Secretary's Office over the Fort Gate, where the Records of the Colony were repoſited; and alſo the Barracks which ſtood on the Side of the Quadrangle oppoſite to the Houſe; ſuch Diligence was uſed in removing the Records, Books and Papers from the Former, many of which for Diſpatch were thrown out of the Windows next the Town, that moſt of them were preſerved; and though, from the Violence of the Wind, the Papers were blown about the Streets, we don't hear that any very material Writings were loſt; but the Fire had got hold of the Roof of the Office ſoon after they began to remove the Records, and though the Engines played ſome time upon it and afterwards upon the Barracks, they were of little Service, the Wind blowing very hard, and the Flames of the Houſe being ſo near them, all ſeemed to be at their Mercy; and an Alarm being given that there was Gun-Powder in the Fort, whether through Fear and an Apprehenſion that there was, or whether the Hint was given by ſome of the Conſpirators themſelves, with artful Deſign to intimidate the People, and frighten them from giving further Aſſiſtance, we cannot ſay; though the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Governor declared to every Body, that there was none there; yet they had not the Courage to depend upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>But though the Floors of the ſeveral Buildings ſoon tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in, there were many Pieces of Timber which were laid in the Walls of the Houſe, Chappel Steeple, and other Buildings, which continued burning almoſt all the Night after; ſo that we could not think the Town quite out of Danger of further Miſchief, 'till thoſe Timbers were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely conſumed; for 'twas apprehended, as the Fort ſtood upon an Eminence, that the Wind according as it ſhould have happened to change, might have blown ſome of the Fire upon the Houſes in the Town, which, for the moſt Part, have ſhingled Roofs; therefore Care was taken to keep a watchful Guard all the Night to prevent further Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>

               <p>THE RECORDER taking Notice of the ſeveral Fires which had lately happened in this City, and the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of them, which had put the Inhabitants into the utmoſt Conſternation; that every one that reflected on the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attending them, the Frequency of them, and the Cauſes yet undiſcovered; muſt neceſſarily conclude, that they were occaſioned and ſet on Foot by ſome villainous Confederacy of latent Enemies amongſt us; but with what Intent or Purpoſe, Time muſt diſcover; that it could not be doubted, but the Lieutenant Governor and His Majeſty's Council had taken the Alarm at this Time of Danger, and were watchful, and anxious for the Safety of the City; and tho they were of Opinion, that it was highly proper and neceſſary that a Proclamation ſhould be iſſued by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, promiſing proper Rewards to ſuch Perſon and Perſons as ſhould make ſuch Diſcovery of the Incendiaties, their Confederates and Accomplices, as that they ſhould be convicted thereof; <hi>Yet it was well known that the Governor and Council had not the Liberty of drawing upon the Colony Treaſurer for any Sum of Money whatſoever, upon any Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency:</hi> And it could not be reaſonably expected the Governor ſhould ſubject himſelf to pay ſuch Rewards out of his own Pocket, for the Uſe and Neceſſities of the Publick; that as the Safety of the City, ſo immediately concerned, ſeemed abſolutely to require ſuch a Meaſure to be taken; ſo the Publick, who were alſo intereſted in the Preſervation of it, would reap the Benefit in common with them, by the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations laudible Reſolution, ſhould they determine to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to pay proper Rewards, and requeſt the Governor to iſſue a Proclamation agreeable thereto; which, he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, the Governor was well inclined to do, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Council to adviſe thereto; <hi>He therefore moved,</hi> 
                  <q>That the Board ſhould come to a Reſolution to pay ſuch Rewards as ſhould by them be thought a proper and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Temptation to induce any Party or Parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to make ſuch Diſcovery.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Upon Conſideration whereof, it was</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ordered,</hi> That this Board requeſt his Honour the Lieutenant-Governor to iſſue a Proclamation, offering a Reward to any white Perſon that ſhould diſcover any Perſon or Perſons lately concerned in ſetting Fire to any Dwelling Houſe or Storehouſe in this City (ſo that ſuch Perſon or Perſons be convicted thereof,) The <hi>Sum of One Hundred Pounds,</hi> Current Money of this Province; and that ſuch Perſon ſhall be pardoned, if concerned therein: And any Slave that ſhould make Diſcovery, to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numitted, or made free; and the Maſter of ſuch Slave to receive <hi>Twenty-Five Pounds</hi> therefore; and the Slave to receive, beſides his Freedom, the Sum of <hi>Twenty Pounds,</hi> and to be pardoned; and if a Free Negro, Mulatto, or Indian, to receive <hi>Forty-Five Pounds,</hi> and alſo to be pardoned, if concerned therein: And that this Board will iſſue their Warrant to the Chamberlain, or Treaſurer of this Corporation for the Payment of ſuch Sum as any Perſon by Vertue of ſuch Proclamation ſhall be intitled unto. And that the Mayor and Recorder wait on his Honour the Lieutenant-Governor, and acquaint him with the Reſolution of this Board.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Mayor and Recorder waited on His Honour accordingly, and a Copy of the Order was alſo delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Many Perſons in the Neighbourhood of the ſeveral Fires beforementioned, thought it neceſſary to remove their Houſhold Goods for Safety; and in their Conſternation, as was natural, ſuffered any Body who offered their Aſſiſtance, to take them away; by which Means, ſome Villians had the Cruelty to make Prey of them; for there were great Complaints of Loſſes upon thoſe Occaſions, which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates took this Day into their Conſideration. And it being much ſuſpected that there were ſome Strangers lurking about the City, who had been the wicked Inſtruments and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe Fires; but upon the Suppoſition only, that by thoſe Means, they might have Opportunities of Pilfering and Plundering. A Scheme was propoſed, that there ſhould be a general Search of all Houſes throughout the Town, whereby it was thought probable Diſcoveries might be made, not only of ſtolen Goods, but likewiſe of Lodgers,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005413_0017_1017394E60AF10C0"/>
that were Strangers, and ſuſpicious Perſons: The Propoſal was approved of, and each Alderman and his Common Council-Man, with Conſtables attending them, undertook to ſearch his reſpective Ward on the South Side of the Freſh Water Pond; and the Monday following was the Day fixed upon for making the Experiment.</p>
               <p>The Scheme was communicated to the Governor, and his Honour thought fit to Order the Militia out that Day in Aid of the Magiſtrates, who were to be diſperſed through the City, and Centries of them poſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>PURSUANT to the Scheme concerted on Saturday laſt, the <hi>general Search</hi> was made; but there were not any Goods diſcovered which were ſaid to have been loſt, nor was there any ſtrange Lodger of ſuſpicious Perſons detected: But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which made him ſuſpect they were not come ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly by; and therefore ordered the Conſtable to take them in Poſſeſſion, to be reſerved for further Enquiry: And theſe two Negroes were committed.</p>

               <p>THE Lieutenant-Governor, by and with the Advice of his Majeſty's Council, iſſued a Proclamation, therein reciting the beforementioned Order and Reſolution of the Common Council, promiſing the Rewards agreeable thereto.</p>
               <p>In the mean whiile, between the Sixth and the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Inſtant, a great deal of Time had been ſpent by the Magiſtrates in the Examination of the Negroes in Cuſtody, upon Account of theſe Fires, but nothing could be got out of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cuff</hi> (PHILIPSE's) was cloſely interrogated, but he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely denied knowing any thing of the Matter; he ſaid he had been at home all that Afternoon, from the Time he returned from <hi>Hilton'</hi>s Fire, where he had been to aſſiſt and carry Buckets: That he was at home when the Bell rung for the Fire at Col. <hi>Philipſe'</hi>s Storehouſe. It appeared, upon Enquiry and Examination of Witneſſes, that he, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Maſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Orders, had been ſawing Wood that Afternon with a white Boy; and that when his Maſter came home from Dinner, he took him off from that Work, and ſet him to ſew on a Vane upon a Board for his Sloop; the white Boy teſtified, <q>That he ſtood by him to ſee him ſew it, and that he left him but a little before the Bell rung for the Fire:</q> And when the Alarm of the Fire was, and that 'twas ſuppos'd to be at his Maſter's Storehouſe, it was ſaid, <hi>Cuff</hi> was aſked whether he would go out with the Buckets, and that he ſhould anſwer, <hi>he had enough of being out in the Morning.</hi> Some of the Neighbours alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they had ſeen him looking over his Maſter's Door but a little before the Bell rung: But an old Man who had known <hi>Cuffee</hi> for ſeveral Years, depoſed, that he had ſeen him at the Fire at the Storehouſe, and that he ſtood next him: There ſeemed to be ſome Objection againſt the Man's Evidence; 'twas thought he might be Miſtaken, being very near-ſighted; Upon Examination, 'twas found he could diſtinguiſh Colours, and he deſcribed the Clothes he had on, and moreover declared, he ſpoke to him, and aſked him, why he did not hand the Buckets; and that thereupon he anſwered him, and did hand Water, and that he knew his Voice.</p>
               <p>There was very ſtrong Proof that he was the Negro that leaped out of the Window of one of the Storehouſes as the Fire was extinguiſhed, and moſt of the People drawn away upon the new Alarm of a Fire; that he was ſeen to leap over ſeveral Garden Fences, and to run home in great Haſte.</p>
               <p>Upon the Whole, 'twas thought proper <hi>Cuff</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in Confinement, to await further Diſcovery.</p>

                     <p>This Crime is of ſo ſhocking a Nature. that if we have any in this City, who, having been guilty thereof, ſhould eſcape, who can ſay he is ſafe, or tell where it will end?</p>

                  <p>PRESENT. The Second Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>The Court opened, and adjourned till Ten o'Clock To-morrow Morning.</p>
                  <p>THE Grand Jury having been informed, That <hi>Mary Burton</hi> could give them ſome Account concerning the Goods ſtolen from Mr. <hi>Hogg'</hi>s; ſent for her this Morning, <hi>and ordered ſhe ſhould be ſworn;</hi> the Conſtable returned and acquainted them, that <hi>ſhe ſaid ſhe would not be ſworn, nor give Evidence:</hi> Whereupon they ordered the Conſtable to get a Warrant from a Magiſtrate to bring her before them. The Conſtable was ſome time gone, but at length returned, and brought her with him; and being aſked <hi>why ſhe would not be ſworn, and give her Evidence?</hi> She told the Grand Jury <hi>ſhe would not be ſworn;</hi> and ſeemed to be under ſome great Uneaſineſs, or terrible Apprehenſions; which gave Suſpicion that ſhe knew ſomething concerning the Fires that had lately happened: And being aſk'd a Queſtion to that Purpoſe, <hi>ſhe gave no Anſwer;</hi> which increaſed the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy that ſhe was Privy to them: And as it was thought a Matter of the utmoſt Concern, the Grand Jury was very importunate, and uſed many Arguments with her, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and private, to perſuade her to ſpeak the Truth, and tell all ſhe knew about it. To this End, the Lieutenant Governor's Proclamation was read to her, promiſing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity, and the Reward of <hi>One Hundred Pounds</hi> to any Perſon, Confederate or not, who ſhould make Diſcovery, <hi>&amp;c. She ſeemed to deſpiſe it,</hi> nor could the Grand Jury by any Means, either Threats or Promiſes, prevail upon her, though they aſſured her withal, that ſhe ſhould have the Protection of the Magiſtrates, and her Perſon be ſafe and ſecure from harm; but hitherto all was in vain: Therefore the Grand Jury deſired Alderman <hi>Banker</hi> to commit her; and the Conſtable was charged with her accordingly; but before he had got her to the Jail, ſhe conſidered better of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and reſolved to be ſworn, and give her Evidence in the Afternoon.</p>

                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005413_0020_10173958A777F160"/>
Accordingly, ſhe <hi>being ſworn,</hi> came before the Grand Jury; but as they were proceeding to her Examination, and <hi>before they aſked her any Queſtions,</hi> ſhe told them ſhe would acquaint them with what ſhe knew relating to the Goods ſtolen from Mr. <hi>Hogg'</hi>s, <hi>but would ſay nothing about the Fires.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Expreſſion thus, as it were Providentially, ſlipping from the Evidence, much alarmed the Grand Jury; for, as they naturally concluded, it did by Conſtruction amount to an Affirmative, that ſhe could give an Account of the Occaſion of the ſeveral Fires; and-therefore, as it highly became thoſe Gentlemen in the Diſcharge of their Truſt, they determined to uſe their utmoſt Diligence to ſift out the Diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>But ſtill ſhe remained inflexible; till at length, having recourſe to Religious Topicks, repreſenting to her the Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſneſs of the Crime which ſhe would be guilty of, if ſhe was privy to, and could diſcover, ſo wicked a Deſign, as the Firing Houſes about our Ears; whereby not only Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Eſtates would be deſtroyed, but many Perſons might looſe their Lives in the Flames: This ſhe would have to anſwer for at the Day of Judgment, as much as any Perſon immediately concerned; becauſe ſhe might have prevented this Diſtruction, and would not; ſo that a moſt damnable Sin would lie at her Door; and what need ſhe fear from her divulging it; ſhe was ſure of the Protection of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates? Or the Grand Jury expreſſed themſelves in Words to the ſame Purpoſe; which Arguments at laſt prevailed, and ſhe gave the following Evidence: Which, however, notwithſtanding what had been ſaid, came from her, as if ſtill under ſome terrible Apprehenſions or Reſtraints.</p>

                     <p>But before I proceed to Sentence, I muſt tell you, that you have been proceeded againſt in the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as any white Man, guilty of your Crimes would have been: You had not only the Liberty of ſending for your Witneſſes; aſking them ſuch Queſtions as you thought proper; but likewiſe making the beſt Defence you could; and as you have been convicted by twelve honeſt Men upon their Oaths; ſo the juſt Judgment of GOD has at length overtaken you.</p>
                     <p>I have great Reaſon to believe, that the Crimes you now ſtand convicted of, are not the leaſt of thoſe you have been concerned in; for by your general Characters you have been very wicked Fellows, hardened Sinners, and ripe, as well as ready, for the moſt enormous and

daring Enterprizes; eſpecially you, <hi>Caeſar:</hi> And as the Time you have yet to live is to be but very ſhort, I earneſtly adviſe and exhort both of you to employ it in the moſt diligent and beſt Manner you can, by confeſſing your Sins, repenting ſincerely of them, and praying GOD of his infinite Goodneſs to have Mercy on your Souls: And as GOD knows the Secrets of your Hearts, and cannot be cheated or impoſed upon; ſo you muſt ſhortly give an Account to him, and anſwer for all your Actions; and depend upon it, if you do not truly repent before you die, there is a Hell to puniſh the Wicked eternally.</p>
                     <p>And as it is not in your Powers to make full Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the many Injuries you have done the Publick; ſo I adviſe both of you to do all that in you is, to prevent <hi>further Miſchiefs;</hi> by diſcovering ſuch Perſons as have been concerned with you in deſigning or endeavouring to burn this City, and to deſtroy its Inhabitants: This I am fully perſuaded is in your Power to do if you will; if ſo, and you do not make ſuch Diſcovery; be aſſured God Almighty will puniſh you for it, though we do not: Therefore I adviſe you to conſider this well, and I hope both of you will tell the Truth.</p>
                     <p>And now, Nothing further remains for me to ſay; but</p>
                     <p>THAT you <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and you <hi>Prince,</hi> are to be taken hence to the Place from whence you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution, and there you, and each of you, are to be hanged by the Neck until you be dead.</p>

                        <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>

                     <p>No Scheme more monſtrous could have been invented; nor can any Thing be thought of more fooliſh, than the Motives that induced theſe Wretches to enter into it! What more ridiculous, than that <hi>Hughſon</hi> in Conſequence of this Scheme, ſhould become a <hi>King! Caeſar</hi> (now in Gibbets a <hi>Governor!</hi> That the White Men ſhould be all killed, and the Women become a Prey to the rapacious Luſt of theſe Villains! That theſe Slaves ſhould thereby eſtabliſh themſelves in Peace and Freedom in the plunder'd Wealth of their ſlaughter'd Maſters!

                     <p>Yet, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> INCREC<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>BLE as ſuch a Plot would have ſeemed to have been, the Event has in Part proved it to be REAL. Whence elſe could ſo many Fires have been lighted up all around you in ſo ſhort a Time, with evident Marks of wilful Deſign? A Deſign that could not be executed but by ſeveral Hands.</p>
                     <p>Now, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the Priſoners at the Bar ſtand charged with being principal Parties in this TRAGICAL DESIGN, and two of the prime Incendiaries; <hi>Quack</hi> for <hi>burning his Majeſty's Houſe in the Fort,</hi> and <hi>Cuffee</hi> for <hi>burning Col.</hi> Philipſe'<hi>s Storehouſe.</hi>

Afterwards Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> proceeded to obſerve on the ſeveral Parts of the Evidence againſt each of the Priſoners; particularly to ſhew, that <hi>Cuffee</hi> was one of the firſt of the Negroes that were ſworn into the Plot to <hi>burn</hi> and <hi>murder;</hi> That he appeared one of the moſt forward and active in promoting it; That Mr. <hi>Philipſe'</hi>s Storehouſe by diverſe Circumſtances appeared to have been wilfully ſet on fire; That the Priſoner declared that he would burn that Storehouſe; That he was ſeen there before the Fire broke out, in a ſuſpicious Appearance, and was preſent at the Time of it; and at the Cry of ſome Perſon, that Negroes were in the Storehouſe, the Priſoner jumped out of a Window, leaped over two Fences and ran away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That he ſeemed exceedingly well pleaſed with the Fire at the Fort; overſet the Buckets that were fill'd with Water, and did what he could to prevent the Extinguiſhing of that Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then inferred from the Facts proved, and Circumſtances attending them, that there appeared <hi>violent Preſumption</hi> of Guilt, which the Law eſteems FULL PROOF.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Quack</hi> he obſerved, that the Witneſſes proved that <hi>Quack</hi> was ſworn into the Conſpiracy, and particularly that he had agreed to burn the Fort; that he repeatedly ſaid he would do it; That the Fire where it broke out could not eaſily be accounted for from any accidental Cauſe; That the Priſoner had confeſſed the Crime both before he was apprehended and ſince he had been in Jail: All which amount to FULL PROOF.</p>
                  <p>The particular Remarks on the Teſtimony of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to the ſeveral Points before mentioned, are here omitted for the Sake of Brevity, and becauſe the Subſtance of the Evidence is before related.</p>
                  <p>Then concluded,</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Thus, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I have diſtinguiſhed the ſeveral Points of the Evidence againſt the Priſoners, and have repeated the Subſtance of what each Witneſs has ſaid to each Point, and ſhall leave it to you to determine whether the Priſoners are guilty or not. I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to lay no more Weight upon any Part of the Evidence, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n it will well bear; and I hope I have not urged any Conſequence which the Fact proved will not fairly warrant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> The Priſoners have been indulged with the ſame Kind of Trial as is due to <hi>Freemen,</hi> though they might have been proceeded againſt in a more ſummary and leſs favourable Way. The Negro Evidence, in the Maner in which it has been produced, is warranted by the Act of Aſſembly that has been read to you: The Law requires no Oath to be adminiſtered to them; and indeed it would ſeem to be a Profanation of it, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter it to a Heathen in the legal Form. You have ſeen that the Court has put them under the moſt ſolemn Caution, that their ſmall Knowledge of Religion can render them capable of.—The Being and Perfections of an ALMIGHTY, ALL KNOWING and JUST GOD, and the Terrors of an eternal World, have been plainly laid before them, and ſtrongly preſſed upon them. Unleſs they were profeſſed Chriſtians, and had taken upon them the Bonds and Obligations of that Religion, <hi>their Word</hi> with the <hi>Cautions</hi> that have been uſed, I ſuppoſe will be thought by you, as ſatisfactory as any Oath that could have been deviſed, But, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the Court has no Power to adminiſter an Oath but in the common Form: And if Pagan Negroes could not be received as Witneſſes againſt each other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>Before I conclude, I can't help obſerving to you, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that by divers Parts of the Evidence, it appears that this horrid <hi>Scene of Iniquity</hi> has been chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and promoted at Meetings of Negroes in great Numbers on <hi>Sundays.</hi> This inſtructive Circumſtance may teach US many Leſſons both of Reproof and Caution; which I only hint at, and ſhall leave the Deduction of the Particulars to every one's Reflection.</p>

                        <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The monſtrous Ingratitude of this black Tribe, is what exceedingly aggravates their Guilt. Their Slavery among us is generally ſoftned with great Indulgence. They live without Care; and are commonly better fed and cloathed, and put to leſs Labour, than the <hi>Poor</hi> of moſt Chriſtian Countries. They are indeed <hi>Slaves,</hi> but under the Protection of the Law: None can hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t them with Impunity. They are really more happy in this Place, than in the Midſt of the continual Plunder, Cruelty and Rapine of their Native Countries: But Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Kindneſs and Tenderneſs with which they have been treated amongſt us; yet this is the ſecond Attempt of the ſame Kind, that this brutiſh and bloody Species of Mankind have made within one Age.<note n="(k)" place="bottom">

                        </note> That Juſtice that was provoked by former Fires and the innocent Blood that was ſpilt in your Streets, ſhould have been a perpetual Terror to the Negroes that ſurvived the Vengeance of that Day, and ſhould have been a Warning

to all that had come after them: But I fear, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that we ſhall never be quite ſafe, 'til that wicked Race are under more Reſtraint, or their Number greatly reduced within this City. But I ſhall not inſiſt further, but refer you, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> to the Direction of the Court; and if the Evidence againſt theſe Priſoners proves ſufficient in your Judgment to convict them, I make no doubt but you will bring in a Verdict accordingly, and do what in you lies to rid this Country of ſome of the vileſt Creatures in it.</p>

                  <p>Then the Jury were charged, and a Conſtable was ſworn to attend them as uſual; and they withdrew; and being ſoon returned, found the Priſoners Guilty of both Indictments.</p>

                     <p>THUS, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> nothing remains to be conſidered of by you, but the Credit of the Witneſſes; againſt which I can ſee no reaſonable Objection: If they are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, then the Priſoners <hi>are Guilty;</hi> and you now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, at this Bar, the Authors, Abettors, and Contrivers of thoſe deſtructive Fires which your Eyes have ſeen: Two of the immediate Agents of thoſe Villanies, have already ſuffered a deſerved Puniſhment, and died con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their Crimes. The Witneſſes declare the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Contriver of thoſe Miſchiefs to be that wicked Man <hi>John Hughſon,</hi> whoſe Crimes have made him blacker than a Negro; the Scandal of his Complexion, and the Diſgrace of human Nature! Whoſe Name will deſcend with Infamy to Poſterity! Who could not be content to live by the Gains of an honeſt Induſtry; but muſt be rich at the Expence of the Blood and Ruin of his fellow Citizens! Miſerable Wretch! How has he plunged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Family into that Pit which he has dug for others, and brought down upon his own Pate that violent Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he contrived, and in Part executed againſt his Neighbours! <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> Though the Crimes charged on the Defendants are ſuch as merit a juſt Indignation; yet in Matters that affect Life, you ought to have the moſt convincing Evidence: The Trial of the Fact is your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. In Matters of Judgment to condemn the Innocent, and acquit the Guilty, is equally Criminal. If you can, after what you have heard, think the Priſoners innocent, you ought to acquit them; but if you find them guilty, you cannot acquit them without the greateſt Injuſtice and Cruelty to your Country and yourſelves. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I ſhall add no more, but leave you to the Direction of the Court and your own Conſciences.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Then the Third Juſtice charged the Jury as followeth.</p>

ſufficiently and properly enlarged upon; nor is it any more neceſſary for the Court to recapitulate the Evidence given in the Caſe; for that has been very clearly ſtated, by the Gentlemen at the Bar.</p>
                     <p>Now,<hi>Gentlemen,</hi> if you cannot credit the ſeveral Witneſſes for the King, if that can be the Caſe, you will then acquit the Priſoners of this Charge againſt them, and find them not Guilty; but on the other Hand, as the Evidence againſt them ſeems to be ſo ample, ſo full, ſo clear, and ſatisfactory, if you have no particular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in your own Breaſts, in your own Conſciencies, to diſcredit them; if that, I ſay, is not the Caſe,; if you have no Reaſon to diſcredit them; then I make no doubt, but you will diſcharge a good Conſcience, and find them Guilty.</p>

                        </gap>ay the Puniſhment is adequate to the horrid Crimes of which you ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed. The <hi>Roman</hi> Common-Wealth was eſtabliſhed ſome hundred Years before any Law was made againſt Parricide; they not thinking any Perſon capable of ſo atrocious a Crime: Yours are indeed as ſingular, and unheard of before; they are ſuch as one would ſcarce believe any Man capable of committing, eſpecially any one who had heard of a God, and of a future State: For People who have been brought up, and always lived in a Chriſtian Country, and alſo called themſelves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to be guilty not only of making Negro Slaves their Equals, but even their Superiors, by waiting upon, keeping with, and entertaining them, with Meat, Drink, and Lodging; and what is much more amazing, to plot, conſpire, conſult, abet and encourage theſe black <hi>Seed of Cain,</hi> to burn this City, and to kill and deſtroy us all.—GOOD GOD! When I reflect on the Diſorders, Confuſion, Deſolation and Havock, which the Effect of your moſt wicked, moſt deteſtable and diabolical Councils might have produced (had not the Hand of our great and good God interpoſed) it ſhocks me! for you, who would have burnt and deſtroyed without Mercy, ought to be ſerved in a like Manner: And although each of you
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:005413_0068_101739F96634B360"/>
have, with an uncommon Aſſurance, denied the Fact, and audaciouſly called upon God as a Witneſs of your Innocence; yet it hath pleaſed him, out of his unboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Goodneſs and Mercy to us, to confound your Devices, and cauſe your malicious and wicked Machinations and Intentions to be laid open and clear before us, not only to the Satisfaction and Conviction of the Court, the Grand and Petty Jury, but likewiſe to every one elſe that has heard the Evidence againſt you; all are ſatisfied the juſt Judgment of God has overtaken you, and that you juſtly merit a more ſevere Death than is intended for you, having, in my Opinion, been much worſe than the Negroes: However, though your Crimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, yet we muſt not act contrary to Law.</p>
                     <p>And now I do moſt earneſtly exhort you, and each of you, to a ſerious and diligent Improvement of the little Time you have yet to live on this Side of Eternity, duly and heartily to weigh and conſider your paſt wicked and ill-ſpent Lives, by bewailing, confeſſing and ſincerely repenting of your Sins; that thereby you may obtain Mercy and Forgiveneſs from our great and juſt God; for without a ſincere, as well as contrite Heart, you can neither expect Mercy or Forgiveneſs for your manifold Offences, both againſt God and your Neighbours.</p>
                     <p>I muſt now ſpeak particularly <hi>to you John Hughſon,</hi> and <hi>to you Sarah Hughſon:</hi> Look upon your poor unhappy Daughter, now ſtanding by you, of whom you have been the miſerable Inſtruments of bringing into the World; after that, to train, and bring her up in the School of the Devil, and now laſtly, to the Gallows.—I ſay, conſider and ſet her a good Example, in a Time when every Moment is precious to you, that the great Deceiver of Mankind, may not have the ſame Power over you all in the next World, as he ſeems to have had in this,</p>
                     <p>I muſt now proceed to the Duty the Law requires of me; which is to tell you,</p>
                     <p>That you, the Priſoners now at the Bar, be removed to the Place from whence you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution, and there you, and each of you, are to be hanged by the Neck 'til you are ſeverally dead; and I pray God of his great Goodneſs, to have Mercy on your Souls.</p>

                     <hi>Ordered,</hi> That the ſaid condemned Priſoners be executed on Friday the Twelfth of <hi>June</hi> Inſtant, between the Hours of Nine and One of the ſame Day; and that the Body of <hi>John Hughſon</hi> be afterwards hung in Chains.</p>

                     <p>IT will appear to you by the Evidence for the King upon this Trial, that theſe four Priſoners at the Bar are ſome of that great Number of Negroes that frequently met at <hi>Hughſon'</hi>s Houſe; where he privately entertained them, and where they confederated with him, and the reſt of the Conſpirators, to carry on this moſt wicked and dreadful Conſpiracy to burn the King's Houſe and this Town, and to murder the Inhabitants.—The moſt horrible and deſtructive Plot that ever was yet known in theſe Northern Parts of <hi>America;</hi> of which <hi>Hughſon</hi> was here the chief Contriver and Director, with great Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of enriching himſelf by the Ruin and Deſtruction of his Neighbours; as has been fully made appear on

                        </gap>ſe Negro Priſoners were ſworn into this direful Conſpiracy, and never to diſcover it, or that <hi>Hughſon</hi> was any way concerned in it.</p>

                     <p>Many of the Conſpirators have already been tried, condemned and executed, for the abominable Parts they have acted in this execrable Conſpiracy: And <hi>Hugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> himſelf, his <hi>Wife, Daughter</hi> and <hi>Margaret Kerry,</hi> are under that Sentence of Death which now awaits their Execution, the juſt Demerits of their heinous Crimes.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>As all the Priſoners at the Bar are Negroes, the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of other Negroes is made ſufficient againſt them by a Law of this Province; which I thought proper to obſerve to you, becauſe we ſhall examine ſeveral Negro Witneſſes to prove what I have alledged againſt theſe Negro Priſoners; and when you have heard their Charge proved againſt them, I can't doubt but you will, for your Oath's Sake, and for your own and this City and Country's Peace and Safety, find the Priſoners Guilty.</p>

                        </hi> and that they agreed to bring all their Booty to him, to enrich him and make him great.—<hi>Thus</hi> were theſe <hi>ſtupid Wretches</hi> ſeduced by the Inſtigation of the Devil, and <hi>Hughſon</hi> his Agent, to undertake ſo ſenſeleſs, as well as wicked an Enterprize; which muſt inevitably end in their own Deſtruction, as now too late they find<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that in the Snares they laid for us, they themſelves are taken.—<hi>Gentlemen,</hi> It cannot be imagined that theſe ſilly unthinking Creatures <hi>(Hughſon's black Guard)</hi> could of themſelves have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And your hypocritical, canting Behaviour upon your Trial, your Proteſtations of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, your Diſſimulation before God and Man, will be no ſmall Article againſt you at the Day of Judgment; for ye have all Souls to be ſaved or to be damned; your Spirits are immortal, that is to ſay, They will live for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to be either eternally happy or eternally miſerable in the other World: And <hi>be not deceived, God will not be mocked;</hi> he will not be baffled withal; he knows all your Thoughts, and ſees all your Actions, and will reward every one according to their Works; thoſe that have done good ſhall go into everlaſting Reſt and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; that is to ſay, into Life eternal; and they that have done evil, and dye hardy and impenient, ſhall be thrown into the infernal Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, together with the Devil and his accurſed Spirits, where the Worm never dyeth; that is, the biting, gnawing Worm of Conſcience will forever be upbraiding you, and the Fire will never be quenched; but in this Torment you muſt remain under the moſt bitter Weeping, Wailing, and Gnaſhing of Teeth, Time without End.</p>
                     <p>If you would not have this your Portion, then let us tell you and admoniſh you, in Compaſſion to your wretched miſerable Souls, immediately to confeſs your Guilt, your horrid Sins, before God and Man, and diſcover your Accomplices, that you may prevent all further Miſchief, which may otherwiſe happen from this your helliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy; ſincerely and heartily bewail your heinous and crying Sins, and entreat Forgiveneſs of God Almighty; for upon theſe Conſiderations only, can you entertain any rational or well grounded Hope of being received into the Arms of his Mercy.</p>
                     <p>And now, What is the End of all theſe your moſt wicked, deteſtable, and horrible Devices? Why, you have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far as to put Part of your accurſed Scheme in Execution; You have burnt down and conſumed the King's Houſe and Buildings in the Fort; the Houſe of <hi>Van Zant,</hi> and have made Attempts to burn ſeveral others, which God Almighty in Mercy and his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and gracious good Providence, has prevented, by ſuffering the Flames to be timely extinguiſhed; the Villanies of theſe diabolical Confederates have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected; many of them have already met with their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, and are gone to their long Homes, whither you are in a few Hours to follow them; for you are now alſo delivered into the Hands of our Laws, and in this World you muſt have Juſtice, and you are left to the Mercy of God in the next.</p>
                     <p>What has already been ſaid, is applicable, moſt of it, to every one of you.</p>
                     <p>And, in as particular a Manner, <hi>Quaſh,</hi> may you be upbraided with the like Reproaches for your Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; for as we have been informed, you have likewiſe had a very indulgent Maſter, who has put great Truſt and Confidence in you; it may be preſumed, from your having better Senſe than the reſt of his Negroes; how vilely then have you abuſed his Indulgence! In return for Kindneſſes, you Wretches, would imbrue your Hands in the Blood of your Maſters, and their Families; you that would deſtroy without Mercy, with what Face can you expect Mercy at the Hands of God, unleſs you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge every one his Guilt, and bewail it with hearty Sorrow, and ſincere Tears of Repentance; and beſeech his Forgiveneſs; laying open the whole wicked Scheme, and diſcovering your ſeveral Confederates and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, all the Parties concerned; ſo that an effectual Stop may be put to all further Miſchief: Upon theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions only can you expect Mercy at the Hands of God Almighty.</p>
                     <p>As to you two <hi>Catoes,</hi> and you <hi>Fortune.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You appear, indeed, to have been inferior Agents; but your Hearts as corrupt and ripe for Miſchief as any of the Reſt; You have all alike taken, <hi>that helliſh, execrable Oath,</hi> and equally bound yourſelves in that villainous Engagement; not only to burn and conſume your Maſter's Subſtance; but to murder and deſtroy their Perſons and Families; you were as willing and ready as the Ableſt of them to act your Parts in this bloody Scheme.</p>
                     <p>It is a very irkſome Taſk to pronounce that Sentence which the Law requires of us; for we delight not in any Man's Blood; but the Law adjudges you unfit to live.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Sentence againſt you, is</p>
                     <p>That you, each and every of you, be carried from hence to the Place from whence you came, from thence to the Place of Execution, where you <hi>Ben,</hi> and you <hi>Quaſh,</hi> are to be each of you chained to a Stake, and burnt to Death.</p>

                  <p>THIS being the Day appointed for the Trial of theſe Priſoners as Slaves upon an Indictment for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, on which they were arraigned on Saturday laſt, they were brought to the Bar in order to proceed thereon: But they complained (as 'tis ſuppoſed, they were adviſed) that they had great Injuſtice done them by being ſold here as Slaves; for that, as they pretended, they were Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in their own Country, and gave in their ſeveral Sir-names.</p>
                  <p>The Indictment was grounded upon an Act of Aſſembly<note n="(i)" place="bottom">4<hi>th</hi> GEO. II. <hi>For the more effectual preventing and puniſhing the Conſpiracy and Inſurrection of Negro and other Slaves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>before mentioned on Trial of</hi> Quack <hi>and</hi> Cuffee, 29<hi>th May.</hi>
                     </note> which enumerated ſeveral Offences; and Conſpiracies amongſt the reſt; and made one Slave Evidence againſt another; ſo that this Fetch might probably be calculated to take off the Negro Evidence: The Priſoners all proteſted they could not ſpeak Engliſh; <hi>and as</hi> Mary Burton <hi>was the only white Evidence againſt them,</hi> and ſhould it be credited that they could ſpeak only in a Tongue which ſhe did not underſtand, how could ſhe tell what paſſed between them in Converſation at <hi>Hughſon'</hi>s? Thus their Adviſers might think they would ſtand the beſt Chance for the Jury to acquit them.</p>
                  <p>The Court deferred their Trial till Wedneſday the 17th Inſtant.</p>
                  <p>Court adjourned 'til To-morrow Morning Ten o'Clock.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>THE Priſoners at the Bar ſtand charged upon two ſeveral Indictments, for conſpiring to burn and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this City, and murder the Inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>The one Indictment is grounded upon an Act of Aſſembly of this Province, ſuppoſing them to be Slaves, by which Act the Teſtimony of one Negro Slave ſhall be legal Evidence againſt another.</p>
                     <p>But it has been made a Queſtion, whether theſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, now before us, are Slaves or not; and the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners themſelves pretend to be free Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> with whom we are now at War, from whom they have been taken, and made Prize, and have been condemned, and adjudged as ſuch in the Court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty here, without any Plea being offered there, or ſo much as any Claim or Pretence of the Priſoners being entitled to any Privilege, as being free Subjects of <hi>Spain;</hi> and ſurely, there never could have been a more proper Time and Seaſon for them to have ſet up ſuch Pretence, as when their Caſe was depending before the Court of Admiralty, where they ſhould have offered it by Way of Plea; eſpecially conſidering, that by their Neglect of that Opportunity, they muſt well know the Conſequence would be their being adjudged as Part of the Goods and Chattels of the Subjects of <hi>Spain,</hi> would be condemned as lawful Prize, and would alſo be ſold as Slaves; but if this Pretence had been offered there, (as it was not) and they could not have proved the Truth of the Plea, it would not have availed them; but they muſt have been adjudged to be Slaves.</p>
                     <p>But they have made that Pretence in this Court; and what has been offered in Support of it? Why, there has been ſeveral Witneſſes that have ſpoke to the Point; and what is the Amount of their Teſtimony? Why, it is no more than the Hearſay of an Hearſay of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who imagined or believed, that they, or moſt of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Negroes taken by Capt. <hi>Luſh</hi> were Freemen; but which of them were, or were not, he could not ſay; nor does it appear, that the Priſoners at the Bar, or any of them, are ſuch of Capt. <hi>Luſh'</hi>s Prize-Priſoners, as that the ſaid <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentleman imagined were Free; for it was no more than his Imagination, as to any of them being ſuch.</p>
                     <p>You have heard the Adjudication and Decree of the Court of Admiralty read, by which it appears, they were condemned as Prize; and that they were ſold as Slaves, has been proved by the Vendue-Maſter; therefore for what appears now before the Court, it ſhould ſeem, that they realy are Slaves: And as nothing appears; no ſufficient or proper Evidence appears to the Contrary; then if you take them upon theſe Conſiderations, to be Slaves; all the Negro Evidence which has been given upon this Trial againſt them, is legal Evidence; and ſo you are to conſider of that Teſtimony, and let it have its full Force; and if you ſhould have ſufficient Reaſons in your own Conſciences to diſcredit them, and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Weight of that Evidence, you can think them, or any of them, not guilty, you will then ſay ſo, and acquit them, or ſuch of them as you think Innocent as to the Charge of this Indictment, upon the Act of Aſſembly.</p>

                     <p>The Priſoners having ſtarted this Pretence, of being free Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in caſe it ſhould have happened upon this Trial, as we think it has not, that there ſhould be ſufficient Evidence to ſhew that the Priſoners were Freemen; if we could take them to be ſuch; is it fit, that Perſons guilty of ſo atrocious and enormous Crimes (let them be free or bond) ſuch execrable Villains ſhould miſs of their deſerved Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and eſcape the Juſtice of the Law? Surely, that would be very unbecoming, that ſuch Wickedneſs ſhould be ſuffered with Impunity in any well regulated Government or Society: Therefore, be they Freemen, or be they Slaves, the main Queſtion before you is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, or any, or which of them are guilty of the Charge againſt them, in the ſecond Indictment, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring with other Slaves and Perſons to burn the Houſe in the Fort, to burn the Town, and murder and deſtroy the People.</p>
                     <p>To prove the Charge in this Indictment, there was the Teſtimony of <hi>Mary Burton;</hi> I muſt obſerve to you, that her Teſtimony, as to the Charge in this Indictment, is ſingle; there is no other Witneſs; but nevertheleſs, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> one Witneſs is ſufficient; and if you give Credit to her Teſtimony, you will, no doubt, diſcharge a good Conſcience, and find them Guilty; If you ſhould have ſufficient Reaſon in your own Minds to diſcredit her Teſtimony, if you can think ſo, you muſt then acquit them: The Priſoners ſeem all to be equally involved, by her Teſtimony, in this unparalelled and helliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, and there is no Room to make any Difference between them; therefore, you will either acquit them all, or find them all Guilty.</p>

THAT <hi>Cuffee,</hi> Philipſe's; was the firſt Man that engaged him in the Conſpiracy; that he went with him to <hi>Hughſon'</hi>s, where he treated him with Punch; that this was about the Beginning of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when the cold Weather was coming in, on a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, and the firſt Time of his being at <hi>Hughſon'</hi>s Houſe; at which Time nothing was ſaid or done re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.</p>

4. That he refuſed to be concerned with them, ſaying, That he durſt not do it; for the White People would play the Devil with them; but <hi>Cuffee</hi> anſwered, that he needed not to fear that, for that he had got <hi>People enough to ſtand by them;</hi> and then he <hi>(Tom)</hi> told them, he would conſider on it; and then they broke up: This being the ſecond Meeting at <hi>Hughſon'</hi>s; at which, neither <hi>Hughſon,</hi> nor any other Perſon was preſent.</p>
                                 <p n="5">5. That about four or five Days after, he met <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the Street, who told him, that if he would go down yonder (meaning to <hi>Hughſon's</hi>) he would come to him; that he went down, and ſoon after <hi>Caeſar</hi> came to him, and called for ſome Punch; that when they had drank, <hi>Caeſar</hi> aſked him, if he would be concerned with them in what they were going to do; that he anſwered, he would not, for he did not like it: <hi>Caeſar</hi> took the Punch, and drank to him again; and when that Tankard was out, he called for another, and drank to him again; and then aſked him, why he refuſed to be concerned with them; telling him, that at their laſt Meeting, he ſaid he would conſider of it; on which he <hi>(Tom)</hi> being heated with Liquor, ſaid, he would join with them; and then <hi>Hughſon</hi> was called on, <hi>who came with a Book, and ſwore him; the Purport of the Oath being to be ſecret, and true to one another.</hi>

                                 <p n="7">7. That ſome Days after he met <hi>Cuffee</hi> in the Street, who aſked him when he would go down again to <hi>Hugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'</hi>s? that he anſwered him, he would go there no more; that he was ſorry for what he had done; for what they were going about was a very great Sin; that <hi>Cuffee</hi> then called him a Fool, and told him, <hi>that if he thought it a wrong Thing, or a Sin, there was a Man that he knew, that could forgive him:</hi> That while they were ſpeaking, <hi>Caeſar</hi> came to them, and then <hi>Cuffee</hi> told him, that he <hi>(Tom)</hi> was going to leave them; on which <hi>Caeſar</hi> curſed him, and ſaid if he did, or ſpoke a Word of what had paſſed among them, he had a Pocket Piſtol, and would be the Death of him; but <hi>Caeſar</hi> as well as <hi>Cuffee</hi> told him, <hi>that if he was in any Pain about what they were going to do, as a Sin, there was</hi> AN OLD MAN <hi>in Town, who they know, that could forgive them.</hi>

                                 <p n="8">8. That ſome time after, <hi>Caeſar</hi> came to him on <hi>Bayard'</hi>s Wharff, and threatned to throw him into the River, if he fell off from them, or informed any body what they were going to do; that he <hi>(Tom)</hi> was afraid, and told him, that he would be true to them; and ſo they parted; and that ever after he ſhunn'd them, and never was at any Time in Company with them, neither at publick or private Meetings.</p>
                                 <p n="9">9. That one Sunday he had a Mind to diſcloſe this Deſign and Conſpiracy to Mr. <hi>Ogilvie,</hi> and went to him for that Purpoſe; that he told him, that he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to tell him, which was a very great Sin, and would ſurprize him; but <hi>Ogilvie</hi> anſwered, that he was going to Church, and bid him come when the Church was out, and he would hear him: That he did not go to Mr. <hi>Ogilvie</hi> after Church was out, nor did he ever after ſay any Thing to him about it.</p>

                                 <p n="3">3. That when he came to <hi>Hughſon'</hi>s, he always went up Stairs in the Company of <hi>Hughſon, his Wife and Daughter, and Peggy,</hi> with whom the Negroes uſed to be at the ſame Time conſulting about the Plot; and that ſhe has often heard Hughſon, <hi>the reſt of the white People, and the Negroes, talk in the Preſence of the ſaid</hi> Jury, <hi>about ſetting fire to the Houſes, and killing the white People of this City;</hi> and has often, when ſuch Converſation was going on, ſeen the ſaid <hi>Jury,</hi> alias <hi>Ury,</hi> whiſpering to <hi>Hughſon, his Wife, &amp;c. and the Negroes,</hi> which ſhe underſtood to be joining in the Conſpiracy with them; ſhe thought it looked very like it; tho' ſhe cannot ſay ſhe ever heard him ſpeak out; but ſaid, ſhe eſteemed his Actions and Behaviour to ſignify his Approbation and Conſent to what was carrying on by the Company, touching this Conſpiracy; and this not one Time in particular, but a great many.</p>
                                 <p n="4">4. That the Conſpirators before mentioned generally went into a Room above Stairs to hold their Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Deponent (being a Servant in the Houſe) uſed often to go into that Room to carry ſuch Things as they wanted; and often came in upon them at ſuch Seaſons, when (as ſhe believes) they would rather have excuſed her Appearance; for ſhe has obſerved, that her coming in has ſometimes made <hi>Jury</hi> uneaſy; that they uſed generally to call up <hi>Mary Hughſon</hi> the Daughter, to bring what they wanted; but when ſhe was out of the Way, the Deponent uſed to go up: She believes

the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> was likewiſe in their Secrets: <hi>Never heard her ſay any Thing of the Plot,</hi> but has heard the reſt talk of it often before her the ſaid <hi>Mary.</hi>

                                 <p n="5">5. That <hi>Hughſon, his Wife, Daughter Sarah, and Peggy, and the ſaid Ury,</hi> when this Deponent has come into the Room amongſt them to bring what they wanted, have ſeveral Times turned out all the Negroes preſent, and then have <hi>all joined in tempting this Deponent to take an Oath;</hi> but upon her aſking them for what? they would not tell her; but ſaid, <hi>ſhe muſt ſwear firſt, and then they would tell her;</hi> but this ſhe abſolutely denied over and over; at which Refuſal they were angry, and turned her out of the Room; and <hi>Ury</hi> ſaid to her, <hi>had not you better ſwear and go fine, than go as ſhe did;</hi> for they <hi>all</hi> (the Hughſons, Peggy <hi>and</hi> Jury, <hi>had when they propoſed to her to ſwear</hi>) offered her Silks, and a deal of fine Things, if ſhe would comply with their Requeſts; and <hi>Peggy</hi> ſaid ſhe was a great Fool if ſhe did not.</p>

                                 <p n="7">7.

                  <p>This Negro, <hi>Adam,</hi> was very willing to lay hold of the Benefit of the Proclamation beforementioned, but would intitle himſelf to it by ſaying as little as poſſible to enlarge the Diſcovery of the Confederates in this <hi>dark Scheme:</hi> He was under Examination ſeveral Hours, ſeveral Days running; the Information that he gave came from him ſlowly and by piece-meals, which was very tireſome; and gave ſo much Trouble, that he was ſeveral Times remanded to Jail, and told that what he ſaid would do him little Service; but as the Conſtable was taking him away, he would beg to ſtay, and ſay he would tell of all he could recollect. While he was under Examination this Day, it was told before <hi>Adam,</hi> that the Chief Juſtice's Negro <hi>Othello</hi> was brought from <hi>Rhode Iſland,</hi> and carrying to Jail, and hearing that, he immediately ſaid, <hi>Othello, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Plot;</hi> as if naturally concluding that ſome Body elſe had impeached him; for till this Accident, he had not mentioned his Name. This <hi>Adam</hi> had a general Acquaintance amongſt the Negroes, and idle Time enough for doing any Miſchief; and 'twas ſuppoſed, that he muſt have known moſt of the Negroes concerned; though he mentioned very few but what we were apprized of before, and had already been either executed or apprehended.</p>
                  <p>It was obſerved by ſeveral in Mr. <hi>Murray's</hi> Family, ſome Time before <hi>Adam's</hi> Commitment, that his Behaviour was ſuch as betokened ſtrong Symptoms of Guilt; he appeared very uneaſy and diſturbed in his Mind; and much more ſo when <hi>Jack</hi> his Fellow-Servant was taken up as one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Conſpiracy; for the next Morning he came ſeveral Times into the Clerk's Office, with a ſeeming Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to diſcloſe ſome Secret; the young Gentlemen at laſt took Notice of it, and ſhutting the Door too, aſked him, Whether he knew any Thing of the Plot? He denied he did; but ſaid, <hi>he was afraid ſome Dog or another would own him a Spite, and bring him in; for that People talked a great Deal of him.</hi>

In the Afternoon, Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> having been preſent and aſſiſting at his Negro <hi>Jack's</hi> Examination, upon his Return home, found <hi>Adam</hi> running backwards and forwards like a diſtracted Creature; he called him into his Study, and charged him as one concerned in the Conſpiracy; which he abſolutely denied, and proteſted his Innocence: His Maſter endeavoured, and uſed many Arguments, to prevail with him to confeſs if he was guilty, but to no Purpoſe; and then he delivered him to the Conſtable.</p>
                  <p>In the Evening two of Mr. <hi>Murray's</hi> Clerks went to ſee <hi>Adam</hi> in the Jail, to try how far they could prevail upon him: and as ſoon as he knew they were come, he deſired Leave to ſpeak with them <hi>Privately;</hi> which being granted, he began with Exclamations, and Proteſtations of his Innocence, declaring <hi>that it was Nothing but damn'd Lies that brought him there; that he knew who was the Author of them, and would be revenged if he died for it.</hi> The young Gentlemen reaſoned with him, telling him if he was innocent to inſiſt upon it, and not be afraid; for he might be aſſured of having Juſtice done him; but if he was guilty, his denying it would ſignify Nothing; for that <hi>they</hi> knew as much of the Plot, as they that were concerned in it; and the only Way to recommend himſelf to Favour, was by making a full Confeſſion: He then conſidered a while; and deſired to know his Accuſer; they told him, they believed it was <hi>Jack;</hi> which aſſoon as he heard, he ſaid, <hi>then I am a dead Man; ſtriking his Head againſt one of the Beams of the Jail;</hi> and ſaid further, <hi>he was afraid the Dog would have ſerved him ſo.</hi> Then he gave the young Gentlemen his Shoe-and Knee-Buckles [being Silver] and ſome other Things, deſiring they might be delivered to his Brother <hi>Caeſar</hi> [another Negro of Mr <hi>Murray'</hi>s.] In this Manner they parly'd with him a full Hour, 'til at length, tired with his Obſtinacy, they concluded to leave him; but he preſſed them to ſtay, ſtill giving them ſome Hopes of his Confeſſion: They told him they had no Occaſion to ſtay to hear him repeat the ſame Things over again: He then aſked them, what they would have him to ſay? Upon which they told him, they would have him <hi>ſpeak ſincerely,</hi> whether he was <hi>guilty or not:</hi> Why then ſaid he, <hi>to ſpeak ſincerely, I am guilty.</hi>

                  <p>Now many Negroes began to ſqueak, in order to lay hold of the Benefit of the Proclamation; ſome who had been apprehended but not indicted; and many who had been indicted and arraigned, who had pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> were diſpoſed to retract their Pleas and plead <hi>Guilty,</hi> and throw themſelves on the Mercy of the Court; ſo that Confeſſions were like to be numerous, and Buſineſs to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply upon our Hands; which made it neceſſary to call in ſome Gentlemen of the Law to our Aſſiſtance upon the Occaſion, who very readily undertook the Taſk.</p>
                  <p>Before the iſſuing of the Proclamation of the 19th Inſtant, <hi>for the Encouragement of the Conſpirators to come in, and make voluntary and free confeſſion and Diſcovery, &amp;c.</hi> there were betwixt Sixty and Seventy Negroes in Jail. who had been already impeached; many of whom after publiſhing the Proclamation, not only confeſſed their own Guilt, in order to entitle themſelves to the Benefit of it, as may appear by the foregoing Examinations; but alſo diſcovered many of their Accomplices who were at large; who were thereupon immediately taken into Cuſtody, by Order of the Judges, or Grand Jury, as the Caſe happen'd before whom ſuch Confeſſions were made; ſo that between the 19th and this Day, there were upwards of Thirty Slaves more added to the former, inſomuch that the Jail began to be ſo thronged, 'twas difficult to find Room for them: and we were apprehenſive, that the Criminals would be daily multiplying on our Hands; nor could we ſee any Likelihood of a Stop to Impeachments; for it ſeemed very probable that moſt of the Negroes in Town were corrupted.</p>
                  <p>The Seaſon began to grow warm, as uſual; and 'twas to be expected that the Heat would be increaſing upon us daily; ſo that the Judges found there was a Neceſſity of bethinking themſelves of taking ſuch ſpeedy Meaſures; as ſhould upon Deliberation be thought moſt adviſeable, for ridding the Jail of ſuch of them as ſhould by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions be thought moſt deſerving of Recommendation to Mercy; for 'twas feared ſuch Numbers of them cloſely confined together, might breed an Infection; and they muſt needs have been very offenſive to the poor Debtors impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned in the City-Hall, which from the Neceſſity of the Caſe could not have been prevented or remedied: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judges aſſociated to them the ſeveral Gentlemen of the Law that were in Town, <hi>viz.</hi> Meſſieurs MURRAY, ALEXANDER, SMITH, CHAMBERS, JAMISON, NICHOLLS and LODGE, in order to conſult about this Matter, and come to ſome Reſolution upon the Emergency.</p>
                  <p>The Reſult of the Meeting was, thoſe Gentlemen unanimouſly agreed to bear their reſpective Shares in the Fatigue of the ſeveral Proſecutions; and ſettled among themſelves the Part each ſhould take: Meſſieurs MURRAY, ALEXANDER, SMITH and CHAMBERS, were to aſſiſt in their Turns, as Council upon the ſeveral Trials, as it ſhould beſt ſuit their reſpective Convenience, and Meſſieurs NICHOLLS and LODGE, to take the Negroes Confeſſions, and abſtract them and the other Evidence into Briefs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The Negroes in general that came to a Confeſſion agreed in the Impeachment of <hi>Hughſon and his Family;</hi> that the Drift of the Plot was <hi>to burn the Town and deſtroy the Inhabitants;</hi> that they were <hi>ſworn</hi> into the Confederacy at <hi>Hughſon'</hi>s, or by <hi>Hughſon,</hi> or ſome Perſon intruſted by him for that Purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>As this was already diſcovered to be the execrable Purpoſe of the Conſpiracy, theſe Gentlemen (conſidering the great Number to be examined) for the Sake of Diſpatch, dropt what was at this Time leaſt material, and only minuted down the Perſons accuſed, the Matter affecting them, where and by whom ſworn, and what elſe came from their Examinant which they judged to be moſt ſignificant; which is the Reaſon that the Examinations and Confeſſions taken by thoſe two Gentlemen are ſo conciſe.</p>

                     <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> That the Court of Admiralty having ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd them to be Slaves, they had been ſeverally ſold and diſpoſed of; by which means they were diſcharged from Confinement in Priſon; and thereby have had the Opportunity of caballing with other wicked, miſchievous and evil diſpoſed Perſons, as well White-Men as Slaves, and have confederated themſelves with them, in a moſt diabolical Conſpiracy, <hi>to lay this City in Aſhes, and to murder and deſtroy all the Inhabitants;</hi> whereas had they appear'd to have been Freemen, they would have been prevented this Opportunity of venting and gratifying the Rancour of their Hearts, by being cloſely confined as Priſoners of War.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> If notwithſtanding they were Free-men, they ought in all Reaſon to have waited the Event of the War, and ſuffer'd patiently under their Misfortune; and when Peace ſhould have been concluded, they might have made the Truth of their Pretenſions appear, and then Juſtice would have been done them.</p>
                     <p>But now, as they are found <hi>Guilty</hi> of this moſt horrid and villainons Conſpiracy, by the Laws of our Land, Nothing remains but to pronounce Sentence of Death againſt them.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Some few Days before this, the Town was amuſed with a Rumour, that <hi>Hughſon</hi> was turned <hi>Negro,</hi> and Vaarck's <hi>Caeſar</hi> a <hi>White;</hi> and when they came to put up <hi>York</hi> in Chains by <hi>Hughſon</hi> (who was hung upon the Gibbet three Weeks before) ſo much of him as was viſible, <hi>viz.</hi> Face, Neck, Hands and Feet, were of a deep ſhining Black, rather blacker than the Negro placed by him, who was one of the darkeſt Hue of his Kind; and the Hair of <hi>Hughſon</hi>'s Beard and Neck (his Head could not be ſeen, for he had a Cap on) was curling like the Wool of a Negro's Beard and Head; and the Features of his Face were of the Symmetry of a Negro Beauty; the Noſe broad and flat, the Noſtrils open and extended, the Mouth wide, Lips full and thick, his Body, (which when living, was tall by the View upwards of ſix Feet, but very meagre) ſwell'd to a Gigantick Size; and as to <hi>Caeſar</hi> (who, tho' executed for a Robbery, was alſo one of the Head Negro Conſpirators, had been hung up in Chains a Month before <hi>Hughſon,</hi> and was alſo of the darkeſt Complexion) his Face was at the ſame Time ſomewhat bleach'd or turned whitiſh; inſomuch that it occaſion'd a Remark, That <hi>Hughſon</hi> and <hi>he</hi> had changed Colours. The Beholders were amazed at theſe Appearances; the Report of them engaged the Attention of many, and drew Numbers of all Ranks, who had Curioſity, to the Gibbets, for ſeveral Days running, in order to be convinced by their own Eyes, of the Reality of Things ſo confidently reported to be, at leaſt, wonderous Phaenomenons; and upon the View they were found to be ſuch as have been deſcribed: Many of the Spectators were ready to reſolve them into Miracles; however, others not ſo haſty, though ſurprized at the Sights, were willing to account for them in a natural Way; ſo that they admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred Matter for much Speculation.</p>
                  <p>The Sun at this Time had great Power, and the Seaſon as uſual very hot, that <hi>Hughſon</hi>'s Body drip'd and diſtill'd very much, as it needs muſt, from the great Fermentation and Abundance of Matter within him, as could not but be ſuppoſed <hi>at that Time,</hi> from the extraordinary Bulk of his Body; tho' conſidering the Force of the Sun, and the natural Meagreneſs of his Crops, one would have been apt to imagine, that long 'ere this, it would have been diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered of all its Juices. At length, about ten Days or a Fortnight after <hi>Hughſon</hi>'s Mate, <hi>York,</hi> was hung by him, <hi>Hughſon</hi>'s Corps unable longer to contain its Load, burſt and diſcharged Pails full<note n="(d)" place="bottom">

                  </p>
                  <p>It has been related already<note n="(h)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Page</hi> 72.</note> that <hi>Hughſon</hi> when he was brought out of Jail to be carried to his Execution, had a red Spot in each Cheek, about the Bigneſs of a Shilling, which at that Time was by ſome thought very remarkable, becauſe he was always pale of Viſage; and the Sheriff (who obſerved it) did not believe, from the Care that had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he could have drank any ſtrong Liquor in Jail; which was an additional Reaſon why they took ſo much Notice of it.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Suppoſition that <hi>Hughſon</hi> had taken Poiſon, it has been made a Queſtion, whether that might not have occaſioned the Swelling of his Corps to ſo amazing a Bulk? Nay his Arms, Legs, and Thighs, were enlarged in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Body; this is ſubmitted to the Conſideration of the Curious and Connoiſſeurs in <hi>Phyſick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Change of Complexions in <hi>Hughſon</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſome imputed it to the Influence of the Sun; but to that it was objected, it would be ſtrange indeed, that the Sun ſhould have two ſuch different Effects as to turn <hi>Hughſon</hi> [a White] black, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> [a Negro] whitiſh.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Hughſon</hi>'s taking Poiſon, that by ſome was thought very improbable; for, as 'tis ſaid, in the Account of his Behaviour at, and going to his Execution, his Actions were obſerved to be ſuch, as betokened his Expectation of being reſcued; he held up his Hand as high as his Pinion would admit of, and ſeemed to beckon with his Finger, as one expecting Deliverance; and if that was his Perſuaſion, he would not have taken Poiſon, which was certain Death; and beſides, if he had taken any, he would have taken a ſufficient Quantity, and Time enough, to have anſwered the Deſign of it, which muſt be ſuppoſed to be, to deſtroy himſelf to prevent his Execution.</p>
                  <p>To this it was anſwered, that though he might be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to take Poiſon to deſtroy himſelf, and did take ſome, yet he might do it with ſo much Reluctance, as not to take the Quantity preſcribed ſufficient to anſwer the End; which tho' he might not be aware of, but expect certain Death from it, yet the nearer he approached the Gallows, the more his Thoughts might be confuſed, and Nature pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; as long as there is Life, there is Hopes, and his Deliverance might be uppermoſt in his Mind; he would willingly have avoided the Infamy of Hanging, and ſtand the Chance of ſaving his Life into the Bargain.</p>
                  <p>Whatever were the Cauſes of theſe Changes, the Facts are here related, that every one may make their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ectures upon them.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Hughſon</hi> it ſeems, let the worſt happen to him in all Events, declared as he was going to mount the Cart which was to carry him to Execution, <q>that he did not doubt but ſome remarkable Sign would happen to him, to ſhew [or ſignify] <hi>his Innocence,</hi>
                     </q> and if his Corps becoming mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous in Size, and his Complexion (for once to uſe a vulgar Similitude) as black as the D—1, can be deemed remarkable Signs or Tokens of <hi>his Innocence!</hi> then ſome may imagine, it has happen'd according to his Expectation.</p>

                  <p>THE Jail being now throng'd with Negroes committed as Confederates in the Conſpiracy, many whereof had made Confeſſions of their Guilt, in Hopes of Pardon in Conſequence of the Proclamation, and others who were pardoned and turned Evidence; it was feared, conſidering the Seaſon of the Year, that ſuch Numbers cloſely confin'd might be apt to breed an Infection; therefore the Judges thought it was proper to examine the Liſt of them, and to to mark out ſuch as ſhould be thought proper to recommend to his Honour the Lieutenant Governor, to be pardoned, upon Condition of Tranſportation to be therein limited by a ſhort Time, and to diſtinguiſh which of them who had been made Uſe of as Witneſſes, might be neceſſary to reſerve for ſome Time; and for this Purpoſe they aſſociated to them Mr. <hi>Nicholls</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lodge,</hi> by whoſe Aſſiſtance the following Liſt was accordingly ſettled, which the Judges reported to his Honour, and ſubmitted to his Conſideration.</p>

                     <p>Then they have their Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, which is ſo big with Abſurdities that 'tis ſhocking to the common Senſe and Reaſon of Mankind; for were that Doctrine true, their Prieſts, by a few Words of their Mouths, can make a God as often as they pleaſe; but then they eat him too; and this they have the Impudence to call honouring and adoring of him.—<hi>Blaſphemous Wretches!</hi> For hereby they endeavour to exalt themſelves above God himſelf, inaſmuch as the Creator muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be greater than his Creature.</p>
                     <p>Theſe and many other juggling Tricks they have in their <hi>Hocus Pocus,</hi> bloody Religion; which have been ſtrip'd of all their wretched Diſguiſe, and fully expoſed in their own Colours by many eminent Divines, but more particularly by the great Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> whoſe extraordinary Endowment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>About the Time, or ſoon after, we had the ſeveral Fires in this City, as related in the Introduction, one <hi>Luke Barrington,</hi> an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> a profeſt Papiſt (who came to live in the County of <hi>Ulſter</hi> ſome ſhort Time before, and ſet up for a School-maſter, and kept School at <hi>Little Britain</hi>) being in Company with <hi>James Mc Claghry, Peter Mullender</hi> and ſeveral others; <hi>Mullender</hi> drank KING GEORGE's Health to <hi>Barrington,</hi> who taking the Baſon of Liquor into his Hand, drank <hi>King Philip</hi>'s, or <hi>Philip of Spain</hi>'s Health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Mc Claghry</hi> thereupon told <hi>Barrington,</hi> it was wrong in him to drink the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Health in that Company, eſpecially as it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> War with <hi>Spain,</hi> and if any would inform againſt him, he might be hanged on that Tree, pointing to a Tree near by; to which <hi>Barrington</hi> replied, he ſcorned to diſſemble for any Body; that <hi>King Philip</hi> was <hi>his King;</hi> and if he would come over with his Army, he would take up Arms for him, and knock all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on the Head: <hi>Barrington</hi> ſtaid a Day and two Nights afterwards in that Neighbourhood, and then left it:
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:005413_0170_10173B46C7F51048"/>
Of this <hi>Mc Claghry</hi> afterwards made Oath before one of his Majeſty's Council for this Province, living near that Neighbourhood, who cauſed diligent Enquiry to be made after <hi>Barrington,</hi> in order to apprehend him; but he was not met with at that Time; though it was ſaid, he was taken up ſome time afterwards, and committed to <hi>Kingſton</hi> Jail, and from thence made eſcape.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems this School-maſter came firſt into thoſe Parts the Fall before; he was a young Man about Five and Twenty; he pretended to be a Miniſter's Son of the <hi>Church of England</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> knew many of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentry, and could give an Account of their Families; he ſaid he left his Father in a Pet; had travelled into <hi>Italy,</hi> and confeſſed to ſome, that he turned Roman Catholick there: And as the Neighbourhood talked much of his being an extraordinary Scholar, and of his underſtanding ſeveral Languages, the Counſellor ſeveral Times ſent him an Invitation to his Houſe; but he never went, nor did that Gentleman ever ſee him.—But it was ſaid, that ſome time after his Arrival there, he chiefly kept Company with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Servants, of which they have many in that Part of the Country, and the greateſt Number of them Roman Catholicks, and they had frequent Meetings together.</p>
                  <p>So that this is a fourth Inſtance of <hi>ſuſpicious Schoolmaſters</hi> infeſting theſe Parts, correſpondent to General <hi>Oglethorpe</hi>'s Letter of Advice: This Man, <hi>Ury</hi> the Prieſt, <hi>Holt</hi> a Dancing-Maſter, and <hi>John Corry</hi> an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> a Dancing-Maſter and profeſt Papiſt.</p>

                     <q>
                        <p>The Way I came to hear of, or know this Mr. <hi>Ury,</hi> was, that laſt Winter ſome time in <hi>February,</hi> I happened to be in Company with a Friend at Mr. <hi>Croker'</hi>s, and Mr. <hi>Webb,</hi> Joiner, called me aſide, and aſked me What School I had; and if I would incline to take a Partner, one very well verſed in the <hi>Engliſh, Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues? I anſwered him, what School I had I could very well manage myſelf; I had no Inclination for a Partner at all: He ſaid he was a good ſober ſort of a Man, and underſtood his Buſineſs very well, and if we could agree, he did not doubt but it would do very well: I anſwered him, I inclined to be Maſter of my own School alone, though it was not ſo large as if I had a Partner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ſeeing I had no Inclination for him, did not tell me who he was.</p>
                        <p>Some time after, about ſeven or eight Weeks, I had a little Buſineſs on board Capt. <hi>Griffiths,</hi> where I met with him and <hi>Web</hi> in Company, which was the firſt time I ever ſpoke to him; then, after our Salutation of each other, he began to aſk me ſome Queſtions concerning my School and Method of teaching; after which we ſtepped in at <hi>Baker'</hi>s, and took a ſerious Glaſs together; at which time he took a ſmall Book out of his Pocket (<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi>) and conſtrued (I think) the 117th Pſalm; then laying the Book on the Table, I took it up, and was going to look on the Title Page; but he directly ſeized it out of my Hands, and told me I muſt not look into it, and put it in his Pocket.</p>
                        <p>Another time at my School, I had ſome Diſcourſe with him concerning Mr. <hi>Whitefield'</hi>s Letter in Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Weſly'</hi>s Sermon on Free-Grace; which Letter he did not approve of at all, and told me, he believed it was <hi>through the great Encouragement the Negroes had received from Mr.</hi> Whitefield, <hi>we had all this Diſturbance; and that he believed Mr.</hi> Whitefield <hi>was more of a</hi> Roman <hi>than any Thing elſe; and he believed he came abroad with no good Deſign.</hi> Then I aſked him what was the Signification of a Non-Juror, as I underſtood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e pretended to be? and he anſwered, thoſe that would not take the Oaths of Allegiance, as he did not: I aſked him Why? Says he, Can you ſwear one to be a Baſtard? <hi>No:</hi> No more can they ſay King <hi>J</hi>—was one; and the Difference between <hi>we Non-Jurors</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> is this; we in the Prayer for the King and Royal Family, <hi>mention no Names,</hi> as they do; I aſked him if they pray'd for the <hi>Pretender?</hi> he ſaid, <hi>for him, let him be who he will, that was the King;</hi> he mentioned no Names.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="166" facs="unknown:005413_0174_10173B556BC15EC8"/>
At another time, ſays he, you talk ſo much againſt Popery, I believe though you ſpeak ſo much againſt it, <hi>you will find you have (or I think will have) a Pope in your Belly;</hi> for, ſays he, the Abſolution of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is not half ſo bad as that of the <hi>Church of England</hi> at the Viſitation of the Sick: But, ſays I, I don't approve of their confeſſing to Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſays I, there is a deal of Wickedneſs and Deceit in it: Says he, No, no; for when any Perſon makes Confeſſions, the Prieſt does not know who they be; for he does not ſo much as ſee them, but only hears and abſolves them: Then, ſays I, I was miſtaken. Oh! ſays he, they ſpeak againſt the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> but don't know them; their Prieſts, ſays he, are the moſt learned of Men; the Articles of the <hi>Church of England</hi> were made in diſtracted Times. And I obſerved ſeveral times he ſaid, <hi>we Prieſts.</hi> Says he, your <hi>Roman Prieſts</hi> will make you believe, and prove by the plain Rules of Grammar, <hi>that black is white, and white black,</hi> and that the Wafer and Wine is the real Body and Blood of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>We were often in Company; but the beſt Part of our Diſcourſe was upon Salvation by Faith alone, which he would not allow, nor Predeſtination; and he told me, he really believed the Moon to be an inhabited Planet, and all the Stars were inhabited; or elſe, ſays he, I would not repeat that Part of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, <hi>Begotten of his Father before all Worlds;</hi> and, ſays he, many Texts of Scripture confirm it to be ſo.</p>
                        <p>I was ſeveral times ſince in his Company, but do not remember any Thing in particular relating to Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the laſt time I had any Thing of Diſcourſe was about two Days before I heard him preach, and then in his Room; I ſeeing the Altar placed in the Corner, I aſked him what Uſe that was for? firſt he ſaid only to lay Books on, or for a Candle to ſit and read by; but I told him I could not think it; for I ſuppoſed it for the Sacrament by its Form and odd Colour; I begged him to let me know what it was; ſo after ſome time he ſeriouſly told me, it was for the Sacrament; and he told me, I think, every Saint's Day it was expoſed, only covered with a Piece of white Linnen; and that he adminiſtered on ſome proper Days; and he told me, they received the Wafer inſtead of Bread, and white inſtead of red Wine: I aſked, why the Wafer? Becauſe, ſays he, the Wafer is more pure; and no Bread he thought pure enough to repreſent the Body of our Lord; then going to his ſmall Box, ſays he, I'll get a Piece and you ſhall taſte it if you will; and he brought me a Piece, and I took and eat it.</p>
                        <p>I think he told me, that ſome time before he had baptized a Child in the Houſe, but they uſed more Ceremonies than we; and he talked as if they anointed and waſhed one another's Feet: He told me further, that at the Time of the Celebration, or at what Time the Sacrament was expoſed, they had lighted Candles burning to repreſent our Saviour as the Light of the World. And when I came in to hear him preach, I accordingly ſaw it as he told me; for he told me before, that if I came on Sunday Evening to hear him, I could ſee it; for the Sacrament was on the Altar covered with a white Linnen Cloth, and there were three Candles burning; but not a Minute after I came in, he put out the Candles, and put his Sacrament in his Box, and locked them up.</p>
                        <p>Some time after I became thus acquainted with him, I was informed he kept a private Meeting, and made Uſe of the Church Form of Prayer every Sunday Evening, at the Houſe of Mr. <hi>John Campbell,</hi> in his own hired Room.</p>
                        <p>My Curioſity led me the next Sunday Evening to go and hear him preach; but when I came there, he told me he did not make a Practice of Preaching to any others, but thoſe of his own Society; and thoſe of his Society did not make any Practice of running to any of our Churches or Meetings; for he did not approve of any ſuch Thing; and as he was a Non Jured Miniſter, ſo he had a Society and Members of his own.</p>
                        <p>Afterwards he told me, he had ſome Company from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> (I think) and deſired to be excuſed; but next Sunday Evening, if I would call, he would be glad to ſee me.</p>
                        <p>The next Sunday Evening I accordingly went, and heard him diſcourſe upon the Second Chapter of the Second Epiſtle of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> the 1<hi>ſt,</hi> 2<hi>d</hi> and 3d Verſes; and before he diſmiſſed us, he told us he would preach the next Wedneſday following (being the Day his Majeſty began his happy Reign) upon the 16th Chapter of <hi>St. Matthew,</hi> the 18<hi>th</hi> and 19<hi>th</hi> Verſes, adjoining to them the Words of Our Lord to his Diſciples, <hi>Whoſe ſoever Sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and whoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I became acquainted with him laſt Fall, and I agreed with him in <hi>December</hi> to teach my Children to write and read; That ſeveral Times in Converſation with him, he talked in ſuch a Manner that I ſuſpected him to be a Popiſh Prieſt He uſed very often to miſs coming to teach my Children at the School time, and made frivolous Excuſes; and at laſt I was very angry with him and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged him: That in the Evenings he us'd very often to pretend that he muſt go to pray by a ſick Perſon <hi>by the Engliſh Church,</hi> that belonged to his Society, or that he muſt go and pray with his Society <hi>by the Engliſh Church:</hi>

                     <p>That the Priſoner is a Romiſh Emiſſary, ſent according to the Intimation in General <hi>Oglethorpe's</hi> Letter, I think muſt be concluded from what has been given in Evidence againſt him; and from the known Principles of the Romiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it may be judged, what Inducement the Priſoner had to undertake ſo wicked and diabolical a Project. The Letter of General <hi>Oglethorpe</hi> has been offered by Way of Inducement, and in aid of other Evidence in general, to ſhew that there was a Plot; and herein I apprehend we are juſtified by the Precedents and Authorities in Law before cited.</p>

                     <p>Before the Priſoner enters upon his Defence, we conceive it will be proper to read to him ſome Paſſages out of ſundry Books, that declare the Cuſtoms and Uſages of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> to which his Practices among us, as declared by the Witneſſes, bear ſome Conformity: And unleſs he can make it appear, that his Practices are warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Uſage of any other Church, we conceive they will convince every Body, that he is a <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and of no other.</p>

                  <p>ON Motion of Mr. Attorney General, the Priſoner was called up to Judgment; and being ſet to the Bar and aſked, Whether he had aught to ſay in Arreſt thereof, why Sentence of Death ſhould not be pronounced againſt him? he had nothing to offer; but requeſted the Favour of the Court, that they would allow him as much Time as they could, before his Execution, for the Settling his private Affairs.</p>

                           <salute>Fellow Chriſtians,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>I AM now going to ſuffer a Death attended with Ignominy and Pain; but it is the Cup that my Heavenly Father has put into my Hand, and I drink it with Pleaſure; it is the Croſs of my dear Redeemer, I bear it with Alacrity; knowing that all that live godly in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> muſt ſuffer Perſecution; and we muſt be made in ſome Degree Partakers of his Sufferings, before we can ſhare in the Glories of his Reſurrection: For he went not up to Glory before he aſcended <hi>Mount Calvary;</hi> did not wear the Crown of Glory before the Crown of Thorns. And I am to appear before an awful and tremendous GOD, a Being of infinite Purity and unerring Juſtice; a God who by no Means will clear the Guilty, that cannot be reconciled either to Sin or Sinners: Now this is the Being at whoſe Bar I am to ſtand; in the Preſence of this God, the Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth, I lift up my Hands, and ſolemnly proteſt, I am innocent of what is laid to my Charge: I appeal to the great God for my Non-knowledge of <hi>Hewſon,</hi> his Wife, or the Creature that was hanged with them; I never ſaw them living, dying or dead; nor never had I any Knowledge or Confederacy with White or Black, as to any Plot: And, upon the Memorials of the Body and Blood of my deareſt Lord, in the Creatures of Bread and Wine, in which I have commemorated the Love of my dying Lord, I proteſt that the Witneſſes are perjured; I never knew the perjured Witneſſes but at my Trial. But for a Removal of all Scruples that may ariſe after my Death, I ſhall give my Thoughts on ſome Points.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> I firmly believe and atteſt, That it is not in the Power of Man to forgive Sin; that it is the Prerogative only of the Great God to diſpenſe Pardon for Sin; and that thoſe who dare pretend to ſuch a Power, do
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:005413_0183_10173B73F8ACFCC8"/>
in ſome Degree commit that great and unpardonable Sin, the Sin againſt the Holy Spirit; becauſe they pretend to that Power which their own Conſciences proclaim to be a Lie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Again,</hi> I ſolemnly atteſt and believe, That a Perſon having committed Crimes that have or might have proved hurtful or deſtructive to the Peace of Society, and does not diſcover the whole Scheme, and all the Perſons concerned with them, cannot obtain Pardon from God: And it is not the taking any Oath or Oaths that ought to hinder him from confeſſing his Guilt, and all that he knows about it; for ſuch Obligations are not only ſinful, but unpardonable, if not broken: Now a Perſon firmly believing this, and knowing that an eternal State of Happineſs or Miſery depends upon the Performance or Non-performance of the above mentioned Things, can not, will not triffle with ſuch important Affairs.</p>
                        <p>I have no more to ſay by Way of clearing my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, knowing that to a true chriſtian unprejudiced Mind, I muſt appear guiltleſs; but however, I am not very ſollicitous about it. I rejoice, and it is now my Comfort (and that will ſupport me and protect me from the Crowd of evil Spirits that I muſt meet with in my Flight to the Region of Bliſs aſſigned me) that my Conſcience ſpeaks Peace to me.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, it may be ſhocking to ſome ſerious Chriſtians, that the holy God ſhould ſuffer Innocency to be ſlain by the Hands of cruel and bloody Perſons (I mean the Witneſſes who ſwore againſt me at my Trial) indeed, there may be Reaſons aſſigned for it, but as they may be liable to Objections, I decline them; and ſhally only ſay, that this is one of the dark Providences of the great God, in his wiſe, juſt and good Government of this lower World.</p>
                        <p>In fine, I depart this Waſte, this howling Wilderneſs, with a Mind ſerene, free from all Malice, with a forgiving Spirit, ſo far as the Goſpel of my dear and only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer obliges and enjoins me to, hoping and praying, that JESUS, who alone is the Giver of Repentance, will convince, conquer and enlighten my Murderers Souls, that they may publickly confeſs their horrid Wickedneſs before God and the World, ſo that their Souls may be ſaved in the Day of the Lord JESUS.</p>
                        <p>And now a Word of Advice to you, Spectators: Behold me launching into Eternity; ſeriouſly, ſolemnly view me, and aſk yourſelves ſeverally, how ſtands the Caſe with me? die I muſt: Am I prepared to meet my Lord, when the Midnight Cry is echoed forth? ſhall I then have the Wedding-Garment on?

                  <q>
                     <p>THAT his Father was Secretary to the South Sea Company, but died when the ſaid <hi>Ury</hi> was young.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>That he was educated at two Univerſities.—But what Univerſities they were he did not care to tell me.</p>
                     <p>That afterwards he became a Non-juring Clergyman; and that the Head of their Society was one Dr. <hi>Clarke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That while in this Character, he was taken up and tried <hi>for writing a Book againſt the Government;</hi> of which he was found guilty: Upon this Account, a Chappal he had of his own, and which brought him in 50 <hi>l. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>UPON the Return of the Veſſels that had tranſported the Negro Conſpirators the laſt Summer, to various foreign Parts, many Particulars of Intelligence concerning the Conſpiracy, which had dropt from thoſe Criminals in their Diſcourſe with the Captains, Paſſengers and others, were brought hither; from which there was Reaſon to apprehend, that this City and People were not yet out of Danger from this Helliſh Confederacy, which had been ſo wickedly and maliciouſly formed againſt both; and conſidering the Hints the Negroes gave concerning <hi>the execrable Oath</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators had engaged themſelves in; it ſeemed probable that the like Attempts would be renewed, notwithſtanding the many Examples that had been made by Executions, and the Number of Slaves ſent out of the Province; for the Conſpirators impiouſly looked upon the <hi>Oath</hi> to be ſo ſacred, that they thought <hi>(as no Doubt they were made to believe)</hi> that the eternal Welfare of their Souls depended upon their ſtrict Obſervance and Execution of it; <hi>for fear</hi> (as the <hi>Cant</hi> was, both of Whites and Blacks) that if they ſhould reveal it, or deſiſt from the Execution of the Engagements they were laid under by it, <hi>they ſhould wrong their own Souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many Cabals of Negroes alſo had been diſcovered in diverſe Parts of the Country, ſince the Execution and Tranſportation of the Conſpirators, which juſtly cauſed Suſpicion, that the ſame villainous Scheme was yet in Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; particularly in <hi>Queen's County,</hi> on <hi>Naſſau,</hi> alias <hi>Long-Iſland;</hi> the Negroes had there formed themſelves into a Company about Chriſtmaſs laſt, by Way of Play or Diverſion (as they would have had it thought) had muſtered and trained with the <hi>borrowed</hi> Arms and Accoutrements of their Maſters, (or we would rather ſuppoſe, <hi>ſurreptitiouſly</hi> obtained) Information whereof having been given to His Honour the Lieutenant Governor, he immediately ordered his Majeſty's Attorney General to write to the Juſtices of that County about it, and to expoſtulate with them upon the Occaſion, and direct them to inflict due Puniſhment on the Offenders.</p>
                  <p>And the Negroes were accordingly chaſtiſed for this daring Piece of Inſolence.</p>
                  <p>There having alſo been Reports about the ſame Time, of ſeveral pretended Prophecies of Negroes, <hi>That</hi> Charles-Town <hi>in</hi> South-Carolina, <hi>and the City of</hi> New-York, <hi>were to be burnt down on the Twenty fifth of</hi> March <hi>next;</hi> theſe Circumſtances conſidered, and added to what had been wrote by General <hi>Oglethorpe,</hi> as before mentioned, <hi>That the declared Enemies had ſecretly conſpired to burn down and deſtroy all his Majeſty's Magazines in North-America;</hi> and conſidering what a Scene of monſtrous Iniquity had been diſcovered the laſt Summer, tending to this deteſtable Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; there ſeemed to be too much Reaſon to ſuſpect, that theſe Sort of Divinations were founded upon a Conſpiracy ſtill ſubſiſting, as well as in Part executed, both here and in <hi>South-Carolina.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lieutenant Governor therefore thought it neceſſary to put the People upon their Guard, by writing circular Letters to the Magiſtrates of every City, Borough and County within this Government.</p>
                  <p>The following Letter was ſent directed to the Mayor, Recorder and Aldermen of this City.</p>

And in order that every one may have Notice hereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I do direct, that you cauſe this Letter to be read from time to time at your General Quarter Seſſions; and that you give in Charge to the Grand Juries, that they make Enquiries concerning the Offenders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I doubt not but you will have Regard hereto, as it ſo highly concerns you all; and that you will take ſuch prudent Meaſures as may prevent any future Diſturbance.</p>

                  <p>THE Juſtices being met a fourth Time, in order to endeavour to pry further into this Myſtery of Iniquity, by examining <hi>Tom</hi> once more; for as to what had been drawn from him hitherto one could not give entire Credit, as the Reader may conclude, excepting as to his being the Inſtrument of putting the Fire; and it being intimated by one of the Magiſtrates, that <hi>Tom'</hi>s Miſtreſs had a <hi>ſtrong</hi> Imagination (one might venture to ſay a <hi>ſtrange</hi> One) that ſhe and her Son, if the Magiſtrates would permit their Attendance, could prevail upon their Negro to ſpeak the whole Truth. As there were many of us, there was Difference in Opinions upon this Matter. However, at length it was ruled, that they ſhould be admitted, and were ſent for accordingly. Upon their Appearance, <hi>Tom</hi> was admoniſhed to tell the whole Truth, how it was concerning this Matter; and he declared himſelf at firſt to the same Purpoſe as to the Negroes he before accuſed, and as to the ſame Matter and Subſtance with his Examinations before ſet forth; but in the Cloſe, as there was great Doubt made of his Veracity, being ſtrenuouſly urged by ſome of the Magiſtrates, and his Maſter and Miſtreſs, <q>to be ſure that he ſpoke nothing but the Truth;</q> and being aſked, whether he was ſure that what he had ſaid as to theſe Negroes was the Truth? he thereupon recanted, and declared what he had before related concerning the Negroes he had accuſed, were all Lies; and took the Whole upon himſelf. And being aſked, why he did it, and how he came to do ſo? he anſwered, <hi>He could not help doing it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Fellow having thus prevaricated, no Uſe could be propoſed to be made of him as an Evidence to convict others, however he might have chanced to change his Note afterwards; and 'twas therefore determined to bring him upon his Trial. But it may be proper to obſerve, that in the Interval between <hi>Tom'</hi>s firſt and laſt Examination, the Negroes accuſed by him, were ſeveral Times cloſely examined, both ſeparately and Face to Face; but they all along poſitively denied every Thing alledged againſt them by <hi>Tom</hi> concerning the ſetting Fire, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> but owned their

being together at <hi>Farmar'</hi>s playing at Pennies; though it could ſcarce be imagined, that <hi>Tom</hi> (who was realy no Fool, nor any of the wiſeſt) had framed this Scheme, and made this Attempt merely on his own Bottom, which ſhould ſo correſpond with the villainous Confederacy of the laſt Year. His Recantation was not taken down in Writing, but what is above ſet forth, contains the Subſtance of it.</p>

                  <p>Before the Articles were read, the Freeholders were ſworn, well and truly to try and judge as directed by the Act of Aſſembly; and the Recorder warned the Priſoner in Favour of Life, that he need not plead <hi>Guilty</hi> to any of the Articles, but nevertheleſs, that his ſeveral Confeſſions being read to the Court, would amount to full Proof, ſo far as they affected himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Then the Articles were read, and were as followeth,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>As the Priſoner had pleaded Guilty to the Second Article, the Court were of Opinion to proceed to Judgment upon that; but Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> moved, that before they proceeded, ſome Witneſſes might be ſworn, and the Criminal's ſeveral Examinations and Confeſſions taken by the Juſtices, as before ſet forth, might be read for their further Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning his Guilt, and for the greater Satisfaction of the Court and Audience.</p>
                  <p>And here it may not be improper to obſerve, that the Priſoner diſtinguiſhed and pleaded to the three ſeveral Articles directly, without Heſitation; which ſeems to be a further Argument that he had more Senſe than ſome People were willing to allow him.</p>
                  <p>Proclamations for Silence and Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>WITNESSES for the KING ſworn, HENDRICKS and HYER.</p>

                     <hi>HENDRICKS</hi> ſaid, <q>he diſcovered the Fire to fall out of the Gutter as he was looking from a Window into the Street; and that thereupon he went and knocked at <hi>Hyer'</hi>s Door, and called him out of Bed, and they ſearched and found Coals on each Side of the Houſe; ſome in the Gutter next the Shed, towards the Church-Yard, and ſome on the Side next <hi>Ratſey'</hi>s Houſe.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>HYER</hi> ſaid, <q>that the Gutter next the Church-Yard was burnt black in the Spot, or Part of the Gutter, where he found the Coals lying.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Criminal's Confeſſions read as before ſet forth.</p>
                  <p>And the Juſtices further informed the Court, that the Criminal at his laſt Examination, though he at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it perſiſted in the ſame Story as to his Accuſation of <hi>Jack (Farmar's)</hi> prompting and propoſing to him to put the Fire, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> and as to the other Negroes preſent at the two Meetings at <hi>Farmar'</hi>s Houſe, adviſing and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him if he did not, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> yet in the Cloſe he declared for Truth, that all he had ſaid relating to them, were Lies, and that he put the Fire of his own Head; and being aſk'd, why he did it, and how he came to do ſo? he anſwered, he could not help doing it. And being aſked by the Court, whether he did not make ſuch Confeſſions as had been then juſt read? he anſwered, <hi>Yes.</hi> He was then bid to tell the ſame Story over again as he had told to the Juſtices at the three firſt Examinations, and likewiſe at the firſt Part of the fourth and laſt; and he repeated the ſame over again, as it were in the ſame Words: And when he had done, being aſked, whether what he had then ſaid as to the other Negroes was true? he anſwered, <hi>No, 'twas all Lies;</hi> and took all again upon himſelf, and owned his Recantation to be the Truth.</p>
                  <p>The Audience being ordered to withdraw, the Priſoner taken from the Bar, and the Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Room cleared; the Recorder adviſed with the Juſtices and Freeholders; and having taken their Opinions, which were unanimous upon that Occaſion, the Doors were ordered to be opened, and the Priſoner brought back; and being accordingly brought back, the Recorder proceeded to Admonition and Sentence, as followeth:</p>

                        </note> within this City. The Evidence of your Guilt has ſtood principally upon your own Confeſſion before your Trial; which you now confirm by your Plea: And indeed this is the ſtrongeſt Proof, the higheſt Conviction that can be: For this ſingle Fact you deſerve Death: And though the Court proceeds to give Judgment againſt you upon this Article; yet your Offence is of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated Nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> conſiſts of many Particulars, all tending to one and the ſame monſtrous and execrable Purpoſe; the Murdering the Inhabitants of this City.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="185" facs="unknown:005413_0193_10173B909190F6A8"/>
The helliſh Scheme you have engaged in, as you have confeſſed before the Magiſtrates over and over again (I think no leſs than four ſeveral Times) was, to ſet <hi>Walter Hyer'</hi>s Houſe on fire, and (as you concluded and propoſed) that would conſequently ſet the next Houſe (<hi>Ratſey'</hi>s) on fire, and that would ſet your Miſtreſs's on fire, and burn your Miſtreſs in it; and then that would burn the whole Town: Then the <hi>Long-Iſland</hi> Negroes were to come over to the Aſſiſtance of the Negroes here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they, in Conjunction, were to murder all the White People of this City: And, in order that your malicious helliſh Purpoſes might effectually take Place, the Fire was to be put, as it actually was, when the Wind blew hard, that in all Probability, any Attempts made to extinguiſh the Flames, might be in vain.</p>
                     <p>And ſuch a truſty Agent have you been in the Devil's Service, that in proſecution of this infernal Conſpiracy, you did actually take the firſt Step propoſed, in order to accompliſh this diabolical Purpoſe, by putting Fire to <hi>Hyer'</hi>s Houſe on both Sides of it.</p>
                     <p>All this that I have ſaid, you have confeſſed over and over again; and in this we muſt take your Word: It was a merciful Act of Providence that your Deſigns were timely prevented, that you were committed upon Suſpicion only, and that thereupon the Truth has thus bolted out from you.</p>
                     <p>It was rumoured without Doors, that you were an half-witted Fellow (Boy I think they called you, though you are ſaid to be Two or Three and Twenty Years old) and indeed one would think hardly any Body but arrant Fools, or Mad-Folks, would engage in ſuch chimerical, wicked, villainous and dangerous Projects, which muſt moſt probably end in the Confuſion, and Deſtruction, of the Wretches concerned; as you found by woful Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the many Examples of thoſe miſerable Creatures of your Colour that expired in Flames, and at the Gallows, the laſt Summer, for the like deteſtable Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And yet ſo hardened and ſtupified are ye in Villainy, that no Examples though ever ſo ſevere, no Terrors of Puniſhment can affright ye; but ye will even defie the Gallows and commit your Bodies to the Flames, rather than not riſque the Chance of gratifying, your ſavage, cruel, and inſatiable Thirſt for Blood.</p>
                     <p>But nevertheleſs, to convince one that you are not that half-witted Fellow, as ſome would repreſent you, you ſhewed ſome Cunning (as it ſhould ſeem you thought) after your Commitment, in providing for your own Safety and Preſervation, by laying this Scheme upon and accuſing others, as having prompted you to this Miſchief, hoping thereby, as it muſt be ſuppoſed, to be admitted an Evidence againſt them, and ſo ſave your own Life: This was a Thought too deep for a Fool, or half-witted Fellow: And indeed from my Obſervation of you, during the Courſe of your ſeveral Examinations, I could diſcover no Reaſon for an Inſinuation, that you had leſs Senſe than thoſe of the common Rank of Negroes, but that your Qualifications for Miſchief are inferior to none of them; That you have Senſe enough to diſtinguiſh between Good and Evil; that your own Conſcience could direct you what was fit and proper to be done, and what not; you yourſelf, by your own Confeſſions have given moſt convincing Proofs; for when (as you all along ſaid, till the laſt Time when you recanted and declared that what you had told concerning the other Negroes was all Lies, I ſay, as you told the Story) <hi>Jack (Farmar's)</hi> in order to try whether you were fit for the Undertaking, ſaid to you, <hi>Tom your Miſtreſs is croſs to you, you muſt ſet fire to the Offdackye, then that will burn</hi> Hyer'<hi>s Houſe, that will burn</hi> Ratſey'<hi>s Houſe, then that will burn your Miſtreſs's Houſe, and burn your Miſtreſs in it:</hi> Your Anſwer to <hi>Jack</hi> upon this Propoſal was, <hi>No, my Miſtreſs no croſs to me, my Miſtreſs good enough, what ſhould I ſet Fire for? you may do it yourſelf;</hi> or Words to that Effect: That thereupon <hi>Jack</hi> inſiſted, that you ſhould ſet fire, and the Reaſon why you at laſt agreed to do it, was becauſe, you ſaid, <hi>Jack threatned he would poiſon you if you did not.</hi> This is what we call natural Reaſon, and ſhews ſuch a Meaſure of it, or there is ſuch a Chain of Conſequences drawn by it, that ſuppoſing it to be your own Scheme (as you now take all upon your ſelf) you can be no Fool, or half-witted Fellow; and if it was the Scheme of others propoſed to yourſelf, your very Repetition of it, your telling that Story as you have done ſo often over and over again, almoſt in the ſame Words, ſhews that you don't want Underſtanding; but that you have made a very bad Uſe of it, and acted againſt that Light, which God Almighty has given you to employ to better Purpoſes: So that here, I ſay, in theſe Inſtances of the very Propoſal and Anſwer, you give convincing Proof, that you were conſcious, <hi>i.e.</hi> that you yourſelf was ſenſible and knew, that what you was going to attempt was wrong, was wicked, and what you ought not to do: Whether <hi>Jack (Farmar's)</hi> was the Perſon that propoſed the Thing to you, we cannot tell; but that ſomebody did, and that you did not do it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of your own Head, I am fully perſuaded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if no one but the Devil and you contrived it; then ſo much muſt be drawn from it, as is ſufficient to ſhew, that you acted againſt the Light of your own Conſcience, your own Reaſon, by your own Way of arguing, and <hi>out of your own Mouth you are judged.</hi> How you came at laſt to withdraw your Accuſation againſt thoſe Negroes, you

               <head>THE CONCLUSION:</head>
               <p>BY the Courſe of the Evidence, it appears. That a Deſign was conceived to deſtroy this City by Fire, and maſſacre the Inhabitants: That Fire was to be put to ſeveral Quarters of the Town, at one and the ſame Time: That the <hi>Engliſh Church</hi> was to be ſet on Fire, at a Time when 'twas moſt likely there would be the fulleſt Congregation, and the Avenues from the Church were to be guarded by theſe Ruffians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in order to butcher thoſe that ſhould attempt to eſcape the Flames: This Part of the Scheme, it ſeems, <hi>Ury</hi> the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> had particularly at Heart.—The Winds were conſulted which would be moſt proper to attempt the Fires with: They were to begin at the Eaſt End of the Town with a ſtrong Eaſterly Wind, which (as it was projected) according to the Courſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

But the Fire at the <hi>Fort</hi> happening in the Day, contrary to the Purpoſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, and the Town having been much alarmed at the Misfortune, tho' not apprehending the Treachery; yet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

From hence they took Courage again, and it was reſolved amongſt them, that they ſhould proceed. Accordingly after one Week had paſſed, they did, we ſee, ſet Fire to ſeveral Houſes within the Compaſs of a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, ſometimes many in a Day, undiſcovered; and made ſeveral other Attempts in which they were fruſtrated, 'till at length ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prize Negroes having been ſeized and committed upon Suſpicion, a Stop was put to their Career.

By the Evidence of this Girl, it appears, that her Maſter <hi>Hughſon</hi> was a Principal, Engine, Agent and Inſtigator of theſe Deeds of Darkneſs amongſt the Slaves here, ever ſince ſhe came into his Service; and by the Evidence of others, Whites and Blacks, it alſo appears, that he having kept a publick Houſe for ſome Years, had long ſince made it a Practice to entertain Numbers of Negroes, often 20, 30, 40 or 50 at a Time, and by Degrees deluded them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the Conſpiracy, upon his Promiſes, that they ſhould all be Freemen, and that other fine Things ſhould be done for them; that upon their conſenting, <hi>Hughſon</hi> always bound them to their Engagements by <hi>horrible Oaths,</hi> not only to perform what they undertook to do, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>burn and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre,</hi> but alſo to keep <hi>all ſecret,</hi> though they were to die for it; that theſe Oaths were reiterated at all future Meetings in order to confirm them; and for their Encouragement, <hi>Hughſon</hi> often ſwore himſelf over again, and had ſworn his Wife and Daughter into the Confederacy alſo That <hi>Hughſon</hi> provided Arms and Gunpowder, further to convince theſe deluded Wretches, how much he was in earneſt; but the Butchery to be executed by the Negroes after they had ſet Fire to their Maſters Houſes, was calculated to be done with Knives; for thoſe Weapons, it ſeems they judged, would make no Noiſe: This the whole Current of Negro Evidence agrees in, and 'tis corroborated by Whites.—That a Knife deſigned for this Purpoſe was actually found in the Cheſt of one of the Negro Conſpirators, and moſt others of them were provided with Knives.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Hughſon</hi> employed ſome of the Head Negroes as Agents under him, to decoy other Negroes, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions were not to open the Conſpiracy to any but <hi>thoſe</hi> that were of their <hi>own</hi> Country (as they are brought from different Parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and might be ſuppos'd beſt to know the Temper and Diſpoſition of each other) and when they brought a Convert to <hi>Hughſon,</hi> or one likely to become ſuch, <hi>Hughſon</hi> always gave them Drams 'til they were intoxicated, and then the Conſpiracy was propoſed to them; and they generally conſented without much Difficulty, upon his ſpecious Promiſes, and ſometimes upon the bare Propoſal; but if they were unwilling to engage, they were terrified by Threats of being murdered, 'til they complied<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There are Allowances to be made, with regard to the ſpecial Circumſtances this Girl was under in this Caſe, and ſome Paſſions and Qualities which ſeemed natural to her: She came over young into this Country, an indented Servant, a Year or two before: Her firſt Maſter, after ſome Service, aſſigned over her Indenture to <hi>John Hughſon</hi> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of her Term, the Midſummer before this Iniquity broke out, when ſhe was between fifteen and ſixteen Years of Age: The Girl thus becoming under the Power of <hi>Hughſon,</hi> a Stranger in the Country, and not a Friend to adviſe with; her Situation was ſurely ſomewhat deplorable; for being in the Hands, and under the Influence of ſo hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Family, and held to Secreſy by her Apprehenſions of the Danger ſhe was beſet with, from theſe Aſſaſſins, ſhe might think her Condition helpleſs, and that ſhe could only wiſh for Deliverance: She was of a warm haſty Spirit, had a remarkable Glibneſs of Tongue, and uttered more Words than People of her ſuppoſed Education uſually do; ſuch a Temper, one might think, could ill brook the Ceremony of attending and ſerving upon Slaves, and ſuch a Band of <hi>black and white Ruffians;</hi> which, it ſeems, was the Service enjoined her; neither could <hi>they</hi> think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſafe with her, unleſs they could ſeduce her to their wicked Purpoſes, which they might have Hopes they ſhould compaſs at laſt; and tho' at firſt they might think ſhe was not to be truſted at all Adventures; yet it ſo happened, that by Degrees, it ſeems, the Conſpirators (as depending upon a Maſter's Influence over one in her Circumſtances, added to the Terrors of their Threatnings to murder her if ſhe made Diſcovery) flattered themſelves they had her ſure, and at length became ſo familiarized and unreſerved towards her, that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But it ſo happened, That for ſome Time before this Grand Jury was diſcharged, there aroſe great Clamour againſt <hi>Mary Burton;</hi> for ſo many Negroes being daily taken into Cuſtody (though not ſolely through her Evidence, but rather principally upon Diſcovery made by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of their <hi>black</hi> Aſſociates already in Cuſtody, and their Teſtimony corroborated with hers) ſome People began to be afraid of loſing their Slaves; for, as Matters were then like to turn out, there was no gueſſing where or when there would be an End of Impeachments; every one had Reaſon to fear their own Negro would be ſent for next; and indeed, all Things duly conſidered, it was moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, there were but few of them that were not in the Secret; and the Girl had declared, that there were many Negroes concerned, whoſe Perſons ſhe could or might probably remember, but many whoſe Names ſhe knew not; ſo that it ſhould ſeem, at length ſome Maſters of theſe Slaves, as well as the Conſpirators, endeavoured to bring the Witneſſes, and the Notion of a Plot, into Diſcredit, if perchance it might put a Stop, not only to further Proſecution, but further Enquiry and Diſcovery alſo: And theſe Attempts, luckily for ſome, had ſuch an Effect, that ſeveral Whites, as well as Negroes, eſcaped Juſtice, who, had the ſame Evidence appeared againſt them a few Weeks before, would ſcarce have been thought Objects of Mercy; nor, from what we may have obſerved, would <hi>Mary Burton'</hi>s Evidence have ſtood ſingle againſt them.</p>
               <p>However, when the firſt Grand Jury drew near their Diſcharge, they were importunate with <hi>Burton,</hi> to diſcover all the Perſons ſhe knew to be engaged in this villainous Deſign; for about this Time ſhe had ſuggeſted to ſome, that there were White People of more than ordinary Rank above the Vulgar, that were concerned, whom if ſhe told of, they would not believe her: This having been inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to the Grand Jury, they were very preſſing with her to diſcover all ſhe knew, whoever they were; but the Girl ſtood mute; nor could the Grand Jury prevail with her to name any, not with Threatnings of Impriſonment; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhe had before done to the Grand Jury) that ſhe had been very ill uſed; that not only her Life had been threatned by Conſpirators of both Complexions, if ſhe made Diſcovery, but ſhe had alſo been frequently inſulted, and abuſed by People of the Town, for bringing their Negroes in queſtion, and that People did not believe what ſhe ſaid, and what ſignified ſpeaking? or to this Purpoſe ſhe expreſſed herſelf; ſhe intimated withal, that there were ſome People <hi>in Ruffles</hi> (a Phraſe as was underſtood to mean Perſons of better Faſhion than ordinary) that were concerned, but ſeemed very unwilling to name any Names; 'til for the laſt Experiment, ſhe was told, ſhe muſt expect to be impriſoned in the Dungeon, if ſhe continued obſtinate; ſhe then began to open, and named ſeveral Perſons which ſhe ſaid ſhe had ſeen at <hi>Hughſon'</hi>s amongſt the Conſpirators, talking of the Conſpiracy, who were engaged in it; amongſt whom ſhe mentioned ſeveral of known Credit, Fortunes, and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and of Religious Principles ſuperior to a Suſpicion of being concerned in ſuch deteſtable Practices; at which the Judges were very much aſtoniſhed; others again were imperfectly deſcribed by her, whoſe reputed Religious Profeſſion might ſquare with ſuch wicked Deſigns, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom the Girl had long before given broad Hints, but ſaid ſhe did not know their Names, or what Part of the City they lived in; but it came out at laſt, that one of them was a Doctor (a profeſs'd <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as common Fame had it) whom ſhe had ſeen ſeveral Times afterwards in the Streets, and who upon Sight of her, always turned another Way, to avoid meeting her: However it was, this Perſon had the Diſcretion to remove himſelf out of this Province ſoon after; and 'tis ſaid, into foreign Dominions; and it were much to be wiſhed, that ſuch others, as were juſtly liable to Impeachment, would act with the ſame Prudence, and follow his Example, for the Sake of their own Safety, as well as the Peace and Security of our ſelves. But upon the Whole, there was Reaſon to conclude, that this Girl had at length been tampered withal; might it not be ſuggeſted to her, that the Reward offered by Proclamation for the Diſcovery, ſhe was already ſure of; for ſhe was intitled to it; and might ſhe not be tempted to make further Advantage of the Affair? Upon this Suppoſition, the Conſpirators could not have deviſed a more effectual Means (if they could but prevail with her) to put a Stop to further Enquiry, to procure the Names of Perſons to be called in queſtion at laſt, concerning this Scene of Villainy, whoſe Fortunes and Characters ſet them above Suſpicion: They

very well knew (for <hi>Papiſts</hi> or <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as <hi>Ury</hi> intimated, are "<hi>too wiſe and too cunning</hi>") if they could but prevail in this, they would thereby not only put a Stop to further Diſcovery, but likewiſe have ſome Pretence, according to their uſual Cuſtom, to clamour loudly, <hi>there was no Plot at all; 'twas a mere Dream!</hi> And to ſerve this Turn, they had luckily with them ſome Owners of Slaves, who hapened to humour this Artifice, though upon a different View.</p>
               <p>'Twas fit this Matter ſhould be ſtated in its proper Light; that on the one Hand the Evidence of this Witneſs (but for whom next under the Interpoſition of Divine Providence, this City would in all Probability have been laid waſte in Aſhes, and many Families maſſacred) might have its due Weight, ſo far as deſerving of Credit; and on the other Hand, that where ſhe may be juſtly ſuſpected to have exceeded the Bounds of Truth, there a Stop may be made, to conſider, and conjecture, how it might have come to paſs, that ſhe told ſome Things incredible at the Winding up of this Affair; and weigh impartially alſo, the whole Current of the other Evidence, remarking how it appears to confirm and eſtabliſh her Teſtimony, ſo far as it has been judged proper and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               <p>The other White People executed, as well as <hi>Ury,</hi> like true <hi>modern Romaniſts,</hi> pretended to maintain (and did proteſt) their Innocence to their laſt Breath; though <hi>Hughſon</hi> himſelf, ſoon after his Conviction, ſeemed to betray ſtrong Symptoms of his Inclination to confeſs his Guilt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make Diſcovery; but if he was in earneſt to have done ſo, in Hopes of ſaving his own Life, his Mind was ſoon changed (as 'twas conjectured) by the Perſuaſion of his Wife; yet <hi>Kerry</hi> left ſuch Proofs behind her of many of the Particulars of this Conſpiracy, and of her own Guilt, as add great Force to the aforegoing Accounts of it; and her rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               <p>That a Plot there was, and as to the Parties and bloody Purpoſe of it, we preſume there can ſcarce be a Doubt amongſt us at this Time; the Ruins of his Majeſty's Houſe in the Fort, are the daily Evidence and Memento of it, ſtill before our Eyes: If the other Frights and Terrors this City was alarmed with, to their great Conſternation, are, as to ſome amongſt us, ſo ſoon ſlipt into Oblivion, yet ſurely others will think we ought once a Year at leaſt, to pay our Tribute of Praiſe and Thankſgiving to the Divine BEING, that through his merciful Providence and infinite Goodneſs, cauſed this inhumane horrible Enterprize to be detected, and ſo many of the wicked Inſtruments of it to be brought to Juſtice, whereby a Check has been put to the execrable Malice, and bloody Purpoſes of our Foreign and Domeſtick Enemies, though we have not been able entirely to unravel the Myſtery of this Iniquity; for 'twas a dark Deſign, and the Veil is in ſome Meaſure ſtill upon it!</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That on the Tueſday or Wedneſday Evening (to the beſt of her Remembrance) after the Deponent's Huſband <hi>James Kannady,</hi> and ſeveral other City Officers had been ſeveral Times in ſearch at <hi>John Hughſon'</hi>s, after the Goods ſtolen from Mr. <hi>Hogg'</hi>s Shop; <hi>Mary Burton,</hi> then Servant to <hi>Hughſon,</hi> came to the Deponent's Houſe to buy a Pound of Candles for her Maſter; and it being a very cold Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Deponent aſked her to come in and warm herſelf, which ſhe did; and thereupon the Deponent took upon her to aſk her ſeveral Queſtions: Firſt of all ſhe aſked her her own Name, which ſhe told her as above; for the Deponent did not know it, though ſhe had been ſeveral Times at her Houſe upon the like Errands, and ſhe knew that ſhe lived at <hi>Hughſon'</hi>s: Then the Deponent aſked her, whether that was a black Child or a white Child which that <hi>Iriſh Beauty</hi> had, which lodged at their Houſe? and ſhe made anſwer, that it was as white as any of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or any other Child. The Deponent then told her, that ſhe heard that there was a Negro who kept Company with her and was the Father of that Child; the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> anſwered, there was a Negro came thither to her, but he was not the Father of that Child, ſhe believed: Then the Deponent took upon her to give the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> good Advice; ſhe told her, ſhe would give her her Bleſſing as a Mother would a Child, as ſhe was a Stranger in the Country; the Deponent adviſed her to have no Dealings with Negroes, and to have no Hand in Thievery, for that would be a Means of bringing her to the Gallows.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Deponent then aſked her, if ſhe knew any Thing of the Thievery of <hi>Hogg'</hi>s Goods? and ſhe ſeveral Times denied that ſhe knew any Thing about the Matter. The Deponent then aſked her, if ſhe had a Mind to be freed from <hi>Hughſon?</hi> if ſhe had, and would diſcover the Goods, the Deponent would free her, and ſhe ſhould come and live with her; then the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> anſwered, that her Huſband (meaning the Deponent's, who had been at <hi>Hugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'</hi>s upon Search, as aforeſaid) was not <hi>cute enough:</hi> Then the Deponent ſaid, tell me where the Goods are, and I will take you away from him to Night; ſhe anſwered, that ſhe would not tell her any Thing to Night, ſhe would tell her To-morrow; but that the Deponent's Huſband had trod upon them. Then the Deponent let the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> return home.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That after this Converſation was over, the Deponent the ſame Evening went to Mr. <hi>Mills,</hi> the Under-Sheriff, and told him what had paſſed as above; whereupon the ſaid <hi>Mills, Mr. Hogg and his Wife,</hi> and ſeveral Conſtables, with the Deponent's Huſband and herſelf, went down to <hi>Hughſon'</hi>s Houſe; and the Deponent deſired <hi>Mills</hi> to go into the Houſe firſt, and bring <hi>Mary Burton</hi> out to her; but <hi>Mills</hi> ſtaying a long Time, the Deponent went into the Houſe to him, and found him and his Wife and <hi>Mary Burton</hi> in the Parlour; and there ſhe denied all that ſhe had ſaid to the Deponent as above: Then the Deponent charged her home with it, 'til at laſt the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid, ſhe could not tell them any Thing there, <hi>ſhe was afraid of her Life, that they would kill her:</hi> Whereupon they took her out of the Houſe; and when they had got a little Way from thence, ſhe put her Hand in her Pocket, and pulled out a Piece of Silver Money, which ſhe ſaid was Part of <hi>Hogg'</hi>s Money which the Negro had given her; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they all went with her to <hi>Alderman Banker'</hi>s; and the Deponent informing him what ſhe had promiſed the ſaid <hi>Mary, that is to ſay,</hi> to get her freed from her Maſter; the <hi>Alderman</hi> directed that ſhe ſhould that Night lodge with the Under-Sheriff at the City-Hall for Safety; and the Deponent wen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

That this Examinant was out upon the Common at the Execution of <hi>Quack</hi> and <hi>Cuffee,</hi> where ſhe met the ſaid. <hi>Mary Burton,</hi> and the Examinant ſaid to her, ſhe wondered how ſhe had Courage enough to be there; ſhe anſwered, that ſhe knew they had deſerved it, <hi>and that if half the Negroes in Town were executed, ſhe believed they had deſerved it;</hi> that ſhe knew a great many of them by Sight, but did not know their Names, nor who they belonged to.</p>
                  <p n="20">20.

                  <p n="21">21. That when ſeveral Fires had thus happened, the Examinant was then convinced of the Truth of what the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> had often before related to her; and the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant's Huſband reſolved to inform, and did inform a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of what <hi>Mary</hi> had told the Examinant, or of the Subſtance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
