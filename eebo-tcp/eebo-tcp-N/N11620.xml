            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is now about a year ſince the following Letter was ſent to the late <hi>Eſſex</hi> Printers—hoſtilities commencing ſoon after, by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> troops againſt the <hi>Americans,</hi> opened ſuch a ſcene of buſineſs, &amp;c. as hitherto to prevent it's publication.</p>
            <p>The Author, though he looks upon the followers of the <hi>Stranger,</hi> herein referred to, to be under a ſad and ſorrowful deluſion, yet has a benevolent affection to them, and his daily prayer to God for them is, that they may be undeceived in time and made wiſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternal ſalvation; and earneſtly prays them to read the following Letter with unprejudiced attention and an honeſt deſire to know the Truth: "It is no more their intereſt than the Author's to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived." Nay, if the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation, or of the final happineſs of all men is true, we run no hazard in denying it to be true; we ſhall as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſaved and finally happy, as thoſe will who avouch it, and enter heaven at death without going through purgatory or their <hi>intermediate ſtate,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we are <hi>waſhed and ſanctified and juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we die; which the advocates for univerſal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation muſt allow we may—without believing their doctrine of univerſal ſalvation to be true; otherwiſe deny there are, or ever were any true Chriſtians— any born of God in this life, but thoſe that believe
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:014684_0003_0F948D2AC1AC6010"/>
               <hi>that doctrine</hi>; which will not only deny all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches of the preſent and paſt genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but alſo all the Chriſtian Martyrs, &amp;c. to be true Chriſtians, ſanctified in Chriſt, and called to be ſaints.—But what if this doctrine is not true? What if you have been given up to a ſtrong deluſion to believe a lie? Where will the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner—Where will the unbeliever, the impenitent, the profane, the ungodly apppear? Will it be your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in this caſe to be deceived? If your doctrine of the final happineſs of all mankind is true, the Bible is not true! Let common ſenſe ſpeak, yea let Deiſts and Infidels ſay, whether they do not with one conſent acknowledge that the Bible teaches in an open and expreſs manner, that the unbeliever, the ungodly and impenitent, dying ſuch, ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with an everlaſting deſtruction? Pray conſider death is coming on us all, and the deceived will then be undeceived:—But what comfort will it be to find ourſelves in hell with <hi>a lye in out right hand</hi> and <hi>a great gulf fixed?</hi>—O my dear fellow-probationers, let us conſider our latter end—let us be wiſe for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity—let us repent and be converted while the long-ſuffering of God is waiting, and the door of ſalvation is open before us.—Let us fear God and keep his commandments, and be holy as God is holy in all manner of converſation and godlineſs, for without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord, but true holineſs conſiſts in real, hearty, practical conformity to our Lord's will in his word.</p>

               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BY a benevolent affection to you and others you now aſſociate yourſelf with to attend the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations of the <hi>Stranger</hi> lately come into your Town, and from a ſerious concern for the cauſe of Chriſt and glory of God, I am moved to write a few things, which, I pray you and others concerned to take under proper conſideration, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That all men are naturally in a ſinful, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and periſhing ſtate.—Sinful, <hi>for there is none that doth good, no not one—ſo then they that are in the fleſh</hi> (as oppoſed to a being in the ſpirit) <hi>cannot pleaſe</hi> God.—<hi>Servants of ſin—under the power of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, who worketh in the hearts of the children of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</hi>—Condemned and periſhing, <hi>for he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not, is condemned already—by the offence of one, judgment is come upon all men unto condemnation—under the curſe—guilty before</hi> God, and the <hi>wrath of</hi> God <hi>abideth on them,</hi> which is <hi>revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. That it is abſolutely neceſſary that we be born of the Spirit—have repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>— Born of the Spirit, <hi>for except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God; he cannot enter the kingdom of God</hi>; Chriſt ſays, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014684_0005_0F948D2D75C20238"/>
not, that I ſaid unto you, ye muſt be born again. The unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God</hi>; he muſt <hi>be waſhed and ſanctified.—Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord</hi> with comfort; hence we muſt <hi>be renewed in the ſpirit of our mind.</hi>—We muſt <hi>be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated after God in righteouſneſs and true holineſs.</hi>—None will receive Chriſt, or <hi>believe on his name,</hi> but ſuch as <hi>are born of God.—The natural man diſcerneth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither</hi> CAN <hi>he know them, becauſe they are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually diſcerned.—No man</hi> CAN <hi>come to Chriſt, except the Father draw him.</hi>—None will or can love God or man with ſuch a love as God requires in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, without being born <hi>of God; he that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.</hi>—True ſaints are <hi>God's workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works.</hi>—Such as are paſſed from death unto life love the brethren—love them, <hi>not in word</hi> or <hi>in tongue, but in deed</hi> and <hi>in truth</hi>:—And <hi>this is love, that we keep God's commandments</hi> and <hi>Chriſt's ſayings.</hi> They do their Lord's will. They do not live in the practice of what they know their Lord forbids, nor in the neglect of what they know he commands. We muſt have repentance toward God and faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Chriſt our Lord and Saviour; for <hi>except ſinners repent they muſt periſh—they muſt repent and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted that their ſins</hi> MAY <hi>be blotted out.—God now commands all men every where</hi> (where the goſpel comes) <hi>to repent.</hi>—Such as are not moved to repentance by the <hi>goodneſs, long-ſuffering, and forbearance of God,</hi> are, <hi>after their hardneſs</hi> and <hi>the impenitency of their hearts, treaſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</hi>—Wo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> that repented not! <hi>It ſhall
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014684_0006_0F948D30EB393F20"/>
be more tolerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the day of judgment than for them</hi>;—they that repent not, are the children of their <hi>father the devil, and the luſts of their father they will do.</hi>—They are the <hi>enemies</hi> of God and Chriſt, they will not be reconciled to God, nor <hi>have Chriſt to reign over them.</hi>—Impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, dying ſuch, muſt be damned; <hi>conſider this,</hi> ſays God, <hi>ye that forget God,</hi> leſt <hi>I tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver: It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, who has ſaid, Vengeance is mine, I will repay it—and will by no means clear the guilty.—If the ſinner turn not, God will whet his ſword, he hath bent his bow and made it ready,</hi> and yet calls to ſinners ſaying, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die?</hi>— We muſt turn to God with <hi>weeping</hi> and <hi>mourning,</hi> with <hi>a broken heart</hi> and <hi>a contrite ſpirit, loathing our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for all our abominations, and abhorring ourſelves in duſt and aſhes before God,</hi> lying low, infinitely low, in the deepeſt humility at his feet.—But we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and turn to God by faith in Chriſt, <hi>for no man can come to God but by Chriſt,</hi> or by faith in Chriſt; <hi>Chriſt is the</hi> only <hi>way to the Father</hi>; it is by faith <hi>we ſee the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.—If our goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt,</hi> (as all unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers are) <hi>in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, leſt the light of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi>
            </p>

in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God and obey not the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, whom he will puniſh with an everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord and the glory of his power.—Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his ſaints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>We muſt all ſtand before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in the body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.—Unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteouſneſs,</hi> the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge <hi>will render</hi> in that day, <hi>indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh of ſoul.</hi> And the <hi>ſmoke of their torment will aſcend up forever and ever.</hi> From the whole it appears as evident as inſpired language can make it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the time of life here on earth is our only probation-time for eternity. <hi>Behold now is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time!

            <p n="2">2. That after death unto the final judgment, while our bodies are in the grave our ſouls will be in a fixed ſtate of happineſs or miſery, according to the ſtate we were in when we gave up the ghoſt;— if in Chriſt, of happineſs; if out of Chriſt—of miſery, and after the reſurrection and final judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the wicked will be in a ſtate of puniſhment in ſoul and body forever and ever.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:014684_0010_0F948D34FB3B77A8"/>Now if <hi>all mankind will finally be ſaved and happy,</hi> Why did Chriſt and his inſpired Penmen of holy ſcripture ſpeak of the damnation and puniſhment of wicked men, dying in their impenitence and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, as being, after the day of judgment, fixed for an eternal duration? Or why do they, when ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the miſery and puniſhment of wicked men in hell, always make uſe of ſuch terms and expreſſions, as are the moſt emphatical to impreſs our minds with an apprehenſion of their eternal, or <hi>endleſs</hi> and <hi>neverceaſing duration</hi>; without the leaſt hint, in other terms or expreſſions, that the damned ſhall finally be releaſed from the puniſhments of hell, and be tranſlated to the regions of eternal bleſſedneſs? What end could Chriſt and his inſpired Writers have in view, in uſing ſuch words in ſuch a manner, upon this awful ſubject of the damnation of hell, as they knew all men of common ſenſe muſt and would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to import <hi>endleſs, neverceaſing</hi> duration; if they knew at the ſame time the puniſhment of wicked men in hell will not be eternal, but have an end? Yea, What reaſon can be given why Chriſt did not tell his hearers, that no man would be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally loſt, but every individual of mankind ſhould finally be ſaved, eſpecially when one of his hearers made it almoſt neceſſary, by putting this queſtion to him. <hi>Are there few that be ſaved?</hi> Chriſt did not anſwer him ſaying, "You are under a groſs error or miſtake by means of the <hi>damning doctrine</hi> of your Teachers, who are proclaiming every where through the country, that wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there be that go in thereat; becauſe ſtrait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth to life and few there be that find it."—No, No; but he ſaid unto
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014684_0011_0F948D35D5079350"/>
them, "Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, for many I ſay unto you will ſeek to enter in and ſhall not be able, when once the maſter of the houſe is riſen up and hath ſhut to the door, and you begin to ſtand without and to knock at the door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open to us, &amp;c."—Which anſwer plainly teaches, That none will be ſaved but ſuch as enter the ſtrait gate which opens into the narrow way that leads to life eternal.—That many of thoſe that ſhall ſeek to enter therein ſhall not be able and hence ſhall not be ſaved, and that the reaſon why they ſhall not be able to enter the ſtrait gate is, becauſe they will not begin to ſeek, or to ſtand at the door and to knock until after the maſter of the houſe is riſen up and hath ſhut to the door, until after their probation-time is at an end.</p>
            <p>But if, notwithſtanding what Chriſt and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Penmen ſay to the contrary, the damned, after ſuffering in hell a certain finite or limited dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall be tranſlated to heaven: Before we can receive this as an article of faith, we muſt be able to produce in the ſcriptures of truth, <hi>a thus ſaith the Lord for it</hi>; but where will you find the divine teſtimony in the book of God, that the wicked in hell will in ſome future period, either before, at or after the day of judgment, be delivered from the pains of hell and made bleſſed in heaven forever? And where is it ſaid in the bible, that though Chriſt and the inſpired Writers ſpeak of hell-puniſhment as <hi>everlaſting, eternal, forever and ever,</hi> &amp;c. Yet it muſt not be underſtood, that they taught, it would be <hi>properly everlaſting, eternal, forever and ever,</hi> or to an endleſs durarion? Or where is it ſaid in the word of God, that the words <hi>eternal, everlaſting, forever,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The original word (in the Greek) is but one for all theſe in Engliſh.</note>

ſignify endleſs, neverceaſing duration, when joined with <hi>life</hi> and <hi>bleſſedneſs</hi> in heaven; but <hi>never ſo</hi> when joined with <hi>deſtruction, puniſhment,</hi> or miſery in hell?</p>
            <p>Beſides, if the wicked in hell ſhall ever, hereafter, come out of hell and be bleſſed in heaven, they muſt firſt pay the very laſt farthing or mite of the debt of ten thouſand talents, for which they were caſt into the priſon of hell; for <hi>they ſhall not come out thence, until they have paid the very laſt farthing or mite,</hi> is the teſtimony of Chriſt; that is, they muſt ſuffer in hell as much and as long as they deſerve to ſuffer at the hands of juſtice for the infinite evil of ſin, as it is a violation of infinite obligation to love and obey God!</p>
            <p>Now it is poſſible for a finite Being to ſuffer as much as he deſerves to ſuffer for his ſins, in a limited duration of time, or it is not: If it is poſſible, then we did not ſtand in abſolute need of Chriſt, as an infinite Perſon to become our ſurety, and to make atonement for our ſins by ſuffering for us, <hi>the juſt for the unjuſt,</hi> in order to deliver us from the wrath that is to come. For after perſons have ſuffered as much as they deſerve to ſuffer for their ſins, they muſt be immediately delivered from a ſtate of ſuffering; it will be no act of juſtice to hold them under puniſhment any longer: But ſuch as are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from hell on account of their own ſuffering, will not join with the redeemed in heaven in aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their redemption to Chriſt, as having redeemed them unto God by his blood:—But it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ſinners in their own perſons to ſuffer, in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited duration of time, all that they deſerve to ſuffer for ſin at the hands of juſtice, becauſe ſin is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite evil, which God infinitely hates, and therefore an infinite puniſhment in duration is what the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſerves to ſuffer for it at the hands of divine juſtice.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:014684_0013_0F948D3736E69890"/>But ſuppoſing it poſſible to ſuffer in hell as much s we deſerve for our ſins, ſo as to be releaſed from a ſtate of puniſhment, this would not qualify the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for the enjoyment of heaven; the inflicting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment on men or devils in hell has no tendency to take away their enmity againſt God, and to make them his cordial friends; but this is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our enjoying heaven, if we do not love God for his own ſake, if we do not love him ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premely, yea, if we do not love him in all his moral character as the heaven of heaven, heaven will be no heaven to us!</p>
            <p>But we are ſure from the moſt ſure word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, unto which we do well to take heed, <hi>that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God</hi>—and that ſuch are all we, by nature as fallen creatures, and by practice ſinners, and therefore, that none of us will inherit the kingdom of God, but ſuch as are <hi>waſhed and ſanctified and juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4.

"O fooliſh Galatians who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth, &amp;c.—Ye did run well, who hath hindered you?

And to worſhip God in the ſpirit and rejoice in Chriſt Jeſus without any confidence in the fleſh:—Never been formed into ſuch a temper of mind, as to delight in the moral law after the inner-man, as being juſt, holy, and good—to love God's glory for its own ſake, as an ultimate good, and to live to the Lord, and glorify him in their body and in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which are his—to eſteem God's precepts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all things to be right, and to hate every falſe way—to repent and turn from every evil way, and to abhor themſelves and repent in duſt and aſhes.— And to exerciſe a truly benevolent affection towards all men, friends and enemies.—It is true, they may have had awakenings and illuminations, and joys and comforts, and great confidence of their good eſtate before God, and great gifts of knowledge and utterance, ſpeak with the tongue of men and angels, &amp;c. and yet have <hi>no charity,</hi> no love to God, no genuine benevolence to men, no friendly affection to Jeſus Chriſt and his kingdom; but be <hi>wolves, dogs, conciſion,</hi> wholly wrapt up in a baſe, contracted, <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> ſpirit, inimical to God, Jeſus Chriſt, and mankind.—And you may be ſure, <hi>that Teacher</hi> is a wolf in ſheep's cloathing, is deſtitute of true love to Chriſt, who lives in the neglect of <hi>family religion,</hi> and teaches others to do ſo, at leaſt by

Falſe teachers are <hi>hirelings, whoſe own the ſheep are not,</hi> they do not <hi>naturally care</hi> for the good of the flock, the things which be Jeſus Chriſt's.— They do not <hi>travel in birth</hi> of ſouls until Chriſt be formed in them; they do not <hi>wreſtle in prayer</hi> with God for the outpouring of his Spirit on ſinners to convince them of ſin, to regenerate and effectually call them unto the fellowſhip of the Father and of his Son Chriſt Jeſus.—And ſuch are falſe teachers, and manifeſt they have no true care for ſouls, that neglect <hi>to preſs ſinners</hi> to ſpeedy repentance—to a ſpeedy flight by faith to Chriſt for refuge—neglect to <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>beſeech them</hi> in Chriſt's ſtead to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, to be at peace with him, and to live a life of univerſal obedience to all the revealed will of God; and neglect to do it on principle! John ſaid, "The ax is laid to the root of the trees, every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and caſt into the fire:"—Chriſt ſaid, "Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh."—That ſuch as will not <hi>cut off a right hand,</hi> or put off the old man that is corrupt, muſt go <hi>to hell</hi> with all their luſts, <hi>where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched</hi>; and wept over hardened Jeruſalem ſaying, "How often would I have gathered thy children, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings and ye would not."—"Behold," &amp;c.—The Apoſtles called on ſinners to "repent and be converted that their ſins might be blotted out."—<hi>Prayed ſouls</hi> and <hi>beſeeched them</hi> in <hi>Chriſt's ſtead</hi> to <hi>be reconciled to God,</hi> and <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the terrors</hi> of the Lord <hi>perſuaded men,</hi> ſaying, "How can ye eſcape if ye neglect ſo great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!—Awake thou that ſleepeſt and ariſe from the

            <p>Such do not care for the flock, that neglect from time to time to urge profeſſors of religion <hi>to give all diligence</hi> to add to their faith virtue, and to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue knowledge, &amp;c.

            <p n="3">3. Such are falſe teachers, who <hi>privily</hi> bring in <hi>damnable hereſies.—Privily</hi> under ſheep's cloathing— under a cloak of zeal for our good, <hi>they zealouſly affect you but not well.</hi>—Wrap them up <hi>in good words and fair ſpeeches</hi> to deceive the hearts of the ſimple.

They corrupt the word of God, retain hidden things of diſhoneſty—walk in craftineſs, and handle the word of God deceitfully—wreſt the ſcriptures by their forced interpretations to ſpeak what the Holy Ghoſt never intended, yea, what is contrary to the letter and ſpirit of the written word of God.—The Apoſtle Paul ſays, "That we henceforth be no more children toſſed to and fro and carried about with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wind of doctrine, by the ſlight of men and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning craftineſs, whereby they lye in wait to deceive."</p>
            <p>And here it may be affirmed without the leaſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, that ſuch a perſon is a falſe teacher, who advances certain leading principles or tenets in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which have a tendency to produce very fatal conſequences to the ſouls of men, if embraced, to maintain and ſupport which, he is forced to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the common ſenſe of mankind, the common ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the whole <hi>Proteſtant Church,</hi> and the plain and obvious meaning of Chriſt and the inſpired Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of ſacred ſcripture:—Such is the doctrine of <hi>univerſal ſalvation</hi> as advanced by the <hi>Stranger,</hi> his doctrine of <hi>purgatory</hi> or <hi>intermediate ſtate,</hi> and of <hi>no application of Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>effectual calling, converſion,</hi> or <hi>believing in Chriſt</hi> as <hi>neceſſary</hi> in order to our being pardoned by God, juſtified as righteous in his ſight, received into his favor, and made heirs of eternal ſalvation <hi>through Chriſt's name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may alſo be affirmed to be an infallible mark of a falſe teacher, if at his firſt coming into a ſtrange place, it is his practice to make uſe of ſuch language only, or forms of ſpeech as he underſtands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey to them orthodox ſentiments until he has gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their affections, and then by little and little, as he finds it will bear, to devulge his corrupt tenets in language directly contrary to what he uſed at firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—That is, more open and leſs equivocal; thus

the ſerpent beguiled <hi>Eve</hi> through his ſubtilty—and thus the Apoſtle feared the minds of the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans would be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, by thoſe <hi>Miniſters of ſatan,</hi> who <hi>transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> themſelves into the <hi>apoſtles of Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>as the miniſters of righteouſneſs, even</hi> as "ſatan himſelf is transformed into an angel of light."</p>
            <p n="4">4. As falſe teachers are of the world, they ſpeak of the world and the world heareth them; but the Apoſtle ſays, "We are of God, he that knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us; hereby know we the ſpirit of truth and the ſpirit of error." And Chriſt ſays to the Jews, "I am come in my Father's name and ye receive me not; if another ſhall come in his own name, him <hi>ye will</hi> receive."— Again, "Why do ye not underſtand my ſpeech? Even becauſe ye cannot hear my words—and becauſe I tell you the truth ye believe me not.—He that is of God heareth God's words, ye therefore hear them not, becauſe ye are not of God.—Many therefore of his diſciples when they heard—ſaid this is a hard ſaying, who can hear it?—From that time many of his diſciples went back and no more walked with him." Theſe were only nominal, that is to ſay, not <hi>diſciples indeed.</hi>—Now as none can cordially acquieſce in the doctrine of Chriſt, but ſuch as are born of God, becauſe it is directly contrary to the ſinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of our hearts, and we muſt deny ourſelves in complying with it; we muſt conclude, ſuch teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers come not with the doctrine of Chriſt, nor in his name, but in their own name and with the ſpirit of the world; if wicked and carnal men find no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in complying with their doctrine ariſing from their own corrupt and ſinful inclinations, and that they would gladly become their diſciples, but are
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014684_0020_0F948D40D8941958"/>
kept back by the objections from common ſenſe, the light of their reaſon and conſcience, and a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional belief of the contrary truths.—Let us illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate this a little.</p>
            <p>Chriſt preaches, that we muſt believe in him, repent and be converted and become as little children, muſt deny ourſelves and take up our croſs daily and follow him—muſt forſake all that we have and love him above father, mother, wife, children, houſe, land, and even our own life, yea muſt cut off a right hand and pluck out a right eye that offends, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we muſt be damned, we muſt go to hell with both hands and both eyes, even into a ſtate of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhment, where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing a Stranger comes into Glouceſter in A.

Did the devil ſend men into this world? No, no; but ſin is of the devil and there are doctrines of devils.— Theſe ſins and errors are the tares, the hay, wood, and ſtubble, which ſhall, in the end of the world be bound in bundles and ſent away into that everlaſting fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels.</p>
            <p>"That all mankind will finally be ſaved and made eternally happy, appears from the declaration of the divine goodneſs and his will relative to this matter: <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked</hi>; and the Apoſtle Peter ſays, The Lord <hi>is long-ſuffering, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance,</hi> and the Apoſtle Paul ſpeaking of God our Saviour, ſays, <hi>Who will have all men to be ſaved and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth</hi>—nay, is it not expreſſly ſaid, "<hi>As by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, even ſo, by the righteouſneſs of one the free gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life.—For as in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.— Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſom for all to be teſtified in due time.—He taſted death for every man.</hi>—Chriſt <hi>is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for the ſins of the whole world,</hi> and <hi>will draw all men unto him.</hi>

What need is there of being born of God, in order either to believe, or to love God and Chriſt as required in this ſcheme? If there is no application to Chriſt—no application of Chriſt to ourſelves—no uniting to Chriſt in believing, an unregenerate perſon will be as able to believe as one that is born of God:—And if wicked men love ſuch perſons, as they believe love them, and an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that others love them, is the only motive of their love to the others; then wicked men may love God and Chriſt with juſt ſuch a love as is taught in this ſcheme, to be the fruit of the faith deſcribed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.—The love which wicked men, who were never

            <p>Neither does this new ſcheme require godly ſorrow for ſin—deep humiliation and repenting as in duſt and aſhes—watching and praying—keeping under the body and crucifying the fleſh with the affections and luſts and the like, leſt otherwiſe <hi>we die—we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come caſtaways</hi> as urged by Chriſt and his apoſtles! But on the contrary teaches, that God ſees no ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in us, let us live as we liſt, and that ſtrait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and few there be, none at all, that find it; becauſe wide is the gate and broad is the way which leadeth to life and many there be, even all mankind, go in thereat!

ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance,</hi> or <hi>his willing that all men be ſaved and come to the knowledge of the truth</hi> as the means or way of ſalvation.—Even as a king's iſſuing out an act of grace to pardon all ſuch rebels as will throw down their arms, ſubmit to his government, and accept of the offered pardon, <hi>is his not willing</hi> that any of theſe rebels ſhould periſh as rebels, but that all ſhould come to repentance and receive a pardon.—But there are many that <hi>reſiſt</hi> the will of God in the goſpel, make light of God's gracious calls and invitations—neglect ſo great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation—and will not come to Chriſt that they may have life—will not repent and be converted that their ſins may be blotted out, but go their ways, provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy one of Iſrael to anger until he ſwears in his wrath, that they ſhall not enter in his reſt, and in the great day will ſay to them, <hi>becauſe I have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ye refuſed; I have ſtretched out my hand and no man regarded; but ye have ſet at naught all my counſel and would none of my reproof.

ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for <hi>all men</hi>; for kings, and for <hi>all</hi> that are in authority.—We are not required in the word of God to pray for thoſe that are in heaven; nor for thoſe in hell, or in your STRANGER's <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſtate,</hi> his <hi>purgatory</hi>; nor for ſuch on earth as have ſinned the ſin unto death; nor for the eternal ſalvation of the non-elect.—And ſometimes <hi>all men</hi> ſignify <hi>all that the Father gave Chriſt out of the world of mankind—all</hi> that the Father <hi>choſe</hi> in Chriſt before the foundation of the world, that they might be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c. <hi>All that were predeſtinated</hi> to the adoption of ſons by Jeſus Chriſt—<hi>all that Chriſt calls his ſheep</hi> for whom he laid down his life with a ſpecial deſign to ſave;—<hi>all</hi> called his <hi>ſeed,</hi> for whoſe ſins Chriſt made his ſoul an offering;—<hi>all foreordained</hi> to be Chriſt's church, which he loved and gave himſelf for that &amp;c.—<hi>foreordained</hi> to be members of his body, and he to be their head as the <hi>ſecond public man; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam</hi>:—As the <hi>firſt man</hi>—the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> had his body to which he ſtood related as head, ſo the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond man</hi>—the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> has his body to which he ſtands related as head; and as the body, or <hi>all men</hi> of the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> were his <hi>natural</hi> ſeed by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral generation and birth, ſo the body, or <hi>all men</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> are his <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſeed by a ſpiritual birth, by regeneration—created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works;—hence, when it is ſaid, by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of one the free gift came upon <hi>all men</hi> to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of life—in Chriſt ſhall <hi>all</hi> be made alive— who gave himſelf a ranſom for <hi>all.</hi>—Taſted death for <hi>every man</hi>—there is no difficulty in underſtanding <hi>all men—all</hi> and <hi>every man</hi>—to mean, <hi>all</hi> that were <hi>choſen</hi> in Chriſt—<hi>choſen</hi> to ſalvation through ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication

of the ſpirit and belief of the truth—<hi>all given</hi> to the Son by the Father that <hi>ſhall come</hi> to him, and whom Chriſt will in no wiſe caſt out.—We muſt either underſtand it thus, or elſe that by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of one the free gift came upon <hi>all mankind</hi> unto juſtification of life, and <hi>all mankind</hi> ſhall be made alive in Chriſt, and that Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſom for <hi>all mankind</hi> with an abſolute deſign to ſave the whole and every man in particular.—But this latter we know is falſe, becauſe multitudes <hi>die in their ſins, will be raiſed up</hi> at the laſt day <hi>to damnation,</hi> and <hi>be puniſhed with an everlaſting deſtruction</hi> from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord and the glory of his power!</p>
            <p>Yet as Chriſt took on him <hi>that human nature,</hi> which is common to all men, whether conſidered as elect or not; as he brought in an everlaſting righteouſneſs for the juſtification of men—by his obedience <hi>to that law,</hi> which is the law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto all men.—And obtained redemption for men, by ſuffering, the juſt for the unjuſt, to the full ſatisfaction of divine juſtice, <hi>that penalty</hi> which all mankind ſtood bound by the ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſuffer; it follows, that his righteouſneſs and atonement are as ſufficient for the juſtification, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſalvation of one ſinner among men as another, and for every ſinner of mankind individually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; and that God can, as conſiſtently with the honor of his moral law and government, on Chriſt's account, pardon, juſtify, and ſave one as another, and every one equally that ſhall accept of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious offer.</p>
            <p>And as God's method of addreſſing himſelf to men in the miniſtry of reconciliation, by ſetting before

them life and death, a bleſſing and a curſe, yea, by holding out to them pardon, juſtification, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life as a free-gift, and inviting, beſeeching, and praying them by his ambaſſadors to accept of the ſame, or otherwiſe they muſt eternally periſh, is a treating men as men, as reaſonable creatures, drawing <hi>them with the cords of a man.</hi>—And as he addreſſes himſelf to men in the miniſtry of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, not immediately, but through the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of his ambaſſadors who know not the hearts of men, nor whether all to whom they are ſent to preach are elect or not—one has as good a warrant to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in Chriſt the Saviour as another, to whom Chriſt is preached:—And as every one is to blame for not believing in Chriſt, it is his own fault that he doth not, becauſe he either ſinfully neglects, voluntarily makes light of, or wickedly treads under foot the offer, and will not come to Chriſt that he might have life; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that it is the duty of one ſinner as much as of another and of every one alike under the goſpel, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, to come to Chriſt, or believe in him: And as God knows none can, none ever will come to Chriſt and be ſaved, except he draws them by his efficacious grace, and yet when drawn they actually come—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living in Chriſt as ſet before us in that goſpel which is committed unto his ambaſſadors to preach to every human creature, and commonly are drawn, and do come while hearing the bleſſed goſpel preached, for faith comes by hearing, &amp;c. And as they come to that Chriſt that all are invited to come to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living no one propoſition but what all are required to believe and cordially accepting of that offer only which is made to all in the goſpel:—It follows, that ſuch as are ſaved, are ſaved wholly by grace in
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014684_0034_0F948D4EA2B79A90"/>
a way that excludes all boaſting from themſelves. And that ſuch as periſh under the goſpel are wholly inexcuſable for their neglect and will be puniſhed for not believing on the name of the Son of God.— And as Chriſt's righteouſneſs and atonement are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the ſalvation of the whole world; and as all mankind in general, by virtue of Chriſt's media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and merits, have a temporary ſalvation—a day of God's forbearance—a ſpace to repent, or a time of probation.—And as God is in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf—Chriſt may be called the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of all men—the Saviour of the world</hi>—and <hi>a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for the ſins of the whole world,</hi> ſo far, that whoſoever, in all the world, believeth in him, ſhall be ſaved;—yea, that if the whole world would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe in Chriſt, as God commands them to do in the goſpel, they ſhould be ſaved.—And yet ſuch as will not believe in him, ſhall be damned.— In an army there is one inſtituted to be a Surgeon-General to the whole army—all the ſick and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the army have a right, by virtue of his being a Surgeon-General, to apply to him; yet ſuch as will not apply, or do refuſe the uſe of his means, will receive no benefit by him:—Chriſt is by office the Saviour, and only Saviour of the world—there is none other name given under heaven whereby men muſt be ſaved—all are called upon to come to him, where the goſpel comes.—Whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life—and him that cometh to Chriſt, he will in no wiſe caſt out; but ſuch as will not come unto Chriſt that they may have life, abide in death, and the wrath of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on them:—Yet all that the Father giveth Chriſt ſhall come.—God has engaged, in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:014684_0035_0F948D4F36EC9F88"/>
of redemption, on condition of Chriſt's making his ſoul an offering for ſin, and his bearing the ſins of many, that he ſhall ſee his <hi>ſeed</hi> and by his knowledge juſtify them.—Hence from the conſiderations above, it appears, that God may as ſincerely offer ſalvation to ſuch as he knows will never accept of it, as to ſuch as he is determined to make willing to accept of it in the day of his power, for God may ſincerely treat men as men or as reaſonable creatures.—It alſo appears, that ſuch as do believe in Chriſt, in the act of believing, do not believe any one propoſition but what ſuch are called upon to believe as finally periſh in unbelief; nor accept of any thing but what is offered to all alike in the goſpel. Hence ſaving faith is not a believing that I am in Chriſt, that God is reconciled to me, and ſees no iniquity in me.—That my ſins are pardoned, that I was never a child of the devil, &amp;c.—But it is a ſeeing the Son as the true God and only and alſufficient Saviour of men, and a believing in him, truſting in him alone for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation—a fleeing to Chriſt for refuge from purſuing vengeance to lay hold on him as the hope ſet before us—a coming to Chriſt weary and heavy-laden with the burden of ſin and guilt for reſt—a coming to Chriſt, ſenſibly periſhing with hunger and thirſt, as to a feaſt, eating his fleſh and drinking his blood, as meat indeed and drink indeed:—A bowing the knee at the name of Jeſus, cordially ſubmitting to him as Prince and Saviour, Lord and Chriſt, counting all our own righteouſneſs as loſs and dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But as to your ſtrange notion, that all mankind were choſen in Chriſt before the foundation of the world, in <hi>contradiſtinction to fallen angels,</hi> I do not

know of one text of ſcripture that can be forced, even by miſinterpretation, to ſhew the leaſt counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to it.—Let us conſider it in relation to a few texts where <hi>election</hi> is mentioned, viz. <hi>Many are called but few are choſen.</hi> Have the fallen angels ever been called? Chriſt ſays, "I lay down my life for the ſheep—my Father gave them me—but ye believe not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheep." Were theſe fallen angels that were not of Chriſt's ſheep?— Again, "I have manifeſted thy name unto the men which thou gaveſt me <hi>out of the world</hi>; thine they were and thou gaveſt them me—I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them, which thou haſt given me; for they are thine: "Doth the <hi>world</hi> here ſignify fallen angels?—Again, "And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed." Were all thoſe fallen angels who did not believe? For it is certain there were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes who did not believe ſo much as the devils did! Jeſus I know and Paul I know, but who are ye? ſaid the evil ſpirit.—Again, "Though the number of the children of Iſrael be as the ſand of the ſea, a <hi>remnant ſhall be ſaved</hi>—even ſo then at this preſent time alſo there is a remnant accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the election of grace.—The election hath obtained it, and the reſt were blinded."—Were the <hi>reſt</hi> and all beſide the remnant, (the election) fallen angels?—Once more, "Give diligence to make your calling and election ſure." Doth it mean that we are to give deligence to make ſure that we are men and not fallen angels?</p>
            <p>And as to your notion that the <hi>tares,</hi> explained to be the children of the wicked one, the devil, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, not wicked men, not heretics, but ſins and

hereſies, which ſhall be gathered together bound in bundles and burnt in the end of the world, it is too ſenſeleſs to be maintained by any perſon in his right mind and profeſſing to be guided by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of truth! Chriſt expreſſly ſays, he means, by the tares, the children of the wicked one, the devil, and by the children of the wicked one he means, <hi>them that do iniquity,</hi> and that theſe ſhall be caſt into a furnace of fire, not to purify, but to torment them, where their torment is expreſſed by <hi>wailing and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth.</hi>—Are ſins and hereſies ſubjects capable of pain and torment!!! But to wicked men Chriſt will ſay, in the judgment, "Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire—I was hungry and ye gave me no meat," &amp;c. Chriſt is ſpeaking to wicked men, when he ſays, <hi>Ye are of your father the devil and the luſts of your father ye will do.</hi>—Paul calls <hi>Elymas</hi> the ſorcerer a <hi>child of the devil</hi>—becauſe he was <hi>full of ſubtilty and all miſchief</hi>—an <hi>enemy of all righteouſneſs:</hi> And the apoſtle John ſays, Such men as <hi>commit ſin are of the devil,</hi> that is, who are <hi>workers of ſin</hi>—live in ſin, and theſe he expreſſly calls <hi>the children of the devil</hi> as oppoſed to the <hi>children of God,</hi> who are <hi>born of God,</hi> do not <hi>commit ſin</hi> but do righteouſneſs, and are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous even as their Father is righteous.—Their ſanctification is not out of themſelves, for they are created in Chriſt unto good works—are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the ſpirit of their mind—created after God in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, are new creatures—have crucified the fleſh with the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and luſts and have put on the new-man, and as the elect of God, holy and beloved, have put on bowels of mercies, kindneſs, gentleneſs, humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, &amp;c.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:014684_0038_0F948D51764A3180"/>Dear Sir, time will fail me to ſay all that I want to ſay, to recover you out of the ſnare of the devil. The ſcriptures ſpeak of falſe teachers bringing in privily <hi>damnable hereſies,</hi> and of ſome being given up to a ſtrong deluſion to believe a lie that they might be damned, and this as a puniſhment for not <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the love of the truth that they might be ſaved!</hi> I am ſure that the leading doctrines in this new ſcheme are damnable hereſies, becauſe they are falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, alſo when embraced for truth will <hi>effectually keep perſons eaſy and ſecure in an unconverted, Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtate.</hi>—And how is it poſſible for a godly man, an experienced chriſtian, who has received the love of the truth to be carried away with ſuch groſs er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, ſo contrary to the plain letter of the word, and common ſenſe, and gracious experience of all the godly?—Chriſt ſays, <hi>if it were poſſible</hi> they would deceive the <hi>very elect</hi>: Perſons muſt be infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated or bewitched by a ſpirit of deluſion, as the <hi>fooliſh Galatians</hi> were, to be captivated into a belief of ſuch palpable errors!</p>
            <p>Once I did hope that you was a good man, that you had received the love of the truth—<hi>you did run well, who hath hindered you?</hi> But if you was ever truly converted to God through faith in Chriſt the Mediator, you was convinced of ſin—that it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered you obnoxious to the wrath and curſe of God—you ſaw yourſelf in a condemned ſtate, in danger of eternal damnation in hell—the wrath of God revealed from heaven againſt you—your feet ſtanding in ſlippery places—you was pricked in your heart, and with the three thouſand, cried, What muſt I do?

to me a ſinner! You ſaw yourſelf condemned by the <hi>juſt judgment of God,</hi> ſo that your mouth was ſtopped and you felt yourſelf guilty before God.— You found alſo, your heart was a heart of ſtone, contrary to that which is good—full of enmity againſt God—that you ſtood in abſolute need of a new heart and a right ſpirit:—You was alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, if you was ever ſaved, it muſt be in the way of free, ſovereign grace!—And if you are truly converted, you was alſo convinced of righteouſneſs and judgment; Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth—that by his obedience and death has brought in an everlaſting righteouſneſs and made complete atonement for ſin. You ſaw Chriſt in his perſon and offices to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovely, deſirable, precious, and ſuitable, ſo that your whole ſoul united to him and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all things as loſs and dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt, to win Chriſt and be found in him.—You now began to find peace with God, began to delight in God and his holy law, and to wage war againſt ſin, all ſin, and to feel a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent affection towards all men, deſiring that all might have repentance toward God and faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, that their ſins <hi>might be</hi> pardoned and their ſouls made happy in the favor, friendſhip, and fellowſhip of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, in walking in the light of truth and holineſs as God is in the light.—Now a change of this importance every true chriſtian is experimentally acquainted with: And Chriſt's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are travelling in birth of their people that Chriſt may thus be formed in them; and if you have experienced a change of ſuch importance, how
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:014684_0040_0F948D58045EA700"/>
unaccountable is it, that you ſhould be carried away after one, whoſe avowed principles neceſſarily teach, That ſuch a change is needleſs, and that all convictions of danger of <hi>eternal puniſhment</hi> and <hi>wrath to come,</hi> which <hi>move</hi> ſinners <hi>to ſtrive to enter in</hi> at the ſtrait gate—to <hi>preſs</hi> into the kingdom, (whereby the kingdom of heaven ſuffers violence and the violent take it by force) and to flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope ſet before them, <hi>are a meer delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion!</hi> Pray conſider theſe things—and the Lord give you underſtanding in all things:—It is no light matter to be deceived in ſuch matters as theſe—or to be turned aſide by a deceived heart, ſo as not to be able to ſay, <hi>Is there not a lye in my right hand?</hi>—Chriſt ſays, "If any man will do God's will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of myſelf—and every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice."</p>
            <p>To conclude, if you, Sir, or any other perſon, ſhall maintain for ſcripture-truth, that the whole race of Adam, or all mankind will finally be ſaved and happy; and that application or union to Chriſt by faith is not neceſſary to our enjoying any ſaving benefit of Chriſt, or the like, I am as ſure that you, or ſuch an one, is under a ſtrong deluſion to believe a lye, as I am that the bible is a book of divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or that there is ſalvation in Chriſt for men! adieu.—I am your hearty welwiſher,</p>

            <p>THAT cannot be true chriſtian doctrine, which naturally tends to turn the grace of God into laſciviouſneſs: But ſuch is the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation, at taught by this Stranger, for nothing can have a greater tendency that way than to teach, that all men ſhall be finally happy, even though they live and die Pagans, Mahometans, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Antichriſtian-Beaſt, open enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, whoremongers, adulterers, blaſphemers, murderers, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That cannot be true chriſtian doctrine, which is agreable to corrupt nature, or to that mere ſelfiſh ſpirit the carnal mind which is enmity againſt God: But ſuch is the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation; for nothing can be more agreable to carnal and wicked perſons than this doctrine, that they ſhall have peace and be finally happy, though they walk all their days in the imagination or ſtubbornneſs of their own evil hearts, adding drunkenneſs to thirſt, or the like.</p>
            <p>That cannot be true chriſtian doctrine, which teaches, that it is no matter, as to our future well-being, what our religion is in this world, whether the chriſtian or the pagan! Or whom we worſhip, the true God, or idols! Or whom we ſerve and obey, Chriſt, or the devil! But ſuch is this doctrine of univerſal ſalvation; and hence it will not be at all ſtrange, for thoſe who embrace it, to live, by and by, in the entire neglect of the inſtituted worſhip of God as commanded by Chriſt, of family religion, and become openly, after awhile, as their conſciences grow more and more feared by reſiſting the light, <hi>downright practical Atheiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That cannot be true chriſtian doctrine, which tends to make all, who embrace it, Deiſts or Infidels: But ſuch is this doctrine of univerſal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for ſuch as embrace it, cannot embrace it, becauſe it appears more evidently to common ſenſe to be ſcripture-doctrine than that of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment of impenitent ſinners in hell; nor becauſe they can interpret what the holy ſcriptures ſay of the eternal damnation of the wicked, ſo as to make the ſame conſiſtent with the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation, without doing the greateſt violence to the common ſenſe, or meaning of words and language.—What boldneſs and violence too, to ſay, the <hi>chaff</hi> or <hi>tares,</hi> which ſhall be burnt in unquenchable fire, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, not men, but the ſins and error of men, when they cannot but know, that Chriſt ſays, <hi>They are the children of the wicked one, and they that do iniquity!</hi> — Alſo, to ſay, the <hi>goats,</hi> on the left hand of the Judge, ſignify not men, but either the ſins of men, or devils themſelves, when they cannot but know Chriſt ſays, the <hi>ſheep</hi> and <hi>goats</hi> are the <hi>righteous</hi> and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:014684_0042_0F948D59C3470CE0"/>
               <hi>wicked</hi> of <hi>all nations,</hi> and that as the righteous ſhall go away into life eternal, ſo the wicked ſhall into everlaſting puniſhment, repreſented by fire unquenchable or everlaſting!—Now he that will do ſuch violence to the meaning of ſome paſſages of ſacred ſcripture to eſtabliſh a particular tenet, would do violence to every paſſage to ſerve a turn, and thereby proves himſelf to be an infidel, and hence that he never embraced this doctrine of univerſal ſalvation from a conviction of divine authority for it, but becauſe it was agreable to corrupt nature: Men that do not like to deny themſelves and take up their croſs daily in following Chriſt— that do not chuſe to have Chriſt to reign over them, nor to keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, would be glad to perſuade themſelves of enjoying happineſs hereafter without paſſing the ſtrait gate into the narrow way of holineſs and ſelf-denial, even in the broad way that the multitude goes in to do evil; for what wicked man is there that would not heartily like to ſerve the devil all his days, or the deſires of the fleſh and of the mind, and would not do it, if he could perſuade himſelf that he ſhould be happy for all this, or ſhould not ſuffer for it in the coming world?—And they that have fallen in with this perſuaſion, commonly advance this argument for it; "That God is a merciful Being" and therefore for him to damn any of mankind forever would be inconſiſtent with the goodneſs of his nature, and imply that he made creatures to damn them, which is a thought they cannot entertain of ſo good a Being:—Which neceſſarily ſuppoſes ſeveral things, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That devils will either be finally happy, or elſe, as they are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as much as ſinful men, God created them to damn them forever: By the way, God made angels and men for his glory; but fallen angels and fallen men have fitted themſelves for deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there was no need of the ſacrifice or atonement of Chriſt, in order for our diſcharge from condemnation; for if it was inconſiſtent with the nature of divine goodneſs to puniſh us with everlaſting deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our ſins, what need could there be of Chriſt's dying for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from the curſe of the la<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, and deliver us from the wrath which is to come, that we were condemned unto? Yea, how came God to condemn us to everlaſting puniſhment, if it was inconſiſtent with the nature of his goodneſs to inflict it upon us? Or if it was not an everlaſting puniſhment that Chriſt died to redeem us from, what was it?—Only a temporal puniſhment, which would have had an end, though he had not died for us! Then Chriſt died in vain, and the Deiſts are right, and the bible is a book of non-ſenſe!—If I were to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this new doctrine I would be ſo honeſt and conſiſtent with myſelf, as at the ſame time to fling away the bible, for it is impoſſible to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile it with the bible-religion, let common ſenſe be judge.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That thoſe perſons, who plead the above argument, have no proper conviction and ſenſe of the moral rectitude of God, his moral law and government—of the nature, evil, and demerit of ſin—of the nature of the remiſſion of ſin and of ſalvation from it, nor of the nature and neceſſity of the atonement by Chriſt in order to the ſame.</p>

               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:014684_0043_0F948D5A83C63F60"/>In a word, that cannot be true chriſtian doctrine, but <hi>damnable hereſy,</hi> which makes ſad the hearts of the godly, as it encourages wicked and vicious perſons to live without fear of eternal puniſhment, in the neglect of repentance—of their own ſalvation—of <hi>religion and virtue, in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of every vice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The following anecdote was communicated to me by a perſon of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, who aſſured me that there was good authority for the truth of it, viz.</p>
            <p>Turning to a part of his audience, where a number of privateers-men were ſwearing at one another, ſaid, "Well, you may go on and drink and ſwear and damn your fellow-men and blaſpheme your Maker and think to diſhonor him; but you do not diſhonor him at all; you only magnify his grace and diſplay the merits of Chriſt ſo much the more."— Huzza! Good doctrine for privateers-men! cried out a certain C— of a privateer.</p>
            <p>It would not be acting out of character in the leaſt for that perſon to addreſs vicious perſons in ſuch a manner, who aſſerts and endeavors to propagate, that all men ſhall finally be happy, and that the moſt vicious and criminal perſons are beloved of God, if not as much beloved of God, while in the practice of ſin, as after they become penitent and virtuous.— Query 1. Whether ſuch a teacher is not a miniſter of ſatan, an encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of vice and irreligion, and an enemy to virtue and pure religion? Query 2. Whether ſuch a teacher ought not to be taken care of by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as an enemy to mankind and a bane to civil ſociety? "Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs exalteth a nation, but ſin is a reproach to any people;—one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſtroyeth much good—Let not an evil ſpeaker be eſtabliſhed in the earth."—God ſaw, in certain pretended prophets of Jeruſalem, "an horrible thing; they commit adultery, and walk in lies; they <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> alſo the hands of <hi>evil-doers</hi> that <hi>none doth return from his wickedneſs</hi>; they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah. Therefore, thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts concerning (thoſe) prophets, Behold, I will feed them with wormwood and make them drink the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of gall; for from (theſe) prophets of Jeruſalem is PROFANENESS <hi>gone forth into all the land.</hi>—Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, <hi>hearken not</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the words of (theſe) prophets, that propheſy unto you; THEY MAKE YOU VAIN; they <hi>ſpeak a viſion of their own heart,</hi> and <hi>not out of the mouth</hi> of the Lord; they ſay ſtill unto them that deſpiſe me, the Lord hath ſaid, YE SHALL HAVE PEACE; and they ſay unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, NO EVIL SHALL COME UPON YOU." Jer. xxiii. 14, 17.</p>

abide there for a certain ſeaſon, but ſhall finally be ſaved; which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dreſſed up in ſoft terms and ſmooth expreſſions, is the very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh purgatory.</p>
               <p>"The ſubſtance of theſe things, and many other errors, he hath openly avowed and fully declared to be his ſentiments, at my houſe, in the hearing of many witneſſes. <note n="†" place="bottom">"The witneſſes are men of reputation for veracity, ſolid judgment, and religion, and are ready to atteſt the truth of what is related in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and would do it, if there was need of it."</note> Theſe are unſcriptural tenets, and notwithſtanding all his perverting of the holy ſcriptures, and wreſting and torturing the word of God, he was not able to produce one plauſible proof, nor one rational argument for the ſupport of theſe pericious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.—They naturally lead to many other groſs errors and popiſh abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.—And they are extremely dangerous to the ſouls of men: They encourage the wicked in their wickedneſs; for upon theſe principles a man may live and die in ſin, and yet go to heaven at laſt; he may get drunk, and commit fornication and adultery, he may cheat, and ſteal, and lye, and indulge all manner of carnal gratifications, and be ſaved notwithſtanding.</p>
